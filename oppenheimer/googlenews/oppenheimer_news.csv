2023-07-19 16:16:08+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’ Review: A Man for Our Time,"Christopher Nolan’s complex, vivid portrait of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb,” is a brilliant achievement in formal and conceptual terms.","The movie is based on “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” the authoritative 2005 biography by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Written and directed by Nolan, the film borrows liberally from the book as it surveys Oppenheimer’s life, including his role in the Manhattan Engineer District, better known as the Manhattan Project. He served as director of a clandestine weapons lab built in a near-desolate stretch of Los Alamos, in New Mexico, where he and many other of the era’s most dazzling scientific minds puzzled through how to harness nuclear reactions for the weapons that killed tens of thousands instantly, ending the war in the Pacific.
The atomic bomb and what it wrought define Oppenheimer’s legacy and also shape this film. Nolan goes deep and long on the building of the bomb, a fascinating and appalling process, but he doesn’t restage the attacks; there are no documentary images of the dead or panoramas of cities in ashes, decisions that read as his ethical absolutes. The horror of the bombings, the magnitude of the suffering they caused and the arms race that followed suffuse the film. “Oppenheimer” is a great achievement in formal and conceptual terms, and fully absorbing, but Nolan’s filmmaking is, crucially, in service to the history that it relates.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTkvbW92aWVzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXJldmlldy1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 12:49:00+00:00,"Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' Is Terrifying, But Irresistible","Nolan's latest film, if not his best, is certainly among his grandest spectacles—one that is immense, assaultive, and full of eye-enveloping abstraction.","Short of Tom Cruise, there’s been no more vocal advocate for the theatrical experience than Christopher Nolan in recent years. He’s penned impassioned op-eds, battled with studios over release strategy, and his movies have consistently boosted the box office's bottom line. Nolan, though, is not just a champion of theaters—but one of their greatest beneficiaries. His latest, Oppenheimer, is, if not his best film, certainly among his grandest spectacles—one made many times more powerful if witnessed in the largest, loudest venue possible.
As you might expect in a movie about the father of the atomic bomb, there is a great—and I do mean great—explosion in Oppenheimer. But in this three-hour biopic, it’s not just the booms and blasts that are worthy of IMAX. It is Cillian Murphy’s oceanic eyes bulging out of his chainsmoker’s cheekbones. It is the alien emptiness of the New Mexico desert. And it is, perhaps most of all, Ludwig Göransson’s relentless score. The fireworks in this movie are constant, if not always literal.
You feel them going off even in seemingly minor moments. For instance: Early in the film, when a young J. Robert Oppenheimer (Murphy, giving a career performance) observes a Picasso painting. The scene is barely even a scene; it's more of a montage fragment. But as this wunderkind takes in this masterpiece, you glean the primary point Nolan wants to make about his subject: That Oppenheimer’s perception of the world was inherently Cubist. Which is to say that Oppenheimer was simultaneously able to see a subject’s many different angles—and this ability allowed him to justify his sometimes dubious, ultimately world-shaking actions.
If the painting, though, is an early window into Oppenheimer’s kaleidoscopic mind, it’s also an approximation of the film’s nonlinear structure. Nolan never met a clock he didn’t think would benefit from multiple dials, and Oppenheimer certainly employs some of Cubism’s disjointedness as it jumps across timelines. Nolan distinguishes different periods through the use of color (the bulk of the narrative) and black-and-white (Oppenheimer antagonist Lewis Strauss’s 1959 cabinet confirmation hearing).
For the most part, all the time-jumping doesn’t inspire confusion, and rather contributes to the film’s athletic pacing. Oppenheimer’s third act revolves around a pair of hearings: one, in 1954, over whether to renew Oppenheimer’s security clearance; and the other, over Strauss’s (Robert Downey Jr., your 2024 Best Supporting Actor) confirmation. Nolan sprinkles the various depositions earlier in the film as narration. We hear different characters describe why Oppenheimer was eventually chosen to run the Manhattan Project (his unparalleled genius at theoretical physics) despite being a risky choice for the position (his womanizing, plus his flirtations with communism).
Oppenheimer is immense, assaultive, and full of eye-enveloping abstraction.
Along the way, Nolan’s technique brought to mind another early 20th century master of modern art: Jackson Pollock. Oppenheimer is immense, assaultive, and full of eye-enveloping abstraction. It’s these qualities that allow the director to pull off an exceedingly difficult task: Making complex theory cinematic. Nolan doesn’t spend much time on the nitty-gritty of fusion and fission, and instead conjures these ideas’ sublimity with quick cuts to dazzling depictions of particles, stars, and light. It’s during these moments when Göransson’s score is loudest, thrumming with the at once frightening and exciting momentum of world-shaking ideas.
For all its experimental flourishes, though, if you rearranged Oppenheimer in a chronological order, you’d be left with a fairly traditional biopic. The film’s underlying conventionality is most glaring in its use of lofty dialogue to characterize—and mythologize—its complicated hero. Characters constantly tell Oppenheimer things like, “You’re not just self-important, you’re actually important” and “Robert, you see beyond the world we live in. Of course we’ll help you.” My favorite, though, is: “How could the man who saw so much be so blind?”
Overall, Oppenheimer is a sympathetic, though not altogether uncritical, portrait of the atomic bomb’s inventor. Universal Pictures
In Nolan’s framing, naivete is Oppenheimer’s fatal flaw. He underestimated the ill-intentions of other people, or he overstated how much smarter he was than them. And in the film’s final hour, he learns his lesson the hard way. Following the successful Trinity Test, Truman drops the atom bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and we glimpse the emotional fallout of Oppenheimer’s incredible achievement—the feelings of guilt, suppression of feeling, and the intellectual rationalizations. “I feel that I have blood on my hands,” Oppenheimer tells President Truman (a hammy Gary Oldman) when he visits the Oval Office. Nolan hammers this feeling home, literalizing the internal detonation during adulatory public appearances. Later, we see Oppenheimer imagining the victims. But in a critical omission, Nolan never shows the devastation to the viewer—a choice that shrouds the violence, leaving it almost theoretical. The urge to keep the focus on Oppenheimer is understandable, but in this instance is a disservice; it makes it too easy for a Western audience to make their own rationalizations.
Overall, Oppenheimer is a sympathetic, though not altogether uncritical, portrait. Nolan, who has called Oppenheimer “ the most important person who ever lived ,” is clearly enamored by his subject’s mind, charisma, and appearance. In his baggy, high-waisted pants and soft-brimmed hat, Murphy cuts a striking figure. Though, it’s not just him. Like all Nolan movies, Oppenheimer is consumed with a classical handsomeness. Hoyte Van Hoytema’s elegant compositions lend a warranted import to these events. But while visually stunning, the film’s serious aesthetic has one downside: It counteracts the inherent camp of Florence Pugh’s Jean Tatlock (an early love), making Oppenheimer quote the Bhagavad-Gita during sex.
The passage she opens to is, “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” The passage reverberates in Oppenheimer’s mind during the Trinity Test. That explosion, Oppenheimer suggests, is the crowning achievement of Oppenheimer’s life’s work. It’s also the zenith of this film. Nolan orchestrates it like a world-class conductor, producing an orgasmic symphony of awe, wonder, and catastrophic power. It’s terrifying, but also irresistible. As such, it brings you closer to understanding Oppenheimer: Who doesn’t want to play God for a moment?",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcXVpcmUuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbW92aWVzL2E0NDYwOTkzNy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

This article is adapted from “Unleashing Oppenheimer: Inside Christopher Nolan’s Explosive Atomic-Age Thriller,” which will be published Oct. 10 by Insight Editions. LOS ALAMOS, N.M. — The drive to Los Alamos from the valley below feels treacherous, even now. J. Robert Oppenheimer chose this intensely remote location in northern New Mexico for the Manhattan Project, the U.S. government’s secret program to build an atomic bomb during World War II, precisely because it is situated on a maze of four mesas separated by deep canyons. It’s nearly impossible to find, and impenetrable if someone did locate it. Where better to save Western civilization than a mountainous high desert plateau, 7,200 feet above sea level, that looks like it’s straight out of a John Ford western?
Just as in 1943, the main entrance to town is a narrow highway that twists and turns atop cliffs of volcanic rock. The only difference now is that it’s paved. And it was up that “tricky road,” as he calls it, that Christopher Nolan found himself driving in June 2021, on a road trip from Los Angeles with his then-13-year-old son Magnus. By then, the director, known for critically acclaimed blockbusters such as “Inception” and “Dunkirk,” had already spent months writing the script for his own secret project on the man known as the father of the atomic bomb — an adaptation of Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, “American Prometheus” — and had hit a creative block. So, he’d decided to make a pilgrimage to the town that Oppenheimer (and the U.S. military) built.

“I was ready to look at it and sort of stand there and see what it felt like,” says Nolan. When they arrived, Nolan and son acted as a two-man location scouting crew. They first stopped at a reproduction of the Manhattan Project main gate that had once prevented unauthorized visitors from entering “the Hill,” as locals call the town. It’s now part of the Manhattan Project National Historical Park and is in nearly the same place that the original main gate once stood. As they explored the area, they also found a small museum located in Fuller Lodge, the great manor house in the center of town, the walls of which were constructed from nearly 800 gigantic ponderosa pine logs.
Oppenheimer had first seen the lodge in 1922 on his first trip to New Mexico, when his father sent him from New York to the Southwest as part of his recovery from a bout of colitis, a condition that would plague him for the rest of his life. It was home to a ranch school for boys that the Manhattan Project would commandeer decades later.
Nolan and Magnus took a tour of Bathtub Row, the series of simple houses where the top-level Manhattan Project scientists lived — another remnant of the ranch school, so named because they were the only dwellings in town with bathtubs (although they lacked kitchens at first). Most of these dwellings are off-limits to visitors because homeowners live there now, but Oppenheimer’s house was unoccupied. “I don’t know if I should say this or not, but Magnus, he did a lookout while I hopped the fence and got some pictures of Oppenheimer’s house,” the director says.
Nolan returned to Los Angeles full of inspiration and dove back into the script. But he’d also been left with a vexing problem. If he wanted to film the town as it had existed in the 1940s, completely forgoing the ubiquitous modern filmmaking tricks of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and green screen, he’d have to emulate the very project he was writing about. He’d have to go out to a remote desert somewhere and build it himself.
“For me, there’s this ‘keyman’ question that hangs over the life of Oppenheimer, which is that no one person invented the atomic bomb,” says Nolan. “He wasn’t the first to split the atom. He wasn’t the first to have a self-sustaining chain reaction. But somehow, he’s the guy who brought it all together and made it happen in the moment that it happened.”
Specifically, though, the physicist made it happen in a place that was a favorite childhood haunt of his, where he had fond memories of riding on horseback.
“Reading the book, you realize that, when they’re looking for a site [for the Manhattan Project], he just gently steers it toward where he spent the summers as a kid,” says Nolan. “As a young man, he said that if he could find a way to combine physics and New Mexico, he could achieve complete happiness. Well, he did and he was — for a time. And his personality was so influential that the leading laboratory in the world still stands in a place where he just liked to vacation.”
That one character detail was enough to help Nolan envision the world he might be able to create on-screen, as told through Oppenheimer’s eyes: one of sweeping desert vistas combined with an array of abstract special effects, again created without CGI, to illustrate an interior life of quantum physics and atoms and molecules. “That contrast is wonderfully cinematic,” says Nolan, who then set out to craft a story that he describes as part hero’s journey, part heist film and part courtroom drama, set against the imagery of a western — all presented in very Nolan-esque, nonlinear fashion.
The director knew he wanted to explore Oppenheimer’s rise to prominence — as well as his humiliating trial after the war, which resulted in the revocation of his security clearance due to his associations with communists. The part he was calling the “heist” section depicts the mad scramble for the world’s most brilliant minds to pull off the impossible project of building an atomic bomb before Adolf Hitler did.
Nolan and Emma Thomas — his producing partner on every film since 1998’s “Following” and also his wife — had started assembling their production team in September 2021. By the end of the month, production designer Ruth De Jong (Jordan Peele’s “Nope,” TV’s “Yellowstone”) was at Nolan’s house, hunkering down with the director one-on-one while he was editing the script, eventually creating a handmade foamcore diorama, or “white model,” of their 1940s Los Alamos set that was so big it could only fit in Nolan’s backyard.
Researcher Lauren Sandoval joined them, scouring the 180-page script looking for every historical discrepancy, as well as creating files to be used as casting references for 79 named characters, all but one of whom existed in real life. As prep and production ramped up, she’d find photo references of the actual bomb, or architectural plans for the steel tower at the Trinity test site near White Sands National Park in southern New Mexico where the first detonation occurred.
Meanwhile, Cillian Murphy was already preparing for the mammoth title role, his sixth collaboration with Nolan but the first in which he’d play the lead. For starters, he’d have to drop substantial weight to better approximate Oppenheimer’s almost emaciated silhouette. And he’d have to brush up on his horseback-riding skills for a scene in which Oppenheimer and his wife, Kitty (played by Emily Blunt), race horses across the desert. Blunt had just shot a TV western, “The English,” while Murphy jokes that, on his TV show “Peaky Blinders,” the horses rarely went faster than a walk. “Brilliant thing is that, in the story, Kitty was fantastic at horseback, apparently better than Robert, so it worked out,” says Murphy. “Emily was so graceful and elegant, and I was less so.”
They had just three months to get ready for a film that would shoot in just 57 days and run three hours, Nolan’s longest yet. “We’re not like other big films that prep for months and months and months,” says executive producer Thomas Hayslip. “Chris is of the mind that he and the crew need 12 weeks of prep and we’ll get it done in 12 weeks, and any more than that is just a waste of time.”

Ever since that first road trip, Nolan had been convinced that it would be impossible to shoot entirely in Los Alamos. “When I was there with Magnus, I saw how many things had changed, obviously, since the 1940s,” says Nolan. “I mean, there’s a Starbucks.”
The offending Starbucks is on what would have been Los Alamos’s main street, once a Wild West-style thoroughfare. Beyond Bathtub Row and the well-preserved Fuller Lodge, which Manhattan Project scientists used as a cafeteria, very little has been preserved from when Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves (played by Matt Damon in the film) and Oppenheimer took over the town.
After location scouting throughout the Southwest, Nolan and his crew built the town on a completely untouched section of Ghost Ranch, an educational and spiritual retreat about an hour and a half north of Santa Fe, made famous by the painter Georgia O’Keeffe. There, they found exactly what they wanted for their Los Alamos: a plateau on a ledge high above the desert with nothing else around.
“When I brought Chris there, he said, ‘This is very epic,’” De Jong recalls. “You felt like, ‘No one will find you here.’ There’s no one. The rest of the world is happening and going on, and we’re doing this thing that we think will save humanity.”
As the company began gathering in New Mexico to start filming at Ghost Ranch on Feb. 28, 2022, the paint was barely dry on the reconstructed town of Los Alamos. Construction had taken place in the dead of the high-desert winter, with the crew losing days of work because the ground was too frozen to dig into, or because snowfall had blocked the roads. Because of time constraints, the production team would have only six scheduled days at this $3 million set they’d spent three months building.
“Nobody is ever, ever, ever going to convince me that this would be better if shot on a soundstage,” says Damon. “When you have to go through the journey of getting out to the middle of nowhere in New Mexico and you don’t know what the weather’s going to be or what the wind’s going to do, that all affects the performance. The unpredictability and reality of being out there just gives you something that you can’t get in a controlled environment.”
Perhaps the most important sequence shot at Ghost Ranch was the moment in which Murphy puts on Oppenheimer’s distinctive porkpie hat for the first time, an action symbolic of the physicist truly coming into his own as the leader of this massive effort.
“He created this iconography, this version of himself,” says Murphy. “It was very self-consciously done, and the hat and the pipe were key. It was very helpful to me to know that these were decisions he’d made. I think he was vain. I think he was ambitious. He liked being talked about, and he liked being identifiable, and the hat and pipe were indicators of that.”

Cigarettes were also key to his persona. “Oppenheimer was a chain smoker,” says prop master Guillaume Delouche. “And when I say chain smoker, he smoked close to 150 cigarettes a day. When he didn’t smoke cigarettes, he would take a break by smoking his pipe.”
To help Murphy re-create the habit that eventually gave Oppenheimer fatal throat cancer, Delouche manufactured herbal cigarettes with a menthol flavor that Murphy could constantly smoke without getting sick. Delouche stamped the cigarettes with the logo of Chesterfield, the only brand Oppenheimer would smoke, and created period-specific cigarette packs for each era of the film.
Nolan believes in keeping an intense pace, so the cast and crew can keep civilized hours, get sleep and go home to their families. He also observes a strict routine, walking onto set every day and eating his breakfast — an omelet with avocado and crispy bacon — at 7 a.m.
“Chris works so fast that the only time you leave set is to go to the bathroom, and we move the toilets very close to you, so you don’t have to go too far,” says Hayslip.

For newcomers, Nolan’s rules were a shock to the system. “It was a real wake-up call for me,” says Blunt. “Chris’s sets can seem strict going into it, and then you realize it’s about placing the movie first. Every scene is so dialed in, because everyone’s been conversing with each other. No one’s been sitting in their own isolation looking at Instagram, distracting them from what they’re doing. I found it the most focused, collaborative experience of my career. I just ran to work. I loved it.”
Blunt found it hardest to adjust to Nolan’s requirement that actors come to set in costume, exactly as they’d appear on film. Carrying a coffee or wearing a personal coat, hat or boots while rehearsing was discouraged. The director’s reasoning was all about efficiency and keeping actors ready to shoot at a moment’s notice. He also wanted them to be entirely immersed in the world they were trying to re-create, without modern intrusions such as cellphones.
Blunt says she will never forget the day she showed up on set at Ghost Ranch wearing Ugg boots. “It was like a scene from ‘The Devil Wears Prada,’” says the actress, laughing. (She got her big break in that movie.) “Chris just looks down at your shoes, and it’s like Meryl Streep is looking at your horrible fashion choice. I just thought, ‘I’ll never be seen dead in Ugg boots around him again.’”
For her wrap gift to Nolan after the shoot, Blunt says she got the director “the ugliest Ugg slippers I could find.”
Filming interior scenes in the real Los Alamos began March 8, 2022. Nolan had revisited shooting in the extant historical buildings there, including Fuller Lodge and a 1940s Women’s Army Corps dormitory (which the production turned into Oppenheimer’s lecture hall), when he realized they had neither the time nor the budget to build those sets from scratch at Ghost Ranch. This meant he finally had the chance to shoot in the house on Bathtub Row where Oppenheimer and Kitty once lived. For the director, being there not only gave the scenes unique production value, but it also added something ineffable to the performances.
“It’s much better for the actors to be in the real place. It’s just informing so much of what they do,” he says. “It’s the exact opposite of doing something on a green­-screen stage, and particularly when people are tired and jaded on films from working long hours. There’s just something magic about walking into Oppenheimer’s real house.”
De Jong’s team and the set decoration department had furnished the space with authentic items, even finding wingback chairs that looked just like ones they had seen in a photo of Oppenheimer and Kitty relaxing with martinis. They also incorporated artwork and furniture that Murphy had uncovered during his research, helping the actor to “melt” into Oppenheimer’s space.
“Definitely, there’s something in the air and in the atoms of the place,” says Murphy, “and it confers a kind of responsibility on you, as a performer, and a responsibility on Chris also, as director. When you’re shooting in these real places where the people you’re portraying lived their lives, it adds a level of respect, and I think the audience subconsciously feels that.”

For Blunt, the house helped bring her closer to Kitty and gain a deeper understanding of her perspective. “They would drink a lot and barely eat and smoked like chimneys, and they had this real passion and fire for each other,” says Blunt, talking about the early days of their relationship.
But between Kitty’s indifference to motherhood and the isolation of Los Alamos, she began to lose herself to alcoholism. “The loneliness of life in Los Alamos must have just been extraordinary, and I felt so deeply for this woman who was not a nice person and really rubbed people the wrong way,” says Blunt.
In a key scene shot in the yard of the house on Bathtub Row, Kitty hangs up laundry while Oppenheimer heads down south to test the atomic bomb, his most triumphant moment. “She doesn’t get to see that,” says Blunt. “She’s busy hanging out laundry. Poor Kitty. No wonder she hit the drink.”
As an unexpected bonus of shooting in the home of the Manhattan Project, the production was able to cast real Los Alamos National Laboratory scientists as background actors.
“I was like: ‘It’s a town of 13,000 that’s known for the atomic bomb. I’m sure it’s full of people who know the history and have relatives who lived it,’” says Nolan, who asked the casting department to set up an open casting call in the town.
Olivia Thirlby, who plays scientist Lilli Hornig, says the actors quickly learned to lean on their new scientist friends. “We could ask, ‘So, what am I saying in this speech?’ And we’d get incredibly accurate and detailed descriptions — which didn’t make it any easier to understand,” she says, laughing.
The background actors were particularly important to a series of Los Alamos scenes that depicted the coming end of the war and Oppenheimer’s horrifying sense of guilt once the bombs drop on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, eventually killing or injuring more than 200,000 people. In one, a large group of scientists debate whether to go ahead with using the bomb on Japan after hearing that Germany has been defeated.
The director was amazed at how the actual scientists in the room could improvise incredibly complex geopolitical conversations based on their knowledge of the bomb.
“The actors were riffing on what the extras were giving them,” says Nolan. “It was a very unusual situation.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvMjAyMy8wNy8xOS9jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1yYWNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-24 20:28:59+00:00,‘Barbenheimer’ Weekend Was a Real Team Effort,"The bumper box office broke the usual pattern for blockbuster opening weekends, with several films contributing to the big numbers.","The incongruous duo of “Barbie,” a hot-pink comedic romp, and “Oppenheimer,” a brooding period drama, combined to sell far more movie tickets than expected over the weekend, pushing the overall domestic box office to $311 million, according to Box Office Mojo, an online database. It was the biggest weekend haul in North America since 2019, and the fourth-largest ever, before adjusting for inflation.
It is a sign that Hollywood has, maybe, finally bounced back from the pandemic. (Whether the film business, which is dealing with dual writers’ and actors’ strikes, can keep the momentum going is another question.)
The weekend was also noteworthy for its variety, with “Barbie” collecting $162 million, “Oppenheimer” $82.4 million and the rest of the features, including “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” and “Sound of Freedom,” adding more than $66 million.
Typically, the biggest weekends for domestic ticket sales have been dominated by a single blockbuster. During the highest grossing weekend, in April 2019, “Avengers: Endgame” accounted for nearly 90 percent of the box office. “Barbie,” by comparison, accounted for just over half of the box office over the weekend.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMjQvYnVzaW5lc3MvYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXdlZWtlbmQtYm94LW9mZmljZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-23 14:40:58+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Barbie’ Opens to Record-Setting $155 Million, ‘Oppenheimer’ Shatters Expectations With $80 Million Debut","""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" shattered expectations, fueling the fourth-biggest box office weekend in history.","“Barbenheimer” is more than just a meme. It’s a full-fledged box office phenomenon.
Over the weekend, moviegoers turned out in force for Greta Gerwig’s neon-coated fantasy comedy “Barbie,” which smashed expectations with $155 million to land the biggest debut of the year. But they also showed up to see Christopher Nolan’s R-rated historical drama “Oppenheimer,” which collected a remarkable $80.5 million in its opening weekend.
Hundreds of thousands of ticket buyers refused to choose between the two seemingly different auter-driven blockbusters with sprawling casts and twin release dates. So they opted to attend same-day viewings of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” turning the box office battle into a double feature for the ages.
“This is an unequivocally great weekend for moviegoing,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ are complementing each other at the box office, not taking audience from each other.”
The cultural craze known as “Barbenheimer” worked to fuel the biggest collective box office weekend of the pandemic era, as well as the fourth-biggest overall weekend in history. It’s worth noting the top three weekends of all time were led by the debuts of sequels in massive franchises (“Avengers: Endgame,” “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”).
“Studios gave audiences two uniquely different, smart and original stories that were meant for the big screen, says Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners, the industry’s trade organization. “People recognized that something special was happening, and they wanted to be a part of it.”
In the end, though, it wasn’t a competition as “Barbie” loomed large over box office charts, thanks to an inescapable marketing campaign, as well as quality to match the stratospheric hype. At the international box office, the film added $182 million for a stunning global tally of $337 million.
The $145 million-budgeted movie, backed by Warner Bros. and Mattel, dominated the zeitgeist in the weeks leading up to its debut (even reportedly causing a shortage of the color pink) to a degree that’s rare for original fare. (Yes, Barbie is perhaps the world’s most famous doll, but the movie isn’t a sequel or part of a pre-existing film franchise.)
“We have a pink unicorn here,” says Jeff Goldstein, the president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros. “We thought it would be $75 million for the opening weekend. Nobody saw $155 million coming. This doll has long legs.”
Audiences and critics dug the PG-13 film, which landed an “A” CinemaScore and 90% on Rotten Tomatoes. Initial crowds were 65% female (which, duh…), but that’s notable because it’s almost always the inverse for any movie that generates over $100 million in its debut.
Among its many records, “Barbie” also scored the biggest opening weekend ever for a film directed by a woman. “Captain Marvel,” which was co-directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, previously held the title with $153 million in 2019. “Wonder Woman,” from filmmaker Patty Jenkins, stood as the record-holder for a movie solely directed by a woman with $103 million in 2017.
Gerwig, the Oscar-nominated director of “Lady Bird” and “Little Women,” co-wrote the screenplay with her partner Noah Baumbach. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling star as the stereotypical versions of Barbie and Ken, who leave behind the Dreamhouse on a quest for self-discovery in the real world. The cast also includes Issa Rae, Dua Lipa, Simu Liu, Michael Cera, Helen Mirren, John Cena and Will Ferrell.
“Oppenheimer” may be settling for second place — not that Universal or Nolan is complaining. Buoyed by stellar reviews and premium large formats, the biopic about the so-called “father of the atomic bomb” is wildly outperforming expectations for a three-hour-long period piece with little action and lots of talking.
Heading into the weekend, analysts were anticipating a $50 million start, which already would have been notable given the grim film’s subject matter and style. With the bigger-than-projected debut, Nolan has only solidified his status as a box office draw, no matter the genre. And his appeal as a filmmaker spans continents. At the international box office, “Oppenheimer” added $93.7 million for a global tally of $174 million.
“This is a 1940s period piece,” says Universal’s president of domestic distribution Jim Orr. “That speaks volumes to the appeal of Nolan and his prowess as a filmmaker. He has an amazing reputation for storytelling in the biggest format possible.”
Nolan, the blockbuster director of “The Dark Knight” and “Inception,” is known to evangelize about Imax — and moviegoers have taken note. Premium large formats (PLFs, as they are known in the industry) contributed a massive 47% of the film’s domestic tally. Imax alone accounted for $35 million of global ticket sales.
“Around the world, we’ve seen sellouts at 4 a.m. shows and people traveling hours across borders to see ‘Oppenheimer’ in Imax 70mm,” says Imax CEO Rich Gelfond. “This is a phenomenon beyond compare in Imax, and we’re just getting started.”
Universal is backing the $100 million- budgeted “Oppenheimer,” which is notable because it marks the first time in more than two decades that Nolan isn’t working with Warner Bros. (Yes, the backers of “Barbie.”) He parted ways with the studio over its ill-fated decision to put its entire 2021 movie slate simultaneously on HBO Max.
Adapted from the Pulitzer Prize-winning book “American Prometheus,” “Oppenheimer” is a star-studded character study about theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy plays the man who led the action at Los Alamos, alongside an ensemble of Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Alden Ehrenreich.
With “Barbenheimer” taking up most of the oxygen at multiplexes, the other movies that were playing in theaters had to fight for scraps.
Tom Cruise’s big-budget sequel “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” took third place, tumbling by 64% with $19.5 million in its second weekend of release. It didn’t help that “Oppenheimer” is all but monopolizing the country’s PLF footprint, where tickets are pricier than standard screens.
The seventh installment in Paramount and Skydance’s globe-trotting action franchise has generated $118.7 million in North America and $370 million globally to date. However, it cost a mammoth $291 million before marketing, so it’ll need to hold its own against “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” to justify that price tag.
In fourth place, the independent juggernaut “Sound of Freedom” added $18.8 million from 3,285 theaters in its fourth weekend of release. The thriller about child sex trafficking has generated $124 million to date, making it the 14th-highest grossing domestic release of the year.
Disney’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” rounded out the top five, bringing in $6.7 million from 2,885 venues. After four weeks on the big screen, Harrison Ford’s action-adventure movie has grossed $159 million domestically and $335 million worldwide. The only trouble? It cost $300 million (and remember, theater owners get a share of ticket sales), meaning Indiana Jones is still deep in the red.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItb3BlbmluZy13ZWVrZW5kLXNoYXR0ZXItcmVjb3Jkcy0xMjM1Njc3NjAxL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItb3BlbmluZy13ZWVrZW5kLXNoYXR0ZXItcmVjb3Jkcy0xMjM1Njc3NjAxL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-23 19:17:29.926000+00:00,Barbie and Oppenheimer Blow Up the Box Office,"With a combined take of $244.5 million domestically and nearly $537 million total worldwide, Barbenheimer has officially broken several box-office records.","Update, July 24: The final numbers are in, and they’re huge: Barbie wound up earning $162 million domestic, with Oppenheimer coming in at $82.5 million. Internationally, Barbie made $194.3 million, with Oppenheimer earning $98 million. Math is hard, but let’s just say that’s a lot of money.
The original story continues below.
For weeks now, movie pundits have wondered just how much money Barbie and Oppenheimer would make on their combined opening weekend. As of Sunday, we have the answer: enough to buy a lot of Dreamhouses (and/or kitchen-free homes in Los Alomos).
The actual numbers are nothing short of staggering. Though final tallies won’t be available til Monday, it seems that Greta Gerwig’s Barbie has raked in about $155 million domestically and another $182 million internationally, exceeding even sky-high expectations. Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer has earned about $80.5 million domestic and $93.7 million internationally—a pretty stunning take for a three-hour drama about men in hats discussing theoretical physics.
That means together, the phenomenon known as Barbenheimer has made about $511 million worldwide, $235.5 million of which was earned domestically—enough to make this the fourth-highest grossing weekend in American history, and the only one of those four weekends not driven by a Disney-released sequel. (The openings of Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens occupy the no. 1, 2, and 3 slots, respectively.)
Deadline has a rundown of all the box office records that have just been broken: Barbie now boasts the biggest opening weekend ever for a female director. It's also the largest opening weekend for a movie based on a toy (beating out Transformers: Dark of the Moon). Oppenheimer has the biggest global opening for a biopic.
But those stats undersell what really was, and is, special about Barbenheimer. Heavily marketed as both these films have been, their massive success feels like an organic phenomenon, driven by actual enthusiasm from actual people. (What a concept!) Yes, Barbie is based on IP, and so, in a sense, is Oppenheimer. Both films are nevertheless idiosyncratic, auteur-driven projects, and not the sort of high-octane action franchise continuations studios seem to believe are the only sort of movie capable of making big money anymore. Both are also being received better than most wannabe blockbusters: critics (including Vanity Fair’s!) have reacted warmly to each film, while audiences have given each film an A Cinemascore.
What’s more, the apparent contrast between Barbie and Oppenheimer wound up working in both films' favor; scores of moviegoers elected to see not one movie but both, dressing up in midcentury hats and suits as well as their Barbie best. “People recognized that something special was happening and they wanted to be a part of it,” Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners, told CNBC. “Our partners in the creative community and at the studios gave audiences two uniquely different, smart and original stories that were meant for the big screen, and movie lovers responded by gathering friends and family and heading to their local movie houses across the nation.”
The singularity of Barbenheimer will be difficult if not impossible to recreate, though that doesn’t mean studios won’t try. We can only hope, then, that they take the right lesson from this weekend: as Nicole Kidman keeps telling us, people want to go back to movie theaters. They’re simply more willing to return if it means getting to see something they haven’t seen a million times before.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbml0eWZhaXIuY29tL2hvbGx5d29vZC8yMDIzLzA3L2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLXJlY29yZHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
7/13/2023 13:33,"In ‘Oppenheimer,’ Christopher Nolan builds a thrilling, serious blockbuster for adults",Christopher Nolan has never been one to take the easy or straightforward route while making a movie.,"NEW YORK (AP) — Christopher Nolan has never been one to take the easy or straightforward route while making a movie.
He shoots on large-format film with large, cumbersome cameras to get the best possible cinematic image. He prefers practical effects over computer-generated ones and real locations over soundstages — even when that means recreating an atomic explosion in the harsh winds of the New Mexico desert in the middle of the night for “Oppenheimer,” out July 21.
Though, despite internet rumors, they did not detonate an actual nuclear weapon.
And as for the biography that inspired his newest film, Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s riveting, linear narrative “American Prometheus” was simply the starting point from which Nolan crafted a beguiling labyrinth of suspense and drama.
It’s why, in his two decades working in Hollywood, Nolan has become a franchise unto himself — the rare auteur writer-director who makes films that are both intellectually stimulating and commercial, accounting for more than $5 billion in box office receipts. That combination is part of the reason why he’s able to attract Oscar winners and movie stars not just to headline his films, but also to turn out for just a scene or two.
“We’ve all been so intoxicated by his films,” said Emily Blunt, who plays J. Robert Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty. “That exploration of huge themes in an entertaining way doesn’t happen. It just doesn’t happen. That depth, the depth of the material, and yet on this massive epic scale.”
In the vast and complex story of the brilliant theoretical physicist who oversaw the Manhattan Project and the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, Nolan saw exciting possibilities to play with genre and form. There was the race to develop it before the Germans did, espionage, romance, domestic turmoil, a courtroom drama, bruised egos, political machinations, communist panic, and the burden of having created something that could destroy the world.
And then there was the man himself, beloved by most but hated by enough, who, after achieving icon status in American society, saw his reputation and sense of self annihilated by the very institutions that built him.
“It’s such an ambitious story to tell,” said Matt Damon, who plays Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. “Reading the script, I had the same feeling I had when I read ‘Interstellar,’ which was: ‘This is great. How the hell is he going to do this?’”
It’s not so disconnected from Nolan’s other films, either. As critic Tom Shone noted in his book about the director, “Looked at one way, Nolan’s films are all allegories of men who first find their salvation in structure only to find themselves betrayed or engulfed by it.”
Nolan turned to Cillian Murphy to take on the gargantuan task of portraying Oppenheimer. Murphy had already acted in five Nolan films, including the Batman trilogy, “Dunkirk” and “Inception,” but this would be his first time as a lead — something he had secretly pined for.
“You feel a responsibility, but then a great hunger and excitement to try and do it, to see where you can get,” said Murphy, who prepped extensively for six months before filming, working closely with Nolan throughout. “It was an awful lot of work, but I loved it. There is this kind of frisson, this energy when you’re on a Chris Nolan set about the potential for what you’re going to achieve.”
It would be an all-consuming role that would require some physical transformation to approximate that famously thin silhouette. A complex, contradictory figure, Oppenheimer emerged from a somewhat awkward youth to become a renaissance man who seemed to carry equal passion for the Bhagavad Gita, Proust, physics, languages, New Mexico, philosophical questions about disarmament and the perfectly mixed martini. But Murphy knew he was in safe hands with Nolan.
“He’s the most natural director I’ve ever worked with. And the notes that he gives to an actor, are quite remarkable. How he can gently bring you to a different place with your performance is quite stunning in such a subtle, low-key, understated way,” Murphy said. “It can have a profound effect on the way you look at a scene from one take to another take.”
Nolan wrote the main timeline of the film in the first person, to represent Oppenheimer’s subjective experience.
“We want to see everything through Oppenheimer’s point of view,” Nolan said. “That’s a huge challenge for an actor to take on because they’re having to worry about the performance, the truth of the performance, but also make sure that that’s always open to the audience.”
The other timeline, filmed in black and white, is more objective and focused on Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a founding member of the Atomic Energy Commission and a supporter of the development of the more destructive hydrogen bomb.
“Oppenheimer” is Nolan’s first R-rated film since 2002’s “Insomnia,” which after years of working exclusively in PG-13, he’s comfortable with. It fits the gravity of the material.
“We’re dealing with the most serious and adult story you could imagine — very important, dramatic events that changed the world and defined the world we live in today,” Nolan said. “You don’t want to compromise in any way.”
Much of the filming took place in New Mexico, including at the real Los Alamos laboratory where thousands of scientists, technicians and their families lived and worked for two years in the effort to develop the bomb. Nolan enlisted many of his frequent behind-the-scenes collaborators, including his wife and producer Emma Thomas, cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, composer Ludwig Göransson and special effects supervisors Scott Fisher and Andrew Jackson, as well as some newcomers like production designer Ruth de Jong and costume designer Ellen Mirojnick to help bring this world to life.
“It was a very focused set — fun set as well, not too serious. But the work was serious, the sweating of the details was serious,” Blunt said. “Everyone needs to kind of match Chris’ excellence, or want to.”
When it came to recreating the Trinity test, Oppenheimer’s chosen name for the first nuclear detonation, art and life blended in a visceral way.
“We wanted to put the audience there in that bunker,” Nolan said. “That meant really trying to make these things as beautiful and frightening and awe inspiring as they would have been to the people at the time.”
Though no real nukes were used, they did stage a lot of real explosions to approximate the blindingly bright atomic fire and mushroom cloud.
“To do those safely in a real environment out in the nighttime desert, there’s a degree of discipline and focus and adrenaline and just executing that for the film that echoes and mirrors what these guys went through on the grandest scale in a really interesting way,” Nolan said. “I felt everybody had that very, very tight sense of tension and focus around all those shooting nights.”
The weather also “did what it needed to do, as per history,” Murphy said, as the wind picked up and whipped around the set.
“I’m rumored to be very lucky with the weather and it’s not the case. It’s just that we decide to shoot whatever the weather,” Nolan said. “In the case of the Trinity test, it was essential, central to the story that this big storm rolls in with tremendous drama. And it did. That really made the sequence come to life.”
He added: “The extremity of it put me very much in the mindset of what it must have been like for these guys. It really felt like we were out in it.”
Then, of course, there is the experience of watching “Oppenheimer.”
“When you’re making a movie, I feel like you’re on the inside looking out,” Blunt said. “It’s really overwhelming to see it reflected back at you, especially one of this magnitude. ... I just felt like my breastplate was going to shatter, it was so intense.”
The hope is that when “Oppenheimer” is unleashed on the world, audiences will be as invested and will seek it out on the biggest screen they can find. The film has a run in IMAX theaters around the country, not something often afforded serious-minded, R-rated movies in the middle of the busy summer season. But this is also the essential Nolan impossibility. As more and more auteurs have had to compromise — to either go smaller or team with streamers to get the kind of budget they might once have had at studios, like even Ridley Scott and Martin Scorsese have had to do this year — Nolan continues to make his movies on the grandest scale.
“Each of his films has been revolutionary in their own way,” Murphy said. “It’s an event every time he releases a film, and rightly so.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLTQ2OWNjODFlMDk4OWY0MTRhMjBkYjU1MDhjNzYzMGEw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-28 17:38:45+00:00,Nolan’s Oppenheimer treats New Mexico as a blank canvas,"There is no acknowledgement in the film of the existence of downwinders from the test, in New Mexico or elsewhere.","In Christopher Nolan’s three-hour biopic “Oppenheimer,” released last week, the Manhattan Project comes to New Mexico largely because J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) wishes it so. The film was shot in the Land of Enchantment with a hastily assembled Ghost Ranch set serving as the film’s freshly constructed Los Alamos. “Oppenheimer” features New Mexico as setting, backdrop, and refuge for the transplant scientists and military men who spent World War II developing the atom bomb. The film does not show the people already living in New Mexico, neither before the first shovel hits the dirt nor after Trinity’s radioactive fallout creates the first downwinders.
Audiences leaving “Oppenheimer” will come away with a sense of the biography of the foundational figure in atomic history. Nolan’s film runs parallel narratives of Oppenheimer’s life from graduate school through Trinity, the 1954 closed-door hearing which upheld his security clearance revocation, and the 1959 confirmation hearing for Lewis Strauss’ nomination to be President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s commerce secretary.
The film capably describes how Oppenheimer built the first theoretical physics department at the University of California, Berkeley in the 1930s, next door to the radiation laboratory founded by Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett). It’s on a vacation with Lawrence and his brother Frank Oppenheimer (Dyland Arnold) in northern New Mexico that Oppenheimer quips that he would be truly happy if he could find a way to combine his two passions, New Mexico and Physics.
The discovery of atomic fission makes this possible, as Oppenheimer and others quickly realize a split atom can theoretically become the core of a powerful bomb. Soon, wartime demands and concern that German physicists might have a year head start lead the War Department to fund the creation of a secret research complex. Oppenheimer, together with General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) settle on the Los Alamos mesa.
“New Mexico was not remote and uninhabitable. Those were the very words that were used when they sited Los Alamos, that it was remote and inhabitable,” said Myrriah Gomez, assistant professor at UNM, at a panel after a Saturday screening of the film in Santa Fe. “Neither the project-wide site nor the Trinity site met the stipulations that the government required for either site.”
In the film, Oppenheimer and Groves find only a ranch school in their way. Left out of the film are the New Mexicans who lost land to the lab, did manual labor for it, and would be caught in the fallout from the world’s first atomic test.
“I knew clearly that this movie would be an over-glorification of the science and scientists, and there would be no reflection on the fact that without the people of New Mexico, we would not even have a Manhattan project for a trinity test,” said Tina Cordova, one of the founders of the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium.
They don’t talk about how New Mexicans did the dirtiest jobs, how we were part of building the roads and the bridges and the buildings. And then when that was completed, they sent us into the dirtiest jobs inside of the labs handling radioactive waste. – Tina Cordova, Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium
The panel was put on by a collection of nuclear threat reduction groups, led by Aligning Action in partnership with Nuclear Watch New Mexico, Ploughshares Fund, and Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium. The attendance, as remarked upon by a panelist, was largely white, and gray hair predominated among the crowd. There was an audience for a critique of New Mexico’s nuclear policy, but the scene at the panel was somewhat different than the crowds making “Barbenheimer” a historic weekend for multiplexes.
Uranium mined in New Mexico was part of that refined and used to fuel Gadget, the Trinity Test bomb, as well as Little Boy, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, and Fat Man, the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. The miners are not depicted in the film, and only slight mention is given to the work of uranium enrichment undertaken at Oak Ridge Tennessee or plutonium refining that occurred at the Hanford reactors in Washington State.
“They don’t talk about how New Mexicans did the dirtiest jobs, how we were part of building the roads and the bridges and the buildings. And then when that was completed, they sent us into the dirtiest jobs inside of the labs handling radioactive waste,” said Cordova. “They also didn’t depict the women that they bussed up there, Native women and the Hispanic women that literally cooked every meal, cleaned every house, changed every diaper, and made every baby bottle. They won’t show that in a film like this.”
After the second act of the film builds to the Trinity detonation, it takes careful detail capturing the reaction to the flash and then the sound wave from the assembled scientists. The thousands of residents of New Mexico who lived within 50 miles of the blast are given no screen time, or mention. The fallout, which the New York Times reported reached 46 states as well as Canada and Mexico, is not depicted or mentioned on screen.
“I have been dealing with a great deal of angst before watching this movie. It has left me with continued anger over the idea that they came to New Mexico when they established the Manhattan Project, invaded our lands and our lives, and they walked away. And when they made the Oppenheimer movie, they came here and took advantage of our tax incentives, they invaded our lands and our lives, and they walked away,” said Cordova. “It would’ve taken nothing away from this movie if they had added a panel at the very end and acknowledged our sacrifices.”
There is no such acknowledgement in the film of the existence of downwinders from the test, in New Mexico or elsewhere. Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” once assigns a number to the atomic dead, offering the 110,000 estimate produced by the US military in the 1940s. A higher estimate, of at least 210,000, was produced in the 1970s, and was the number used by panelists.
John C. Wester, Archbishop of Santa Fe, spoke against the continued and renewed development of nuclear weapons in the world and in his diocese. The Basilica of St. Francis “is only about roughly a hundred footsteps away from 109 East Palace Avenue, which was the gateway during the Manhattan Project,” said Wester, repeating a line he has honed in his appeals for disarmament. “And the secret was the Los Alamos lab that, as we just saw very dramatically, developed the atomic bomb that incinerated more than 200,000 souls at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In response, I seek to make the St. Francis Cathedral, in downtown Santa Fe, a gateway to universal, verifiable, global nuclear disarmament.”
The perils of the Atomic Age are not just the past harm done through bomb development, use in World War II, and testing before and after. It is the continued legacy of the bomb and its development, with Los Alamos as a crucial node in the nuclear enterprise, that adds urgency to righting the wrongs of the past.
“We’ve been slept-walked into a new nuclear arms race, arguably far more dangerous than the first,” said Wester. “I grew up in the duck-and-cover generation. Perhaps some of you remember that. I felt chills many decades later when I read that Robert McNamara, defense secretary during the Cuban Missile Crisis, said that we survived that crisis only by luck. Luck is not a sustainable strategy for the survival of the human family.”
Jay Coghlan, of Nuclear Watch New Mexico, emphasized the danger from renewed plutonium pit production at Los Alamos, which he sees as both unnecessary for nuclear deterrence, and as risking development of new nuclear weapons.
In the shadow of “Oppenheimer,” with its close focus on the policy fights at the dawn of the Atomic Age, it was clear that everyone felt the film, flaws and all, at least afforded a moment for the nation and the world to challenge the status quo on nuclear weapons. Still, another way to make that point stick home would have been to include what happened to the people of New Mexico, the first victims of nuclear colonialism and nuclear weapons.
When Gomez began her research, she interviewed her great aunt, in her 90s at the time, to ask what it was like when the Manhattan Project came to land where her family had lived.
“She had her hands about two feet apart. She said the bean plants were this high when the federal government came and bulldozed over them,” said Gomez. “These were people’s livelihoods. My great-grandfather took his crops and took them into town, and traded them or sold them. They were subsistence farmers. It wouldn’t have taken a lot of work to do that research to represent that New Mexico was not remote and uninhabited.”
In the blast sequence, too, Nolan could have found room to tell the stories of the people who lived in New Mexico long before Oppenheimer and Groves ever set to work on building a secret lab.
“It would’ve been fantastic if they would’ve included the histories that have been shared with us by the people that lived through the blast,” said Cordova. “The fact that I know people who told me stories about how they dropped to their knees, they got out of their car, they dropped to their knees and they started praying the rosary because they thought they were experiencing the end of the world. Or the mother that gathered up all of her children in bed with her and said, ‘If we’re gonna die, we’re all gonna die together.’”
“Those kinds of stories could have been easily depicted as part of this,” continued Cordova, “because I think some people are going to ask the question, maybe not, but some people will, you know: What happened to the surrounding area?”
In Nolan’s telling, that’s left up to the audiences’ imagination. It didn’t have to be.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc291cmNlbm0uY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMjgvbm9sYW5zLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXRyZWF0cy1uZXctbWV4aWNvLWFzLWEtYmxhbmstY2FudmFzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The cast of director Christopher Nolan’s hotly anticipated war-era drama “Oppenheimer” is standing united in the effort to support the SAG-AFTRA strike.
Stars of the film appeared on the red carpet of the film’s UK premiere on Thursday before the strike was officially announced, but they ended up walking out of the event “to write their picket signs,” according to Nolan.
Addressing the audience inside the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square theater before the screening began, as seen in videos posted to social media, Nolan acknowledged the work of Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh and Robert Downey Jr., among other “Oppenheimer” cast members.
“We have to acknowledge (that) you’ve seen them here earlier on the red carpet,” Nolan said, adding “unfortunately they’re off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by SAG.”
Nolan continued that the actors who left the “Oppenheimer” premiere in support of the union that represents them join “one of my guilds, the Writer’s Guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of the union, and we support them.”
The Writers Guild of America (WGA) has been on strike since May.
Blunt told Deadline on the “Oppenheimer” red carpet Thursday, prior to the cast walking out of the screening and prior to the strike’s official commencement, that her hopes were that “everyone makes a fair deal and we are here to celebrate this movie.”
“And if they call (the strike), we’ll be leaving together as a cast in unity with everyone,” Blunt said, adding, “We are gonna have to. So we will see what happens. Right now it’s the joy to be together.”
The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)’s president Fran Drescher announced in an impassioned speech during a press conference in Los Angeles on Thursday that the union will go on strike.
The strike is set to go into effect at midnight PT Thursday night.
“Oppenheimer” is scheduled to premiere in theaters on July 21.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8xMy9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWNhc3Qtc2FnLXN0cmlrZS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-11 17:06:29+00:00,‘Barbenheimer’s’ Global Box Office Battle: How the Two Blockbusters Are Performing in Countries Around the World,"A breakdown of how 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' are performing around the world, as both movies enter their fourth weekends of release.","The dual release of Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” on July 21 has restored the box office to its pre-COVID glory, and the effects have been felt around the world.
As of Aug. 14, “Barbie” — a comedy starring Margot Robbie as the iconic doll who goes through an existential crisis — has crossed the $1 billion mark worldwide (earning $1.18 billion so far), making Gerwig the first solo female director to do so. But “Oppenheimer,” in which Cillian Murphy portrays the father of the atomic bomb, has also stood its ground, making $648 million globally — an amazing feat for a three-hour-long film based on a historical figure.
Though “Barbie” has held tightly onto the No. 1 spot at the domestic box office since its release, “Oppenheimer” has fought its way to the top in other major markets, including India and Hong Kong. And, both films have stirred up some controversy in various countries due to their themes — specifically, “Barbie’s” feminist undertones and “Oppenheimer’s” depiction of the creation of the bombs that were dropped in Japan — oftentimes making one the winner by default.
After the fourth weekends of release for both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” below is a breakdown of how the movies have performed so far in the world’s biggest markets, using industry estimates and data from Box Office Mojo.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vbGlzdHMvYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWdsb2JhbC1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW51bWJlcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-20 09:00:39+00:00,Christopher Nolan and the Contradictions of J. Robert Oppenheimer,The biopic director argues that the physicist who oversaw creation of the atomic bomb was both the most important person who ever lived and hopelessly naïve.,"A quick question about the Trinity test, when Oppenheimer, Groves and the physicists and engineers set off the first nuclear bomb. How did you get that shot? Was some of it old footage from the test itself?
The way we approached [the] Trinity test was to forgo computer graphic imagery because I think computer graphics are inherently a bit safe, a bit anodyne, so I challenged my effects crew to come up with analog, real-world types of imagery that we could use to pull this off because we knew the Trinity test had to be a showstopper in the film. Some of the things they came up with were extremely small and microscopic that play as bigger. Some were absolutely massive and required all kinds of complicated safety protocols and involved the actors in some very small version of what it must have been like to be there out in the desert at night in those bunkers waiting to detonate that device.
It’s hard to believe you ginned this up in the short time since “Tenet.”
I wrote the script relatively quickly once I started writing, but I had a lot worked out beforehand.
Many years ago, I had written a script about the life of Howard Hughes that never got made because I wrote it right as Scorsese was making his own film. [Laughs] But I cracked the script to my satisfaction, and that gave me a lot of insight on how to distill a person’s life and how to view a person’s life in a thematic way, so that the film is more than the sum of its parts. So in some ways, the script, yes, it took me a few months, but it was really a culmination of 20 years of thinking.
As I do interviews and the film’s coming out, I’m always asked, do you know what you’re doing next?
And the answer is always the same. For me, I do one thing at a time and I put everything into it obsessively, and the film is not finished. Well, the way I like to put it is, the audience finishes the film.

2023-07-20 20:23:42+00:00,"Could ‘Oppenheimer’ Finally Win Christopher Nolan, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Oscars?","""Oppenheimer"" could be a major Oscars player for Christopher Nolan, and stars Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt.","“Oppenheimer” has burst into the Oscar race.
With the earnest and urgent cultural fabric of “To Kill a Mockingbird” and the philosophical measure of “The Tree of Life,” writer, director and producer Christopher Nolan‘s chronicle of the creation of the most destructive weapon ever used stands as the most ambitious and vital piece of filmmaking of his career. Adapted from the book “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, “Oppenheimer” tells the complicated and morally fraught story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer who led the effort to develop the atomic bomb.
Nolan and his stellar ensemble of actors have amassed 27 Oscar nominations collectively throughout their careers. One of those who surprisingly hasn’t nabbed one is Irish actor Cillian Murphy, who plays the titular scientist. With dry wit and womanizing charm that effectively makes him the scientific version of Michael Fassbender in “Shame,” Murphy is an effective vehicle to lead the viewer through reams of scientific terminology. In addition, his tour-de-force performance, which is sure to be in real consideration for best actor, is best displayed when showcasing the emotional toll such a creation can have on a person. Lead actors from competitive best picture players, especially from biopics, have been consistently recognized over the past few decades in Oscar history (see Benedict Cumberbatch for “The Imitation Game” or Christian Bale for “American Hustle”). Murphy could find his time has come after decades of memorable turns in “28 Days Later” (2002) and “Breakfast on Pluto” (2006).

“Iron Man” himself, Robert Downey Jr., is afforded the best material to chew on of the supporting players as Lewis Strauss, one of the founding commissioners of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and a hostile figure to Oppenheimer following the hydrogen bomb development. A two-time nominee for “Chaplin” (1992) and “Tropic Thunder” (2008), the role and awards pathway could mimic Oliver Stone’s “JFK” (1991) and its supporting actor nominee Tommy Lee Jones who played Clay Shaw. Only one actor from a Nolan movie has ever won and been nominated for Oscar recognition, Heath Ledger for “The Dark Knight,” coincidentally beating RDJ for “Thunder.” Very early in the awards race, only Robert DeNiro from Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon” seems to be considered a viable contender after the film debuted at Cannes.
In what has been a consistent criticism of Nolan’s oeuvre, the women in “Oppenheimer” are given very little agency to the central narrative. Oscar nominee Florence Pugh (“Little Women”) is arguably one of the most exciting actors in Hollywood, and she is relegated to a brief storyline about her emotional instability in her mere minutes of screen time as Oppenheimer’s girlfriend and later mistress Jean Tatlock, a re-engineered Marion Cotillard from “Inception.”

Emily Blunt, who has been overdue for her first Oscar nom after multiple snubs for “The Devil Wears Prada” (2006), “A Quiet Place” (2018) and “Mary Poppins Returns” (2018), plays Kitty, Oppenheimer’s alcoholic wife, who is sufficiently depressed so as to ask a family friend to take their baby for a while. However, during a critical cross-examination scene, Nolan offers Blunt the opportunity to showcase the skill and biting line deliveries she’s displayed throughout her career. With a smirk and swag, Blunt may finally be able to snag her first nom for supporting actress, especially in a film that is an across-the-board contender.
Nolan himself has received five Oscar nominations during his career — “Memento” (2001) in original screenplay, “Inception” (2010) for original screenplay and best picture and “Dunkirk” (2017) for directing and picture. His second directing nom is well within arm’s reach in what I would call the most “un-Nolan” movie he’s ever made. Box office and strong reviews will only help Universal’s quest to get one of the leading filmmakers of the 21st century his first statuette (it would also help keep him happy to make more movies with them in the future). One noteworthy point: An “Oscar hat-trick” of winning picture, director and screenplay has only been achieved nine times, most recently by the Daniels for “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”
The technical artists will also be highly competitive in their respective races, notably production design (Ruth De Jong, Claire Kaufman), cinematography (Hoyte van Hoytema), costumes (Ellen Mirojnick), editing (Jennifer Lame), sound (Richard King, Michael W. Mitchell, Kevin O’Connell, Gary A. Rizzo) and original score (Ludwig Göransson).
Of all the movies screened up to this point this year, Nolan’s movie is one of two films that could have all the key ingredients to win the Academy Awards’ most coveted prize. It’ll be a colossal guild player (watch out for the SAG ensemble), and the regional critics could make it a darling during the precursor season. The ongoing strikes could have a ripple effect on films that are dropping in the later months, since their teams won’t be able to promote them in the same way as earlier titles.
“Barbenheimer” may be an internet sensation, but only one resonates with Oscar voters, and it’s the one without pink. It’s okay; the pink one will make all the bucks.
Of Nolan’s 11 previous movies, only three have been shut out of the Academy Awards — his debut “Following” (1998), “Insomnia” (2002) and “The Dark Knight Rises” (2012).

2023-07-30 14:51:30+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Barbie’ Scores Massive $93 Million, ‘Oppenheimer’ Adds Huge $46 Million in Second Weekends","""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" continued to rule at the domestic box office as ""Haunted Mansion"" opened quietly.","It’s a “Barbenheimer” world and we’re just living in it.
The collective force of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” continued to rule the box office in their second weekends of release, providing another needed jolt as two Hollywood strikes threaten the fragile exhibition industry.
Greta Gerwig’s cotton candy-colored fantasy comedy again led the way, adding a massive $93 million between Friday and Sunday. Ticket sales for “Barbie” declined just 43% from its debut and resulted in the seventh-biggest second weekend in history. The only movies that enjoyed bigger sophomore outings were billion-dollar behemoths “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” ($149 million), “Avengers: Endgame” ($147 million) and “Infinity War” ($114 million), “Black Panther” ($111 million), “Jurassic World” ($106 million) and “The Avengers” ($103 million).
Christopher Nolan’s dark historical drama also had a stellar sophomore outing, taking in a mighty $46.6 million over the weekend. According to Universal, it became the first R-rated film to gross more than $10 million for 10 days in a row.
“Weekend two proves the outpouring of interest in ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ a week ago was not a fluke,” says Paul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore analyst. “Both films put up second weekend numbers that would have been considered solid as debuts and reflect two of the best sophomore session holds in box office history.”
After two weeks on the big screen, “Barbie” has generated $351.4 million in North America to stand as the fourth-biggest domestic release of the year. Globally, the Warner Bros. film has grossed $774 million and ranks as the third-largest film of 2023.
“Oppenheimer,” meanwhile, has earned $174 million at the domestic box office and $400 million at the global box office. It has already outperformed the lifetime grosses of two prior Nolan efforts, “Tenet” ($365 million) and “Batman Begins” ($373 million).
Two new movies, Disney’s remake of “Haunted Mansion” and A24’s violent thriller “Talk to Me,” attempted to entice audiences in the wake of “Barbenheimer,” to varied results. (Of course, nobody could predict the dominant punch of the two blockbusters when release dates were set.)
“Haunted Mansion” debuted in third place with $24.6 million from 3,700 North American theaters. The film added $9.1 million at the international box office, bringing its worldwide tally to $33 million. It’s not a great result for a kid-centric tentpole and it probably didn’t help that the Halloween-esque film opened in July. Disney spent $150 million to produce the film and tens of millions on promotional efforts. So, the film has a high bar to reach profitability, at least in its theatrical run.
It doesn’t bode well that audiences were mixed on “Haunted Mansion,” which has a “B+” CinemaScore. Directed by Justin Simien and starring LaKeith Stanfield, Rosario Dawson, Tiffany Haddish and Owen Wilson, the film takes inspiration from the Disney theme park ride and follows a single mother and her son, who move into… a haunted mansion.
“Disney gets additional value from its productions for its other divisions — in this case, the film promotes its theme parks,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “But setting that aside, the movie has a long climb to break-even.”
The low-budget “Talk to Me” generated a healthy $10 million from 2,340 theaters across the U.S. Those ticket sales exceeded expectations and were enough to land in sixth place. It’s the second-biggest start in wide release ever for A24, following “Hereditary” with $13.6 million.
“Talk to Me” is the feature debut of Australian YouTube stars Danny and Michael Philippou. Reviews and word-of-mouth have been positive, which helped the film to break out at the box office. It centers on a group of friends who discovers how to conjure spirits, which is all fun and games until one of them unleashes a horrifying supernatural force.
“This is an excellent opening for an indie horror picture made on a budget of $4.5 million,” says Gross. “The horror genre continues to be a very creative space for new and developing talent.”
Elsewhere at the domestic box office, the independent juggernaut “Sound of Freedom” added $13.6 million from 3,411 theaters in its fifth weekend of release. The thriller about child sex trafficking has generated $150 million to date, making it the 12th-highest grossing domestic release of the year. Remarkably, “Sound of Freedom” has earned more money in North America than big-budget tentpoles like “Fast X” ($145 million), Pixar’s “Elemental” ($142 million) and Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” ($139 million).
“Mission: Impossible” took the No. 5 spot on domestic charts with $10.7 million from 3,191 venues in its third outing. Internationally, the film has generated $309.4 million for a global total of $448 million. Despite positive reviews, the $291 million-budgeted blockbuster has stumbled in the wake of “Barbenheimer” and will struggle to recover in its theatrical run.
Overall, the month of July was ahead by 1.4% compared to pre-pandemic times, while the entire box office for the year remains down roughly 20%.
“July would have been a lukewarm month, but then ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ arrived; moviegoing exploded,” says Gross. “Within one week, July caught up to its pre-pandemic average.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYmFyYmllLWJveC1vZmZpY2Utb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc2Vjb25kLXdlZWtlbmQtcmVjb3Jkcy0xMjM1NjgxMDM5L9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYmFyYmllLWJveC1vZmZpY2Utb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc2Vjb25kLXdlZWtlbmQtcmVjb3Jkcy0xMjM1NjgxMDM5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-05 20:42:53+00:00,Review: Oppenheimer is pure visual poetry,"Technically it's a biopic, but it doesn't play like one.","I'll admit I had my doubts when I first heard that director Christopher Nolan was planning to make a film about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the research effort to develop the first atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project. This is one of the most well-documented periods of 20th-century American history, after all, and there have already been so many books, films, and TV series about the race for the bomb, of varying quality. (As always, let me give a shout-out to Manhattan, a stellar fictional series that was tragically canceled after just two seasons.) How would Nolan make this very well-trodden material his own?
I needn't have fretted. With Oppenheimer, Nolan has gifted us a truly unique, unflinching, nuanced portrait of the enigmatic, complicated man who spearheaded the Manhattan Project and subsequently ran afoul of the ""red-baiting"" politics of the McCarthy era. Technically it's a biopic, but it doesn't play like one. It's more like Nolan carefully selected various threads running through Oppenheimer's life and wove them into a richly textured tapestry that somehow transcends those raw materials. The result is pure visual poetry.
(Spoilers below, although this is very well-documented history.)
Nolan's film is largely based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin (which I highly recommend). The trailers understandably focused on the drama surrounding the birth of the atomic bomb leading up to the Trinity Test, but I had hoped that the film as a whole would follow the book's arc and include Oppenheimer's subsequent fall from grace. And so it does. In fact, that later, darker part of Oppenheimer's life provides the lens through which his earlier successes play out in Nolan's film.
There are two basic storylines, and the film shifts back and forth between them; Nolan has never been one to strictly adhere to a chronological timeline. ""Fission"" is shot in color and follows Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) through his early years as a graduate student and college professor; his leadership of the Manhattan Project culminating with the Trinity Test; his simultaneous triumph and torment in the wake of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; and the eventual loss of his security clearance thanks in large part to early Communist connections and his outspoken opposition to developing a hydrogen bomb.
""Fusion"" is shot in IMAX black-and-white analog photography and follows the 1959 Senate confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission who—as the film gradually reveals—played a critical role in stripping away Oppenheimer's security clearance five years earlier, angering many in the physics community. The black mark against Oppenheimer's name wasn't fully cleared until December 2022—right around the time the first trailer for Oppenheimer appeared.

Nolan has assembled an amazing cast. David Krumholtz is almost unrecognizable as I.I. Rabi, and Benny Safdie is perfection as Edward Teller, who sharply disagrees with Oppenheimer about the hydrogen bomb and eventually betrays him during the security hearings. Emily Blunt shines in a relatively small role as Kitty Oppenheimer, who suffered from depression and had a volatile relationship with her philandering husband, but remained fiercely loyal to him. (She really did refuse to shake Teller's hand when Oppenheimer was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award in 1963.) But the film ultimately belongs to Murphy and Downey Jr., both of whom give Oscar-worthy performances. Their mutual antagonism is arguably the heart of the film.
Physics fans should have fun picking out the various physics luminaries who make brief cameos. Jack Quaid's Richard Feynman has few lines but is recognizable due to his bongos—an anachronism, since Feynman didn't take up the bongos until later in life, but an entertaining anachronism. Hey, there's Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer), Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), Leo Szilard (Máté Haumann), Enrico Fermi (Danny Deferrari), Luis Alvarez (Alex Wolff), Hans Bethe (Gustaf Skarsgård), Vannevar Bush (Matthew Moline), Kenneth Bainbridge (Josh Peck), and the infamous Klaus Fuchs (Christopher Denham).
Nolan brings an impressive degree of historical accuracy to the film without resorting to a slavish recitation of facts, seeding it with oodles of throwaway details and characters as ornamental flourishes. For instance, the truth about whether a young Oppenheimer really injected cyanide into an apple intended for one of his professors (future Nobel Prize winning physicist Patrick Blackett) is hotly debated by historians, but it was not invented for the film. I was pleased to see mention of the paper Oppenheimer co-authored with a student while at Berkeley in 1939 predicting black holes—a topic largely forgotten until John Wheeler's work in the 1960s. Even his signature cocktail gets a shout-out.
Oppenheimer's mistress, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), did commit suicide, and there is an assassination conspiracy theory that she was murdered and her suicide staged—something barely hinted at in the film, but present nonetheless. There was a certain amount of online shock at the nudity and sex scenes between Murphy and Pugh, but I thought they were carefully handled and weren't remotely gratuitous—especially the touching post-coital scene where the pair are simply sitting naked, having an intensely intimate conversation.
President Truman did call Oppenheimer a ""crybaby"" (albeit not to his face) when the latter met with him after the war and confessed he felt he had blood on his hands. It's also true that Oppenheimer never publicly expressed regret for his role in building a bomb that killed between 100,000 and 200,000 people. (The exact number is still a matter of debate.) As he says in the film, his thinking was that it would be better to make dropping the first nuclear weapon so horrifying that nobody would ever want to use them again.

The dialogue during the openly hostile interrogation of Oppenheimer at the security hearings was drawn almost verbatim from the official transcripts—delivered to dramatic perfection by Nolan's outstanding cast. One of the most powerful scenes is the (verbatim) testimony of physicist David Hill (Rami Malek) during Strauss' Senate confirmation hearing to be Eisenhower's Secretary of Commerce.
Strauss had hoped Hill, then chair of the Federation of American Scientists, would speak in his favor. Instead, Hill declared that ""most of the scientists in this country would prefer to see Mr. Strauss completely out of the Government,"" and went on to provide a devastating critique of Strauss, citing his arrogance, lack of integrity, and personal vindictiveness toward Oppenheimer in particular. (Nolan dug up the transcript himself from Senate records.) Strauss was not confirmed—the first failure of a Cabinet nomination since 1925—and the rejection effectively ended his political career. He remained bitter about that for the rest of his life. Some might call it karma.
That said, this is not a documentary, and naturally a few liberties were taken. Most notably, the powerful final conversation between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), referencing a conversation they'd had in the past, is entirely fictional. Nor is the actual physics front and center, since thematically, Nolan is far more interested in exploring questions of power, politics, patriotism, and personal internal paradoxes. Still, the film handily captures the world of physics and physicists. Case in point: in one scene, Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) questions Oppenheimer about the possible risk of igniting the atmosphere and destroying the world when they push the detonator button for the Trinity Test. ""Chances are near zero,"" Oppie responds. ""What do you want from theory alone?"" Groves responds, ""Zero would be nice.""
Those less familiar with this period in history might not pick up on all the ornamental details, but that shouldn't hamper their enjoyment of the film. Ars Senior Technology Editor Lee Hutchinson had quibbles with the sound quality, however, citing ""mumbling, background noise obscuring the dialog, and putting VFX behind dialog so the sound overpowered everything else."" That wasn't the case at the screening I attended (or at least, I didn't notice). Still, forewarned is forearmed, and there was also criticism about the sound mixing for Nolan's 2020 film, Tenet. Audiophiles, take note.
Clocking in at three hours' running time, with many scenes featuring a bunch of white men sitting around talking about physics and defense strategy, Oppenheimer is the antithesis of what is usually deemed summer fare. Yet Nolan's skill in telling the story is such that it never seems to drag. Small wonder audiences have been flocking to theaters to see the film. (Many made it a double feature with Barbie, hence the ""Barbenheimer"" phenomenon.) Oppenheimer greatly exceeded its initial box office projections and has already grossed over $400 million worldwide. It's my pick for best film of 2023 thus far, and a worthy addition to my growing list of films about the atomic bomb.

2023-07-10 19:00:32+00:00,"AMC Theatres Says More Than 20,000 Moviegoers Have Already Booked ‘Barbie’-‘Oppenheimer’ Double Features","Plenty of moviegoers are watching Christopher Nolan's atomic drama “Oppenheimer” and Greta Gerwig's colorful romp ""Barbie"" on the same day.","In the battle of the bomb vs. the bombshell… why not both?
Plenty of moviegoers are making the decision to watch Christopher Nolan’s atomic drama “Oppenheimer” and Greta Gerwig’s colorful romp “Barbie” on the same day when the two tentpoles hit theaters on July 21.
With two weeks to go until the big day, AMC Theatres, the world’s largest cinema chain, is reporting that more than 20,000 AMC Stubs members have purchased tickets to see “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” on the same day.
Though it was apparently significant enough for AMC to issue a press release, it’s hard to contextualize the statistic because there aren’t a lot of comparable data points for guests purchasing tickets to see multiple movies on the same day — at least not ones that are publicly available. Moreover, the total number of AMC Stubs members, which includes A-List, AMC Stubs Premiere and AMC Stubs Insider, is unclear. Adam Aron, the CEO of AMC, said in early 2020 there were between 900,000 and 1 million A-List subscribers, which starts at $19.95 per month.
“That more than 20,000 moviegoers have already made plans and purchased tickets to see Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day is a great sign that the growing online conversation around seeing both of these incredible films is turning into ticket sales,” says Elizabeth Frank, executive VP of worldwide programming and chief content officer at AMC Theatres. “Just as exciting, with 10 days to go until these movies open, this may only be the beginning. From Friday to today, we saw a 33% increase in the number of guests who decided to create their own double feature by purchasing tickets to see both movies on the same day. We are thrilled to see this momentum.”
On paper, it may not seem like these films are catering to similar audiences. “Oppenheimer,” starring Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt, is a dark and gritty three-hour-long story about the American theoretical physicist who led the efforts to build the weapons of mass destruction that ended World War II. Meanwhile, “Barbie,” led by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is a neon-hued fantasy comedy about Barbie-Land expats Barbie and Ken, who go on a quest of self-discovery in the real world.
But the clash of the blockbuster-hopefuls, which hail from two beloved filmmakers and happen to be scheduled on the same day, has become a full-fledged phenomenon known as “Barbenheimer.” The seemingly stark contrast between the $100 million-budgeted films has inspired countless memes, fan art and apparel.
According to early tracking, “Barbie” is expected to outpace “Oppenheimer” in terms of inaugural ticket sales. But there’s a chance that Tom Cruise’s big-budget sequel “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” which opens a week prior on July 12, could end up again in the top spot on domestic box office charts over the weekend.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVtaWVyLWRvdWJsZS1mZWF0dXJlcy1hbWMtdGhlYXRlcnMtMTIzNTY2NTYzMi_SAWJodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9uZXdzL2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlbWllci1kb3VibGUtZmVhdHVyZXMtYW1jLXRoZWF0ZXJzLTEyMzU2NjU2MzIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Any story about Oppenheimer has to also be a story of the many scientists who came together for the Manhattan Project — whom Thomas calls “the rock stars within the scientific framework of the day.” Nolan was adamant about not creating composite characters, and to make sure audiences could keep track, he wanted each figure to be played by not just great actors but also those with recognizable or distinctive faces. Rami Malek, who plays physicist David Hill, only appears in the film for several minutes, for example, and yet he makes a remarkable impression.
For Oppenheimer himself, a real rock star served as partial inspiration. Cillian Murphy says that the director would send him pictures of David Bowie from the late 1970s — “when he was so skinny and kind of emaciated but had these wonderful tailored suits with the trousers,” Murphy says. “That was the Oppenheimer silhouette.”
Of course, screen time wasn’t an issue for him; his character dominates the film. “I’ve played a physicist before, in a movie for Danny Boyle called Sunshine, so I must have resting physicist face,” Murphy says. “What became clear to me really quickly was that there’s no point in me trying to understand quantum mechanics. I don’t have the intellectual capability. My job is to go after the humanity.” Others arrived armed with a surprising amount of knowledge. Benny Safdie, who plays Edward Teller (now known as the father of the hydrogen bomb), studied nuclear physics in high school. “I was working with a physicist at Columbia University,” Safdie says. “I was doing cosmic rays. It is a deep passion of mine.”
Safdie, an acclaimed filmmaker himself, was stunned by how quickly Nolan and his crew were able to move through scenes of various physicists and politicians arguing, debating, and questioning. He recalls sitting in one location thinking, “We’re going to be here for a while because this is like seven, eight scenes, it’s a hundred people, it’s period. But we moved to a new location before lunch! I said, ‘I have no idea how you did that.’”
The constant hubbub of scientific activity is one of the engines of the film, and Nolan was determined to give his actors a lot of freedom to talk and move. “You look down, there’s no marks on the floor,” Downey says. “You wonder if you shouldn’t pace it up. And Chris says, ‘Don’t worry about that. That’s my problem.’”
Because everything in Oppenheimer moves so fast, Nolan and editor Lame later went through the film repeatedly for what they called “character passes” – watching each cut of the picture to make sure individual characters weren’t getting lost in the shuffle. Nolan likens it to making a bed and pulling on each corner of a sheet, or changing a tire and tightening lug nuts. “You have to tighten the corners opposite so that everything stays in balance.”
Many of the real-life figures had written books, so cast members came in with a broad sense of their lives. “I always like to empower the actors to try things if they have an idea,” Nolan says. “In the script, the scenes are very, very stripped down. So you have to push your actors to come in with a bigger sense of the world, and walk through the door into the scene knowing what they just said to the security guard outside or whatever coming in.”
The director points to a scene in the office of U.S. secretary of war Henry Stimson, played by James Remar, in which a group is picking targets for the atomic bomb. Remar learned that his character had honeymooned in Kyoto, and it’s a matter of record that the city was taken off the initial list of targets – but Remar and Nolan added a line about the honeymoon being one of the reasons why. “It has this bureaucratic quality of a group of men discussing massive destruction and how they’re going to do these awful things. And you’re suddenly seeing a human face to these negotiations,” Nolan says. “There are some nice awkward silences in the movie, and that’s one of my favorite.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktYmVoaW5kLXRoZS1zY2VuZXMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-24 14:28:33+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’: Robert Downey Jr. Says Cillian Murphy Made the Greatest ‘Sacrifice by a Lead Actor’ He’s Ever Seen in His 53-Year Career,"Robert Downey Jr. has raves for his ""Oppenheimer"" co-star.","Cillian Murphy is earning some of the best reviews of his career for leading Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer, but no praise might be higher than this rave from co-star Robert Downey Jr.: “I have never witnessed a greater sacrifice by a lead actor in my career,” the “Iron Man” star told People magazine about Murphy’s performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer.
“He knew it was going to be a behemoth ask when Chris called him,” Downey Jr. added. “But I think he also had the humility that is required to survive playing a role like this. We’d be like, ‘Hey, we got a three-day weekend. Maybe we’ll go antiquing in Santa Fe. What are you going to do?’ ‘Oh, I have to learn 30,000 words of Dutch. Have a nice time.’ But that’s the nature of the ask.”
“Oppenheimer” shot for 57 days, one of Nolan’s quickest film shoots, and Murphy is front and center in nearly every scene. The cast and crew lived together in the same hotel during the film’s production, but Murphy never joined his fellow ensemble for dinner due to the intensity of playing the lead role.
“Of course he didn’t want to come and have dinner with us,” Matt Damon previously told People magazine. “He couldn’t. His brain was just too full.”
Emily Blunt reasoned that Murphy did not attend cast dinners because “the sheer volume of what he had to take on and shoulder is so monumental.”
For Murphy, “Oppenheimer” marks the biggest leading role of his film career thus far. That kind of pressure isolated the actor. “You know that when you have those big roles, that responsibility, you feel it’s kind of overwhelming,” he told People.
Murphy also lost weight for the role, although he has not disclosed how much. The actor stars in the film as theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who was tasked with leading the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico in the effort to create the atomic bomb. Downey Jr. stars as Lewis Strauss, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission who later persecuted Oppenheimer for being a Soviet spy.
“Chris had one of the most incredible leads in Cillian,” Florence Pugh added to People. “He is an actor that I have been watching for quite some time and have been desperate to work with for ages. You’d have to be mad to say no. It was truly one of the best experiences that I’ve had.”
“Working with him was hugely impressive,” she added. “Every single day he shows up knowing every single possible way, intonation, inflection of how to bring this character to life. That was hugely impressive to me. There’s a reason why he is one of the greats.”
“Oppenheimer” is now playing in theaters nationwide from Universal Pictures.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3Mvcm9iZXJ0LWRvd25leS1qci1wcmFpc2VzLWNpbGxpYW4tbXVycGh5LW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWdyZWF0ZXN0LXNhY3JpZmljZS0xMjM1Njc4MzA2L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3Mvcm9iZXJ0LWRvd25leS1qci1wcmFpc2VzLWNpbGxpYW4tbXVycGh5LW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWdyZWF0ZXN0LXNhY3JpZmljZS0xMjM1Njc4MzA2L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-17 22:31:23+00:00,Christopher Nolan and the ‘Oppenheimer’ cast discuss the atomic bomb and its chilling echoes today: ‘Humanity can only deal with one apocalypse at a time’,Christopher Nolan wants us to be wary of nuclear threat – and he’s not the only one.,"CNN —
“The bomb, Dimitri. The hydrogen bomb,” an exasperated US president reminds his Soviet counterpart in Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 classic “Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.”
As if the bomb could ever be forgotten. At the height of the Cold War, when mutually assured destruction was at its crazed height, nuclear warfare found itself abstracted through humor – perhaps the only reasonable way to treat something so fearsome. The bomb was a sick joke to be ridden, sometimes metaphorically, sometimes literally, a totem of mankind’s ingenuity and stupidity riveted shut and let fly. To look at it head-on was to be blinded by its glare; the power it wrought was too absurd — and too close — to countenance. Best to send in the clowns.
It would have seemed inconceivable then, but the atomic bomb did fade out of mind. In the 21st Century, other existential threats have reared their heads. Yet the nuclear threat feels closer today than it has for generations. And it’s precisely at this moment that Christopher Nolan is asking audiences to look it soberly in the eye.
“Our relationship with nuclear weapons is very complicated,” Nolan told CNN. “The fear ebbs and flows. It’s almost like humanity can only deal with one apocalypse at a time, and there’s so many issues to worry about.”
But worry many will after watching “Oppenheimer,” his latest and perhaps greatest film to date. As the name suggests, Nolan has taken on the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientific genius and conflicted godfather of the atomic bomb. Working in IMAX, the director conjures an overwhelming, altogether haunting retelling of the story of the bomb’s creation and its fallout across three taut hours that pushes the limits of the medium itself.

Nolan’s screenplay – written, unusually, in the first person – drew from definitive biography “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin, but stops short of its forensic take on the physicist. Flitting between color and monochrome – the director has described the former as a subjective and the latter an objective lens on events – we mostly experience the narrative through Oppenheimer’s eyes.
“We have to get the facts right. We have to be guided by history. But we’re trying to give the audience an experience. We’re trying to really entertain and engage in a meaningful way,” Nolan explained.
“It’s a subjective telling,” he added. “We’re trying to not judge the man. We’re trying to experience things with him and understand.”
Oppenheimer’s piercing blue stare is inhabited by Cillian Murphy, the director’s long-time collaborator and first-time leading man. “Oh, there was a man,” Murphy said of his character. “I was so exhilarated to be given the opportunity – it’s kind of a dream part. But it’s so multifaced and massive, so you just dive in.”
Murphy plays Oppenheimer from a young student in Cambridge in the 1920s through to the post-war McCarthy era and beyond, without the aid of distracting de-aging CGI (the physicist died in 1967). Around him swirls a who’s who of impeccably suited scientists, military men and politicians, along with the women in his life, wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) and lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) – a vast supporting cast in the truest sense.
“Watching Cillian and Chris together, it was two people at the height of their abilities,” said Matt Damon, who stars as Leslie Groves, the brusque general overseeing the Manhattan Project.
“It felt the most like watching when Spielberg did ‘Saving Private Ryan,’” he added, “watching Chris Nolan with a story that’s worthy of his vast ability. Everybody could feel it, so everybody came with everything they had and was like, ‘Alright, how do we support this?’”
A threat renewed
For most of Nolan’s considerable cast, Oppenheimer’s invention set the backdrop for their upbringings. “This was our existential threat growing up,” recalled Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and later a political operator.
“We did grow up at this time, but it’s almost too much to engage with, so you push it out,” said Damon. “It’s like we’ve all been living under this sword of Damocles for 80 years … Our kids, it’s not part of their experience to the extent that it should be.”

Nolan knows this only too well. “I told one of my teenage sons what I was working on,” he recalled. “He said to me, ‘Well, does anybody really worry about that anymore?’ This was a couple of years ago. By the time we finished shooting the film, unfortunately he wasn’t asking that question anymore.”
Russia invaded Ukraine days before cameras started rolling, noted Murphy, and it was under that cloud that filming began in New Mexico, at a stand in for the Los Alamos HQ for the Manhattan Project.
The film has taken on troubling relevance, especially the passages set post-war, documenting an arms race that Oppenheimer warned against. Its examination of his legacy, from the physicist’s perspective and the people around him, forms a devastating and complex coda.

Today, the ethical debate surrounding the bomb remains undimmed. But even if a war involving a nuclear power hadn’t erupted in Europe in 2022, Nolan believes “Oppenheimer” contains crossover anxieties.
“(Nuclear war) is unique in the threats that we face, but it also relates to a lot of our relationship – and particularly young people’s relationship – with technology and technological innovation,” he said. “Because ultimately, the atomic bomb, awful though it is and was, it was an incredible technological innovation.”
Eighty years after the Trinity Test, technological innovation looks like artificial intelligence (AI), he offered, and the potential dangers of “unleashing those things on the world.”
“A lot of the scientists I speak to, a lot of the people who work in the tech sector I speak to, they worry about this,” he added. “They see what they’re doing as their Oppenheimer moment, and they look to his story to give some kind of guidance as to how the relationship between science, technology, government and society should function.
“I don’t know whether Oppenheimer’s story has answers to that,” he added. “It certainly raises the questions, and in a way that I think we will find quite chilling.”
""A lot of the scientists I speak to ... they see what they're doing as their Oppenheimer moment,"" Nolan said of the rise of AI. Universal Pictures
Kubrick had us laugh at the bomb because it felt like an appropriate coping mechanism. Now Nolan’s fierce and sincere contemplation will awaken a new generation to its horrors – and that feels appropriate too.
For a director obsessed with the workings of time, the arrival of his latest movie is uncanny. But one senses the film will outlive this moment, and only burnish his reputation as one of the few blockbuster directors with the clout to pull off working at this scale.
“There’s always been this mystique around Nolan,” Downey Jr. shared. “The spring-into-summer that the first ‘Iron Man’ came out (in 2008), people were like, ‘Oh, this will do until “The Dark Knight” comes out.’ So, you’re like, ‘Oh, it’s not a Chris Nolan.’”
“He’s a master filmmaker, there’s no denying it,” he added, “and you don’t get many of those per generation.”
“I think this film is kind of the apotheosis of his talent as a director,” said Murphy. “To have had the privilege of working with him over the years and seeing him move towards this, it’s phenomenal to witness.”

,Robert Downey Jr. Declares 'Oppenheimer' the 'Best Film I've Ever Been In',"Robert Downey Jr. said the Christopher Nolan-directed historical drama 'Oppenheimer' is the ""best film I’ve ever been in"" at the movie's London premiere on July 13, before walking out in solidarity with the SAG strike.","Marvel fans, cover your ears!
According to Robert Downey Jr., Oppenheimer is the best film he has acted in.
At the London premiere of the Christopher Nolan-directed historical drama on Thursday, the Iron Man star, 58, revealed that the movie is a career-best for him, according to a video shared by Deadline on Twitter.
“Just going to flat out say it: This is the best film I’ve ever been in,” he said in the video, a declaration that was met with cheers from the premiere audience at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square. “I cannot wait for you all to experience it.”
Downey — who portrays Lewis Strauss, primary antagonist of titular physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) — goes on to say that “no matter what your expectations are” going into the dark period piece, which follows the effort to create an atomic bomb during World War II, it “transcends that.”

""This is what a summer blockbuster, when I was growing up, used to be,” he continued. “It just kind of, like, changed your life. But again, you know, it’s why Chris Nolan is who he is.
Downey’s interview came just before he and his castmates walked out of the premiere in solidarity with the Hollywood actors' strike.
When he and his Oppenheimer costars including Murphy, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett and Emily Blunt left the theater after walking the red carpet, Nolan, 52, addressed their sudden absence in relation to SAG-AFTRA's then-looming strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP).
""We have to acknowledge, you've seen them here earlier on the red carpet,” the director said, as captured by another Deadline-shared video. “Unfortunately, they're off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by SAG.”
He continued, ""Joining one of my guilds, the Writers Guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of their union, and we support them.”
Before her departure, Blunt, 40, who plays Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty, told Deadline, “If they call [a strike], we’ll be leaving together as a cast in unity with everyone. We're gonna have to.""
“But right now, it’s the joy to be together,” the A Quiet Place star added.

In a new interview with The New York Times Magazine, Downey opened up about his journey as an actor post-Iron Man, which began with Dolittle — a film that flopped hard following its 2020 release.
“I finished the Marvel contract and then hastily went into what had all the promise of being another big, fun, well-executed potential franchise in Dolittle,” he told the magazine. “I had some reservations. Me and my team seemed a little too excited about the deal and not quite excited enough about the merits of the execution.”

“But at that point I was bulletproof,” he explained. “I was the guru of all genre movies.”
Thankfully, Downey told the outlet, his post-Marvel career eventually led him to Oppenheimer. “Then old Chris Nolan calls, and getting to see the spartan, almost monastic way he approaches this art form, it was like going to the other side of the moon,” he said.
Oppenheimer premieres in U.S. theaters July 21.

Robert Oppenheimer in the 2023 film, “Oppenheimer.” The scientist was the leader of America's Manhattan Project, which created the first nuclear weapons. Universal Pictures
Few things are more terrifying than nuclear war, and it’s looking like Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” film captures that terror.
“Oppenheimer” has been shaping up to be one of the summer’s largest blockbusters (although it will have stiff competition on opening weekend from Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie”). The biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer, one of the primary scientists behind the creation of the atomic bomb, was filmed partially in Berkeley, where Oppenheimer taught as a professor. In a lesser-known local connection, Oppenheimer’s brother Frank also founded San Francisco children’s museum the Exploratorium.
Wednesday, Variety reported that early reactions to the film have been visceral, to say the least. The accounts come from a Wired interview with Nolan himself, so they should be taken with a grain of salt, but he noted that those who’ve seen the film have had intense emotional reactions. One of Nolan’s fellow filmmakers, who was not named in the story, said, “It’s kind of a horror movie.”

“Some people leave the movie absolutely devastated,” Nolan said to Wired. “They can’t speak. I mean, there’s an element of fear that’s there in the history and there in the underpinnings. But the love of the characters, the love of the relationships, is as strong as I’ve ever done.”
Oppenheimer biographer Kai Bird, whose 2005 book served as the source material for the film, echoed Nolan’s sentiments in an interview with the Institute for Advanced Study. “I am, at the moment, stunned and emotionally recovering from having seen it.”
The film is set to be released July 21, and given that it was filmed specifically for IMAX, audiences would do well to view it on the biggest screen possible. Tickets are available for IMAX showings at AMC Bay Street 16 in Emeryville, Veranda Luxe in Concord, AMC Dine-In Sunnyvale 12, Cinemark Century Daly City 20, and AMC Santa Clara. It will be presented in IMAX in San Francisco at AMC Metreon 16.

2023-07-21 19:56:20.827000+00:00,"‘Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds.’ The Story of Oppenheimer’s Infamous Quote","The Robert Oppenheimer quote, from the Hindu sacred text the Bhagavad Gita, has come to define the father of the atomic bomb, but its meaning is more complex than many realize","Seeking his counsel, Arjuna asks Krishna to reveal his universal form. Krishna obliges, and in verse 12 of the Gita he manifests as a sublime, terrifying being of many mouths and eyes. It is this moment that entered Oppenheimer’s mind in July 1945. “If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one,” was Oppenheimer’s translation of that moment in the desert of New Mexico.
In Hinduism, which has a non-linear concept of time, the great god is involved in not only the creation, but also the dissolution. In verse 32, Krishna says the famous line. In it “death” literally translates as “world-destroying time,” says Thompson, adding that Oppenheimer’s Sanskrit teacher chose to translate “world-destroying time” as “death,” a common interpretation. Its meaning is simple: Irrespective of what Arjuna does, everything is in the hands of the divine.
“Arjuna is a soldier, he has a duty to fight. Krishna, not Arjuna, will determine who lives and who dies and Arjuna should neither mourn nor rejoice over what fate has in store, but should be sublimely unattached to such results,” says Thompson. “And ultimately the most important thing is he should be devoted to Krishna. His faith will save Arjuna’s soul."" But Oppenheimer, seemingly, was never able to achieve this peace. “In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no overstatements can quite extinguish,” he said, two years after the Trinity explosion, “the physicists have known sin; and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.”
“He doesn’t seem to believe that the soul is eternal, whereas Arjuna does,” says Thompson. “The fourth argument in the Gita is really that death is an illusion, that we’re not born and we don’t die. That’s the philosophy, really. That there’s only one consciousness and that the whole of creation is a wonderful play.” Oppenheimer, perhaps, never believed that the people killed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki would not suffer. While he carried out his work dutifully, he could never accept that this could liberate him from the cycle of life and death. In stark contrast, Arjuna realizes his error and decides to join the battle.
“Krishna is saying you have to simply do your duty as a warrior,” says Thompson. “If you were a priest you wouldn’t have to do this, but you are a warrior and you have to perform it. In the larger scheme of things, presumably, the bomb represented the path of the battle against the forces of evil, which were epitomized by the forces of fascism.”
For Arjuna, it may have been comparatively easy to be indifferent to war because he believed the souls of his opponents would live on regardless. But Oppenheimer felt the consequences of the atomic bomb acutely. “He hadn’t got that confidence that the destruction, ultimately, was an illusion,” says Thompson. Oppenheimer’s apparent inability to accept the idea of an immortal soul would always weigh heavy on his mind.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tYW5oYXR0YW4tcHJvamVjdC1yb2JlcnQtb3BwZW5oZWltZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Matt Damon told his wife he would take a break — unless Christopher Nolan called,Matt Damon negotiated a 'Nolan exemption' in couples therapy with his wife. He and Cillian Murphy reveal how Christopher Nolan recruited them for 'Oppenheimer.',"Matt Damon likes to stay busy.
Over the last couple of years, the actor has starred in Air (which he also produced), The Last Duel (which he produced and co-wrote), and Stillwater, and also made cameo appearances in Thor: Love and Thunder and No Sudden Move. Before Christopher Nolan called Damon to offer him the role of General Leslie Groves in his historical drama-thriller Oppenheimer (out July 21), the actor — who previously appeared in Nolan's 2014 science fiction epic Interstellar — had told his wife, Luciana, that he would take some time off. So how did Damon play the role of Groves in the movie, about ""father of the atomic bomb"" J. Robert Oppenheimer, without breaking his word? Turns out the actor had secured what future generations may well call ""the Nolan exemption"" in this spousal agreement.

""This is going to sound made up, but it's actually true,"" Damon reveals in EW's Around the Table with Nolan and costars Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr. ""I had — not to get too personal — negotiated extensively with my wife that I was taking time off. I had been in Interstellar, and then Chris put me on ice for a couple of movies, so I wasn't in the rotation, but I actually negotiated in couples therapy ­— this is a true story — the one caveat to my taking time off was if Chris Nolan called. This is without knowing whether or not he was working on anything, because he never tells you. He just calls you out of the blue. And so, it was a moment in my household.""
""So, even modern psychology has a caveat…"" says Downey in the video, which you can watch above.
""For Chris!"" says Damon.
""Just checking,"" says Downey. ""You heard it here first!""

As a result, Damon can be seen in the film playing Groves, the general who oversaw the Manhattan Project, where the United States' atomic weapons were created, alongside costars Murphy as Oppenheimer, Blunt as the physicist's wife Kitty, and Downey as Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss.
Murphy has been a stalwart supporting player in several of Nolan's previous movies, including 2005's Batman Begins and 2010's Inception. But, like Damon, the Irish actor was unaware the director had even written a script about Oppenheimer until Nolan called him up and asked if he was interested in playing the movie's titular physicist.

""Chris' way of operating is that he just calls you out of the blue,"" says Murphy. ""I genuinely had no idea. He said he was making a movie about Oppenheimer and he said, 'I'd like you to play Oppenheimer.' I had to sit down. It was kind of overwhelming.""
Nolan admits that his habit of phoning Murphy without warning to offer him roles does have a downside. ""[It's] a fun way to do it,"" says the director to the actor. ""But it means that it's very difficult to call you to go out to dinner or something. Because every time you answer the phone it's like, what's it going to be?""

2023-07-24 13:00:00+00:00,Is Oppenheimer Streaming on Netflix or Peacock? How to Watch Oppenheimer Now,"'Oppenheimer,' Christopher Nolan's highly anticipated new film, premieres on July 21. Here's how to watch and stream the movie online.","If you're anyone who's been on the Internet within the past month, you've definitely, definitely heard of Oppenheimer and Barbie. The two films are set to face off at the box office on the same massive weekend for cinema, as both officially were released into the world on July 21. While some moviegoers plan to see just one film or the other, some are determined to see both, potentially even on the same day. The weekend is likely the biggest movie event since the pandemic began.
At the heart of the fanfare is Christopher Nolan's newest film, Oppenheimer. The biopic follows J. Robert Oppenheimer, the famed theoretical physicist who helped create the atomic bomb. The film delves into both his personal and professional life, along with the internal turmoil of creating and utilizing the deadliest weapon known to man. The film boasts a stacked cast, including Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr.
Reviews are in from Rotten Tomatoes, and it's clear the film is one of Nolan's best (although as we've found in our ranking, he has yet to make a true dud). Anyone who's a fan of masterful cinema, or just a history buff, should enjoy watching Oppenheimer. You won't want to miss it, especially because you can combine it with the lighthearted Barbie to brighten your day after watching such a serious film.
So if you're convinced and want to watch Oppenheimer, buckle up. The excitement for the film has made it near impossible to grab a seat for the film's first weekend, which means you might have to wait later in the theatrical run to see it, or wait until it heads to a streaming platform. Here's when that may happen.
How to Watch Oppenheimer
Right now, Oppenheimer is only available to watch in theaters. Movies usually have a theatrical run of at least a month, and it can be extended if the film does particularly well. Oppenheimer may be in theaters for a while yet, so if you want to see it, snag your tickets now.
When Will Oppenheimer Head to Streaming?
While it's not clear when the film will go to streaming, it's possible to guess where the film will go when it does inevitably head to a platform. The film is distributed by Universal Pictures, which is owned by NBCUniversal. It's likely Oppenheimer will head to Peacock when it does go to a streaming platform. As for when that may be, it's possible by the fall the film will be available, but on-demand and streaming transition is at the discretion of the distributor.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNoZWFsdGguY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYTQ0NTkxMjY3L2hvdy10by13YXRjaC1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1zdHJlYW1pbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-15 13:20:24-04:00,My Reason for Not Watching Oppenheimer (A Perspective from Hiroshima),"On August 6, my mind kept going back to where my grandfather was the day the US bombed Hiroshima.","Read more of UCS’s critical analysis of Oppenheimer and the global security issues it examines here.
As we approached August 6 this year, the 78th anniversary of the US atomic bombing of Hiroshima, my mind kept going back to the basement of Chugoku Electric Power Company, 800 meters (half a mile) from the hypocenter, where my grandfather was that day. I witness how the force of the nuclear bomb can destroy the human body, how the vacuum of a nuclear explosion can gouge out a child’s eyeballs, how the atomic burns peel the skin, swell and corrode the face in ways humanity had never seen. According to one review , the filmmaker focuses on the face of Oppenheimer rather than showing the carnage of his bomb.
From a few minutes of an interview with the ﬁlmmaker, I can see that spectators of his movie will safely assume that the characters have all the possible means to escape to minimize their exposure to radiation. Such a space was never offered to people at ground level in Hiroshima and Nagasaki on those critical days. The mushroom-shaped cloud created by the explosion was depicted over and over again in the trailer for the film. But this is a symbol of ashes to the people of my community. That cloud contained the flesh and bones of our grandparents.

The G7 Summit
This past May, I was in Hiroshima, the city where I was born and raised, and witnessed the G7 summit from ground level. Six Western nations–Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, and Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who had survived a murder attempt by a fisherman one month prior, gathered to strengthen their ties. The city was paralyzed. Police from all over Japan were there, schools were closed for five days, and there were so many road closures that people stayed home and watched it on TV.
Biden entered Japan through Iwakuni, a US military base, while others used Japanese airport/gate of the independent nation. Other leaders also stayed in a Japanese hotel in Ujina near the Setouchi sea shore where they had the summit. Biden headed straight to an American-owned hotel (Hilton) in the city center, stopping all the traffic at the center of the city near ground Zero. Local TV camera persons were trying to capture a presidential aide who carried the “nuclear football,” which is always with the US President and enables him to launch a nuclear strike anywhere in the world.
People watched as Prime Minister Kishida spoke of progress in nuclear disarmament talks. Leaders promised the president of Ukraine to provide weapons, including depleted uranium munitions, “for as long as it takes” said Biden, to win the war. This was said in the city of Hiroshima –where people have shared a common understanding for 78 years that they must never betray the hibakushas (atomic bomb sufferers) who pray for World Peace, and live with the fear of radiation illness and dying of cancer with excruciating pain.
During the Summit, Biden paid a visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, known to locals as Atomic Bomb Park, a memorial to those who experienced the massive force of the atomic explosion. It is a landmark of human tragedy and our entering of the nuclear age. Kazumi Matsui, the Mayor of Hiroshima, visited the US Embassy in Tokyo soon after the summit to sign a Sister Parks Agreement between the Atomic Bomb Park and Pearl Harbor National Memorial Park.
Pearl Harbor Memorial Park commemorates the battle between the United States and Japan that began with the attack by Japanese forces on Pearl Harbor. It commemorates the deaths of over 2,000 U.S. sailors and soldiers, as well as 68 civilians caught in the crossfire. The Sister Park Agreement indicates an official consensus between the City of Hiroshima and the United States that the war began with an (unjustified) attack on Pearl Harbor and ended with the (justified) dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The Hiroshima Alliance for Nuclear Weapons Abolition (HANWA) is a local group formed by descendants of hibakushas and allies. They warned citizens of Hiroshima, in the midst of the festive G7 Summit, that agreements like this put the city on the fast track to being transformed beyond recognition, with a narrative that lacks historical accuracy, and obliterates the past.
Ms. Haruko Moritaki, a descendant of hibakusha and Representative of HANWA facing the final stages of cancer, sat in a Citizens’ Assembly meeting on May 17th, 2023. She commented on President Obama’s remarks during his brief visit to the Atomic Bomb Park in 2016, the first sitting US president to visit Hiroshima since the war. Obama delivered a brief speech, saying: Seventy-one years ago, on a bright, cloudless morning, death fell from the sky and the world was changed. Ms. Moritaki said, “Death didn’t fall from the sky. The death was brought by the United States dropping of the bomb …over human beings.”
President Biden didn’t deliver a speech when he visited the Atomic Bomb Park. He had nothing to say to the people of Hiroshima.
My role as an artist
As a visual artist, educator, and a third-generation hibakusha who now lives in the United States, I have visited many nuclear sites in the country over the years to grasp the American nuclear narrative. I have witnessed how development of nuclear technology forever changed the land and continues to divide communities and oppress the vulnerable.
As an artist in the year 2023, I am part of a community asked constantly to address ethical questions regarding what is at stake in a work of art: Who is telling the story? Who is silenced in the process? Who is assumed to be the viewer in a given context? I wonder, was the filmmaker asked, or did he ask himself these same questions?
We have heard enough from those benefiting from the current power structure who can relate to the man responsible for leveling two cities but not to the more than 200,000 people who were killed, along with the rest of the city’s inhabitants who were left injured, facing slow and horrible deaths from radiation exposure.
So again, I ask: What is the framework around the production of a film that constitutes historical suffering? How do you address the issue while being respectful of the difficult and often painful feelings triggered by the film? It is a filmmaker’s moral duty to decide how these images are purveyed without reinstating trauma.
In solidarity with those not pictured
In an article titled “The Racial Underpinnings of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings,” Elaine Scarry notes that on September 18, 1944, US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met at Roosevelt’s Hudson Valley estate. A written recording reveals that Japan had been designated as the target for the bombings nearly seven months before Germany surrendered on May 7,1945. The training taking place in the Pacific for the mission to drop the bomb on Japan was initiated in that same month, which further supports the content of the meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill. The historical records indicate yet again the way nuclear development prevents white nations from becoming victims of nuclear atrocities.
Scarry quotes Langston Hughes, who commented in 1953: (Until racial injustice ceases in the United States), “it is going to be very hard for some Americans not to think the easiest way to settle the problems of Asia is simply dropping an atom bomb on colored heads there.”
Scarry goes on: The cruelty daily inflicted on people of color in our own city streets acts as a mental rehearsal for carrying out large-scale slayings abroad. It keeps our capacity for cruelty limber; it dulls the mind and gives us practice in pronouncing the word “expendable.”
My friend Petuuche Gilbert of Acoma Pueblo in New Mexico, who works tirelessly to draw attention to the ongoing contamination of his people from uranium mining, said to me, “I want to see the film acknowledges [sic] the entire story of the nuclear bomb’s impact not only upon its first victims but upon the lives of indigenous peoples also living with its legacy of development and application. I want the film to mention indigenous peoples whose land was taken to build and test the bomb. I want it to tell and comprehend the tragedies of the nuclear fuel chain.”
He added “Manifest destiny was necessary to build America and have what it is today—American power and supremacy.”
At the G7, in Obama’s speech, in the Sister Park Agreement, and now yet again in Oppenheimer, we see the erasure of the hibakusha and their experiences, the supremacy of war and national power over the people harmed by that supremacy.
No, I do not need to watch the film and be retraumatized.
My solidarity is with the people not pictured, those who continue to suffer.

Christoper Nolan’s latest epic “Oppenheimer” began its domestic box office marathon with a whopping $10.5 million in Thursday preview grosses. That’s a staggering total for what is essentially a 3-hour, R-rated grimdark drama mostly concerned with men in suits having cryptic conversations about science and politics.
It’s also around double the preview grosses for “Interstellar” ($4.8 million in 2014) and “Dunkirk” ($5.5 million in 2017), pointing toward an opening weekend figure well above those films’ respective $49 million and $50 million Fri-Sun debuts.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXRodXJzZGF5LWJveC1vZmZpY2UtY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The day Christopher Nolan called Cillian Murphy about his new film, “Oppenheimer,” Murphy hung up the phone in disbelief.
The Irish actor, though a regular presence in Nolan films going back almost two decades, had always been a supporting player. This time, Nolan wanted him to lead.
“He’s so understated and self-deprecating and, in his very English manner, just said, ‘Listen, I’ve written this script, it’s about Oppenheimer. I’d like you to be my Oppenheimer,’” Murphy, 47, told The Associated Press earlier this year. “It was a great day.”
For Murphy, it is never not exciting to get a call from Nolan. It’s just hard to predict if he’s going to. He knows there are some movies he’s right for and some movies he isn’t.
“I have always said publicly and privately, to Chris, that if I’m available and you want me to be in a movie, I’m there. I don’t really care about the size of the part,” he said. “But deep down, secretly, I was desperate to play a lead for him.”
Murphy first met Nolan in 2003. He was brought in to screen test for Batman — not just the movie, the character. Murphy knew he wasn’t right for the Dark Knight, but he wanted to meet the man who’d directed “Insomnia” and “Memento.” They hit it off and Murphy got to tap into a sinister intensity to play the corrupt psychiatrist Dr. Crane/Scarecrow, who would go on to appear in all three films. Nolan would also call on Murphy to be the conflicted heir to a business empire in “Inception” and a traumatized soldier in “Dunkirk.”
“We have this long-standing understanding and trust and shorthand and respect,” Murphy said. “It felt like the right time to take on a bigger responsibility. And it just so happened that it was a f—ing huge one.”
Soon after the phone call, Nolan flew to Dublin to meet Murphy and hand him a physical copy of the script, which he devoured right there in Nolan’s hotel room. It was, he said, the best he’d ever read.
Then the scale of it started to sink in.
This would be a film about the charismatic and controversial theoretical physicist who helped create the atomic bomb. Oppenheimer and his peers at Los Alamos would test it on July 16, 1945, not knowing what was going to happen. There was a non-zero chance that the heat from the explosion could set off a chain reaction that would ignite the atmosphere and literally set the world on fire.
It didn’t, but several weeks later the United States would drop those bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing tens of thousands of people and leaving many with lifelong injuries. Soon, the United States was at work to strengthen its nuclear arsenal, developing plans to work on an even more catastrophic weapon: the hydrogen bomb.
As Nolan has said, “Like it or not J. Robert Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived.”
“Oppenheimer,” which opens in theaters on July 21, features a starry cast including Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty, Matt Damon as the man who hired Oppenheimer for the job at Los Alamos, Robert Downey Jr. as a founder of the Atomic Energy Commission and many more rounding out the pivotal players in and around this tense moment in history.
“You realize this is a huge responsibility. He was complicated and contradictory and so iconic,” Murphy said. “But you know you’re with one of the great directors of all time. I felt confident going into it with Chris. He’s had a profound impact on my life, creatively and professionally. He’s offered me very interesting roles over and I’ve found all of them really challenging. And I just love being on his sets.”
Murphy continued: “Any actor would want to be on a Chris Nolan set, just to see how it works and to witness his command of the language of film and the mechanics of film and how he’s able to use that broad canvas within the mainstream studio system to make these very challenging human stories.”
Over the years, Murphy has come to appreciate that with Nolan there’s always something deeper to discover than what’s literally on the page. “Dunkirk,” he recalled, was only 70 pages and there wasn’t much to his character, not even a name.
“He said, ‘Look, let’s figure it out together and you and me can find an emotional journey for the character.’ And we did it. We did it out in the water on that boat. That comes from trust and respect,” Murphy said. “I’m really proud of that performance.”
As with all Nolan endeavors, secrecy around “Oppenheimer” is vitally important. Murphy loves the “old-fashioned approach” that builds interest and anticipation.
“There’s an awful lot to talk about when we can talk freely,” Murphy said with a smile.
The difference from other Nolan originals, even “Dunkirk,” is that “Oppenheimer” is rooted in historical fact and actual transcripts. You can read the book it’s based on, Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.” You can watch the 1981 documentary “The Day After Trinity” on The Criterion Channel.
And you can try to parse Nolan’s words for clues. He’s talked about recreating the Trinity test, the fascinating paradoxes, the twists, turns and ethical dilemmas; for him, the story is cinematic and both dream and nightmare. But ultimately, it’s something that just needs to be seen.
“The question will be how Chris presents it,” Murphy said. “I think people will be very surprised and wowed by what he does. Anything I say will just seem a bit lame as compared to seeing this in an IMAX theater.”
The time for discussions will be after the movie comes out. But Murphy did offer up that they worked hard to get Oppenheimer’s look right, from the narrow silhouette to the pipe and the porkpie hat. Oppenheimer, he said, “seemed aware of his own potential mythology.” But, again, those conversations will have to wait.
“I’m really proud of the movie and I’m really proud of what Chris has achieved. This was, for sure, a special one, certainly because of the history with me and Chris. We were not walking around the set high-fiving, but it did feel special.” Murphy said. “It’s an event every time he releases a film, and rightly so. Whether I’m in them or not, I always go to see his movies.”

,Oppenheimer’s science beyond the Manhattan Project,Explore everything Los Alamos is doing,"What about J. Robert Oppenheimer as a scientist stands out after all these years? Mark Paris, a theoretical physicist at Los Alamos, takes a look at some of the high points in a column for Physics Today, tracing Oppenheimer’s important contributions to the emergence of quantum theory. Oppenheimer achieved influential work in the spectral properties of molecules, offered an understanding of cosmic rays and neutron stars, and predicted what would come to be called “black holes.” Much of that work came while founding the leading school of theoretical physics in America.
Paris traces that work while also exploring Oppenheimer’s relationship with experimental physics, an appreciation that would serve him well as director of the Manhattan Project.

On the same day “Barbie” passed its billion-dollar box office milestone, the other half of the viral “Barbenheimer” phenomenon blew past the half-billion-dollar mark.
Since its release three weeks ago, Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” has made $552.9 million worldwide, according to official estimates from Universal Pictures.
It is now the highest grossing R-rated movie of 2023, and “marks the fastest a Universal R-rated film has hit the $200 million threshold domestically,” the studio said in a news release Sunday. It’s also the highest grossing movie set during World War II, according to Universal.
In its third weekend, “Oppenheimer” has had incredible stamina as the No. 3 movie in both domestic and international box offices.
Nolan’s blockbuster has had “an astounding theatrical run made all the more impressive by the R-rating, running time and subject matter which, in the hands of a lesser filmmaker and absent a spectacular marketing and release strategy, would have likely wound up as a mere footnote when referencing the performance of historical dramas at the box office,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.
The box office numbers are impressive for a three-hour biography about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project physicist. The movie is one of only four biopics to earn more than half a billion dollars globally, alongside “Bohemian Rhapsody,” “Passion of the Christ,” and “American Sniper.”
“‘Oppenheimer’… (has) become one of the most revered, talked about and successful summer movies ever to be released by a major studio,” said Dergarabedian, adding the movie “demonstrates the power of great filmmaking and of course a bit of unforeseeable ‘Barbenheimer’ magic.”
“Oppenheimer” and “Barbie” had a symbiotic relationship in the lead-up to their shared debut on July 21, perhaps helped by their very different styles and tones.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8wNi9idXNpbmVzcy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1zdXJwYXNzZXMtNTAwLW1pbGxpb24tYXQtYm94LW9mZmljZS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMy8wOC8wNi9idXNpbmVzcy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1zdXJwYXNzZXMtNTAwLW1pbGxpb24tYXQtYm94LW9mZmljZS9pbmRleC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Given the “Barbenheimer” craze that’s sweeping the nation, Murphy has naturally been asked a lot about Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie.” Omelete (via Cinéfilos) even asked the “Oppenheimer” actor if he’d play a Ken in a potential sequel to Gerwig’s now historic comedy blockbuster.
“Sure, yeah. Let’s read the script, let’s have a conversation,” Murphy responded about playing Ken. “I can’t wait to see [‘Barbie’]. I can’t wait to see the movie. I think it’s great for cinema to get all these great movies happening this summer.”
“Barbie” opened to a massive $162 million during its opening weekend, but “Oppenheimer” was no slouch. The film debuted to a huge $82 million, a staggering number considering Nolan’s latest is a talky, three-hour biographical drama that’s also rated R.
Nolan told IGN ahead of both films opening in theaters that “it’s terrific” to have two summer tentpoles being released together.
“Summer, in a healthy marketplace, is always crowded, and we’ve been doing this a long time,” Nolan said. “I think for those of us who care about movies, we’ve been really waiting to have a crowded marketplace again, and now it’s here and that’s terrific.”
Murphy agreed with Nolan, telling IGN: “I think it’s great. I mean, I’ll be going to see ‘Barbie.’ I can’t wait to see it. I think it’s just great for the industry and for audiences that we have two amazing films by amazing filmmakers coming out the same day. Could spend a whole day in the cinema, what’s better than that?”
Whether or not Murphy becomes a Ken remains to be seen. For now, he’s still processing everything that went into becoming J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who created the atomic bomb during World War II. Murphy went through dramatic isolation periods and weight loss during filming, so much so that Robert Downey Jr. said he’s never seen an actor sacrifice more for a role than Murphy in “Oppenheimer.” Is Oppenheimer a hero or a villain? The discussion is a nuanced one for Murphy.
“I do think that he believed it would be the weapon to end all wars,” Murphy recently told NME. “He thought that [having the bomb] would motivate countries to form a sort of nuclear world governance. He was naive.”
Murphy added that Nolan helped him unlock the more nuanced parts of Oppenheimer’s character. “Chris used this amazing phrase,” he said. “We were talking about Oppenheimer’s arc and he said, ‘You know, he’s dancing between the raindrops morally.’ That unlocked something in my mind when I was preparing.”
“Oppenheimer” is now playing in theaters nationwide from Universal Pictures.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHkta2VuLWJhcmJpZS0yLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLW5haXZlLTEyMzU2Nzk0NjEv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1rZW4tYmFyYmllLTItb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbmFpdmUtMTIzNTY3OTQ2MS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-03 14:52:36+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’ Dialogue Might Be Hard to Hear Because Christopher Nolan Refuses to Re-Record Actors: ‘An Artistic Choice Some Disagree With’,"Having trouble understanding ""Oppenheimer"" dialogue? That might be because Christopher Nolan does not re-record his actors in post-production.","Are Christopher Nolan movies too loud? It’s a question that’s asked every time the director releases a movie, and “Oppenheimer” is no exception. Nolan’s sound mix is once again a point of contention among viewers, with some complaining that it’s hard to understand the dialogue against Ludwig Göransson’s booming score and other sound design choices. In a recent interview with Insider, Nolan explained that one reason it may be hard to hear the dialogue in “Oppenheimer” is because he refuses to re-record his actors in post-production.
“I like to use the performance that was given in the moment rather than the actor re-voice it later,” Nolan said. “Which is an artistic choice that some people disagree with, and that’s their right.”
Nolan refuses to record ADR, so whatever vocal takes he gets on the day of filming are what go into the film’s theatrical cut. That can be a risk in a movie like “Oppenheimer” considering the IMAX cameras used to shoot the film are incredibly loud on set, although Nolan said they are getting better.
“There are certain mechanical improvements,” Nolan said. “And actually, Imax is building new cameras right now which are going to be even quieter. But the real breakthrough is in software technology that allows you to filter out the camera noise. That has improved massively in the 15 or so years that I’ve been using these cameras. Which opens up for you to do more intimate scenes that you would not have been able to do in the past.”
Whatever dialogue issues some “Oppenheimer” viewers are having with the film aren’t stopping moviegoers from flocking to see the atomic bomb epic. “Oppenheimer” has soared past the $400 million mark at the worldwide box office in less than two weeks of release, a huge accomplishment for a three-hour biopic that’s rated R. The film is expected to have grossed more than $200 million domestically by the end of its third weekend in release.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tZGVmZW5kcy1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1zb3VuZC1yZWZ1c2VzLWFkci1yZWNvcmRpbmctMTIzNTY4Njg5NS_SAXRodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9uZXdzL2NocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLWRlZmVuZHMtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc291bmQtcmVmdXNlcy1hZHItcmVjb3JkaW5nLTEyMzU2ODY4OTUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,'Oppenheimer': Meet the Star-Studded Cast of Christopher Nolan's Atomic Bomb Epic (Exclusive Photo),"The cast of Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' — Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh and Robert Downey Jr. — all pose in an exclusive photo for PEOPLE","When Christopher Nolan embarks on a new project, Hollywood's A-list wants in.
His latest epic undertaking, Oppenheimer, based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, attracted one of the starriest casts the Oscar-nominated director has ever assembled, headlined by Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh and Robert Downey Jr.
The biopic follows J. Robert Oppenheimer, played by Murphy, the scientist who famously led the Manhattan Project — the effort to create an atomic bomb during World War II.

In a group interview with PEOPLE, Blunt equated filming the movie with the sprawling cast in New Mexico to being at ""summer camp.""
""We were all in the same hotel in the middle of the New Mexican desert,"" she recalls. ""We only had each other. Me and Matt were roommates and we were like, 'Let's go to have dinner.' ""
Sadly for Murphy, he rarely got to join in on the fun due to the daunting task of leading Nolan's film.
""The sheer volume of what he had to take on and shoulder is so monumental,"" marvels Blunt. ""Of course he didn't want to come and have dinner with us."" Damon agrees, saying, ""He couldn't. His brain was just too full.""
Adds Murphy, ""You know that when you have those big roles, that responsibility, you feel it's kind of overwhelming.""
Oppenheimer will hit theaters on July 21. Moviegoers can see it on standard and IMAX screens.

,“Oppenheimer” is a one-of-a-kind cinematic immersion into history,"Dramatic as it is educational, Nolan provides an authentic portrayal of The Manhattan Project and goes above and beyond by displaying the scrutiny Oppenheimer faced from the U.S. government after WWII.","While much excitement for the film was built around the spectacle of nuclear explosion, Nolan thankfully dives into much greater depths during his depiction of the Oppenheimer security hearing that occurred after World War II.
Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, “Oppenheimer” is a biopic that explores the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, portrayed by Cillian Murphy. The two work hand in hand, with Nolan creating a realistic cinematic odyssey of the invention that came out of the Manhattan Project , while Murphy’s haunted expression — sensitized by his bright blue watery eyes — embodies the once passionate and later demoralized creator of the atomic bomb used on Japan in 1945 during World War II. From its astounding portrayal of historic events to the dedicated cast, “Oppenheimer” is not a movie but an experience from beginning to end.
Within seconds of the opening scene, Nolan foreshadows the intensity of the film with audio that sends vibrations throughout the theater, shaking viewers' seats. Despite its three-hour duration, the film’s astonishingly fast-paced narrative makes the experience engaging throughout. With time jumps, black and white shots and a nonlinear plot, “Oppenheimer'' quickly throws its viewers into the mix of events. The theme of change is a vital tool for Nolan, keeping the film fresh while adding to the concept that the Manhattan Project was a vital race between nations to build the first atomic bomb.
As explosive as the film’s score is, it frustratedly dilutes some of the fast-paced dialogue. Poor sound mixing has been a consistent issue faced by Nolan, tracing back to his second film “Memento.” Nolan has gone on record with The Hollywood Reporter to say that his choice of thunderous scores is completely intentional.
""Many of the filmmakers I've admired over the years have used sound in bold and adventurous ways,” Nolan said. “I don't agree with the idea that you can only achieve clarity through dialogue. Clarity of story, clarity of emotions — I try to achieve that in a very layered way using all the different things at my disposal — picture and sound.""
From talks of radioactive isotopes, countless names of scientists and the at times overbearing background sound, salient plot details are hard to keep track of. While “Oppenheimer” is nowhere near the conceptual complexity of time travel in “Interstellar,” nor the manipulation of dreams in “Inception,” viewers should be advised to pay close attention throughout the biopic still.
While the sound slightly muddles the film’s clarity of expression, it is simultaneously the most captivating component. The score displays the dichotomy of moral questions in the Manhattan Project from moments of soothing orchestra harmony that reflect Oppenheimer's elegance in pursuit of a new scientific discovery, to screeching violins in times of urgency and trauma. While the score alone is enough to pierce through the screen, it is merely a rehearsal for the climax of the film — The Trinity Test — which was the first-ever detonation of a nuclear explosion.
Just as the timer ticks to zero for The Trinity Test, a deafening silence roams, leaving only the sound of deep breathing to fill the air. The silence astutely displays the dissonance between the speed of sound and light, emphasizing the unscalable size of the explosion and serving as a brilliant tactic of excitement and horror when the explosion is finally heard. As the screen is slowly filled with red, yellow and fiery smoke, it is an astounding experience that is perfectly fitted for IMAX.
While much excitement for the film was built around the spectacle of a nuclear explosion, Nolan thankfully dives into much greater depth of the physicist in the less explosive second half of the film. One emotional yet horrific scene dives into the mind of Oppenheimer where he envisions the incinerated victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Murphy’s performance during the scene wonderfully displays the evolution of Oppenheimer and the subsequent trauma faced as a result of his own invention.
Along with Murphy comes a brilliant performance by Robert Downey Jr. who plays Lewis Strauss — chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission — and brings forth the security hearing on Oppenheimer due to his previous ties to the communist party. Combined with the mental stress of the bombings, it is at this point where Oppenheimer is completely defeated, where even his wife —played by Emily Blunt — is begging for him to fight back.
While what results from the security hearing may seem minimal, Nolan’s underlying messages shine throughout this moment. Nolan brings to light the U.S. government’s exploitation of scientists after WWII, displaying their ignorance towards Oppenhiemer’s request of enforcing international regulation on nuclear weapons and deeming him as a threat to U.S. security once no longer needed for the war. “Oppenheimer” goes beyond the Trinity Test, educating modern audiences on this untold dramatic story of betrayal and the double-edged significance of Oppenheimer’s contribution to society.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhdmFsaWVyZGFpbHkuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMy8wNy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1pcy1hLW9uZS1vZi1hLWtpbmQtY2luZW1hdGljLWltbWVyc2lvbi1pbnRvLWhpc3RvcnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-28 21:15:49+00:00,The Darkest Memes of the Barbie-Oppenheimer Double Feature,The internet is at its best and its worst after it was announced that a film about the making of the atomic bomb would debut on the same day as Barbie.,"Adam Perocchi’s Oppenheimer-inspired reimagining of the Barbie Dreamhouse (image courtesy Adam Perocchi)
She’s Everything. He’s Death, the destroyer of worlds. She’s Mattel. He’s the Manhattan Project.
Directors Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach’s summer blockbuster Barbie (2023) is set to open in theaters on July 21, the same day as Christopher Nolan’s long-anticipated film Oppenheimer (2023), a movie about the development of the atomic bomb. Many theaters across the country are screening these polar opposite movies back-to-back, and the notion of a double feature has the internet in absolute shambles. So what better way to cope than with a deluge of absurdly dark memes?

In the weeks leading up to the dual blockbuster opening, people are preparing for the emotional wreckage that will undoubtedly besiege them from the confluence of these films. Notably, Christopher Nolan told Wired reporters that some early viewers of Oppenheimer (2023) “left the movie absolutely devastated,” which is, you know, super uplifting to hear.

Those who are seeing Oppenheimer (2023) before Barbie (2023) are calling the mash-up “Oppenbarbie,” and those who are wrong and seeing the films in the reverse order are calling it “Barbieheimer.”
This meme from The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent (2022) has yet to get old for me. (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)
Like many others on the internet, I have strong opinions about how theatergoers should spend the day. The following meme is giving “No sleep. Bus. Club. Another club. Another club. Plane. Next place. No sleep”:

The pairing of the two films has led some to make interesting observations of real-world phenomena that could fit the Barbie-Oppenheimer theme — such as this pair of surreal houses:
As they say, art imitates life. Or in this case, life imitates art? I don’t know anymore. (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)
… Or this strange pink cloud that’s either another hazardous “gender reveal” or (hopefully) an incredible PR stunt by the Barbie (2023) marketing team:

,"Christopher Nolan: ""Bittersweet"" to have ""Oppenheimer"" cast leave London premiere amid SAG-AFTRA strike",The film is scheduled to be released in theaters on Friday.,"During the London premiere of the highly anticipated film ""Oppenheimer,"" some stars left early to join the picket lines in support of the SAG-AFTRA strike.
""It was very bittersweet to have the actors there supporting the film, and then understanding that they needed to then leave and go on strike,"" the film's writer and director, Christopher Nolan, told ""CBS Mornings"" in an interview that aired on Thursday.
Nolan emphasized the significance of the actors' strike and a parallel one held by the Writers Guild of America since May.
""It's an important moment,"" he said. ""It's a kind of moment that comes along every few decades.""
As a writer, Nolan has been on strike for over two months and hopes the movement will compel companies to promptly reassess their deal structures. The strikes largely focus on issues related to financial compensation amid disputes with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), a trade association that represents companies including Paramount Studios, which has the same parent company as CBS News.
Nolan is known for films including ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Dunkirk"" and ""Interstellar."" His latest creation, ""Oppenheimer,"" has been described as his most impressive yet. It is scheduled to be released in theaters on Friday.
The film delves into the life of famed physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who oversaw the development of the first atomic bomb during World War II. One notable aspect of the movie is its commitment to authenticity. Nolan said he avoided relying on computer-generated imagery to create a textured and real atmosphere. The film uses old-school methods and practical effects to heighten the immersive experience for viewers, especially during pivotal moments like the depiction of the Trinity nuclear test, which was the first detonation of a nuclear weapon and took place in 1945.
""We knew the Trinity test had to be the showstopper. It's the key thing in the film. It had to have incredible beauty and incredible threat. It's difficult to make computer graphics threatening,"" he said.
Nolan said the film highlights a cautionary tale, reflecting on Oppenheimer's public acclaim as the father of the bomb, while also recognizing the turmoil he faced due to the changed world and the ongoing threat of nuclear weapons.
In an emotional scene, Oppenheimer envisions the potential horrors of future nuclear explosions, portrayed through the face of Nolan's own daughter.
""For me, yes, it was about looking to people you love, looking to the things that you love, the world around you that you love and value and imagining the destructive force of these weapons,"" said Nolan.
Some CBS News staff are SAG-AFTRA or Writers Guild members. But their contracts are not affected by the strikes.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc2FnLWFmdHJhLXN0cmlrZS_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1zYWctYWZ0cmEtc3RyaWtlLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-03 16:00:46-04:00,"Barbenheimer Explained: Yes, People Really Are Making Oppenheimer & Barbie a Double Feature","You can see Oppenheimer or Barbie on July 21...or, as viral ""Barbenheimer"" buzz suggests, you could just see both movies back to back.","When you think of pink, is it the fun cotton-candy kind that colors the sunset over Barbie’s Malibu skies? Or is it the hue that glows like a haunting pall over the blasted aftermath of a nuclear-devastated landscape?
For moviegoers this month, that won’t just be a fanciful mental exercise. Both Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer are opening in theaters on the same July day — the former about Mattel’s California-cool toy doll come to life, the latter about the conflicted physicist who helped usher in the age of atomic warfare.

Obviously, the two movies couldn’t be more different. Starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (as Ken), Barbie brings the toy icon’s happy-go-lucky fluff to the same box office as Nolan’s gravely serious (and cinematically epic) nuclear spectacle in Oppenheimer, with each film expected to do blockbuster numbers as audiences pick their summertime movie flavor. But instead of showing up to the theater to see just one, fans are buzzing online over a novel concept in moviegoing: Why not ride the whole thematic roller coaster all at once and just watch Oppenheimer and Barbie back to back... at the same theater... and on the same day?
The Latest Craze in Moviegoing: Barbenheimer

Memes celebrating the chance to do just that are spilling across social media, as fans hyped by the idea of an Oppenheimer / Barbie movie mash-up have begun to cheekily tout the striking contrast between the two films. As The New York Times reports, the audience thirst for such a high-contrast double feature isn’t just a niche thing, either. Searching online for “Barbenheimer T-shirt,” the paper notes, “brings tens of thousands of results, and sellers on Etsy have designed their own versions” — some of which playfully juxtapose the bubbly pink “Barbie” logo with the sinister imagery of an expanding mushroom cloud.
That’s the sort of fan-powered viral marketing that no studio can buy (or even really plan for), and it’s created a rising-tide environment of buzz ahead of the two films’ July 21 release. “They’re so vastly different,” film industry analyst Robert Mitchell told NYT, “that they allow for the narrative that popped up organically: This would be strangest double bill ever” — an attention-stealing concept, he added, that’s “pretty much a gift for distributors.”

As anyone who's spent recent time on the entertainment-oriented side of social media knows, a lot of folks are tweaking their schedules to arrange an Oppenheimer and Barbie double-feature date. The real question, though, is in the details: Do you start off the day with Oppenheimer’s weighty themes and then shift over into pink fantasy mode with Barbie? Or Do you treat Barbie more like a high-calorie appetizer that you mindlessly munch on ahead of the IMAX-worthy Oppenheimer main course?

2023-07-28 04:04:01+00:00,Cillian Murphy Was Also Considered For Oppenheimer Role In TV Series,The TV series 'Manhattan' considered casting Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer,"If you’re making a production with J. Robert Oppenheimer in it, your casting call is likely to include Cillian Murphy.
As it turns out, Murphy — who plays the title role in Universal’s film box office hit — was also considered to play Oppenheimer in a short-lived TV series.
Manhattan, a show on WGN America nine years ago, was set in the Los Alamos, N.M. efforts to develop an atomic bomb. The series primarily centered on Frank Winter (played by John Benjamin Hickey), a physics professor leading the Manhattan Project.
J. Robert Oppenheimer appeared during the first season and in beefed up appearances in Season 2. But that was the last season for the series.
“When we were casting Oppenheimer, we went through a whole series of different ideas,” Lila Byock (The Leftovers), a writer on Manhattan and the wife of series creator Sam Shaw (Castle Rock), told Vanity Fair.
Showrunner Shaw added, “We wanted Oppenheimer to feel both like he possessed a certain undeniable charisma, a presence onstage, but also that he was playing a different instrument. He needed to feel alien, or other, in some ways.” He revealed, “Cillian Murphy was on that list.”
“It still smarts that we didn’t get to tell the story in its fullness as we had hoped,” Shaw laments.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktd2FzLWFsc28tY29uc2lkZXJlZC1mb3Itb3BwZW5oZWltZXItcm9sZS1pbi1ub3ctY2FuY2VsZWQtdHYtc2VyaWVzLTEyMzU0NTAxNDYv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy9jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS13YXMtYWxzby1jb25zaWRlcmVkLWZvci1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1yb2xlLWluLW5vdy1jYW5jZWxlZC10di1zZXJpZXMtMTIzNTQ1MDE0Ni9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-24 18:00:00+00:00,Kodak Had to Engineer Brand-New 65mm Film Stock for the Black-and-White ‘Oppenheimer’ Sequences,Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema ventured into uncharted territory with the large-format IMAX camera to explore the landscape of faces.,"Given the historical and psychological complexity of “Oppenheimer” — the biopic thriller about physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the “father of the atomic bomb” — director Christopher Nolan and go-to cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema ventured into uncharted territory with the large-format IMAX camera to explore the landscape of faces. Specifically, the faces of Oppenheimer and Admiral Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a major figure in the development of nuclear weapons during the Cold War.
To help achieve a more intimate spectacle, redefining portraits and close-ups for 70mm IMAX, Nolan divided the film into separate perspectives and timelines: He called Oppenheimer’s “Fission” (in color) and Strauss’ “Fusion” (in black-and-white), in keeping with the quantum physics theme.
“This was a three-hour-long movie about faces,” van Hoytema told IndieWire. “And our challenge was to be able to get closer with the camera to make those faces become our landscape, and to make those faces interesting enough for the audience to become captivated by them.”
However, shooting close-ups in IMAX was harder, technically, than capturing the vistas of Los Alamos, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer oversaw the creation of the atomic bomb as part of The Manhattan Project. Van Hoytema usually relied on tight 80mm lenses for close-ups, but he needed to get closer than 6 feet for greater intimacy. With no available lenses, Panavision lens specialist Dan Sasak supplied and adapted Hasselblad, Panavision Sphero 65, and Panavision System 65 lenses for “Oppenheimer.”
Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy on the set of “Oppenheimer”
As with “Dunkirk” and “Tenet,” though, it was impractical to shoot entirely in 65mm IMAX, given the noisy camera and the dialogue-driven nature of “Oppenheimer.” Van Hoytema shot with the IMAX MKIV, IMAX MSM 9802, and Panavision Panaflex System 65 Studio cameras. But he shot IMAX whenever possible for optimal resolution and immersion. The film is playing in a record number of 70mm IMAX theaters: 30 worldwide, including 19 in the U.S. and six in Canada.
Kodak supplied 65mm film for the 15-perf IMAX and 5-perf Panavision cameras: 250D (5207) and 500T (5219) color negative and Double-X (5222) black-and-white negative. Yet large-format black-and-white film was a first for Kodak — and how they finished it for use in the IMAX camera was a challenge. This required a partnership between Kodak/FotoKem/IMAX and Panavision to support the 65mm black-and-white workflow.
Apart from a few surreal moments imagined by Oppenheimer, van Hoytema went for period naturalism in conveying the contrasting personalities and emotions of Oppenheimer and Strauss. Dramatically, the film pitted the celebrated and controversial physicist, burdened with becoming Prometheus incarnate for his weapon of mass destruction, against a rising star of the industrial/military complex seized by ambitions of power and glory. What extraordinary performances and iconic faces van Hoytema had to work with.
“Oppenheimer” Universal
“The actors, of course, make my life a lot easier,” he said. “I’m not asked to make something magically work. They’re very much film actors and they honed their performances. They have a very good understanding of that intimacy and what the camera sees.”
Referencing large portrait photography was essential for van Hoytema. “There was definitely creative latitude, but you’re portraiting what could play in the head of your main character,” he added. “You have to be very much character driven but almost impure towards your characters.”
Photographing in black-and-white, though, required more control with lighting. Fortunately, van Hoytema relied on what he learned about the process as a student at the Łódź Film School in Poland. “It’s raw and it very quickly looks concept-y and aesthetical,” he said. “The reason for the black-and-white was very much a way of separating those two narratives, so that on an intuitive level you could easily jump from one to the other. In a way, we had already done that with the blue and the red color coding in ‘Tenet.’ Black-and-white seemed a very obvious way to do it in this film.”
“Oppenheimer”
But 65mm black-and-white didn’t exist, so the director and cinematographer asked Kodak if they would be able to produce it. “After months and months of trial and error,” said van Hoytelma, “they came back with several cans that had handwritten labels that we then could run through our cameras. We thought this was gonna be the end of our engineering and we were gonna ask them to produce enough film for us.
“But then we had to figure out the cameras,” he continued. “They don’t run the film through as they shoot because the emulsion is different and the backing of the film is different. So Panavision and IMAX had to re-engineer the cameras, especially the pressure plates. And FotoKem, the lab, had to come up with all kinds of different things, and the planning, and the infrastructure. When could we do black-and-white and when could we do color, and how are we going to plan our shoot around what we can achieve in the lab?”
Aside from the vast landscape of Los Alamos, where Oppenheimer felt most at home, the locations consisted of small spaces, which often became a psychological pressure cooker for the physicist. “They all represent different moments of his life, different moments in his development, different states of emotionality,” the cinematographer said. “So that is something that we were very enslaved to with the camera.”

There are unforgettable IMAX close-ups throughout, including Oppenheimer observing the successful Trinity atomic blast and the sense of horror during his celebratory address in the Los Alamos gym after the Japanese surrender. This is when he imagines the radioactive fallout from the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. For this, van Hoytema was able to leverage the power and controllability of LED tech along with back projection with the help of VFX to manipulate the image so that it gradually vibrated as the scene progressed.
Strauss, who battled his own demons, expresses dread in a close-up while driving in a car on the way to a meeting about the Soviet nuclear threat with Oppenheimer and the Atomic Energy Commission. “It’s about lightness and darkness and your contrast is a little higher, and you have to overcome that a little bit by sometimes lighting it more aggressively,” van Hoytema said.
But the most sublime Oppenheimer close-up, beside the lake at Princeton, was also one of the hardest. “You do a shot like that and everybody feels the weight,” said van Hoytema. “We tried some different things. I worked with some bounces, I moved some negative around, and somehow all our feelings culminate and all our working together shake hands at that moment.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvY3JhZnQvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY2luZW1hdG9ncmFwaHktaW1heC1ob3l0ZS12YW4taG95dGVtYS0xMjM0ODg2ODkzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-07-15 23:25:28+00:00,Christopher Nolan Warns of ‘Terrifying Possibilities’ as AI Reaches ‘Oppenheimer Moment’: ‘We Have to Hold People Accountable’,"After a screening of ""Oppenheimer,"" director Christopher Nolan offered warnings about artificial intelligence technology.","Christopher Nolan expressed caution about artificial intelligence after a special screening of “Oppenheimer,” drawing a comparison between the rapidly developing technology and his new dramatic feature about the creation of the atomic bomb.
Nolan’s remarks came during a conversation following a preview screening of “Oppenheimer” in New York. Moderated by “Meet the Press” anchor Chuck Todd, the panel included Nolan, as well as Los Alamos National Laboratory director Dr. Thom Mason, physicists Dr. Carlo Rovelli and Dr. Kip Thorne, plus author Kai Bird, who co-wrote “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” which Nolan’s film is based on.
“The rise of companies in the last 15 years bandying words like algorithm — not knowing what they mean in any kind of meaningful, mathematical sense — these guys don’t know what an algorithm is,” Nolan shared at the screening. “People in my business talking about it, they just don’t want to take responsibility for whatever that algorithm does.”
“Applied to AI, that’s a terrifying possibility. Terrifying,” Nolan continued. “Not least because, AI systems will go into defensive infrastructure ultimately. They’ll be in charge of nuclear weapons. To say that that is a separate entity from the person wielding, programming, putting that AI to use, then we’re doomed. It has to be about accountability. We have to hold people accountable for what they do with the tools that they have.”
Nolan’s new feature retells how J. Robert Oppenheimer was tapped by U.S. military powers to develop the atomic bomb during World War II. Cillian Murphy plays the theoretical physicist, leading a cast that includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr. and Florence Pugh.
Nolan’s comments come as the entertainment industry is at a near-complete halt, with SAG-AFTRA ordering a strike on Thursday to join WGA members on the picket lines. Among numerous other disagreements with studios, a primary issue for both unions is the matter of AI and its potential existential impact on labor practices in the entertainment industry.
“With the labor disputes going on in Hollywood right now, a lot of it — when we talk about AI, when we talk about these issues — they’re all ultimately born from the same thing, which is when you innovate with technology, you have to maintain accountability,” Nolan stated.
“Do you think we’ll keep re-examining Oppenheimer? As our understanding of quantum physics continues, as our taming of the atom continues,” Todd asked at one point in the panel.
“I hope so,” Nolan stated. “When I talk to the leading researchers in the field of AI right now, for example, they literally refer to this — right now — as their Oppenheimer moment. They’re looking to history to say, ‘What are the responsibilities for scientists developing new technologies that may have unintended consequences?'”
“Do you think Silicon Valley is thinking that right now?” Todd interjected. “Do you think they say that this is an Oppenheimer moment?”
“They say that they do,” Nolan said after a pause and then chuckled. “It’s helpful that that’s in the conversation and I hope that that thought process will continue. I am not saying Oppenheimer’s story offers any easy answers to those questions, but it at least can show where some of those responsibilities lie and how people take a breath and think, ‘Okay, what is the accountability?'”
In a piece published by the New York Times in May, AI pioneer Dr. Geoffrey Hinton expressed regret regarding his life work. Hinton’s work at the University of Toronto laid the groundwork for the tech industry’s investment in generative artificial intelligence, which powers chatbots such as ChatGPT.
“I console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn’t done it, somebody else would have,” Dr. Hinton told the Times. “It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things.”

7/14/2023 0:00,Who was Oppenheimer? What to know about Christopher Nolan’s new film,"Temple University professors Alan McPherson and Bernd Surrow discuss the mysterious subject of Christopher Nolan’s newest film, ""Oppenheimer.""","Award-winning filmmaker Christopher Nolan is poised to once again leave moviegoers thrilled, entertained and scrambling to Google explanations about his latest film Oppenheimer, which releases in theaters on July 21. The film stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb” who led the United States’ development of the first nuclear weapons during World War II. Alongside Murphy is a star-studded cast that includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr. and Florence Pugh.
Nolan’s films are famous for their twists and turns, complex plots and puzzling characters, and from the sounds of early reviews Oppenheimer will be no different. The nuclear weapons Oppenheimer developed through the Manhattan Project famously helped bring World War II to an end. Weapons capable of such devastation, evident following the 1945 bombing of Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki, have not been used in war since. Yet there remain plenty of questions about these weapons and the man who helped develop them.
Alan McPherson, professor of history and director of the College of Liberal Arts’ Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy, answers some of the biggest questions about Oppenheimer. Bernd Surrow, professor of physics and senior associate dean at the College of Science and Technology, discusses atomic bombs and the way Oppenheimer and his team developed them.
Key takeaways
Known as the “father of the atomic bomb,” Oppenheimer was a theoretical physicist, and in 1942 he became the top scientist in charge of developing the atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project.
To develop the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer and his team found a way to bombard neutrons with plutonium and uranium that caused a nuclear fission reaction. During a nuclear fission reaction, the heavy plutonium or uranium nucleus splits into smaller nuclei while releasing energy and other neutrons. Those neutrons can split other nuclei and release more neutrons causing a chain reaction. This chain reaction, when unchecked, can lead to an atomic bomb.
Though he never received the Nobel Prize for his work, Oppenheimer did receive the Medal for Merit in 1946 and the Enrico Fermi Award in 1963.
What exactly did Oppenheimer do?
Oppenheimer was a theoretical physicist and the top scientist in charge of developing the atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project, which was a World War II-era government project to develop a nuclear weapon before the Germans. He was responsible for the team that researched and designed the bomb. This is why he’s known as the “father of the atomic bomb.” His formal role was director of the Los Alamos Laboratory.
–Alan McPherson
How did Oppenheimer feel about the atomic bomb?
Oppenheimer saw developing the bomb as a necessary evil. He took the job of top scientist for the Manhattan Project armed with the knowledge that such a weapon would almost certainly be used against the Germans or the Japanese. The son of German Jews, Oppenheimer would have preferred the bomb be ready earlier so that it could be used against the Nazis, but he still understood that his government would use it against Japan.
Once he witnessed the test detonation in person, Oppenheimer famously quoted the Bhagavad Gita: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” The devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki weeks later only increased his concern. Oppenheimer had an interest in communism during the 1930s, so he anticipated how this weapon, and especially the development of a more powerful hydrogen or “super” bomb, would intensify the confrontation with the Soviet Union and, perhaps, cause a civilization-ending war.
–Alan McPherson
What is the difference between a nuclear bomb and an atomic bomb?
Atomic bomb and nuclear bomb are actually synonyms. The more accurate term is nuclear bomb, since the physical process takes place not in the atomic shell, but in the atomic nucleus.
There are, however, two types of atomic bombs—a fusion bomb and a fission bomb. The type of atomic bomb developed by Oppenheimer was a fission bomb, which is named for the nuclear fission reaction that was discovered by Germans Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938. The Manhattan Project produced and used two different fission bombs, which were code-named Little Boy and Fat Man. Little Boy was a uranium-based bomb that was dropped over Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6, 1945, and Fat Man was a plutonium-based bomb that was dropped over Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945.
–Bernd Surrow
How did Oppenheimer create the atomic bomb?
To develop the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer and his team needed to bombard neutrons with an element that can undergo nuclear fission, in this case plutonium or uranium. A large part of the development process involved producing enough plutonium and uranium-235, a uranium isotope, to create the weapons.
Once the elements were acquired, Oppenheimer’s team bombarded neutrons with plutonium or uranium-235 to begin the nuclear fission reaction. During a nuclear fission reaction, the heavy plutonium or uranium nucleus splits into smaller nuclei while releasing energy and other neutrons. Those neutrons can split other nuclei and release more neutrons causing a chain reaction. If left unchecked, this chain reaction can create an atomic bomb.
–Bernd Surrow
Where did Oppenheimer test the atomic bomb?
Trinity, the name of the test detonation for the atomic bomb, took place in an area near Alamogordo, New Mexico, now known as the White Sands Missile Range. The test site was about 200 miles south of the Los Alamos Laboratory that Oppenheimer directed.
It is important to note, however, that more than 30 sites across the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada were involved in research and production as part of the Manhattan Project. These sites included Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the Hanford Site in Washington state and Los Alamos Laboratory.
–Bernd Surrow
Did the Oppenheimer movie use a real atomic bomb for the detonation scene?
I categorically say no. Using a real atomic bomb would have severe domestic and political implications, which the U.S. government wouldn’t risk. More likely, the film used a combination of conventional explosives and video editing.
–Bernd Surrow
Did Oppenheimer win a Nobel Prize?
Oppenheimer was never awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on the Manhattan Project. However, he was awarded a Medal for Merit in 1946, and in 1963 he was given the Enrico Fermi Award, awarded to scientists of international stature for their lifetime achievement in the development, use or production of energy.
–Bernd Surrow
What happened to Oppenheimer after the atomic bomb?
After the war, Oppenheimer worked as an advisor for the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) where he lobbied for arms control. In 1947, he became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, where Einstein had also worked. It’s a center that still exists and gathers scholars from every field to share research. McCarthyite politicians suspected Oppenheimer of disloyalty because of his political opinions, due to his communist leanings, and in 1954 the AEC stripped him of his security clearance. This decision was vacated in December 2022 by the Department of Energy, successor to the AEC. In her official statement, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm deemed the 1954 AEC decision biased, unfair and flawed.

After 1954, Oppenheimer continued lecturing around the world and eventually helped establish the World Academy of Art and Science. It’s important to understand that while the U.S. government shunned Oppenheimer during the Red Scare, the world of science, whether in the United States or abroad, always recognized Oppenheimer’s contributions to developing the bomb and trying to limit its spread.

A Neolithic farming community from 6,500 years ago in modern-day France was mostly one big family. DNA analysis of 94 individuals found at a burial site revealed that two-thirds were members of a single family that spanned seven generations. No half-siblings were uncovered, suggesting that monogamy was standard. And most adult women were not closely related to others in the group, which indicates that male descendants tended to stay put, whereas women moved around.

“All in all, a really good job,” says atomic-bomb historian Richard Rhodes about Oppenheimer. The film is right in portraying US theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer as both remorseful and proud for his involvement in creating the first nuclear weapons, says Rhodes. He suggests that the portrayal of Oppenheimer’s downfall, after he opposed the hydrogen bomb, is an intentional message to scientists today: standing up in the political arena comes with consequences. Overall, Rhodes says, scientists in the film seem to be the “good guys … which is quite an achievement when you think of what they were working on”.

An important part of Earth's climate system could shut down around the middle of the century, two researchers warn. Collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation could decrease temperatures in northern Europe and increase warming in the tropics. There have been signs that cold water from melting ice sheets has already weakened the current. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that it won’t collapse this century, and other climate scientists say the timing suggested in the new analysis should be taken with a pinch of salt. It’s based on extrapolating data on sea surface temperatures in one region of the Atlantic, which represents “only one part of a highly complex, dynamical system”, says oceanographer Marilena Oltmanns.

Cities must work to provide cooling cover and eliminate the ‘shade deserts’ that disproportionately affect low-income communities, argue three urban-geography and climate researchers. Shade is one of the most efficient and cost-effective ways to reduce heat-related health risks outdoors. And it’s simple to create with trees, buildings, canopies, shade sails, awnings and walls — but it is “frequently overlooked in urban planning and climate-change mitigation strategies,” the trio writes.

Large language models (LLMs), a type of artificial intelligence (AI), can write poetry, code and pass tough exams. Often, the precise reasons why they behave the way they do are not known — even to their own creators. “Revealing their true nature is urgent and important,” argues a Nature editorial. To really assess LLMs’ abilities and limitations, researchers need to understand how they work and find new ways of testing them. “Similar to the processes that medicines go through to attain approval as treatments and to uncover possible side effects, assessments of AI systems could allow them to be deemed safe for certain applications,” the editorial suggests.

2023-07-16 10:45:28+00:00,At the heart of the film ‘Oppenheimer’ is a clash between real-life Jews,,"(JTA) — In 1945 physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer was a national hero, hailed as the “father of the atomic bomb” and the man who ended World War II.
Less than a decade later, he was a pariah, after the United States Atomic Energy Commission revoked his security clearance following allegations about his left-leaning politics at the height of the anti-communist McCarthy era.
Christopher Nolan’s biopic, “Oppenheimer,” which opens in theaters on July 21, will star Irish actor Cillian Murphy as the famous scientist. But it will also feature Robert Downey Jr. as a lesser known real-life character, Lewis Strauss (pronounced “Straws”), the chairman of the AEC and one of Oppenheimer’s chief inquisitors.
The clash between the scientist and the bureaucrat was a matter of personalities, politics and the hydrogen bomb (Strauss supported it, Oppenheimer was opposed). But according to amateur historian Jack Shlachter, the two represented opposites in another important way: as Jews. Shlachter has researched how Oppenheimer’s assimilated Jewish background and Strauss’ strong attachment to Jewish affairs set them up for conflict as men who represented two very different reactions to the pressures of acculturation and prejudice in the mid-20th century.
Shlachter is in a unique position to explore the Jewish backstory of Oppenheimer: A physicist, he worked for more than 30 years at Los Alamos National Laboratory, the New Mexico complex where Oppenheimer led the Manhattan Project that developed the bomb. Shlachter is also a rabbi, ordained in 1995, who leads HaMakom, a congregation in Santa Fe, New Mexico, as well as the Los Alamos Jewish Center.
“A hero of American science, [Oppenheimer] lived out his life a broken man and died in 1967 at the age of 62,” The New York Times wrote last December, after the secretary of energy nullified the 1954 decision to revoke Oppenheimer’s security clearance. Lewis Strauss died in 1974 at age 77; his funeral was held at New York’s Congregation Emanu-El, where he had been president from 1938 to 1948.
When I asked Shlachter what drew him to the story of Oppenheimer and Strauss, he told me, “At this later stage of my life, I realized that things are not black and white. The common narrative that I think I have heard in town puts Oppenheimer at 100 and Strauss at zero. I just tried to balance that a little bit, and I thought that their Jewishness was one way to see that there’s some nuance in the relationship.”
Our conversation was edited for length and clarity.
There has been a lot of talk about Oppenheimer in anticipation of the Christopher Nolan film, but I haven’t seen much on his Jewish background. I guess as a rabbi and a physicist at Los Alamos this was a subject you couldn’t resist.
I am speaking as a private citizen, not on behalf of Los Alamos National Laboratory or anything like that. Oppenheimer was the first director of what is now Los Alamos National Laboratory. He was the scientific leader of the Manhattan Project. And it was really his doing that the laboratory ended up in northern New Mexico. He has been out here as a late teen and really fell in love with the desert Southwest.
His Jewishness is a bit complicated. His father was an immigrant from Germany in the late 1800s. And his mother was a first-generation American but her parents had emigrated to the United States. And in their approach to religion, they became enamored with the Ethical Culture Society of Felix Adler.
That’s the non-sectarian movement that had roots in Reform Judaism and is based on the idea that morality does not need to be grounded in religious or philosophical dogma.
Correct. Samuel Adler, Felix’s father, was brought over from Germany to serve as the rabbi of New York’s Temple Emanu-El, then and now a major Reform synagogue. They sent Felix back to Germany to study and he got his PhD in Heidelberg, and the plan had been for Felix Adler to succeed his father at some point. He came back in his 20s and gave what was his first and last sermon at Temple Emanu-El. He had adopted and absorbed some ideas while he was in Germany that were completely anathema to the Reform community, and he spun off the Ethical Culture Society.
Julius Oppenheimer, Robert’s father, was a trustee of the Ethical Culture Society, and Felix Adler conducted the wedding ceremony of Julius to Ella Oppenheimer, Robert’s mother. J. Robert Oppenheimer was educated at the Ethical Culture school. It was supposed to be non-religious and yet it was clearly dominated by Jews. It was one of these things about being American through and through, and somehow not having Judaism stand in the way. I think that really shaped Oppenheimer’s approach to Judaism.
Was there an ethos that he might have absorbed from the Ethical Cultural school that would have been important either in his left-wing politics or in his approach to the Manhattan Project?
My suspicion is yes, because Felix Adler in his training in Germany had become quite interested in Karl Marx and in the plight of the working class, and it seems impossible to me that that didn’t get somehow transmitted at the Ethical Culture school. It does not surprise me that Oppenheimer’s politics were left leaning.
As an adult, did Oppenheimer ever talk about his Judaism publicly or explain what his connection was to either the people or the faith?
Almost not at all, although there are some quite interesting quotes from other people. The Nobel laureate physicist Isidor Isaac Rabi and Oppenheimer were quite close, and Rabi testified on Oppenheimer’s behalf at the security hearing in 1954. According to Ray Monk’s massive biography of Oppenheimer, Rabb says that “what prevented Oppenheimer from being fully integrated was his denial of a centrally important part of himself: his Jewishness.” And Felix Bloch, who was another Jewish physicist who went on to win the Nobel Prize, said that Oppenheimer tried to act as if he were not a Jew, and succeeded because he was a good actor. You know, when you can’t integrate yourself and you’re trying to distance yourself from your roots, you can become conflicted. That’s Rabi’s assessment of Oppenheimer’s connection to Judaism.
But you also found a few instances of Oppenheimer positively engaging with Jews and Judaism.
In 1934, when Oppenheimer was a professor at Berkeley, he earmarked 3% of his salary for two years to help Jewish scientists emigrate from Germany. I think the fact that they were scientists was the important thing, and of course they were Jewish, because they’re the ones who were trying to get out in 1934. I don’t know that he was doing this because they were Jews or because they were scientists. Supposedly, Oppenheimer sponsored his aunt and cousin to emigrate from Germany, and then he continued to assist them after they came to the United States.
And then in 1954, at the security clearance hearing, Oppenheimer said that starting in late 1936, he developed “a continuing, smoldering fury about the treatment of Jews in Germany.” I don’t know if you had gone back to 1936 that you would have found any evidence of him saying that at the time. I doubt it. But one thing to remember is that in Oppenheimer’s lifetime, antisemitism was not non-existent. Antisemitism shaped how people dealt with their Judaism and this was the way he dealt with it.
So fast forward, Oppenheimer grew up well-to-do in New York and was educated at Harvard and then in Europe, where he studied physics at the University of Cambridge and the University of Göttingen. He joins the staff at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley, and he begins socializing with leftist professors — both communists and so-called fellow travelers, deeply involved in workers’ rights and supporting the anti-fascists in the Spanish Civil War — in ways that are going to come back to haunt him in the 1950s. In the “American Prometheus” biography, which Nolan’s film is based on, we learn that Oppenheimer’s political activities came to the attention of the FBI at this point, years before his work on the atom bomb project.
That’s correct. He clearly had sympathy for those causes. And I would say understandably. There was a depression going on in this country, and the workers’ condition was not perfect.
There are now historians who are claiming Oppenheimer really was a card-carrying communist despite his denials. He certainly was a fellow traveler, his brother Frank was clearly a card-carrying communist as was Robert’s future wife Kitty.
In 1942 Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Grove was appointed director of what became known as the Manhattan Project, and selected Oppenheimer to head the project’s secret weapons laboratory.
Groves and Oppenheimer seem to have a chemistry which was critical for the success of the project. Why Groves figured that Oppenheimer was the guy to lead it is a little bit of a mystery. Oppenheimer had not led anything even remotely like this. He was a theoretical physicist, and you’re talking about huge experimental facilities for the project. And he wasn’t yet 40. But Oppenheimer rose to the occasion.
You mentioned earlier what Oppenheimer later described as his “smoldering fury” over the Nazis treatment of the Jews. Did working on a bomb to defeat Nazi Germany assuage whatever pangs of conscience he might have had over developing a bomb of such massive destructive potential?
I do think so. And that was probably true for many of the scientists who worked on the project, many of whom were Jewish. There was also a suspicion that the Nazis were working on a bomb as well and then God forbid that they should get there first. I think that was really the driver.
I’vre read that Oppenheimer did not feel guilt over his contribution to developing nuclear weapons or the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki but he did feel a sense of responsibility for what had been unleashed.
Oppenheimer realized that a lot of people lost their lives as a result of this. But I will tell you, my father was a GI during World War II, he enlisted in 1943 and fought until ’45. He was in Europe when V.E. Day came, and then came back to the United States for leave before he was going to be shipped out to the Pacific. And my father was convinced to his dying day that the bomb saved his life [by ending the war with Japan]. And, you know, that was a widespread sentiment.
After the war, Oppenheimer ends up in Princeton directing the famous Institute for Advanced Study and that’s going to bring him into the crosshairs of Lewis Strauss. Tell us who he is and how these two Jewish figures contrasted.
Three of Strauss’ four grandparents emigrated from Germany/Austria, probably in the 1830s, 1840s. Somebody ended up in Virginia and Strauss grew up in the South. His connection to Judaism is quite different from Oppenheimer’s. Strauss was a valedictorian of his high school and in his autobiography says that he was absolutely fascinated by physics. But the family had no money so rather than go to college Strauss became a traveling shoe salesman. And even though merchants he sold to would be closed on Sunday, he insisted on [also] taking Saturday off because of his Judaism, and he took the financial hit. He ended up volunteering to work for Herbert Hoover, the future Republican president, who was organizing European relief efforts after World War I. Hoover becomes a lifelong friend, advocate and supporter. Strauss managed to push Hoover — no friend to the Jews — to lodge a formal complaint when some Jews were slaughtered by the Poles.
He had a pretty meteoric rise. He gets connected to the Kuhn, Loeb investment firm, marries the daughter of one of the partners and he makes money hand over fist. But he stayed connected with his Judaism through all this, eventually becoming the president of Temple Emanu-El for 10 years from 1938 to 1948. So just like there are political differences between Oppenheimer and Strauss, there are religious differences: Oppenheimer grows up in the Felix Adler breakaway and Strauss is mainstream Reform Judaism.
Strauss was a trustee of the Institute for Advanced Studies when it hired Oppenheimer. What else came between the two men? I’ve read that Strauss was a proponent of the hydrogen bomb, and Robert Oppenheimer was hesitant because he felt the astronomically greater power of the H-bomb was not necessary.
The H-bomb was physicist Edward Teller’s idea — he called it “the super” — and Oppenheimer appropriately sidelined Teller at Los Alamos, saying “this is a distraction from what we’re trying to accomplish.”
The animosity between Strauss and Oppenheimer had probably several different dimensions. But I think Strauss also had to navigate being Jewish in an American society that didn’t totally embrace Jews, and I think it was somewhat of a threat to him to have somebody like Oppenheimer whose approach to dealing with his Judaism was to hide it, basically. Here’s Strauss, you know, president of Temple Emanu-El, he’s clearly not hiding that he’s Jewish, and he’s trying to survive and thrive in a Washington establishment that’s not so embracing of Judaism. So that was another dimension. I’d even read that Strauss was offended by Oppenheimer’s alleged marital infidelity.
The animosity also includes the fact that Oppenheimer could be mean. Generally, people who worked at the laboratory loved him, but he could also be mean, and he made Strauss feel like a fool in a public hearing in 1949 — sort of like, “You’re an amateur physicist. You don’t know what you’re talking about,” and that really cut to the quick.
Whatever the reason, Strauss is not a good enemy to have when he becomes a trustee of the Atomic Energy Commission. It’s Strauss who in 1953 told Oppenheimer that his security clearance had been suspended, and led Oppenheimer to request the hearing that led to his security clearance being revoked.
Strauss was appointed one of the five members of the original Atomic Energy Commission. The chair at the time was David Lilienthal, also Jewish by the way, and there’s a photograph of the five members of the Commission that’s absolutely perfect because there are four people on one side on the left, and one person sort of off by himself on the right — and it’s Strauss who’s off by himself. And there were apparently a few dozen votes of the Commission in its early years, mostly having to do with security matters, where the vote was four to one and Strauss was the lone dissenting voice. He was focused on security and was probably very anti-communist.
I want to shift gears and talk about your background, and how a physicist becomes a rabbi.
I was a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego, and my thesis advisor sent me to Los Alamos for the summer of 1979 to learn a certain piece of physics. My connection to Judaism at that stage in my life was almost nil. I had done the classic sort of Conservative American Jewish upbringing of post-bar mitzvah alienation. When I came to Los Alamos I didn’t know a single person in town, so I thought I could go to the synagogue and meet some people. And because my training was reasonably thorough in the liturgy, I started leading some things at the synagogue while I was here.
Instead of going back to UC San Diego, I ended up continuing my graduate studies at the laboratory and completing my PhD while I was still here, and then got hired as a staff member at the laboratory. And all that time there was a rabbi who was coming up from Santa Fe to Los Alamos, and would teach an adult education class and I got interested. I had the arrogance of a newly minted PhD physicist that if you can learn physics, you can learn anything. So I started doing a lot of self-teaching in Judaism.
And what I discovered, which is my passion in the rabbinate, is that adult Judaism is not taught to kids because kids are kids. And most people reject Judaism like I did because they don’t know that Judaism is much richer than what most people reject. I spent my entire physics career here at the lab and in parallel, as I became more knowledgeable in Judaism, I came to know that I didn’t know anything. Then it turns out that there was a rabbi, Gershon Winkler, who moved to New Mexico and took me on as a private student, and that process led to my private ordination through him.
To pull the threads together, I’m curious how you as a physicist think about your responsibility for the uses of science, and how they mesh or clash with what you are learning in Torah.
I’ll steer your question slightly, if that’s okay. [The medieval Jewish philosopher] Maimonides says clearly that we’re given brains and the ability to do rational thought. Judaism is, it seems to me, inherently compatible with the idea of using your brain to understand how the world works, which is what physics is all about. Physics can help us see the beauty in the universe. And that beauty is part of what we’re given as a responsibility to appreciate in Judaism as well.
But science can also be applied for destructive purposes.
We are in a world that is not perfect. And, you know, there have been wars since time immemorial. Atomic weapons were used to end a war, and that was important. Like I said, my father to his dying day felt that his life was saved because of the atomic bomb, and you know, who’s to say that he was wrong?
In Los Alamos, how does the community process their legacy? Is it one of unmitigated pride or is it always leavened by regret about the destructive forces that were unleashed?
I think Oppenheimer is generally viewed very positively. What happened in Los Alamos was an important part of the history of the world. And it’s inspiring to be here at a place where, 80 years ago, there was basically nothing but a small boys’ school.

As the movie Oppenheimer is released, Ben Platts-Mills explores the true story of the enigmatic Manhattan Project scientist, and the atomic bomb that made him a ""destroyer of worlds"".
It was the early hours of 16 July 1945, and Robert Oppenheimer was waiting in a control bunker for a moment that would change the world. Around 10km (6 miles) away, the world's first atomic bomb test, codenamed ""Trinity"", was set to proceed in the pale sands of the Jornada del Muerto desert, in New Mexico.
Oppenheimer was a picture of nervous exhaustion. He was always slender, but after three years as director of ""Project Y"", the scientific arm of the ""Manhattan Engineer District"" that had designed and built the bomb, his weight had dropped to just over 52kg (115lbs). At 5ft 10in (178cm), this made him extremely thin. He'd slept only four hours that night, kept awake by anxiety and his smoker's cough.
That day in 1945 is one of several pivotal moments in Oppenheimer's life described by the historians Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin in their 2005 biography American Prometheus, which provided the basis for the new movie biopic Oppenheimer, released 21 July in the US.
In the final minutes of the countdown, as Bird and Sherwin report, an army general observed Oppenheimer's mood at close-quarters: ""Dr. Oppenheimer... grew tenser as the last seconds ticked off. He scarcely breathed...""
The explosion, when it came, outshone the Sun. With a force matching 21 kilotonnes of TNT, the detonation was the largest ever seen. It created a shockwave that was felt 160km (100 miles) away. As the roar engulfed the landscape and the mushroom cloud rose in the sky, Oppenheimer's expression relaxed into one of ""tremendous relief"". Minutes later, Oppenheimer's friend and colleague Isidor Rabi caught sight of him from a distance: ""I’ll never forget his walk; I’ll never forget the way he stepped out of the car... his walk was like High Noon... this kind of strut. He had done it.""
In interviews conducted in the 1960s, Oppenheimer added a layer of gravitas to his reaction, claiming that, in the moments after the detonation, a line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita, had come into his mind: ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""

In the following days, his friends reported he seemed increasingly depressed. ""Robert got very still and ruminative during that two-week period,"" one recalled, ""because he knew what was about to happen."" One morning he was heard lamenting (in condescending terms) the imminent fate of the Japanese: ""Those poor little people, those poor little people."" But only days later, he was once again nervous, focussed, exacting.
In a meeting with his military counterparts, he seemed to have forgotten all about the ""poor little people"". According to Bird and Sherwin, he was instead fixated on the importance of the right conditions for the bomb drop: ""Of course, they must not drop it in rain or fog… Don’t let them detonate it too high. The figure fixed on is just right. Don’t let it go up [higher] or the target won’t get as much damage."" When he announced the successful bombing of Hiroshima to a crowd of his colleagues less than a month after Trinity, one onlooker noticed the way Oppenheimer ""clasped and pumped his hand over his head like a victorious prizefighter"". The applause ""practically raised the roof"".
The combination of nervous fragility, ambition, grandiosity and morbid gloom are hard to square in a single person
Oppenheimer was the emotional and intellectual heart of the Manhattan Project: more than any other single person he had made the bomb a reality. Jeremy Bernstein, who worked with him after the war, was convinced that nobody else could have done it. As he wrote in his 2004 biography, A Portrait of an Enigma, ""If Oppenheimer had not been the director at Los Alamos, I am persuaded that, for better or worse, the Second World War would have ended... without the use of nuclear weapons.""
The variety of Oppenheimer's reported reactions as he witnessed the fruition of his labours, not to mention the pace with which he moved through them, might seem bewildering. The combination of nervous fragility, ambition, grandiosity and morbid gloom are hard to square in a single person, especially one so instrumental in the very project provoking these responses.
Bird and Sherwin also call Oppenheimer an ""enigma"": ""A theoretical physicist who displayed the charismatic qualities of a great leader, an aesthete who cultivated ambiguities."" A scientist, but also, as another friend once described him ""a first-class manipulator of the imagination"".
Oppenheimer: The movie The movie Oppenheimer, released 21 July in the US, is based on the Pulitzer prize-winning book American Prometheus. Oppenheimer is played by Cillian Murphy. Several other real people are portrayed, such as Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), the general who recruited Oppenheimer, as well as figures from his personal life, including Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), a psychiatrist who he dated in the 1930s, and his wife Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt). Read BBC Culture's review of Oppenheimer and why it is a deserving masterpiece.
By Bird and Sherwin's account, the contradictions in Oppenheimer's character – the qualities that have left both friends and biographers at a loss to explain him – seem to have been present from his earliest years. Born in New York City in 1904, Oppenheimer was the child of first-generation German Jewish immigrants who had become wealthy through the textiles trade. The family home was a large apartment on the Upper West Side with three maids, a chauffeur, and European art on the walls.
Despite this luxurious upbringing, Oppenheimer was recalled as unspoiled and generous by childhood friends. A school friend, Jane Didisheim, remembered him as someone who ""blushed extraordinarily easily"", who was ""very frail, very pink-cheeked, very shy..."", but also ""very brilliant"". ""Very quickly everybody admitted that he was different from all the others and superior,"" she said.
By the age of nine, he was reading philosophy in Greek and Latin, and was obsessed with mineralogy – roaming Central Park and writing letters to the New York Mineralogical Club about what he found. His letters were so competent that the Club mistook him for an adult and invited him to make a presentation. This intellectual nature contributed to a degree of solitude in the young Oppenheimer, write Bird and Sherwin. ""He was usually preoccupied with whatever he was doing or thinking,"" recalled a friend. He was uninterested in conforming to gender expectations – taking no interest in sports or the ""rough and tumble of his age-group"" as his cousin put it; ""He was often teased and ridiculed for not being like other fellows."" But his parents were convinced of his genius.
""I repaid my parents’ confidence in me by developing an unpleasant ego,"" Oppenheimer later commented, ""which I am sure must have affronted both children and adults who were unfortunate enough to come into contact with me."" ""It’s no fun,"" he once told another friend, ""to turn the pages of a book and say, 'yes, yes, of course, I know that'.""
When he left home to study chemistry at Harvard University, the fragility of Oppenheimer's psychological make-up was exposed: his brittle arrogance and thinly-masked sensitivity appearing to serve him poorly. In a letter from 1923, published in a 1980 collection edited by Alice Kimbal Smith and Charles Weiner, he wrote: ""I labour and write innumerable theses, notes, poems, stories and junk… I make stenches in three different labs…I serve tea and talk learnedly to a few lost souls, go off for the weekend to distill low grade energy into laughter and exhaustion, read Greek, commit faux pas, search my desk for letters, and wish I were dead. Voila.""

Subsequent letters collated by Smith and Weiner reveal that the problems continued through his post-graduate studies, in Cambridge, England. His tutor insisted on applied laboratory work, one of Oppenheimer's weaknesses. ""I am having a pretty bad time,"" he wrote in 1925. ""The lab work is a terrible bore, and I am so bad at it that it is impossible to feel that I am learning anything."" Later that year, Oppenheimer's intensity led him close to disaster when he deliberately left an apple, poisoned with laboratory chemicals, on his tutor's desk. His friends later speculated he could have been driven by envy and feelings of inadequacy. The tutor didn't eat the apple but Oppenheimer's place at Cambridge was threatened and he kept it only on condition that he see a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist diagnosed psychosis but then wrote him off, saying that treatment would do no good.
Recalling that period, Oppenheimer would later report that he seriously contemplated suicide over the Christmas holidays. The following year, during a visit to Paris, his close friend Francis Fergusson told him he had proposed to his girlfriend. Oppenheimer responded by attempting to strangle him: ""He jumped on me from behind with a trunk strap,"" Fergusson recalled, ""and wound it around my neck... I managed to pull aside and he fell on the ground weeping.""
It seems that where psychiatry failed Oppenheimer, literature came to the rescue. According to Bird and Sherwin, he read Marcel Proust's A La Recherché du Temps Perdu while on a walking holiday in Corsica, finding in it some reflection of his own state of mind that reassured him and opened a window on a more compassionate mode of being. He learned by heart a passage from the book about ""indifference to the sufferings one causes"", being ""the terrible and permanent form of cruelty"". The question of attitude towards suffering would remain an abiding interest, guiding Oppenheimer's interest in spiritual and philosophical texts throughout his life and eventually playing a significant role in the work that would define his reputation. A comment he made to his friends on this same holiday seems prophetic: ""The kind of person that I admire most would be one who becomes extraordinarily good at doing a lot of things but still maintains a tear-stained countenance.""
The kind of person that I admire most would be one who becomes extraordinarily good at doing a lot of things but still maintains a tear-stained countenance – Oppenheimer
He returned to England in lighter spirits, feeling ""much kinder and more tolerant"", as he later recalled. Early in 1926, he met the director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Göttingen in Germany, who quickly became convinced of Oppenheimer's talents as a theoretician, inviting him to study there. According to Smith and Weiner, he later described 1926 as the year of his ""coming into physics"". It would prove a turning point. He obtained his PhD and a postdoctoral fellowship in the year to follow. He also became part of a community that was driving the development of theoretical physics, meeting scientists who would become life-long friends. Many would ultimately join Oppenheimer at Los Alamos.

Returning to the US, Oppenheimer spent a few months at Harvard before moving to pursue his physics career in California. The tone of his letters from this period reflect a steadier, more generous cast of mind. He wrote to his younger brother about romance, and his ongoing interest in the arts.
At the University of California in Berkeley, he worked closely with experimentalists, interpreting their results on cosmic rays and nuclear disintegration. He later described finding himself ""the only one who understood what this was all about"". The department he eventually created stemmed, he said, from the need to communicate about the theory he loved: ""Explaining first to faculty, staff, and colleagues and then to anyone who would listen ... what had been learned, what the unsolved problems were."" He described himself as a ""difficult"" teacher at first but it was through this role that Oppenheimer honed the charisma and social presence that would carry him during his time at Project Y. Quoted by Smith and Weiner, one colleague recalled how his students ""emulated him as best they could. They copied his gestures, his mannerisms, his intonations. He truly influenced their lives.""
All things which evoke discipline: study, and our duties to men and to the commonwealth, war... ought to be greeted by us with profound gratitude; for only through them can we attain to the least detachment; and only so can we know peace – Oppenheimer
During the early 1930s, as he strengthened his academic career, Oppenheimer continued to moonlight in the humanities. It was during this period that he discovered the Hindu scriptures, learning Sanskrit in order to read the untranslated Bhagavad Gita – the text from which he later drew the famous '""Now I am become Death"" quotation. It seems his interest was not just intellectual, but represented a continuation of the self-prescribed bibliotherapy that had begun with Proust in his 20s. The Bhagavad Gita, a story centred on the war between two arms of an aristocratic family, gave Oppenheimer a philosophical underpinning that was directly applicable to the moral ambiguity he confronted at Project Y. It emphasised ideas of duty, fate and detachment from outcome, emphasising that fear of consequences cannot be used as justification for inaction. In a letter to his brother from 1932, Oppenheimer specifically references the Gita and then names war as one circumstance that might offer the opportunity to put such a philosophy into practice:
""I believe that through discipline... we can achieve serenity... I believe that through discipline we learn to preserve what is essential to our happiness in more and more adverse circumstances... Therefore I think that all things which evoke discipline: study, and our duties to men and to the commonwealth, war... ought to be greeted by us with profound gratitude; for only through them can we attain to the least detachment; and only so can we know peace.""
In the mid 1930s, Oppenheimer also met Jean Tatlock, a psychiatrist and physician with whom he fell in love. By Bird and Sherwin's account, Tatlock's complexity of character equalled Oppenheimer's. She was widely read and driven by a social conscience. She was described by a childhood friend as ""touched with greatness"". Oppenheimer proposed to Tatlock more than once but she turned him down. She is credited with introducing him to radical politics and to the poetry of John Donne. The pair continued to see each other occasionally after Oppenheimer married the biologist Katherine ""Kitty"" Harrison in 1940. Kitty was to join Oppenheimer at Project Y, where she worked as a phlebotomist, researching the dangers of radiation.

In 1939, physicists were far more concerned about the nuclear threat than politicians were and it was a letter from Albert Einstein that first brought the matter to the attention of senior leaders in the US government. The reaction was slow, but alarm continued to circulate in the scientific community and eventually the president was persuaded to act. As one of the preeminent physicists in the country, Oppenheimer was one of several scientists appointed to begin looking more seriously into the potential for nuclear weapons. By September 1942, partly thanks to Oppenheimer's team, it was clear that a bomb was possible and concrete plans for its development started to take shape. According to Bird and Sherwin, when he heard that his name was being floated as a leader for this endeavour, Oppenheimer began his own preparations. ""I’m cutting off every communist connection,"" he said to a friend at the time. ""For if I don’t, the government will find it difficult to use me. I don’t want to let anything interfere with my usefulness to the nation.""
Einstein would later say: ""The trouble with Oppenheimer is that he loves [something that] doesn’t love him – the United States government."" His patriotism and desire to please clearly played a role in his recruitment. General Leslie Groves, the military leader of the Manhattan Engineer District, was the person responsible for finding a scientific director for the bomb project. According to a 2002 biography, Racing for the Bomb, when Groves proposed Oppenheimer as scientific lead, he met with opposition. Oppenheimer's ""extreme liberal background"" was a concern. But as well as noting his talent and his existing knowledge of the science, Groves also pointed out his ""overweening ambition"". The Manhattan Project's chief of security also noticed this: ""I became convinced that not only was he loyal, but that he would let nothing interfere with the successful accomplishment of his task and thus his place in scientific history.""
In the 1988 book The Making of the Atomic Bomb, Oppenheimer's friend Isidor Rabi is quoted as saying he thought it ""a most improbable appointment"", but later conceded it had been ""a real stroke of genius on the part of General Groves"".

At Los Alamos, Oppenheimer applied his contrarian, interdisciplinary convictions as much as anywhere. In his 1979 autobiography, What Little I Remember, the Austrian-born physicist Otto Frisch recalled that Oppenheimer had recruited not only the scientists required but also ""a painter, a philosopher and a few other unlikely characters; he felt that a civilised community would be incomplete without them"".
I became convinced that not only was he loyal, but that he would let nothing interfere with the successful accomplishment of his task and thus his place in scientific history – Manhattan Project chief of security
After the war, Oppenheimer's attitude seemed to change . He described nuclear weapons as instruments ""of aggression, of surprise, and of terror"" and the weapons industry as ""the devil's work"". At a meeting in October 1945, he famously told President Truman: ""I feel I have blood on my hands."" The President later said: ""I told him the blood was on my hands – to let me worry about that.""
The exchange is an arresting echo of one described in Oppenheimer's beloved Bhagavad Gita, between Prince Arjuna and the god Krishna. Arjuna refuses to fight because he believes he will be responsible for the murder of his fellows, but Krishna takes away the burden: ""View in me the active slayer of these men... Arise, on fame, on victory, on kingly joys intent! They are already slain by me; be you the instrument.""
During the development of the bomb, Oppenheimer had used a similar argument to assuage his own and his colleagues' ethical hesitations. He told them that, as scientists, they were not responsible for decisions about how the weapon should be used – only for doing their job. The blood, if there was any, would be on the hands of the politicians. However, it seems that once the deed was done, Oppenheimer's confidence in this position was shaken. As Bird and Sherwin relate, in his role at the Atomic Energy Commission during the post-war period, he argued against the development of further weapons, including the more powerful hydrogen bomb, which his work had paved the way for.
These efforts resulted in Oppenheimer being investigated by the US government in 1954 and having his security clearance stripped, marking the end of his involvement with policy work. The academic community came to his defence. Writing for The New Republic in 1955, the philosopher Bertrand Russell commented that the ""investigation made it undeniable that he has committed mistakes, one of them from a security point of view rather grave. But there was no evidence of disloyalty or of anything that could be considered treasonable... The scientists were caught in a tragic dilemma.""
In 1963, the US government presented him with the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation, but it wasn't until 2022, 55 years after his death, that the US government overturned its 1954 decision to strip his clearance, and affirmed Oppenheimer's loyalty.
Throughout the last decades of Oppenheimer's life, he maintained parallel expressions of pride at the technical achievement of the bomb and guilt at its effects. A note of resignation also entered his commentary, with him saying more than once that the bomb had simply been inevitable. He spent the last 20 years of his life as director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, working alongside Einstein and other physicists.

As at Los Alamos, he made a point of promoting interdisciplinary work and emphasised in his speeches the belief that science needed the humanities in order to better understand its own implications, write Bird and Sherwin. To this end, he recruited a raft of non-scientists including classicists, poets, and psychologists.
He later came to consider atomic energy as a problem that outstripped the intellectual tools of its time, as, in President Truman's words, ""a new force too revolutionary to consider in the framework of old ideas"". In a speech made in 1965, later published in the 1984 collection Uncommon Sense, he said ""I have heard from some of the great men of our time that when they found something startling, they knew it was good, because they were afraid"". When talking about moments of unsettling scientific discovery, he was fond of quoting the poet John Donne: ""Tis all in pieces, all coherence gone.""
You might also be interested in:
John Keats, another poet Oppenheimer enjoyed, coined the phrase ""negative capability"" to describe a common quality in the people he admired: ""that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason."" It seems as though it was something of this that the philosopher Russell was getting at when he wrote of Oppenheimer's ""inability to see things simply, an inability which is not surprising in one possessed of a complex and delicate mental apparatus."" In describing Oppenheimer's contradictions, his mutability, his continual running between poetry and science, his habit of defying simple description, perhaps we are identifying the very qualities that made him capable of pursuing the creation of the bomb.

Even in the midst of this great and terrible pursuit, Oppenheimer kept alive the ""tear stained countenance"" he had foretold in his 20s. The name of the ""Trinity"" test is thought to have come from the John Donne poem Batter my heart, three-person'd God: ""That I may rise and stand, o'erthrow me, and bend/Your force to break, blow, burn, and make me new."" Jean Tatlock, who had introduced him to Donne, and with whom he is thought by some to have remained in love, had committed suicide the year before the test. The bomb project was marked everywhere by Oppenheimer's imagination, and by his sense of romance and tragedy. Perhaps it was overweening ambition that General Groves identified when he interviewed Oppenheimer for the job at Project Y, or perhaps it was his ability to adopt, for the time required, the idea of overweening ambition. As much as it was the result of research, the bomb was the product of Oppenheimer's ability and willingness to imagine himself as the kind of a person that could make it happen.
A chain smoker since adolescence, Oppenheimer suffered bouts of tuberculosis during his life. He died of throat cancer in 1967, at the age of 62. Two years before his death, in a rare moment of simplicity, he drew a distinction that marked out the practice of science from that of poetry. Unlike poetry, he said, ""science is the business of learning not to make the same mistake again"".

NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Oppenheimer Asset Management on Tuesday projected the S&P 500 would rise above its record high by year end, the latest Wall Street firm to grow more bullish on the outlook for stocks following the market's rally this year.
Oppenheimer lifted its year-end price target for the S&P 500 to 4,900 from the 4,400 projection it set in December, Chief Investment Strategist John Stoltzfus said in a note. The new target represents a roughly 7% increase from Monday's closing price for the benchmark index, which has gained 19% this year.
The S&P 500 record closing high is 4,796.56, reached on Jan. 3, 2022, while the index's intraday record is 4,818.62, which it hit on Jan. 4, 2022.
Stoltzfus said his new target stemmed from expectations that U.S. inflation will continue to trend lower, the Federal Reserve's rate-hiking cycle appears closer to ending, and ""capitulation"" by stock market bears ""suggests that money held on the sidelines may flow into stocks in the months ahead.""
""Our appraisal of the market landscape ... suggests that opportunity outweighs risk as current monetary policy generates a transition from a 'free money' environment to an environment with a traditional cost of borrowing,"" Stoltzfus said in the note.
Oppenheimer's more bullish view comes after Citigroup (C.N) recently boosted its S&P 500 price target by 15%, saying the more upbeat view reflected increased probability of an economic soft landing.
Morgan Stanley (MS.N) strategist Michael Wilson late last month acknowledged that ""our more bearish views on the broader US equity market have been wrong this year,"" although the firm's base-case June 2024 price target of 4,200 is about 8.5% below current S&P 500 levels.

,Oppenheimer Offers Us a Fresh Warning of AI’s Danger,The U.S. ignored Oppenheimer’s warnings about nuclear weapons and rushed to build and deploy a dangerous technology. We must not make the same mistake with AI,"American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (far left) points to a picture of the atomic bomb explosion over Nagasaki, Japan, as scientist Henry D. Smyth (second from left), Major General Kenneth D. Nichols (second from right) and scientist Glenn Seaborg (far right) look on in the 1940s.
The U.S. ignored Oppenheimer’s warnings about nuclear weapons and rushed to build and deploy a dangerous technology. We must not make the same mistake with AI
Eighty-one years ago, President Franklin D. Roosevelt tasked the young physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer with setting up a secret laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M. Along with his colleagues, Oppenheimer was tasked with developing the world’s first nuclear weapons under the code name the Manhattan Project. Less than three years later, they succeeded. In 1945 the U.S. dropped these weapons on the residents of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing hundreds of thousands of people.
Oppenheimer became known as “the father of the atomic bomb.” Despite his misplaced satisfaction with his wartime service and technological achievement, he also became vocal about the need to contain this dangerous technology.
But the U.S. didn’t heed his warnings, and geopolitical fear instead won the day. The nation raced to deploy ever more powerful nuclear systems with scant recognition of the immense and disproportionate harm these weapons would cause. Officials also ignored Oppenheimer’s calls for greater international collaboration to regulate nuclear technology.
Oppenheimer’s example holds lessons for us today, too. We must not make the same mistake with artificial intelligence as we made with nuclear weapons.
We are still in the early stages of a promised artificial intelligence revolution. Tech companies are racing to build and deploy AI-powered large language models, such as ChatGPT. Regulators need to keep up.
Though AI promises immense benefits, it has already exposed its potential for harm and abuse. Earlier this year the U.S. surgeon general released a report on the youth mental health crisis. It found that one in three teenage girls considered suicide in 2021. The data are unequivocal: big tech is a big part of the problem. AI will only amplify that manipulation and exploitation. The performance of AI rests on exploitative labor practices, both domestically and internationally. And massive, opaque AI models that are fed problematic data often exacerbate existing biases in society—affecting everything from criminal sentencing and policing to health care, lending, housing and hiring. In addition, the environmental impacts of running such energy-hungry AI models stress already fragile ecosystems reeling from the impacts of climate change.
AI also promises to make potentially perilous technology more accessible to rogue actors. Last year researchers asked a generative AI model to design new chemical weapons. It designed 40,000 potential weapons in six hours. An earlier version of ChatGPT generated bomb-making instructions. And a class exercise at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology recently demonstrated how AI can help create synthetic pathogens, which could potentially ignite the next pandemic. By spreading access to such dangerous information, AI threatens to become the computerized equivalent of an assault weapon or a high-capacity magazine: a vehicle for one rogue person to unleash devastating harm at a magnitude never seen before.
Yet companies and private actors are not the only ones racing to deploy untested AI. We should also be wary of governments pushing to militarize AI. We already have a nuclear launch system precariously perched on mutually assured destruction that gives world leaders just a few minutes to decide whether to launch nuclear weapons in the case of a perceived incoming attack. AI-powered automation of nuclear launch systems could soon remove the practice of having a “human in the loop”—a necessary safeguard to ensure faulty computerized intelligence doesn’t lead to nuclear war, which has come close to happening multiple times already. A military automation race, designed to give decision-makers greater ability to respond in an increasingly complex world, could lead to conflicts spiraling out of control. If countries rush to adopt militarized AI technology, we will all lose.
As in the 1940s, there is a critical window to shape the development of this emerging and potentially dangerous technology. Oppenheimer recognized that the U.S. should work with even its deepest antagonists to internationally control the dangerous side of nuclear technology—while still pursuing its peaceful uses. Castigating the man and the idea, the U.S. instead kicked off a vast cold war arms race by developing hydrogen bombs, along with related costly and occasionally bizarre delivery systems and atmospheric testing. The resultant nuclear-industrial complex disproportionately harmed the most vulnerable. Uranium mining and atmospheric testing caused cancer among groups that included residents of New Mexico, Marshallese communities and members of the Navajo Nation. The wasteful spending, opportunity cost and impact on marginalized communities were incalculable—to say nothing of the numerous close calls and the proliferation of nuclear weapons that ensued. Today we need both international cooperation and domestic regulation to ensure that AI develops safely.
Congress must act now to regulate tech companies to ensure that they prioritize the collective public interest. Congress should start by passing my Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, my Algorithmic Justice and Online Transparency Act and my bill prohibiting the launch of nuclear weapons by AI. But that’s just the beginning. Guided by the White House’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, Congress needs to pass broad regulations to stop this reckless race to build and deploy unsafe artificial intelligence. Decisions about how and where to use AI cannot be left to tech companies alone. They must be made by centering on the communities most vulnerable to exploitation and harm from AI. And we must be open to working with allies and adversaries alike to avoid both military and civilian abuses of AI.
At the start of the nuclear age, rather than heed Oppenheimer’s warning on the dangers of an arms race, the U.S. fired the starting gun. Eight decades later, we have a moral responsibility and a clear interest in not repeating that mistake.

2023-08-07 20:48:39+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’ Extends Imax 70mm Run Due to Popular Demand (EXCLUSIVE),"""Oppenheimer"" has extended its 70mm run at Imax theaters nationwide through the end of August due to popular demand.","Due to popular demand, “Oppenheimer” has extended its 70mm run at Imax theaters nationwide through the end of August.
The previous end date, which was already an extension of the film’s original run in Imax 70mm format, was Aug. 17. Tickets for Christopher Nolan’s atomic bomb drama are already on sale through Aug. 31 at some Imax theaters, as exhibitors will make them available on a rolling basis.
Nolan, a longtime vocal champion of the premium format, touted Imax 70mm as the “best possible experience” to see “Oppenheimer” because “the sharpness and the clarity and the depth of the image is unparalleled.” Only 19 theaters in the U.S. (and 30 worldwide) have the capability to play films in Imax 70mm, including the AMC Universal CityWalk in Los Angeles and the AMC Lincoln Square in New York — making those screens some of the hottest tickets in town.
“It actually looks better in film,” Imax CEO Richard Gelfond tells Variety. “It’s not just about nostalgia. It’s a better experience.”
A lot of work goes into the 70mm experience, he adds. It takes three days to make an Imax film print, and each one is crafted directly from Nolan’s film negative. In the case of “Oppenheimer,” which clocks in at three hours, physical reels are 11 miles long and weigh 600 pounds.
The process is “time consuming and expensive,” Gelfond admits. But ultimately, it’s “worth it.”
Already, the historical biopic starring Cillian Murphy as the “father of the atomic bomb” J. Robert Oppenheimer, has raked in over $550 million at the global box office, a triumphant feat for an R-rated drama that runs over three hours long. Imax has accounted for a remarkable $114.2 million (22%) of the film’s worldwide total.
“Oppenheimer” will control the Imax footprint until Denzel Washington’s “The Equalizer 3” takes its spot on Sept. 1. Later in the year, Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune Part II,” also filmed with Imax cameras, is getting an exclusive Imax run starting on Nov. 3.
Still, executives at Imax are confident this summer won’t be the last of “Oppenheimer” in Nolan’s preferred format.
“Imax 70mm film lasts, on average, 10 times longer than regular 70mm or 35mm film. Those prints are assets that we’ll be using for the next 20 years,” says Mark Jafar, global head of corporate communications for Imax. “Places like BFI [in London] or Lincoln Square will do Nolan retrospectives or bring back ‘Oppenheimer’ given how popular it is. We’ll be showing it in this format for years to come.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItaW1heC03MG1tLWV4dGVuZGVkLXRpY2tldHMtMTIzNTY4OTg5OS_SAVlodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9uZXdzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWltYXgtNzBtbS1leHRlbmRlZC10aWNrZXRzLTEyMzU2ODk4OTkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-16 22:29:27+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’s Cillian Murphy On Why He Likes To See Christopher Nolan Films Without Him In Them & Why He Adores ‘Interstellar’,Cillian Murphy is talking about his favorite Christopher Nolan film without him and why he likes watching films by the 'Oppenheimer' director where he's not in them.,"Oppenheimer marked the sixth time Cillian Murphy starred in a film directed by Christopher Nolan following The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception and Dunkirk.
Out of the 13 films Nolan has directed, Murphy has been in close to half of them and there’s one particular title that the Irish actor would’ve liked to be a part of.
“I adore Interstellar just because I find it so emotional,” Murphy told The Independent in an interview before the SAG-AFTRA strike. “I remember seeing it in the cinema when I had little kids. It just had a big impact on me. It broke my heart.”
Murphy also noted that he enjoys watching Nolan’s work, particularly when he is not part of the ensemble cast.
“I love watching his films when I’m not in them because you don’t have to freak out about the size of your ears, or whatever,” he added.
Interstellar is a 2014 science fiction film, directed, co-written and produced by Nolan. The film starred Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn and Michael Caine about a group of astronauts who space travel in search of a new home for humankind.
Murphy also explained what other Nolan film he would pair alongside Oppenheimer for a double bill saying, “You could go Interstellar, which is very… explores similar scientific, physic themes. Or you could watch Dunkirk, which is also set in World War II. Dunkirk is shorter, so that might be a good match ‘cause it’s like an hour-and-a-half, and then you can go into [Oppenheimer].”
Murphy has been getting a lot of praise for his portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the “father of the atomic bomb.” His co-star Robert Downey Jr. said he had “never witness a greater sacrifice by a lead actor” in his career.
“He knew it was going to be a behemoth ask when Chris called him. But I think he also had the humility that is required to survive playing a role like this,” Downey Jr. told People in July. “We’d be like, ‘Hey, we got a three-day weekend. Maybe we’ll go antiquing in Santa Fe. What are you going to do?’ ‘Oh, I have to learn 30,000 words of Dutch. Have a nice time.’ But that’s the nature of the ask.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tZmlsbXMtYWRvcmVzLWludGVyc3RlbGxhci0xMjM1NTIxMDQ5L9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tZmlsbXMtYWRvcmVzLWludGVyc3RlbGxhci0xMjM1NTIxMDQ5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,‘Barbie’ arrives in Japan without ‘Oppenheimer’ after social media stumble,"“Barbie” arrived divorced from its trendy “Barbenheimer” partner, a phenomenon in July in the United States but a cultural faux pas in Japan.","J.

TOKYO – When “Barbie,” the live-action movie about a plastic doll, opened Friday in Japan, it did so without “Oppenheimer,” the rival film with which it shared a bill in the United States.
“Oppenheimer,” a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, has no opening date in Japan, thus far, and Universal Studios has said nothing about the film coming to the only country targeted in anger with atomic weapons.
“Barbie” arrived divorced from its trendy “Barbenheimer” partner, a phenomenon in July in the United States but a cultural faux pas in Japan.
Film distributors will consider whether the movie will turn a profit before deciding to show it in Japan, said Kazuhiro Maeshima, a professor of global studies at Sophia University in Tokyo by phone Thursday. Later openings in Japan for U.S. films are not unusual, he said.
“They may decide that it’s better not to show it in Japan because of this reaction” to the “Barbenheimer” controversy, Maeshima said.
The two films were married on social media in a lighthearted, social-media meme called “Barbenheimer” that encouraged U.S. moviegoers to see the contrasting films in one day. Both movies opened July 21 in the U.S.
‘Summer to remember’
“Oppenheimer” is based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led the U.S. project during World War II that was first to develop an atomic weapon.
An Internet meme in late July that grafted images of its star, Cillian Murphy, with one of Margot Robbie, star of “Barbie,” unleashed outrage in Japan for its apparent insensitivity.
Warner Bros.’ official “Barbie” account on X, formerly known as Twitter, re-tweeted a fan-art poster showing Murphy’s Oppenheimer carrying Robbie as Barbie superimposed over a mushroom cloud.
“It’s going to be a summer to remember,” declared the tweet, since deleted.
Warner Bros. Japan was among the first to react.
“We consider it extremely regrettable that the official account of the American headquarters for the movie ‘Barbie’ reacted to the social media postings of ‘Barbenheimer’ fans,” Warner Bros. Japan tweeted on the “Barbie” Japan account.
“We take this situation very seriously. We are asking the U.S. headquarters to take appropriate action,” the tweet read. “We apologize to those who were offended by this series of inconsiderate reactions.”
The Warner Bros. Film Group the next day offered “a sincere apology” for “its recent insensitive social media engagement.”
Sachiko Ishikawa, a YouTuber from Tokyo who tries to demystify Japan by talking about its misconceptions, addressed the “Barbenheimer” flap in a video, “#Barbenheimer in Japan?!,” posted Wednesday.
“It’s not that the memes weren’t a problem, but what made it all snowball was the response,” Ishikawa told Stars and Stripes by phone Thursday. “The memes would’ve happened regardless, but the backlash was caused by the ‘Barbie’ official X reply.”
Living memory

Ishikawa said she found the Japanese attitude toward “Oppenheimer” interesting. The comments on her video focus less on the meme controversy and more on the history of the atomic bomb.
People in Japan associate the atomic bomb and the mushroom cloud with an estimated 110,000 who died immediately and thousands more who suffered from the bombings, Maeshima said. Living survivors tell their stories to subsequent generations, so the atomic bombings are a reality for them, he said.
The Japanese are reminded of the bombings every August with the anniversaries of the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
By contrast, in the U.S., the bombings are generally considered a good thing that quickly ended the war, and victims’ stories are reported less frequently, Maeshima said.
Even if the movie reaches Japanese theaters, it may fall flat following the “Barbenheimer” incident, he said.
“It depends on whether one can imagine the tragic situation the bombings have brought on people when thinking about the mushroom cloud,” he said.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmlwZXMuY29tL3RoZWF0ZXJzL2FzaWFfcGFjaWZpYy8yMDIzLTA4LTEwL2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1tb3ZpZXMtamFwYW4tYmFyYmVuaGVpbWVyLTExMDA5OTY3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,'Oppenheimer': Emily Blunt got 'withering' looks from Christopher Nolan for wearing Uggs,"Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are ""vacation buddies and neighbors."" Now, they co-star in Christopher Nolan's ""nightmarish"" nukes movie ""Oppenheimer.""","NEW YORK – Like most savvy actors, Matt Damon always picks up the phone for Christopher Nolan.
The A-lister, who previously appeared in Nolan’s 2014 film “Interstellar,” was planning to take a break from acting when the Oscar-nominated director called about “Oppenheimer” (in theaters Friday), his chilling new historical drama.
“I had told my wife I was taking time off,” says Damon, speaking to USA TODAY in a joint interview with co-star Emily Blunt before the Screen Actors Guild strike. “This was something we literally negotiated, but the one caveat was ‘if Chris Nolan calls.’ He was my get-back-to-work card, and then he actually called, which was a wonderful surprise.”
'Oppenheimer':Christopher Nolan made his new movie because he thought he'd die in a nuclear Armageddon
Matt Damon brings levity to the 'wildly unpopular' Leslie Groves
In the white-knuckle epic, Damon plays gruff U.S. Army officer Leslie Groves, who calls on physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to oversee the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II. Groves was “wildly unpopular” with the scientists, Damon says, and frequently butted heads with Oppenheimer. But there was still “mutual respect” between the two men.
“They’re complete polar opposites,” says Damon, sitting at a hotel in New York's Tribeca neighborhood. “The military is obsessed with secrecy, and the scientists are trying to get to the root of the problem, which they do by sharing. Groves constantly felt like a kindergarten teacher chasing these guys around. So Chris found some comedy there, which is good for a movie about something so serious.”
“Maybe that’s why he cast you,” Blunt suggests. “Everyone loves you and you have a natural warmth. If you cast someone unlikable playing someone unlikable, it would’ve been (alienating).”
Emily Blunt's Kitty Oppenheimer is 'volatile' yet fiercely loyal
Blunt portrays Kitty, Oppenheimer’s caustic, alcoholic wife. When Oppenheimer is probed by government officials about possible Communist ties, she demands that he stop feeling sorry for himself. She’s similarly unsympathetic about the death of his former lover.
“Kitty didn’t do small talk. She only did big talk,” Blunt says. “There’s a lot about her that wouldn’t necessarily be ‘likable,’ but I don’t think she cared. She was such a force of personality.” Toward the end of the film, “she’s become so volatile and unpredictable – the drinking is out of control. But he says to his defense (team), ‘Kitty and I have walked through fire together, and I believe in her.’ She’ll fight for him when he won’t fight for himself.”
The movie's Trinity test scene was 'beautiful' yet 'nightmarish' to behold
One of the movie’s most thrilling sequences is the Trinity test, when the first nuclear weapon was detonated in the New Mexico desert in 1945. The bomb’s mushroom cloud and blinding light were recreated using practical effects.
“Because the explosion is real, it’s as beautiful as it is nightmarish,” Blunt says. “Because you know it’s not (computer-generated), you can’t dissociate from it.”
“You can’t take your eyes off it, but it’s the most terrible thing you’ve ever seen,” Damon adds. Witnessing it on the set, “it was a big boom. Everybody had their earplugs in.”

Emily Blunt recalls her 'Devil Wears Prada' moment with director Christopher Nolan
“Oppenheimer” is the second film Blunt, 40, and Damon, 52, have made together, including the 2011 sci-fi thriller “The Adjustment Bureau.” Blunt says they would “hang out constantly” while shooting the latter, going on double dates with her husband, John Krasinski, and Damon’s wife, Luciana Barroso.
“Now we’re vacation buddies and neighbors,” says Blunt, who lives in the same Brooklyn apartment building as Damon. “I know, it’s ridiculous. This is strange not to see Matt in his sweats and slippers.”
“The only time I wear shoes is when we do interviews together,” Damon quips. “I’ve got a great pair of house slippers, and I’m going to put them right on when I get home. I did accidentally wear my Ugg slippers on a school run once.”
“Do you know who hates Uggs more than anyone?” Blunt asks. “Christopher Nolan. I’ve never known anyone to detest a pair of Uggs more than Chris Nolan. It’s a testament to how he wants everything on set to look as it would (in the period). If there’s a plastic bottle in the shot, he’s like, ‘Ugh!’ He hates to even look at it. I would sometimes put on some Uggs and I’d just get this withering look down to my feet – it was like being in ‘The Devil Wears Prada’ again. Just the look down to the shoes. And I'd go, 'I know, I know. But I'm just sitting on an apple box in the background today!' ""
As a joke, Blunt gave Nolan a pair of Uggs at the end of the shoot. His wife, Emma Thomas, “wrote to me and was like, ‘Brilliant wrap gift. He’s wearing them now,’ "" Blunt recalls with a laugh. “I was so pleased!”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L21vdmllcy8yMDIzLzA3LzE5L29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWVtaWx5LWJsdW50LW1hdHQtZGFtb24taW50ZXJ2aWV3LzcwNDI0MjcxMDA3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"Review: She’s “Barbie,” he’s just “Oppenheimer”","After participating in a fever dream of head-to-toe pink outfits and a frenzy of film bros, I can confidently say seeing these films back to back is a mistake.","More than 200,000 people sat for nearly five hours with nothing but the artificial light of the screen casting shadows over their awed faces this past weekend as the cultural phenomenon “Barbenheimer” swept the nation.
Part of what drove the “Barbenheimer” double-feature craze is the hyper feminine-masculine dichotomy between the films, as “Barbie” was advertised as a feminist paradise while viewers assumed “Oppenheimer,” a biopic about the man who led the creation of the atomic bomb, would tackle war and corruption. Ahead of the films’ opening, online consensus favored watching “Oppenheimer” first then ending the day with “Barbie” under the assumption that the former would be incredibly depressing and audiences would need an uplifting only the latter could provide. But in true GW fashion, this Barbie decided to be a devil’s advocate and watched director Greta Gerwig’s masterpiece first.
In “Barbie,” viewers are quickly introduced to Margot Robbie’s Stereotypical Barbie as she makes the rounds in Barbieland, a matriarchal utopia, from an all-Barbie Supreme Court and a Pink House for the president, while the Kens … are sort of in charge of the beach. After a long day of observing physicist Barbie win a Nobel Prize (score one for the Barbies over J. Robert Oppenheimer) and moderating a fight between Ryan Gosling’s needy Stereotypical Ken and Simu Liu’s Lifeguard Ken, she brings a choreographed, blowout dance party to a halt, asking: “Do you guys ever think about dying?”
The literal record-scratch moment sparks the plot of the film as the next day Barbie’s fantasy world crumbles, sending her to seek sage advice from Kate McKinnon’s Weird Barbie. She discovers the girl playing with her in the Real World is negatively influencing her life and journeys to heal her human counterpart.
In a desperate attempt for her affection, Gosling’s Ken tags along for the ride. Barbie and Ken get separated through their misadventures, giving Ken the opportunity to discover patriarchy and import it back to Barbieland, creating a host of problems that the Barbies must solve. Along the way, Barbie teams up with mother-daughter pair Gloria and Sasha, the humans responsible for her existential crisis.
After initially hearing about this film, many people wrote it off as fluff to promote Mattel’s brand. Instead, “Barbie” unexpectedly goes where many blockbusters before it haven’t, by catering to a predominantly female audience through its satirizing of the patriarchy and gender dynamics. From the hard cut showing an ad for Depression Barbie, a doll that wears sweatpants all day and rewatches the BBC’s “Pride and Prejudice” show until she passes out, to the Barbies experiencing the canon event of pretending to enjoy a man playing guitar, the comedy was meant for the girls.
The peppy acting of the ensemble cast, featuring stars from Issa Rae to Michael Cera, is true to the dolls they portray. Yet Robbie still delivers a heartfelt performance alongside her creator, Ruth Handler, in which Barbie unpacks an identity crisis while Ruth, played by Rhea Perlman, praises her for evolving. The film resolves with an ending that is beyond “Kenough” but you’ll have to see for yourself.
Christopher Nolan’s adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” chronicles the father of the atomic bomb’s conflicted morals and personal woes as he worked on the Manhattan Project, and pinpoints his career’s downfall through two government hearings. An early scene in which Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy, attempts to poison his teacher, goes through a crisis of conscience, and then thwarts the professor from dying foreshadows a shocking amount of the film.
Politics and quantum physics go hand in hand as Oppenheimer initially struggles to get security clearance due to his ties to members of the Communist Party. Few actors encapsulate pain and regret like Murphy as he stares off into space during a Red Scare-sparked hearing into his communist associations, which unfortunately eats up valuable time in the film as the hearings are endless.
The race to build the weapon of mass destruction leads Oppenheimer to assemble a team of renowned scientists and convene them for three years in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Though I failed my AP Physics exam, I found the scenes in which Oppenheimer debates with his fellow scientists how to construct the bomb to be among the most engaging in the movie — in part because of the bizarre ensemble of actors Nolan assembled. During the infamous Trinity test, none other than Josh Peck — yes, a man who once ran over Oprah in a Nickelodeon show — turns the key that unleashes a bomb.
But Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, who were limited in screen time likely because of the unnecessarily extensive time Nolan devoted to the hearings, still shined. Pugh in the role of Jean Tatlock, Oppenheimer’s ex-flame, captures an intense torturedness in her vulnerable interactions with him, especially when he reveals to her his engagement. Blunt, who plays Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty, expertly shifts from quiet despair after being made aware of his affair to firecracker as she defends him during a security hearing.
All of that said, no movie should be three hours long. In an effort to stay true to history, Nolan drilled too deep into the legal and national security implications of Oppenheimer’s loss of clearance, misplacing the actual plot: Oppenheimer’s late-arriving conscience and subsequent moral crisis. In an effort to build tension, the complex governmental hearings just dragged on as Nolan brought back too many acquaintances and enemies of Oppenheimer to make their cases.
After participating in this fever dream of head-to-toe pink outfits and a frenzy of film bros, I can confidently say seeing these films back to back is a mistake. Some might argue that I just watched them in the wrong order but “Barbie” genuinely was not all party, more a meditation on girl and womanhood, and in truth, no movie or TV show can overpower “Oppenheimer.” Believe me, I tried watching “Glee” afterward.
These films each deserve a full day and a clear mind to be appreciated, from the fantastic floor-to-ceiling plastic sets of “Barbie” to the multi-layered, fraught emotions of “Oppenheimer.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZ3doYXRjaGV0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3LzI4L3Jldmlldy1zaGVzLWJhcmJpZS1oZXMtanVzdC1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"UNCSA Filmmaking alumni and staff take center stage as ""Oppenheimer"" 70mm projectionists",,"UNCSA Filmmaking alumni and staff take center stage as ""Oppenheimer"" 70mm projectionists
“Oppenheimer” is one of the biggest films of the summer for many reasons, including its star-studded cast and the popularity of the director, Christopher Nolan. But “Oppenheimer” has cinephiles excited for another reason: it is a rare opportunity to view a film projected in 70mm.
Though the format is widely considered the best way to view a film, Nolan is one of only a few directors that films using this iconic filming method. Since it has become an increasingly uncommon way to film, projectionists are also extremely hard to find today…unless you look in the right place. The School of Filmmaking Moving Image Archives (also known as the Film Archives) is one such place – not only is it one of the top ten largest film archives in the world, but it also serves as one of the few places in the country where people can learn the art of film projection and preservation.
Thanks to their experience working with the Film Archives, two staff members and eight alumni are serving as 70 mm projectionists for “Oppenheimer.” Alumni Jesse Price, Adam Witmer, Jonathan Foster, Christopher Schneider, Lucas Taylor, Noelle Aleman, Scott DuVall and Jason Garnett were all trained by the staff at the Film Archives during their time as students. Additionally, staff members Matt Jones and Eric Self are practicing what they teach by serving as projectionists.
'Destroyer of Worlds'
Based on the true story of theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, “Oppenheimer” focuses on the titular character's experience during World War II. During that time, Oppenheimer served as the director of the Manhattan Project’s Los Alamos Laboratory, where the first nuclear weapons were developed.
Starring many well-known actors, including Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr. and Matt Damon, “Oppenheimer” has already earned over $400 million globally. In addition to the lead cast members, three School of Drama alumni can be seen in the film in notable roles; Dylan Arnold (B.F.A. ‘16) plays Frank Oppenheimer, younger brother of J. Robert Oppenheimer, Steve Coulter (B.F.A. '81) plays American chemist James Conant, and Dane DeHaan (B.F.A. ‘07) plays Kenneth Nichols, a civil engineer in the Army who worked on the Manhattan Project.

Arnold spoke with the Hollywood Reporter about his experience on set and watching the crew work together. ""It was a pretty amazing experience to watch [Director of Photography] Hoyte van Hoytema hoist that massive 80-pound camera on his shoulder with ease and then reload that giant IMAX mag,” explains Arnold. “It’s also little moments like that where you just look around and think, 'Everyone is so on it. Everyone just knows so much. Top to bottom, this is an extraordinary experience.'""
Signature filmmaking style
Director Christopher Nolan is known for his complex storytelling and is largely considered one of the best filmmakers of the 21st century. While this can be partially attributed to his unique cinematic style that explores themes around reality, another part is because Nolan prefers shooting in 65mm film, also known as premium large format film stock. The film is then projected in IMAX 70mm film and the extra 5mm is used for sound.
Nolan explains that he was very intentional with the decision to film “Oppenheimer” in premium large format. “We put a lot of effort into shooting the film in a way that we can get it out on these large format screens,” he told the Associated Press. “It really is just a great way of giving people an experience that they can’t possibly get in the home.”
Many of Nolan’s award-winning films, including “Inception,” “Interstellar,” “Tenet” and “Dunkirk,” were either partially or fully filmed on 65mm film. It is a format he started using during “The Dark Knight” and has now become one of his signatures. “The sharpness and the clarity and the depth of the image is unparalleled,” Nolan tells AP. “You’re getting a feeling of 3D without the glasses. You’ve got a huge screen and you’re filling the peripheral vision of the audience. You’re immersing them in the world of the film.”
The 70mm difference
Historically, a majority of films were filmed on 35mm, and 70mm was reserved for blockbusters like “Oklahoma!,” “Ben-Hur,” “My Fair Lady” and “2001: A Space Odyssey.” However, with the rise of digital filming methods, both physical film formats have dwindled over the past 15 years.
Alumnus Adam Witmer (B.F.A. ‘16) elaborates on why 70mm projection is still very relevant and important in filmmaking. “70mm is still the best image quality you can see on the screen,” he says. Though several factors make this so, he summarizes that the most important reasons are “resolution, brightness and color.”
“As opposed to digital methods, film’s image isn’t made up of pixels so you can zoom in and still have a very sharp image,” explains Witmer. “Additionally, when watching a digital projector, whenever you have a screen that’s dark, there will still be a slight glow because the projector is sending light. Due to the way 70mm or 35mm film blocks light during dark scenes, it’s actually black so that the theater will be completely dark.” He adds that the inverse is also true, “true white is clearer and brighter on film because the lamps tend to be brighter than most digital projectors.”
70mm is still the best image quality you can see on the screen. Adam Witmer, Film Alumnus
Matt Jones, who currently serves as the associate curator of the Film Archives, adds that when comparing digital projection and 70mm projection side-by-side, “it's not even close.”
“When you watch film, you spend half of your time in the dark as the shutter opens and closes 24 times per second. It's an active process for the brain as it tries to make sense of what it's seeing. It's why you often rub your eyes from the strain as you leave a film show,” explains Jones. “Digital content, on the other hand, uses scan lines to replace a previous image with a new one and never goes dark. It has a numbing effect on the brain, which is why you're more likely to zone out and fall asleep when watching TV on your couch.” Jones believes that by returning film to theatres, “audiences can again enjoy the active process it used to be – nowadays there's very few opportunities for the general public to do that.”
So, if it is superior to other filming methods, why isn’t 65mm standard? Mostly it comes down to cost, availability of equipment and ease of transportation. It is very expensive to shoot. Since nearly all theaters only project digitally, distributing a film and finding projectionists to run it is a huge ordeal. Additionally, the film is challenging to transport – just one copy of 70mm film for “Oppenheimer” weighs 600 pounds.
Despite these obstacles, Dean of Filmmaking Deborah LaVine believes the format isn’t likely to disappear. “Filmmakers the caliber of Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan have long been demanding higher standards in the projection of contemporary and historical films. Scorsese explains that the audience ‘misses the narrative. You’re missing the performance’ when watching subpar projection.” Thankfully, there are schools like UNCSA that are still teaching the necessary skills these imaginative filmmakers need.
A hidden gem
Tucked into the School of Filmmaking campus lives the Film Archives building, the fifth largest non-commercial archive in the country. The extensive holding includes a collection of 16,500 original feature film prints on 70mm, 35mm and 16mm; 240 live-action and animated short films, documentaries and newsreels on 35mm and 16mm; 4,600 previews of coming attractions on 35mm; and over 20,000 videocassette, laserdisc and DVD titles.
At the Film Archives, students can either volunteer or do work-study as they start at the bottom and work their way up, learning about all aspects of caring for and handling the various pieces of media housed there. Witmer was a work-study student in the Archives for all four years he was at UNCSA and says that he and any other student trained by the staff had to first prove they could be trusted before they were taught to become a projectionist. “My first year was hauling inventory around, second year I was taught to inspect the films, and by the third year Matt felt I was ready to learn how to become a projectionist,” explains Witmer.
A look inside the School of Filmmaking Moving Image Archives (also known as the Film Archives).
LaVine emphasizes how crucial it is for a projectionist to be highly skilled. “The art of film projection is very demanding and requires great skills, not the least of which are receiving and checking film reels, loading the films onto the projector in the right order, making sure the film runs smoothly through the projector, checking that sound is operating properly, joining ('splicing') lengths of film together if they break. A projectionist must have a terrific sense of color, hearing and timing.”
The archives are run by Matt Jones and Eric Self, who are dedicated to maintaining the inventory, training students and managing the free films that are screened every weekend at the ACE Theater.
Jones explains his philosophy for approaching his job at the Moving Image Archives. “When I started at UNCSA over 20 years ago, I decided that I wanted to show as many people as possible as many different kinds of film as possible because there's secrets to life in art if you look at it the right way.”
He adds that seeing countless students graduate and move on to their careers in the film industry, Jones still finds joy in the mentorship aspect of his job. “These jobs are hard, very hard, and I can't say how proud I am to watch our students step up to the plate over and over.”
Now, from St. Louis to Los Angeles, our alumni and staff are currently utilizing skills learned at UNCSA to project “Oppenheimer” for movie lovers nationwide. Though there are only 30 theaters that are currently screening in 70mm, people are traveling long distances to experience the film the way the filmmaker intended.

2023-07-27 14:51:13+00:00,"Benny Safdie Is ‘Proud to Say’ His ‘Oppenheimer’ Eyebrows Are Real, Says Christopher Nolan Told Him Not to Pluck Them for Months: ‘Let It Go Crazy’","Benny Safdie sports some pretty thick brows as Edward Teller in ""Oppenheimer,"" and it was all by design.","“Good Time” and “Uncut Gems” director Benny Safdie expands his acting career with a prominent supporting role in Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer.” He plays Edward Teller, the real-life theoretical physicist known as “the father of the hydrogen bomb.” Teller joined Oppenheimer to work on the atomic bomb in Los Alamos, N.M., focusing on nuclear implosion and uranium hydride research. He was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary, and had a thick accent, which presented Safdie with one of his biggest acting challenges.
“The accent was something I was so nervous about,” Safdie recently told Vulture. “I remember Chris asking me, ‘How’s the accent coming?’ And I’m just like, ‘Oh my God, how am I going to accomplish this?’ I didn’t know if he was going to want me to do it. But he sent me all of these interviews and we talked about how Teller speaks and who he is. It was a long process of working together to really nail it down.”
“I remember finally I was like, ‘You know what? I could sound crazy, but I don’t care. This is what Teller sounds like and I’m just going to do it,'” Safdie added. “I sent a voice-memo where I just narrated what my breakfast was and how Teller really liked pineapple.”
Because “Oppenheimer” spans several years, Safdie also had to find a way to change his accent as Teller grew older. Screaming ended up being a solution.
“Before each take, I said, ‘Okay, I’m going to yell. I’m going to really break up my vocal cords,'” Safdie told Vulture. “It makes such a big difference. We also came up with this weird laugh-snort that Teller has when Kenneth Branagh is talking and we realize the Germans are behind and we’re ahead of them. Snorting and hitting the leg. We spent so long on that! Just that little snort. You’re not afraid to look stupid in a lot of ways, because when you’re free like that, it’s a fun place to be.”
Another signature part of bringing Teller to life was his eyebrows. Safdie sports some pretty thick brows in the film, which he said Christopher Nolan was adamant about.
“I am proud to say that it’s all my eyebrows,” Safdie said. “Teller had the best eyebrows. Every once in a while I have a straggler that I’ll just pluck out, cause it looks a little too crazy. But Chris said, ‘Don’t do that. Let’s just let it go crazy.’ I had the most insane eyebrows for months and months, and you just had to brush them out and then they shined in all their glory.”
“Oppenheimer” is now playing in theaters nationwide from Universal Pictures.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tYmVubnktc2FmZGllLWV5ZWJyb3dzLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWVkd2FyZC10ZWxsZXItMTIzNTY4MTM3OC_SAXRodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9uZXdzL2NocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLWJlbm55LXNhZmRpZS1leWVicm93cy1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1lZHdhcmQtdGVsbGVyLTEyMzU2ODEzNzgvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-03 12:02:10.343000+00:00,Oppenheimer Fans Spot Disturbing Detail That Hints at a Horrifying Conspiracy,Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer features a horrifying detail that hints towards a decades-old conspiracy.,"Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer.
A disturbing detail in Oppenheimer seems to hint at a larger conspiracy... and it sees director Christopher Nolan in true ""horror mode.""
During a harrowing sequence of quick shots, the death of Jean Tatlock is shown as she seemingly drowns herself in the bath. However, a pair of black-gloved hands hints that all is not as it seems.
“One thing in Oppenheimer I haven't been able to get out of my head is that brief insert of black gloves in that one flashback with Florence Pugh,” said film fan Josh Lewis on Twitter. “Nolan was really in his horror mode.”
One thing in Oppenheimer I haven't been able to get out of my head is that brief insert of black gloves in that one flashback with Florence Pugh. Nolan was really in his horror mode. — Josh Lewis (@thejoshl) July 23, 2023
He’s not the first to notice the gloved hands, and the scene seems to suggest that Tatlock’s death wasn’t suicide at all. Tatlock is played by Florence Pugh and features throughout the movie as Oppenheimer’s lover who continued to have a relationship with the scientist while he was married to his wife, Kitty (played by Emily Blunt).
Not only frowned upon due to the illicit nature of their relationship, Tatlock was also a keen member of the Communist party and was seen by many to be a security risk. Tatlock’s fate is teased throughout the film, with a flashback eventually revealing she supposedly drowned herself in the bathtub.
Of course, the gloved hands suggest otherwise, and fans have since been debating its meaning. Some believe the scene is a manifestation of Oppenheimer’s guilt and the gloved hands are meant to represent Oppenheimer blaming himself for her death.
The horrifying blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment is the closest Nolan comes to horror in Oppenheimer. However, it also teases a decades-old conspiracy. Following her death, an autopsy determined her cause of death as death by drowning, however, a “faint trace” of chloral hydrate was found in her system, a substance capable of sedating a person.
According to the book American Prometheus, on which Oppenheimer is based, at least one physician had doubts about her cause of death, speculating she may have been drugged and forcibly drowned. “If you were clever and wanted to kill someone, this is the way to do it,” said one doctor.
This subsequently led to speculation by historians, as well as Tatlock’s own brother, that she may have been killed by U.S. Government officials due to her affiliation to the Communist party, coupled with her closeness to one of the Manhattan Project’s key players.
“I do not believe that her interests were really political,” Oppenheimer told The United States Atomic Energy Commission in 1954. “She was a person of deep religious feeling. She loved this country, its people, and its life.”
Nevertheless, it looks as though Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan may have been convinced enough to tease that her death wasn’t a suicide at all.
IGN’s Oppenheimer review gave it 10/10 and said: “A biopic in constant free fall, Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s most abstract yet most exacting work, with themes of guilt writ large through apocalyptic IMAX nightmares that grow both more enormous and more intimate as time ticks on. A disturbing, mesmerizing vision of what humanity is capable of bringing upon itself, both through its innovation, and through its capacity to justify any atrocity.”

2023-07-21 13:57:47.446000+00:00,"In nod to ‘Oppenheimer,’ US vows to prioritize cleanup at nuclear lab","Ike White, who heads DOE’s Office of Environmental Management, said the release of “Oppenheimer” film makes it time to talk about the atomic age's legacy.","The price tag for cleaning up waste from the once top-secret Manhattan Project and subsequent Cold War-era nuclear research at Los Alamos National Laboratory has more than doubled in the last seven years, and independent federal investigators say federal officials will have to do better to track costs and progress.
The Government Accountability Office in a report issued Wednesday said while some improvements have been made, the U.S. Energy Department hasn’t taken a comprehensive approach to prioritizing cleanup activities at the New Mexico lab.
The report came as federal officials hosted a forum Thursday in Los Alamos to talk about cleaning up contaminated soil and groundwater and handling hazardous waste generated by decades of research that started with development of the atomic bomb during the 1940s.
Ike White, who heads DOE’s Office of Environmental Management, said the release this week of the “Oppenheimer” film makes it a good time to talk about the legacy that came from the dawning of the atomic age. Part of the environmental cleanup mission requires an examination of history, White told those gathered at the historic Fuller Lodge in the heart of Los Alamos.
He characterized the nation’s multibillion-dollar cleanup program as the third largest liability on the books for the federal government — behind only Social Security and Medicaid.
“It is a large, it is a complicated, it a technologically challenging program,” White said. “It is extremely important to a lot of people who live across the country from coast to coast, and all of us who are part of that program feel an extraordinary responsibility to make that program successful.”

Still, the GAO pointed to weaknesses in oversight by the Office of Environmental Management at Los Alamos. They said failure to finalize a performance baseline for the cleanup contractor prevented the office from tracking ongoing costs, the scope of work and progress.
New Mexico environmental regulators said the report validates their longstanding concerns — that cleanup is mired in unnecessary delays that threaten public health and the environment. New Mexico Environment Department spokesman Matthew Maez pointed specifically to the federal government’s responsibility to protect drinking water.
“The frequent delays and lack of transparency in cleanup must be remedied,” he said. “We hope this report galvanizes DOE-EM to enact change in Los Alamos.”
Environmental management officials at Los Alamos said they expect to complete remaining cleanup activities at the lab by 2043 at an estimated cost of about $7 billion.
Michael Mikolanis, who heads DOE’s environmental management office at Los Alamos, said Thursday that his team is developing a long-term strategic vision for the remaining cleanup that will be based on priorities identified through numerous meetings with state regulators, the leaders of neighboring Native American communities and others.
While White agrees with the GAO that prioritizing the scope of work is important, he said optimum efficiency is not always the most important factor.
“One of the things that we’ve arranged with our strategic vision effort and our stakeholder engagement is to try to make sure we’re doing that prioritization of the work in a way that is transparent to the community and that doesn’t just reflect a sort of bureaucratic set of values,” he said.
Don Hancock with the Albuquerque-based nuclear watchdog group Southwest Research and Information Center said the DOE in 2010 had issued a roadmap that included a goal of disposing of most of the transuranic waste — that which contains manmade elements heavier than uranium — by the end of 2015.
He asked the DOE officials at the forum about the timeline and how much waste remained.
Mikolanis said his office plans to unveil an interactive map this fall that will include estimates of the waste at Los Alamos that is stored above ground and that which has yet to be unearthed.
White said estimates for the cleanup project nationwide are hard to calculate because the ultimate volume of waste can change depending on the scope of a project.
The GAO report includes several recommendations for the DOE that include implementing a plan to account for cost and schedule increases, building trust with state regulators and including consideration of potential risks when making decisions.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZlZGVyYWx0aW1lcy5jb20vZmVkZXJhbC1vdmVyc2lnaHQvMjAyMy8wNy8yMS9pbi1ub2QtdG8tb3BwZW5oZWltZXItdXMtdm93cy10by1wcmlvcml0aXplLWNsZWFudXAtYXQtbnVjbGVhci1sYWIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

""It Feels Very Intimate"": Cillian Murphy on Working with Christopher Nolan and His Prep for Oppenheimer
Pattinson is one of the hottest actors in Hollywood right now.
Last month, Christopher Nolan revealed that he was inspired to make Oppenheimer (opening in theaters everywhere July 21) as his next movie after Robert Pattinson gifted him a book of speeches by J. Robert Oppenheimer when Tenet wrapped production.
You'd think Nolan would return the favor by offering Pattinson a prominent role in the atomic bomb thriller, but the actor is nowhere to be seen throughout the blockbuster's massive ensemble, which includes everyone from Cillian Murphy to Robert Downey Jr.
RELATED: Oppenheimer Stars Explain Why Working with Christopher Nolan Is an ""Instant Yes""
""He was busy,"" the filmmaker explained during an interview with entertainment journalist Tara Hitchcock, alluding to Pattinson's commitments to other projects like Mickey 17 and The Batman - Part II. ""He's very much in-demand these days.""
Nevertheless, the book of Oppenheimer's speeches fortified the director's interest in the Manhattan Project, which Tenet directly references in a conversation between The Protagonist (John David Washington) and arms dealer Dimple Kapadia (Priya Singh).
""You're reading these great intellects trying to deal with the massive consequences of the way in which they've changed life forever for all of us,"" Nolan continued. ""And I really got hooked on the story.""

While penning the screenplay for the 3-hour historical epic, Nolan drew on American Prometheus (the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography about the life and career of J. Robert Oppenheimer written by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin). His notorious commitment to realism was taken to a new level here with the insistence that the Trinity test be recreated without the use of CGI imagery.
""Doing real-world effects and having us out in the desert with the actors, waiting for this incredible moment, it gave us some small feeling of what it must have been like to be there for the original detonation,"" Nolan said. ""It was thrilling and terrifying and beautiful and dangerous — all in equal measure.""

In addition to writing and directing, he also produced the feature alongside Emma Thomas (Nolan's wife and co-founder of their Syncopy production banner) and Charles Roven. J. David Wargo, James Woods, and Thomas Hayslip are executive producers.

,Oppenheimer Almost Discovered Black Holes Before He Became ‘Destroyer of Worlds’,"Before leading the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer co-authored a paper explaining that the most massive stars must eventually become what we would now call a black hole","J. Robert Oppenheimer (right) applied the principles of general relativity developed by Albert Einstein (left) to determine that what we now know as a black hole can form under certain circumstances.
Before leading the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer co-authored a paper explaining that the most massive stars must eventually become what we would now call a black hole
J. Robert Oppenheimer, now the protagonist of a much-anticipated film hitting theaters on July 21, is today most known for his scientific leadership of the U.S. Manhattan Project, the World War II–era crash program to build the first-ever atomic bombs. But just a few years earlier, Oppenheimer had found himself pondering very different “weapons” of mass destruction: black holes—although it would be decades before that name arose.
“It was influential; it was visionary,” says Feryal Özel, an astrophysicist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, of Oppenheimer’s work on black holes and neutron stars, the superdense corpses of expired massive stars. “He has a lasting impact.” Özel is a founding member of the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration, which released the first-ever image of a black hole in 2019—80 years after Oppenheimer co-authored a paper theorizing that such objects could exist.
Özel isn’t the only leading modern physicist to admire Oppenheimer’s work on black holes. “It stands up completely; there are no flaws,” says Kip Thorne, an emeritus professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology. Thorne won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017 for his work with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), which in 2015 detected gravitational waves from two colliding black holes. “It went so far beyond anything that anybody else had ever done,” Thorne says of Oppenheimer’s “tour de force” paper exploring black holes, which runs only five pages long. “It is amazing what is contained there.”
Oppenheimer’s brief foray into astrophysics began with a 1938 paper about neutron stars, which continued in a 1939 installment that further incorporated the principles of Einstein’s general theory of relativity. He then published a third paper on black holes on September 1, 1939—but at the time, it was scarcely noticed because this was the very day Germany invaded Poland, launching World War II. Oppenheimer never wrote on the topic again.
Even if it hadn’t been overshadowed by war, Oppenheimer’s work on neutron stars and black holes “was not understood to be terribly significant at the time,” says Cathryn Carson, a historian of science at the University of California, Berkeley.
Each paper was written with a different member of the swarm of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars that Oppenheimer carefully cultivated. These protégés facilitated his ability to jump between research topics—and ultimately, according to Thorne and others, represent one of his most important contributions to physics.
Oppenheimer’s climactic third paper, written with his student Hartland Snyder, explores the implications of general relativity on the universe’s most massive stars. Although the physicists needed to include some assumptions to simplify the question, they determined that a large enough star would gravitationally collapse indefinitely—and within a finite amount of time, meaning that the objects we now know as black holes could exist.
“Eventually there should emerge what we would now call a singularity at the origin, a point of infinite density where, in some sense, spacetime itself rips, and there should become what we would now call an event horizon,” says David Kaiser, a physicist and historian of science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “This is all in that paper—not in the modern vocabulary, but the mathematics is absolutely recognizable to us today.”
In the decades since Oppenheimer and Snyder’s black hole bombshell, scientists have confirmed that the same principles hold even without the simplifying assumptions initially put in place. Thorne says that the paper is particularly staggering, given contemporary work from an even more famous physicist—the one who developed general relativity in the first place.
“[Albert] Einstein published almost simultaneously a paper in which he argued that you cannot have a star or any object shrink to the size of what we now call the gravitational radius or the size of a black hole,” Thorne says. “Einstein was completely wrong.”
But despite the merit of Oppenheimer and Snyder’s work on black holes, the topic simmered on physicists’ back burner for decades—and today is perhaps best known as a sobering example of how brilliant ideas can be overlooked, says Manuel Ortega-Rodríguez, a theoretical physicist at the University of Costa Rica.
“It struck me as really, really interesting and fascinating and scary that such an idea was there for like 25 years, and nobody paid attention,” he says. “That means that today we could have an equally revolutionary idea right now that the community is ignoring.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVudGlmaWNhbWVyaWNhbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1hbG1vc3QtZGlzY292ZXJlZC1ibGFjay1ob2xlcy1iZWZvcmUtaGUtYmVjYW1lLWRlc3Ryb3llci1vZi13b3JsZHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 08:35:09.427000+00:00,Remember ‘Manhattan’: The TV Show That Told the ‘Oppenheimer’ Story First,“Manhattan” told the story of the atomic bomb back when “Mad Men” and “The Americans” were the coolest shows on TV. The only problem was that no one watched it.,"Going as far back as last summer when the first ominous countdown clock teaser debuted, every single time I see footage of Oppenheimer, it has made me want to rewatch the overlooked two-season historical drama Manhattan. And what better way to prepare for Christopher Nolan’s highly anticipated summer blockbuster than with a canceled-too-soon TV series packed with actors who have since become recognizable favorites?
Sam Shaw’s Manhattan debuted in 2014 on WGN America, when the quintessential antihero who was a complex period character was the hottest trend in TV. It didn’t matter if they were based on real people or entirely fictitious, as long as they were complicated. Think “I can fix him,” before that phrase entered the popular lexicon.
Mad Men was heading toward its conclusion, and every network was looking for the next Don Draper. In 2013, The Americans hid a marriage story inside a spy narrative, utilizing the last decade of the Cold War as a backdrop for different interpretations of loyalty and patriotism. Halt and Catch Fire premiered the month before Manhattan, adding to this trend with its exploration of the rise of computers in the 1980s and the prickly geniuses who were making waves.
The TV landscape has fundamentally changed in the nine years since that summer. Anyone would be hard-pressed to remember what other original dramas aired on the now-defunct WGN network (Underground, Salem, and Outsiders). In fact, I misremembered that Manhattan had aired on AMC, thanks to it fitting the brand and because it can now be found on AMC+ (along with Hoopla, Tubi, and Freevee). That’s not to mention that WGN America is a name I haven’t heard in years.
Even in 2014, Kevin Fallon wrote in his glowing Manhattan review for The Daily Beast that “most TV consumers have no idea what the hell WGN America is.” This was spot-on, considering it was canceled after its second season. (Nine years later, another prophecy from Fallon in the same review has come to pass: “It raises the question of whether there really just may be too much television these days.”)
In 2021, casting news announcing that Cillian Murphy would switch his Peaky Blinders newsboy cap for a J. Robert Oppenheimer’s porkpie hat in Nolan’s latest project was the catalyst that led to me finally catching up with the hidden gem. That same October, I binged both seasons (totaling 23 episodes) in under a week, something I recently repeated in lieu of going outside over the holiday weekend. It had completely slipped my mind that the Manhattan pilot opens on July 2, 1943, and includes an Independence Day celebration at the top-secret location in the middle of the New Mexico desert. Insert the ‘Leo pointing’ meme here to reflect my lack of chill when I saw the date and realized the coincidence.
So what is Manhattan, and why should you check it out?
Spoiler alert: light spoilers for Manhattan and some historical spoilers for Oppenheimer follow.
A radio report playing over the opening scene paints a bleak picture of the casualty list “on the eve of another Independence Day,” an onscreen graphic states that 61 countries are at war, there are more than 40 million casualties, and it is 766 days before Hiroshima. A yet unnamed figure plays golf using his car's headlamps as his only light source in the dusty, dark setting before having a eureka moment. Soon, we learn that WWI veteran Dr. Frank Winter (John Benjamin Hickey) is a brilliant physicist who doesn’t play by the rules and ruffles all the wrong feathers within this government facility. While this archetype is overplayed, Frank’s journey takes unexpected deviations in exploring the ethics of a weapon with the power to vaporize cities—and Hickey delivers a deeply nuanced performance.
Frank leads one team of scientists within the top-secret Manhattan Project, tasked with developing an atomic bomb. Los Alamos, New Mexico, was originally home to a ranch school and was subsequently acquired by the military. A town was erected in its place to accommodate these experts, their families, and the men in uniform sent to keep a watchful eye over proceedings—and to ensure no secrets ended up in the hands of Nazis or the Soviets. In 1943, Los Alamos opened its doors to what was originally meant to be a small community, but two years later, its population hit 4,000 civilians and 2,000 servicemen.
It doesn’t take a scientific genius to realize that an isolated town focused on the war effort with an average age of 25 years old (as per American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, which is the inspiration for Nolan’s movie) is the ideal backdrop for a big-budget movie or a TV show. Manhattan’s heady mix of politically charged storylines, subterfuge, and relationships crumbling under the stress of this isolated environment makes it a community worth exploring.
“This is not going to be a Great Men of History piece,” creator Shaw said at the Manhattan TCA panel in 2014. Whereas Nolan’s forthcoming movie places the father of the atomic bomb front and center, Robert Oppenheimer (Daniel London) only appears in a third of the episodes and is rarely at the heart of the events. Instead, the majority of the characters are fictitious, allowing Shaw greater scope for dialing up the drama while also exploring the scientific methodology and ethical debates that go hand-in-hand with research that can destroy the world. (Figures who worked on the project and even tried to oppose it do provide inspiration for the likes of Frank.)
Two bombs were designed in New Mexico, and Shaw’s series pits the two teams against each other in the race to make a successful weapon. Maverick Frank heads the rag-tag “implosion” team, relegated to a rustic hut, whereas hotshot young scientist Charlie Isaacs (Ashley Zukerman) immediately gains entry to the main building. Charlie has been selected as an integral part of the “Thin Man” group and is working on a gun model mechanism. Don’t worry; you don’t need a degree in quantum physics to understand the series, although it also doesn’t overly dumb down the science—much like how shows like ER use medical jargon while still effectively conveying what is unfolding.
Frank is unimpressed by Charlie’s genius, and this bristling dynamic is an ongoing push-and-pull threading through the two seasons. Zuckerman is most recognizable as Succession’s Nate, and here he gets to play the shades of gray of a man tasked with creating a weapon of mass destruction.
While Los Alamos did have similar amenities as a typical town in the 1940s and encouraged social activities, workers were forbidden from discussing the details of their “day at the office” with their spouses. Therefore, without small talk about work as an option, sex became an easy way to bridge the lack of communication. What followed was the need for a robust maternity ward as the number of babies born at this location was 80 in the first year alone and 10 per month after that—any person born here has PO Box 1663 as their birthplace. Manhattan acknowledges this trend and the horniness of its scientists and wives. Wandering eyes are also part of this environment, with Charlie and his wife, Abby (Rachel Brosnahan), straying when other conversation fails.
The message here is that scientists fuck, which Nolan’s movie also endorses (The Guardian first reported that the film includes “prolonged nudity”).
Oppenheimer’s messy romantic entanglements have been teased as part of the press tour (though Murphy mentioned a NDA prohibiting the cast from detailing overall specifics of the film, and honestly, I’m all for the surprise). In Manhattan, Robert’s relationship with former fiancée Jean Tatlock propels Brosnahan’s nosy switchboard operator’s story forward in the second season. It also speaks to a wider conspiracy theory that has never been resolved—which I won’t get into here because of spoilers, but feel free to look it up. Suffice it to say Manhattan leans into the most sensationalist take on this story.
From the trailer, Oppenheimer appears to have a “getting the gang together” tone, whereas the TV series throws us into the story after Los Alamos has been constructed. Aside from the obvious similarities when using the same historical event, these two titles boast a cast of actors you instantly recognize from a slew of other projects. Manhattan is a character actor paradise, boasting the aforementioned Hickey, Zukerman, and Brosnahan, as well as other TV faves like Olivia Williams, David Harbour, Harry Lloyd (aka Tom Hiddleston’s clone), a pre-Evil Katja Herbers, the always delightful Michael Chernus, The West Wing’s Richard Schiff and William Petersen.
This list barely scratches the surface, and you should be on the lookout for guest stars Griffin Dunne, Mamie Gummer, Justin Kirk, Jason Ralph (Brosnahan’s now-husband), and the never-misses Bill Camp. Christopher Denham has the honor of playing a series regular in Manhattan and a role in Oppenheimer, and there is a thematic thread between both characters.
“We never saw this show as Law and Order: Atomic Bomb—like it was going to be ripped from the headlines of history,” Shaw told Vox after the Season 2 finale. Sadly, that episode would become the series finale as WGN America didn’t renew Manhattan. Coming to shows late makes it harder to get annoyed about a canceled-too-soon title (“It’s me, hi, I’m the problem, it’s me”). While Shaw’s story was exploring the past, it was caught between the critically acclaimed period darlings like Mad Men and The Americans.
Manhattan’s success was no doubt impacted by debuting on a platform that no one had heard of, when curious eyes had already turned to Netflix. In this case, it is not too late, as there is time to add Manhattan to your summer viewing lineup, whether you watch it before or after Nolan’s epic—or with Barbie thrown in the explosive mix. (We understand if Barbie is your first priority this weekend.)

2023-07-30 10:00:08+00:00,Opinion | What ‘Oppenheimer’ Doesn’t Tell You About the Trinity Test,"As a new generation of Americans learns about the world’s first nuclear test, the people who lived through it are being left out of the story again.","The area of southern New Mexico where the Trinity test occurred was not, contrary to the popular account, an uninhabited, desolate expanse of land. There were more than 13,000 New Mexicans living within a 50-mile radius. Many of those children, women and men were not warned before or after the test. Eyewitnesses have told me they believed they were experiencing the end of the world. They didn’t reflect on the Bhagavad Gita, as Oppenheimer said he did. Many simply dropped to their knees and recited the Hail Mary in Spanish.
For days after, they said, ash fell from the sky, contaminated with 10 pounds of plutonium. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that after the test, radiation levels near some homes in the area reached “almost 10,000 times what is currently allowed in public areas.”
That fallout has had devastating health consequences. While I know of no people who lost their lives during the test, the organization I co-founded has documented many instances of families in New Mexico with four and five generations of cancers since the bomb was detonated. My family is typical: I am the fourth generation in my family to have had cancer since 1945. My 23-year-old niece has just been diagnosed with thyroid cancer. She is a college student studying art. Now her life, too, has been upended.
Despite this, New Mexicans who may have been exposed to radioactive fallout from Trinity have never been eligible for compensation under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a 1990 federal law that has provided billions of dollars to people exposed during subsequent tests on U.S. soil or during uranium mining.
“Oppenheimer” leaves out other stories, too. The Manhattan Project and the nuclear weapons industry used the promise of a better life to entice thousands of people in the Southwest into the uranium mines that supplied the Manhattan Project. The miners went to work each day without adequate safety gear, while supervisors wore it from head to toe. Miners seldom left the mines during their shifts, even to eat lunch. They drank the contaminated water inside the mines when they were allowed to take breaks.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMzAvb3Bpbmlvbi9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXdvcmxkL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLW51Y2xlYXItYm9tYi1jYW5jZXIuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-04 09:00:00-04:00,How Have Nuclear Weapons Evolved Since Oppenheimer and the Trinity Test?,"Despite the danger posed by nuclear weapons, the US continues programs to build new ones.","It took the Manhattan project three years to develop a nuclear bomb: and only weeks between the first nuclear test explosion and the use of a nuclear weapon in war. Almost 80 years later – how have nuclear weapons evolved?
A brief history of nuclear testing
In 1945, the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan. The first bomb, codenamed “Little Boy” was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945.Three days later, the US dropped the second bomb, “Fat Man,” on Nagasaki. The two bombs, each with an estimated yield of around 15 and 21 kilotons (15,000 and 21,000 tons of TNT equivalent), respectively, caused widespread destruction, resulting in the loss of more than 100,000 lives.
After the war, the US conducted atmospheric nuclear tests in the Pacific Proving Grounds in the Marshall Islands and in Nevada and many more underground. The Soviet Union, Great Britain, France, China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea tested nuclear weapons of their own. Since the first development of nuclear weapons, the total number of nuclear tests exceeds 2,000, with 528 tests conducted above ground. These above ground tests had a destructive force of more than 400,000 kilotons TNT. The tests provided the information to increase the sophistication of nuclear weapons designs. But the nuclear tests, and particularly the atmospheric tests, were enormously destructive to the land and communities that were exposed to their explosive power and radiation.
Timeline of nuclear weapons tests
The largest bomb ever made

Today’s modern nuclear warheads have undergone significant advancements in terms of design, technology, and destructive power. Notably, modern warheads are almost exclusively thermonuclear bombs, or hydrogen (H) bombs, which use both fusion and fission reactions to generate higher release of energy – tens of kilotons to several megatons TNT equivalent, or tens of times more powerful than the early atomic bombs. These bombs essentially use an atomic bomb as a trigger for the powerful fusion explosion.

The largest nuclear weapon to ever been tested, Tsar Bomba, had an estimated yield of 50 megatons (although it had a capacity double that) – an explosive yield greater than that of the Little Boy by a factor of 3,500. Literally translated as “King of bombs,” this monster atomic bomb, designed by the Soviet Union, generated a fireball that reached a diameter of 4 km (2.5 miles), and a mushroom cloud that rose over 60 km (40 miles) into the atmosphere. The blast wave was felt over 1,000 km away (over 620 miles), and its shockwave was detected 4,000 km away from its source, or nearly 2,500 miles away. To illustrate the increased scale of destructive power, if the same bomb dropped on Hiroshima was detonated in a major US city like New York City, 264,000 lives will be lost, along with 512,000 injuries. Tsar Bomba, on the same city, would kill more than 7.6 million people while injuring additional 4.2 million (Figure 2).

Notably, however, such weapons are too large to be considered ‘operational’. Tsar Bomba, for example, weighed 27 tons with a size of 8 meters length and 2 meters diameter – making it impractical to be deployed in a ballistic missile.

Smaller, lighter, faster

Nuclear states have not just pursued larger and more powerful weapons. They have pushed to make weapons that are lighter and more compact, so that they can be carried in multiples, and lower yield, so that they can plausibly be used on a battlefield.

60 years after the biggest nuclear test, nuclear weapons have become smaller and more compact – a process of miniaturization that allows integration into various delivery systems. Some modern weapons are also designed with multiple warheads, with enhanced precision for guidance and targeting systems, allowing a single delivery vehicle to carry multiple independent nuclear payloads.

Alongside high-yield strategic nuclear weapons, there has been significant development of non-strategic, or tactical nuclear weapons designed for limited use scenarios. These weapons are generally of lower yield and intended for use on the battlefield i.e., strikes against relatively close and specific targets that minimize collateral damage affecting the civilian population. But despite sometimes being referred to as “small nukes”, these weapons still cause devastating destruction. The explosive yield of tactical nuclear weapons today ranges from anywhere below one kt to above 100 kt: the high-end surpasses the yield of Little Boy and Fat Man by up to five times. Despite the lower yield and smaller size, the use of tactical nuclear weapons carries a high risk of escalation from potential misinterpretation, miscalculation, or an unintended response from adversaries, all of which can lead to a full-scale nuclear war. The availability of weapons, especially at low yields designed to facilitate battlefield use, increases the probability of their use in a conflict scenario.

In addition to the nuclear weapons themselves, the nuclear weapons state and non-weapons state have invested heavily in many delivery systems – strategic missile and conventional missile capabilities, as well as in missile defense systems. Nuclear strategists and scientists have long argued that the development and deployment of missile defense systems are ineffective against determined adversaries, but the US budget requested for $10.9 billion to strengthen and expand the deployment of missile defenses in 2023. Such development of missile defense systems has potential for encouraging an arms race dynamic and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty’s role in trying to arrest that dynamic.

Almost 80 years after the first nuclear weapon was dropped on Japan, there hasn’t been any use of nuclear weapons on another country. But since then, nuclear states accumulated as many as 60,000 weapons in total at one time, and currently the nine states possessing nuclear weapons have approximately 13,000 nuclear weapons, with US and Russia accounting for almost 90% of the inventory These modern nuclear warheads are significantly more lethal compared to the atomic bombs used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The radius of devastation and the resulting blast effects, such as firestorms, radioactive fallout, and thermal radiation, would be significantly larger, amplifying the casualties and long-term environmental and health consequences. Despite the danger posed by nuclear weapons, the US continues programs to build new nuclear weapons, including a nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles (SLCM-N).

Arms control and nuclear warheads over time for the US and Russia/USSR.

The use of nuclear weapons would have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and geopolitical consequences. As we continue to invest and enhance nuclear weapons technologically, the global community continues to grapple with the challenges and risks associated with their existence. The pursuit of disarmament, nonproliferation, arms control, and diplomatic dialogues remains more crucial today than ever in promoting peace and global security.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYmxvZy51Y3N1c2Eub3JnL3N1bGdpeWUtcGFyay9ob3ctaGF2ZS1udWNsZWFyLXdlYXBvbnMtZXZvbHZlZC1zaW5jZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1hbmQtdGhlLXRyaW5pdHktdGVzdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"As ‘Oppenheimer’ Opens, Here’s How Chicago Gave Birth to the Nuclear Age","“Oppenheimer,” the much-anticipated blockbuster from Batman director Christopher Nolan, hits movie theaters this week.

The story has deep connections to Chicago — specifically the University of Chicago — and the Manhattan Project that led to the development of the first atomic bomb.

Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors

Below is a Q&A with John Mark Hansen, professor of political science at the University of Chicago who has done extensive research on the birth of the nuclear age in Hyde Park’s “atomic village.”

(The interview has been edited for length and clarity.)

WTTW News: How did Chicago come to be the epicenter of research to make a self-sustaining nuclear reaction — the first step toward making an atomic bomb?

John Mark Hansen: Well, it was largely happenstance. The happenstance was that when the authorities in Washington who had been working on the development of nuclear power after the creation of the Manhattan Project in 1939, they decided that they would designate the first stage in the project to be under the direction of Arthur Compton, who was a professor of physics here at the University of Chicago and Nobel laureate, the chair of the physics department and the dean of the physical sciences division. And it was Compton then who within a month or so made the decision to gather all of the people he needed for that first stage of the project in Chicago. And so he was the one who asked Fermi and his group to come to Chicago.

Tell me a little bit about why Compton, because obviously, there are so many names that we are familiar with. We’re familiar with Oppenheimer. Obviously, we’re familiar with the Fermi. I don’t think as many people would know Compton. Why was Compton the man designated to get this project off the ground?

Hansen: Well, Compton was part of a group of physicists who were involved in an earlier project called the Uranium Project. He was asked by the government authorities in 1941 to produce a report about the feasibility of creating an atomic weapon and what the timetable would look like. So he was the chair of that committee, and I think it was kind of a natural extension then to ask him to be the one to lead it.

You’ve written about Hyde Park’s “atomic village.” Did the scientists talk about it in those terms at the time or is that something applied in retrospect? Is that how they thought of themselves?

Hansen: No, not really. That’s a name that I have given it in retrospect. You know, there were atomic villages that were built at Oak Ridge in Tennessee, at Hanford, in Washington and at Los Alamos in New Mexico. What I thought interesting about the group of scientists assembled here was that they weren’t segregated off from the rest of society the way they were at the other three sites. They lived out in the community and they did their work on a college campus not in a specially designed laboratory.

I can understand why they isolated the folks at Los Alamos and the other places you mentioned for security reasons. So why didn’t they do that in terms of the folks who were working in Chicago? It just seems like it would be a huge security risk.

Hansen: Well, part of it was just that they needed to get this going fast and they didn’t have anything built yet. So that’s one answer. Another answer is that they had originally, or Compton himself had originally wanted, to build the nuclear reactor that achieved the first sustainable chain reaction in 1942 — he had originally wanted to put that out at in part of the Argonne Woods Forest Preserve out in Palos Park. But the contractor didn’t get it done on time. And so it ended up being done under the West Grandstand of Stagg Field here on the campus just because they didn’t want to further delay the project.

Did all of the scientists who were working on the project have a clear notion that the end goal was to create a weapon?

Hansen: Every scientist who had a significant responsibility knew that that was the end point.

So after the first chain reaction had been achieved in Chicago, did many of the folks who were working in Chicago, were they transferred to Los Alamos?

Hansen: Yes. So a significant number were and there was a group that went to Oak Ridge, there was a group that went to Hanford and there was a group that went to Los Alamos. Oftentimes, on the way to Los Alamos, having been either at Oak Ridge or at Hanford in between.

It seems a very short period of development to go from that first chain reaction to within, I think it was 2.5 years, the Trinity test. How was that possible? Was it the fact that the government was just throwing so much in terms of personnel and money at this project?

Hansen: Well, a big part of it was that there was no expense that was spared in developing the bomb. But I would also say that Compton in his report about the timetable to the development of the bomb pretty much called it exactly right. He said that the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction could probably be achieved by early 1943 and the first battlefield weapons by sometime in 1945. So, it was anticipated even years in advance that that would be about the amount of time that would be required.

Obviously Oppenheimer himself was famously conflicted about this power he had helped to develop. Was that shared by many of his colleagues? I assume there was a range of opinions — they had achieved this incredible objective and created a weapon that ultimately did end the war. How did they feel about it?

Hansen: Well, as one might imagine, I think that there were differences in the degree to which the scientists who were involved in it felt conflicted. There were many scientists who were involved in the project who wish that we’d gotten there earlier so that the bomb might have played a role in ending the war in Europe sooner. A large number of the scientists in fact emigrated from Europe, many of them Germans who had been forced out of Germany by the Nazi regime. Many of them were Jewish and had relatives who perished and certainly friends who perished in the Holocaust. You know, on the other side, there were many scientists who were concerned not so much about having participated in the development of the bomb but not having any control over how that knowledge and how that science would be used.

So here at the Metallurgical Lab at the University of Chicago, starting in 1944, there was a major effort by the scientists to begin to sound alarms and to convince the government to begin to think about how to put in place controls over the development and use of nuclear energy. There was a lot of concern even in 1944 about the prospect of an arms race once it became known that there was such a thing as an atomic bomb. And that led in 1945 and into 1946 into a sustained effort on the part of the atomic scientists led by the people here at the Met lab to create a governance structure for nuclear energy development that would be accountable to democratically elected public officials and be accountable to the public.

In terms of the film, I don’t know whether you’ve had a chance to see it yet, but do you think the interest it has generated in the story of Oppenheimer and the development of the atomic bomb — is it a good thing that people are relearning this history?

Hansen: I think so. It certainly is going to raise awareness of the continuing issues of nuclear proliferation and of the prospects of nuclear confrontations — probably not in the places that we once thought about, but rather in places like South Asia or in East Asia. So that’s one thing I. I think the other thing it really puts on the agenda is the questions about the dangers in the development of technology and how one contains those dangers. And those are still with us. You know there are lots of technologies out there that could have far-reaching social effects and sort of bringing back to the public’s attention the way in which nuclear scientists really wrestled with the dictates of their conscience at the same time that they were developing these technologies I think that has many lessons for us as well.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and other organizations are hosting a special showing of “Oppenheimer” at the Music Box Theatre on July 29, followed by a post-movie panel conversation.

2023-06-29 18:19:02+00:00,Will Christoper Nolan’s ‘Oppenheimer’ Get a Theatrical Release in Japan?,"Christopher Nolan's historical epic ""Oppenheimer"" hasn't finalized release plans in Japan.","Christopher Nolan‘s historical epic “Oppenheimer,” about the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II, is preparing for a massive global debut next month. As of now, though, the film’s distributor Universal has yet to announce when — or if — it will premiere in Japan.

A spokesperson for the studio says “plans have not been finalized in all markets.” Universal is releasing the $100 million-budgeted “Oppenheimer” in the U.S. and much of the rest of the world on July 21.

The situation in Japan is complicated given the film’s subject matter and the devastation the bombs wrought on the country. “Oppenheimer” centers on American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), who led the efforts to build the weapons of mass destruction that ended the war. Approximately 200,000 Japanese civilians died after two atomic bombs were dropped in 1945 over the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Though the movie’s focus may not be enough to prevent the country from playing “Oppenheimer” in its theaters, if it does secure a release date, it’s not clear that Japanese moviegoers will be interested in seeing a film about the topic.

Other American-backed movies set in the Pacific theater of World War II have played in Japanese cinemas — though to mixed results. Hugh Jackman’s 2013 “X-Men” movie “The Wolverine,” which had a sequence involving the bombing of Nagasaki, generated a muted $7.9 million. Meanwhile, the Japanese-language “Letters From Iwo Jima” ($42.9 million), the second of Clint Eastwood’s 2006 companion pieces, earned far more than “Flags of Our Fathers” ($13.1 million), which recounted the same battle from the American perspective. “Oppenheimer,” sources say, differs from those films in that it is a talky R-rated drama that is largely set in laboratories and the halls of American government, not the battlefield.

Whether “Oppenheimer” will play in Japan comes down to Toho-Towa, the country’s biggest distributor of Hollywood films. The company has yet to screen the movie but is expected to do so soon.

There are other factors that make Japan a unique moviegoing market. Unlike most territories, Hollywood studios have influence but not the final say in when its movies will open in Japan. It’s also often the last country to release Hollywood films, in part because marketing efforts are highly structured. It’s not unusual for American-made movies to debut in Japan months later than they do in North America. And those plans are usually late to come together.

That said, two other major tentpoles that are premiering domestically in July have already been given release dates in Japan. Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” is set for Aug. 11 and Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” lands on July 21.

Nolan’s films, including “The Dark Knight” trilogy, as well as “Inception,” “Interstellar,” “Dunkirk” and “Tenet,” tend to make a huge portion of their money at the international box office. That may not be the case with a firmly American story like “Oppenheimer,” which studio sources believe will be more popular with U.S. moviegoers than foreign crowds. Japan, one of the top moviegoing markets, has been a modest territory for Nolan’s prior efforts. His two most recent releases, “Tenet” and “Dunkirk,” grossed $25 million and $14.8 million respectively in the country’s cinemas.

Nolan, who shot the movie in 70mm with Imax cameras, has stressed the importance of “Oppenheimer,” arguing that the aftershocks of the technology reverberates to this day.

“Like it or not, J. Robert Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived,” Nolan said at CinemaCon, the annual convention for movie theater owners. “He made the world that we live in for better or for worse. His story has to be seen to be believed.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2Uvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tdGhlYXRyaWNhbC1yZWxlYXNlLWphcGFuLTEyMzU2NDU3NTIv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vYm94LW9mZmljZS9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi10aGVhdHJpY2FsLXJlbGVhc2UtamFwYW4tMTIzNTY0NTc1Mi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 16:29:57+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’ sparks nuclear debate. Will Congress join in?,A few are skipping all the Oppenheimer vs. Barbie memes and trying to seize the moment to promote their legislation.,"As a wave of “Oppenheimer” vs. “Barbie” memes washed over the internet this week, members of Congress tried to ride it, joining in the fun. But a few struck a more serious tone. With nuclear policy back in popular conversation for the first time in years, lawmakers with a long-standing interest in the topic wondered how to seize the moment.

Sen. Edward J. Markey saw an opportunity to promote his proposal to ban AI from launching nuclear weapons, touting a meeting with one of the creative forces behind “Oppenheimer.”

The Massachusetts Democrat met with Kai Bird, whose Pulitzer Prize-winning book helped inspire Christopher Nolan to make his moody summer opus.

“I’m honored that Kai Bird has endorsed my legislation to ensure the robots never have their finger on the nuclear trigger,” Markey said in a statement, adding that he hopes senators will take it seriously as they work to finish their version of the annual defense policy bill.

Nolan’s movie offers a three-hour tour of the ethical and political history of America’s nuclear weapons program, following the tortured journey of J. Robert Oppenheimer, often called the father of the atomic bomb. It is based on the 2005 biography that Bird co-wrote with Martin J. Sherwin, “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.”

Markey said he sees an AI arms race beginning that recalls the nuclear arms race of the last century, and he wants public officials to remember that Oppenheimer “created a monster he ultimately could not contain.”

The summer movie release, which sparked a frenzy on Friday as it competed with the equally anticipated “Barbie” from director Greta Gerwig, was met with disappointment from advocates who had hoped it would acknowledge the lingering effects of the Manhattan Project and its testing program for people in New Mexico.

Sen. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., echoed those concerns, pointing to the “Downwinders and post-71 uranium mine workers” in his home state whose stories didn’t make it into Nolan’s biopic.

“With so much interest in Oppenheimer and the Trinity Test, this is an opportunity to educate millions of Americans that nearly eight decades later, New Mexicans are still dealing with the impacts of radiation exposure,” Luján said in an emailed statement.

The Democrat reupped calls to expand the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, the 1990 law that compensates some people who contracted cancer after nuclear contact. But he suggested the hoopla surrounding the movie hadn’t done much to advance the cause.

“It’s the sad truth that too many have died from the radioactive fallout from these decades-old tests. And I’ll be very candid, I’m worried folks aren’t really focused on the negative consequences of the Oppenheimer nuclear tests,” he tweeted.

Meanwhile, other lawmakers were jumping on the meme bandwagon on social media, playing along as people tried to guess who would see “Oppenheimer” and who would see “Barbie.”

“To everyone assuming I’m going to Oppenheimer, I say: why not both?” tweeted Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.

Oppenheimer led the Los Alamos Laboratory during the Manhattan Project in the 1940s, as scientists developed the nuclear weapons that the United States would use to end World War II and change the course of human history.

Reigniting public debate was part of Nolan’s goal, the director has said, and he has tried to position the movie somewhere between a typical Hollywood blockbuster and a high-minded work of art.

At a panel this month marking the anniversary of the Trinity test, NBC News host Chuck Todd invited Nolan to imagine screening the movie for members of Congress and asked him what he would want them to learn.

“Our relationship with the fear of nuclear weapons ebbs and flows with the geopolitical situation, and it shouldn’t, because the threat is constant,” Nolan replied. “When you look back at history, some of the closest moments to nuclear disaster have actually been in times of relative calm geopolitically. So even though the situation in Ukraine kind of puts it more in the forefront of people’s minds, the truth is, nuclear weapons are an extraordinarily dangerous thing to have lying around the house.”

Nolan warned against forgetting the weapons exist or taking them lightly.

“One of the things that frightens me the most … [is] when I hear in the media reasonable people talking about ‘tactical nuclear weapons,’ as if this distinction can be made … [with] politicians and media sort of warming us up to the idea that perhaps there’s a certain size of nuclear weapon that would be acceptable as opposed to large ones,” he said.

Oppenheimer himself was eager to remind people that nuclear weapons didn’t happen by accident and that developing technology is a matter of policy, not destiny.

“We have greatly developed and greatly increased our atomic activities. This growth, though natural technically, is not inevitable,” he wrote in 1953. “If the Congress had appropriated no money, it would not have occurred.”

The BAFTA-winning series aired on the BBC more than 40 years ago and is available from today as a boxset on the VoD player.

Sam Waterston was the Cillian Murphy of the series, starring as the titular scientist as he led the weapons laboratory of the Manhattan Project, all the while under constant surveillance by the FBI because of his left wing politics and association with communists. As with Nolan’s movie, the show followed his role in developing the world’s first nuclear weapons and his rivalry with Edward Teller, through to being stripped of his security clearance by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in the 1950s. David Suchet, Kate Harper, John Carson, Christopher Munke and Jana Shelden also starred.

The show catapulted Waterston to fame, as he went on to land roles in Law and Order, The Newsroom, and Grace & Frankie. It aired in the U.S. on PBS’ American Playhouse and won three BAFTAs including Best Drama Series, while being nominated for seven.

The BBC’s move comes as Oppenheimer tears up the global box office alongside Barbie. Deadline’s latest box office report had Universal‘s opus at $405.6M global and more is expected this weekend during the second ‘Barbenheimer’ holdover.

A scene in the film “Oppenheimer,” in which the physicist is quoting a Bhagavad Gita verse while making love, has upset some Hindus. The information commissioner of the Indian government, Uday Mahurkar, said in an open letter the scene was a “direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus” and alleged that it amounted to “waging a war on the Hindu community.” He also said that it almost appeared to be “part of a larger conspiracy by anti-Hindu forces.”

It is hard to say how many Hindus were offended by the Gita quote in a sexually charged scene, but there were those who disagreed with the views expressed in the tweet. Pavan K. Varma, a former diplomat, wrote that the controversy was a “misplaced outrage.”

Some others were not offended, just disappointed that the context of the lines quoted from the Bhagavad Gita was not brought out well. I should also add that Hindu texts composed over 1,000 years, starting around the sixth century B.C.E., have Sanskrit mantras for every occasion, including reciting some ritually before having sex. But they are context-specific, and certainly the Bhagavad Gita would not be used.

Overall, the controversy brought attention to the words quoted by J. Robert Oppenheimer while looking at the erupting fireball from the atomic bomb explosion in Los Alamos, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945: “Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” These words are a a paraphrase of Bhagavad Gita 11:32 where Krishna, an avatar of Vishnu – whom many Hindus think of as the supreme being – says that he is kala, or time.

Kala also means “death.” Oppenheimer’s teacher, Arthur Ryder, a professor of Sanskrit at the University of California, Berkeley, had translated the verse as “Death am I, and my present task Destruction.”

Beyond the sex squabble, the biopic can be a good starting point to understand how Oppenheimer’s deep knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita and other Sanskrit texts helped him with his assignment in New Mexico. It can also be a catalyst for the public to have some hard conversations about weapons of mass destruction.

Wisdom of the Gita and the Panchatantra

As an undergraduate at Harvard University, Oppenheimer read Hindu texts in translation, but at Berkeley, he learned Sanskrit from Ryder, meeting in his teacher’s home on long winter evenings. On Oct. 7, 1933, he wrote to his brother Frank that he had been reading the Gita with two other Sanskritists.

This text was special to Oppenheimer, more than other books. He called it “the most beautiful philosophical song existing in any known tongue,” and he gave copies to friends. When talking at a memorial service for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, he quoted his own translation of Bhagavad Gita 17:3, “Man is a creature whose substance is faith. What his faith is, he is.”

Oppenheimer’s reaction, when he looked at the mighty explosion, seems to be close to what the German theologian Rudolf Otto called “numinous” – a combination of awe and fascination at this majesty. His reaction was to think of the Bhagavad Gita’s verse 11:12: “If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one.”

Oppenheimer also read many other Sanskrit texts, including the fifth-century Sanskrit poet Kalidasa’s “Cloud Messenger,” or “Meghaduta,” and his letters show familiarity with “The Three Hundred Poems of Moral Values,” or the “Satakatrayam,” a work from the sixth century C.E. From his quoting the text in many contexts, he seems to have been fond of the Panchatantra,“ a text of animal fables with pragmatic morals. Ryder, Oppenheimer’s Sanskrit mentor, had also translated this book of charming stories with sometimes cynical messages.

Oppenheimer’s familiarity with the Panchatantra is also evident in the naming of his new car Garuda, after the eagle-vehicle of Lord Vishnu. He explained the name to his brother, not with the bird’s well-known connection with Vishnu, but by alluding to a lesser-known story from the Panchatantra, in which a carpenter makes a wooden flying vehicle shaped like the mythical Garuda for his friend.

Oppenheimer loved a Sanskrit epigram from the Panchatantra: ""Scholarship is less than sense, therefore seek intelligence.” The line is a rueful reflection at the end of a story in which four men go to seek their fortune.

Three of them were learned scholars who held the fourth in low esteem. On their path, they came across some bones. On seeing those, the first, believing the bones to be of a lion, said that he could put the skeleton together. The second said he would the graft skin and flesh on it, and the third said he would make it come to life. The fourth – believed to be the less learned person – warned them against it. However, when they insisted on going ahead, he asked them to wait until he could climb a tree for safety. The lion came to life and devoured the three scholars.

Oppenheimer used the Sanskrit verse that followed this story often. From the Gita, he learned and rationalized that it was his duty to build the bomb, and it was the leaders’ duty to use it wisely. In other words, Oppenheimer went along with government decisions not because they were government decisions but because he thought political decision-making was the duty of government leaders, not scientists.

A missing discussion

It is hard to know director Christopher Nolan’s motivation for juxtaposing the Gita verse with an intimate scene – it could be creative license or simply Orientalism, or the West’s stereotypical description of the East. Given Oppenheimer’s deep love for the Bhagavad Gita, he would not have, I believe, quoted the text with disrespect.

As for the Hindus who are offended, there could be multiple reasons: It could be the centuries of a colonial gaze that was fascinated with and horrified by the erotic in Indian spirituality.

For example, the 10th-century temples of Khajuraho – where only about 10% of the sculptures are erotic – and texts like the Kamasutra informed early missionary views on Hinduism. It could also be that some Hindus valorize the spirit of renunciation and the ascetic impulse of some Hindu texts.

But beyond this controversy, this film offers an opportunity to reflect on more profound issues. The detonation of atomic bombs led to the death of possibly 200,000 people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and horrific effects on survivors. Kai Bird, coauthor of the book on which the biopic Oppenheimer is based, said that he hopes the film “will initiate a national conversation not only about our existential relationship to weapons of mass destruction but also the need in our society for scientists as public intellectuals.”

While that would be valuable, an important discussion, left out from the narrative, is about the ethics of American leaders who knowingly caused harm at the time. The atomic test explosion led to devastating health consequences for about 13,000 New Mexicans who lived within a 50-mile radius and were not warned beforehand or afterward. This exposure to radioactive material took a toll over several generations.

In the end, the lesson is that the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita have to be balanced with the pragmatic lessons of the Panchatantra. Despite Oppenheimer’s quoting the Panchatantra about common sense being more important than intellectual scholarship, his own interpretation of duty gave undue credit and power to political leaders.

With the atomic explosion in New Mexico, the lion from the Panchatantra story that Oppenheimer cautioned about did come to life, and some may say it lives in a straw cage.

2023-07-07 18:35:31.044000+00:00,"Oppenheimer, Nullified and Vindicated","Kai Bird, a biographer of J. Robert Oppenheimer, writes about his efforts to rectify a McCarthyist smear on the reputation of the inventor of the atomic bomb.","“Architect of Atomic Bomb Cleared of ‘Black Mark.’ ” That was the headline last December 18th, when the Times ran a long story on page 16 reporting that Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm had “nullified a 1954 decision to revoke the security clearance of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a top government scientist who led the making of the atomic bomb in World War II but fell under suspicion of being a Soviet spy at the height of the McCarthy era.” Granholm had issued a press release explaining that her department had been “entrusted with the responsibility to correct the historical record and honor Dr. Oppenheimer’s ‘profound contributions to our national defense and scientific enterprise at large.’ ” She said that she was pleased to announce the nullification.

The Times’ veteran reporter on things nuclear, William J. Broad, went on to summarize Oppenheimer’s life story and his downfall at the height of the Cold War: “Until then a hero of American science, he lived out his life a broken man and died in 1967 at the age of 62.” But, even in 1954, it was clear to most readers of the trial transcripts, leaked to the Times that spring, that the security hearing was a kangaroo court and that Oppenheimer had been publicly humiliated for political reasons. The “father of the atomic bomb” had to be silenced because he was opposing the development of the hydrogen “super” bomb. Ever since, historians have regarded him as the chief celebrity victim of the national trauma known as McCarthyism.

So why now, sixty-eight years after the infamous security hearing, and fifty-five years after Oppenheimer’s death, did the Biden Administration find the courage to do the right thing? Governments rarely apologize for their errors. How did this decision happen? True, the director Christopher Nolan has a major motion picture coming out this summer called “Oppenheimer.” But, contrary to popular myth, Hollywood’s influence in Washington is limited, particularly when it comes to the nuclear-security establishment.

Here is the wholly improbable story.

In 2005, Martin J. Sherwin and I published “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.” Marty had worked on the biography for twenty-five years. I was brought aboard the project only in 2000. In 2006, the book won the Pulitzer Prize, and Marty was inspired by the notion that perhaps we could sue the government to revoke the 1954 decision. We wrote a four-thousand-word memo delineating how the Atomic Energy Commission, or A.E.C., had violated its own regulations governing security reviews. Among a long list of transgressions, they had illegally wiretapped Oppenheimer’s home and the office of his lawyer during the course of the security trial. Nothing incriminating was discovered. They allowed the three-member security panel access to Oppenheimer’s F.B.I. files, which ran to several thousand pages—but denied his own lawyer a security clearance, so he was not allowed to read the material being used selectively against his client. They blackmailed otherwise friendly witnesses to turn against Oppenheimer.

Armed with this catalogue of abuses, we approached a senior partner at WilmerHale, an influential Washington law firm, and persuaded him to take on the case pro bono. A young associate was assigned to research whether there was any legal recourse in the courts. Three months later, we got a phone call from the firm, explaining that it had to drop the matter due to personal objections from one of its partners, the late C. Boyden Gray, who had formerly served as White House counsel during the Presidency of George H. W. Bush. Washington is still a small town, and, as it happens, Gray’s father was Gordon Gray, the man who had chaired the three-member security-hearing panel that ruled against Oppenheimer.

Some months later, Marty Sherwin and I were at a crowded book party in Georgetown, at the home of William Nitze, a son of the late career politician Paul Nitze. Across the room, I pointed out to Marty, stood Boyden Gray. Marty marched up to Gray, introduced himself as Oppenheimer’s biographer, and proceeded to explain why what Gray’s father had done in 1954 was a travesty. Boyden Gray took offense, and they argued vehemently for a few minutes. No blows were landed, but Marty walked away pleased that he had spoken truth to power.

By this time, we had been advised by other lawyers that, separate from Boyden Gray’s objections, they had come to the conclusion that the courts could not be used to reverse the 1954 decision. The lawyers advised that such a reversal could only be achieved by executive order, probably by the President himself. (WilmerHale did not respond to requests for comment.)

Early in 2010, we therefore approached the Obama White House. Fortuitously, the newly appointed White House counsel was Robert Bauer, who happened to be one of my high-school friends from Cairo, Egypt, where both of our fathers were stationed as Foreign Service officers in the nineteen-sixties. Marty and I drafted yet another memo making the argument for nullification and sent it to Bauer—and he was sympathetic. Bauer encouraged us to get a few senators or historians to sign a letter urging nullification.

Without further prompting, we soon learned that Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, had sent a twenty-page memo on June 14, 2011, to Obama’s Secretary of Energy Steven Chu. Bingaman’s letter, which paralleled many of our own arguments, was drafted by a member of his staff, Sam Fowler, and marshalled a powerful legal case. But Secretary Chu declined to act. Bingaman retired from the Senate, in early 2013, and was replaced by Senator Martin Heinrich.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtlci5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9jdWx0dXJlLWRlc2svb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbnVsbGlmaWVkLWFuZC12aW5kaWNhdGVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-02 08:30:16+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’ is a must-watch for everyone who works in AI and health care,"J. Robert Oppenheimer’s story offers particularly salient lessons for health care leaders, entrepreneurs, and policymakers.","All great stories have complicated endings. But that doesn’t mean they can’t offer simple and instructive lessons. Christopher Nolan’s magnum opus, “Oppenheimer,” highlights the tragic story about the “father of the atomic bomb.” But it’s also a story about how the United States missed an opportunity to be a global leader in the development of an innovation that would define the 20th century. This century will be defined by transformational technologies — especially artificial intelligence — and J. Robert Oppenheimer’s story offers particularly salient lessons for health care leaders, entrepreneurs, and policymakers.

Oppenheimer’s era was defined by the nuclear power race, while ours is being defined by the competition in artificial intelligence technology. Both technologies are powerful tools that will change the trajectory of humanity. In another disconcerting similarity with Oppenheimer’s era, political actors who frame national policies around innovation seem disengaged with or are politicizing the nuances of science. This politicking has made it increasingly difficult to have constructive conversations about the future of health care innovation. We already see this happening with the misinformation around mRNA technology and the ongoing harassment of scientists.

Meanwhile, more than a dozen health care companies are already using ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot developed by OpenAI, for a variety of functions. But we do not fully understand the consequences of integrating these large language models into health functions. Surprisingly, many of the ongoing conversations on AI policymaking and regulation have focused on technology industry leaders, and have not fully utilized the expertise of leaders from the health care industry, who have unique insights on the application of AI on health and medicine. This reminded me of a powerful scene in the movie “Oppenheimer” in which the titular scientist tries to persuade President Truman about the dangers of the nuclear power, only to have his concerns dismissed.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4LzAyL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWFydGlmaWNpYWwtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLWFpLWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-20 12:49:10.114000+00:00,Here’s why the best IMAX movies still need a Palm Pilot to work,"In IMAX theaters around the world, Oppenheimer will play in its full 70mm glory. In the projection booth, a Palm m130 will help make it happen.","The Palm Pilot surely wasn’t the point of the TikTok, but it seemed to be the only thing anybody noticed. Ahead of the release of Oppenheimer, the official IMAX TikTok account posted a video showing the mind-bending size of the 70mm film print and the orange extensions IMAX had to build just to hold the platter in place. To give you some context: Oppenheimer’s film reportedly weighs 600 pounds, and the reel is an outrageous 11 miles long. Director Christopher Nolan told Collider that he thinks he might have hit the “outer limit” for how big a film reel can be.

But anyway, back to the Palm Pilot. Right there, in the foreground of the TikTok video, is a small blue and silver Palm device. (It’s technically not called a Palm Pilot — PalmPilot was the name of the company and devices long before the m130 came out — but everybody calls this class of devices Palm Pilots. So we will, too.) More specifically: a picture of a Palm Pilot, on a tablet, mounted to a white column next to the machine holding the reels. It’s not just a Palm Pilot; it’s a Palm Pilot emulator, running on another device because that’s apparently how important this thing is to getting Oppenheimer on a screen near you.

The emulated device in question is a Palm m130, a device released in 2002. It had a two-inch 160 x 160 display, was powered by Motorola’s 33MHz DragonBall VZ processor, and ran on Palm OS 4.1. Palm said the battery would last a week between charges, and you could even add Bluetooth via a card slot. People liked it, it got good reviews. You probably haven’t thought about it in damn near two decades.

In an IMAX theater, the m130’s job is to control the quick turn reel unit, or QTRU for short. (For many years, it appears, a non-emulated m130 sat holstered in most theaters.) The QTRU’s job is to control the platters, which are those large horizontal shelves where all of a film’s many reels are stitched together, stored, and then quickly spun out to and from the projector. The IMAX 1570 projector moves film at a little under six feet per second, so it’s all happening really fast.

The m130 is apparently crucial to keeping the thing humming — “PALM PILOT MUST BE ON ALL THE TIME,” reads a notice above an image of a different m130 that has since been passed around the internet — but doesn’t often need to be used. “I’ve never had to interact with the Palm Pilot,” says one person familiar with the technology. “It’s really just a status screen.” Its job is to keep the QTRU moving at a consistent speed and to help keep the film’s video in sync with its audio.

A (non-emulated) shot of the m130’s QTRU status menu. Image: Tom Barber

If you zoom in on the image, as of course the entire internet did, there are four things it displays. Our knowledgeable source explained each one:

ProjL and ProjR: Refers to the sides of a 3D projector, L and R meaning left and right. “This is from the days of the 45-minute 3D documentaries, where there was a right eye print and a left eye print which both ran through the projector at the same time.”

Takeup: Defines which platter is ready to receive the film after it goes through the projector.

Feed: Defines which platter is feeding film into the projector.

Locked: “If this is highlighted, this means that the platters are ready to run.”

The Palm-powered QTRU system is actually a relatively high-tech part of an otherwise extremely manual process. Yves Leibowitz, a longtime projectionist, has made a number of popular YouTube videos documenting the process of loading a film, which requires setting up the enormous reels in exactly the right place, manually threading film through a number of rollers and platters, and constantly checking and rechecking to make sure everything’s lined up and ready to go.

In most of his videos, you actually get a brief glimpse of a Palm device set up next to the QTRU, but Leibowitz never seems to need to touch it. In every case we’ve seen, though, it’s an actual physical device. The emulator appears to be a new phenomenon, and in fact, IMAX told Vice it was created specifically for Oppenheimer. “IMAX Engineering designed and manufactured an emulator that mimics the look and feel of a PalmPilot to keep it simple and familiar for IMAX film projectionists,” the company said. The emulator, if you’re curious, appears to be running on a Winmate W10IB3S-PCH2AC-POE Panel PC, a 10.1-inch Windows tablet that appears to have been designed to live outside of conference rooms and help people control schedules and video conferencing.

The obvious question here is, why in the world would IMAX still run its systems on a 21-year-old device? And why, when faced with the need to update it, would it choose to simply emulate said 21-year-old device on a crappy Windows tablet? Other QTRU systems have a controller built into the machine itself, which seems better in every imaginable way.

For IMAX, like so many other companies that rely on generations-old technology, the answer is simple: it works. And it’s not like it’s a booming industry in need of reinvention. There are only 30 theaters worldwide that can even show a full 70mm print like Oppenheimer, 19 of them in the US. Most IMAX experiences are digital now, like most moviegoing experiences in general.

Nolan is actually one of the few filmmakers left making 70mm IMAX movies at all, and if he’s hit the limit of the technology, even he might not do it much longer. “If 70mm IMAX had a resurgence then I’d expect that they’d update the QTRU controllers,” our source says. “Until then it’s best to ride it until the wheels fall off.” Palm OS is simple and stable and easily emulated (heck, you can run it in your browser right now) and still does this particular job just fine.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMzgwMTExOC9pbWF4LW1vdmllLXBhbG0tcGlsb3Qtb3BwZW5oZWltZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Written and d","Read more of UCS’s critical analysis of Oppenheimer and the global security issues it examines here.

On July 21, Oppenheimer, a new major motion picture chronicling the life and legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, will open in theaters across the country. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, director of Dunkirk, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy, the film was inspired by the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. (In a run-up to the film, NBC News produced a documentary on Oppenheimer that aired on July 9 on MSNBC and is now streaming on Peacock.)

“What I wanted to do was take the audience into the mind and the experience of a person who sat at the absolute center of the largest shift in history,” Nolan said in a Universal Pictures press release. “Like it or not, J. Robert Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived.”

I can’t say that Oppenheimer—or anyone else for that matter—could be considered the most important person who ever lived, but there is no doubt that he, as well as the hundreds of other Manhattan Project scientists at Los Alamos he led, changed the world irrevocably. Ever since they detonated the first nuclear device on July 16, 1945, all of humanity, as President Kennedy pointed out in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly 16 years later, has been living “under a nuclear sword of Damocles, hanging by the slenderest of threads, capable of being cut at any moment by accident or miscalculation or by madness.”

Some Manhattan Project scientists tried to stop President Truman from dropping the atomic bomb on Japan in the first place. Afterward, many of them—including Oppenheimer—wrestled with civilian and military officials to try to restrain an arms race they predicted would happen. They campaigned against proliferation, for stricter arms control, and even for eventual disarmament. Sometimes they were successful in setting—or at least influencing—the political agenda. More often, they were not.

Bird, whose book was first published in 2005, would like the film to jumpstart a public discussion about the issues Oppenheimer grappled with, issues that are still very much with us today.

“I have hopes it will actually stimulate a national, even global conversation about the issues that Oppenheimer was desperate to speak out about,” Bird said during a mid-May seminar at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study, where Oppenheimer served as director from 1947 to 1966. “About how to live in the atomic age, how to live with the bomb and about McCarthyism. What it means to be a patriot, and what is the role for a scientist in a society drenched with technology and science to speak out about public issues.”

The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) has been deeply engaged in the same issues ever since its founding in the spring of 1969. The fledgling organization’s very first reports were on ballistic missile defense and multiple warhead missiles, and over the last 54 years, UCS scientists have been in the thick of the national debate over nuclear weapons and arms control.

Given the upcoming debut of Oppenheimer, I wanted to explore the role that physicists and other scientists have played since World War II in shaping national—and international—nuclear policy with Dylan Spaulding, a senior scientist in the UCS Global Security Program. Spaulding has an undergraduate degree in physics from Brown University and a doctorate degree in Earth and Planetary Sciences from the University of California, Berkeley, where Oppenheimer taught from 1929 to 1943. Among other positions before joining the UCS staff last year, he was a stockpile stewardship graduate fellow at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and spent time at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories, where he gained familiarity with the US nuclear weapons complex and the science of weapons development.

EN: By May 1945, it was a foregone conclusion that the United States would drop the atomic bomb on Japan. But at least one Manhattan Project scientist—Leo Szilard—tried unsuccessfully to convince President Truman to abandon plans to use the weapon, and he and a number of his colleagues warned policymakers that using the bomb would trigger an arms race with the Soviet Union. They recommended that the United States demonstrate what they called the “gadget” before United Nations representatives at an uninhabited site. Where was Oppenheimer on this issue?

DS: As Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin point out in American Prometheus, J. Robert Oppenheimer’s position was complicated. Most of the scientists at Los Alamos had been working fervently to stop Nazi Germany, which they feared would develop an atomic bomb first, but the war in Europe ended just before the US bomb was ready. Many key Manhattan Project scientists, including Oppenheimer, were Jewish, and—unlike Oppenheimer, who was born in the United States—many were refugees from Europe. After Germany unconditionally surrendered in May 1945, some of the scientists began to question the value of continuing, possibly because their sense of urgency had ebbed. That wasn’t as true for Oppenheimer, who apparently was caught between his deep devotion to the science, his personal convictions, and his role as project leader. At the time, he was reluctant to acknowledge that scientists have a unique responsibility when it comes to arms control, although he recognized that the weapon they had designed would fundamentally change the nature of war. In fact, he thought it could put an end to all war.

At the same time, he was wary of the debate among his Los Alamos colleagues about the implications of their work. He insisted that scientists were no more qualified than anyone else to determine the use of atomic power and that politics was not their first responsibility. Ultimately, he signed off on a report by an advisory committee to Secretary of War Henry Stimson that concluded that it could “propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war” in Japan and saw “no acceptable alternative to direct military use.”

By contrast, Leo Szilard was alarmed when the Truman administration’s intentions for using the weapon became clearer. Along with James Franck, Glenn Seaborg and other Manhattan Project scientists, he issued what became known as the Franck Report, an especially prescient document that recommended demonstrating the bomb before international observers in an unpopulated area. The report warned that using the bomb without a prior international agreement on controlling atomic energy would spark a runaway arms race and that dropping it unannounced on a civilian population would sacrifice any possibility of the United States being able to provide moral leadership on nuclear issues. Szilard followed the report with a petition to Truman signed by more than 70 Manhattan Project scientists calling for restraint and granting the Japanese the opportunity to surrender first. Oppenheimer did not take Szilard’s efforts kindly and did not circulate the petition at Los Alamos. It never got to Truman.

It is clear that Oppenheimer was deeply transformed after the war, particularly when his Manhattan Project protégé, Robert Serber, returned to Los Alamos after participating in the first US delegation to Hiroshima with a first-hand account of the horrific atrocities on the ground. Oppenheimer, who had previously been appalled that there were no protests over the US firebombing of Tokyo, now found himself identified in the daily news as the architect of an even more massive barbarity.

After the war, Oppenheimer did help shape some of the first US arms control proposals. In 1946, for example, he coauthored the Acheson-Lilienthal report, one of the first attempts to design a system of international control over atomic energy. After the Truman administration established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which placed atomic energy under civilian supervision, Oppenheimer became chair of the AEC’s General Advisory Committee (GAC), which kept him in the middle of the political and ethical debates over nuclear weapons in the post-war years.

EN: When the Soviet Union exploded its first atomic bomb in August 1949, it prompted the Truman administration to dramatically increase the number of nuclear weapons in the US stockpile from around 50 to some 300 by June 1950. It also ignited a crash program to develop the “Super,” a thermonuclear hydrogen bomb, 1,000 times more lethal than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. How did Oppenheimer and other Manhattan Project scientists react to that?

DS: It wasn’t a surprise for most of the Manhattan Project scientists that the Soviets were able to develop their own bomb. Spies at Los Alamos had provided the Soviet Union background on the project well before the United States dropped the bombs on Japan. In fact, when Truman told Soviet leader Joseph Stalin at the Potsdam conference in late July 1945 that the United States had a “new weapon of unusual destructive force,” Stalin may have known more about it than Truman! Detonating the bomb demonstrated the science. Afterward, it was merely an engineering problem for other countries to replicate.

The idea of a “super” bomb had been actively promoted by another physicist at Los Alamos, Edward Teller, much to Oppenheimer’s dismay. He saw it as unnecessarily complicated and possibly unfeasible, but Teller essentially refused to work on anything else. When the idea resurfaced in 1949, Teller jumped at the chance to recruit scientists back to Los Alamos to work on it.

Oppenheimer, who then chaired the GAC, opposed building this even more lethal and indiscriminate weapon. He felt that such a large bomb served no military purpose, was morally repugnant, and instead recommended that the United States develop smaller, “tactical” nuclear weapons that could be used on the battlefield.

Oppenheimer’s vehement opposition to the hydrogen bomb was a major factor leading to his prosecution in early 1950s during Sen. Joseph McCarthy’s Red Scare campaign and ultimately the revocation of his security clearance. Teller was a key witness against him in government hearings.

Oppenheimer and his allies obviously lost the debate over the hydrogen bomb. Today, most of the US nuclear arsenal is made up of thermonuclear weapons that have yields ranging from 10 to 80 times larger than the Hiroshima bomb.

EN: Regardless, physicists have played a pivotal role in arms control since then. A notable example happened in the 1980s, when US and Soviet scientists worked together to show that a nuclear test ban treaty could be verified. What can you tell us about that extraordinary effort?

DS: Between 1945 and 1992, the United States and Russia collectively conducted 1,745 tests in the atmosphere and underground. The seven other confirmed nuclear states conducted 311 tests until 1998, with North Korea being the only state that has tested since then. Because tests were critical for nuclear weapons development throughout the Cold War, antinuclear advocates saw some form of nuclear test ban as the best way to stop the arms race and limit proliferation. Progress came in fits and starts, but it was ultimately thanks to the scientists who demonstrated the technical means to verify a test ban treaty that the political stalemate could be overcome.

The earliest attempts to limit testing began in the late 1950s, resulting in a temporary moratorium and then a partial test ban in 1963 during the Kennedy administration that ended testing in the atmosphere, oceans, and space. The partial test ban treaty was largely due to growing public awareness of the threat posed by radioactive fallout as well as the sobering experience of the Cuban Missile Crisis, when the United States and the Soviet Union narrowly averted a nuclear exchange. But it also was at least partly due to efforts by US chemist Linus Pauling, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1962 for raising awareness of the dangers of atmospheric testing as well as organizing a petition calling for an end to testing signed by more than 11,000 scientists around the world.

The very real concern that nations could secretly continue to conduct underground tests would prove to be an obstacle to further progress until the 1980s, when Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev’s policy of glasnost, or openness, allowed US and Soviet scientists to talk directly with each other. Princeton physicist Frank von Hippel and Jeremy Stone, president of the Federation of American Scientists, organized arms control workshops and joint studies with Soviet physicists, including Roald Sagdeev, Evgeny Velikhov and others associated with the Soviet Academy of Sciences. At one such meeting in Moscow in 1986, Thomas Cochran, a physicist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, proposed that US and Soviet scientists work together to seismically monitor US and Soviet test sites. Velikhov and his team accepted Cochran’s proposal, and the resulting project showed that advanced seismometers could detect even small tests and distinguish them from large chemical explosions and natural seismic activity. Their demonstration provided a viable way to verify an underground test ban and countered government claims that such a treaty could not be enforced.

That joint US-Soviet project remains a prime example of what can be accomplished by multilateral scientific collaboration. It took another decade, but in September 1996, the United Nations adopted the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). All five official nuclear weapons states—China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States—as well as 66 other nations signed the treaty that day. (While abiding by the treaty, neither China nor the United States have officially ratified it.) Today, the CTBT Organization maintains an impressive array of seismic stations, infrasound atmospheric sensors, submarine hydroacoustic sensors and radionuclide monitors spanning the globe to detect nuclear tests anywhere they might occur.

EN: In 1983, President Reagan gave his famous “Star Wars” speech calling for scientists to develop a “space shield” that would render “nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete.” The US scientific community, including physicists at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), warned that the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) to put an anti-ballistic-missile-defense system in space would not work. Tell us about the role scientists have played over the last four decades to try to kill what has amounted to a zombie program that won’t die.

DS: The idea of an impenetrable shield against nuclear weapons, whether space-based or ground-based anti-ballistic missiles, is innately attractive, and would be preferable to basing national security on the concept of mutually assured destruction. In reality, however, a viable anti-ballistic missile defense system would likely spur an adversary to build more offensive missiles and, in any case, missile defense has proven to be ineffective, expensive, and technically vulnerable.

Ronald Reagan’s original notion of a space-based system was enthusiastically championed by some scientists, particularly Edward Teller, but UCS and other scientific organizations have demonstrated how impractical and dangerous these proposals are.

A year after Reagan proposed the SDI system, UCS founders Kurt Gottfried and Henry Kendall—along with Manhattan Project physicist Hans Bethe and physicist Richard Garwin, a longtime UCS board member—coauthored The Fallacy of Star Wars, a book that showed that the system was based on a nonexistent technology and would require considerably more satellites than its proponents suggested. Potentially costing billions of dollars apiece, the satellites would be much more vulnerable than the missiles they were supposed to defeat. Their assessment was seconded a few years later by scientists at the American Physical Society, who published a similarly scathing appraisal of SDI’s technical challenges and feasibility.

Around the same time, physicists Lisbeth Gronlund and David Wright, who later served as codirectors of the UCS Global Security Program (GSP) from 2002 to 2020, circulated a pledge signed by more than 7,000 scientists who vowed they would not accept SDI-related funding. The campaign generated headlines across the country, drawing public attention to the scientific community’s strong opposition to Reagan’s plan.

These efforts mounted technical, as well as moral, challenges to the Star Wars program and highlighted the folly behind it. They remain a shining example of how scientists can best use their expertise to debunk bad—and dangerous—government policy, showing that there is no technical solution to protect people from nuclear weapons. The real solution is political and diplomatic.

EN: The myth of a viable Star Wars program became even more problematic when the George W. Bush administration abandoned the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty with the Russians in 2002. UCS scientists were able to show that an anti-ballistic missile defense system could be easily defeated.

DS: That’s right. The idea behind limiting defensive weapons under the ABM Treaty was to support nuclear arms reductions by discouraging an offense-defense arms race. The ABM Treaty strictly limited the amount of missile defenses each party could field. Eventually the unrealistic dream of a space-based missile defense system came down to earth, and the Pentagon focused on ground-based interceptors to target nuclear-armed missiles during their long coast through space, the midcourse phase of flight.

In 2000, the last full year of the Clinton administration, UCS scientists published another study, this time in collaboration with scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and elsewhere. The study, Countermeasures, showed just how easily the proposed national missile defense system could be defeated using technologies available to any state capable of launching a nuclear-armed ballistic missile.

Nevertheless, within its first weeks in office, the George W. Bush administration signaled an interest in withdrawing from the ABM Treaty. Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the administration announced it was indeed doing so and planned to accelerate the development of a Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system against possible missile threats from Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. It was a decidedly pared down version of what Edward Teller and Ronald Reagan had envisioned, but it was equally misguided.

The Pentagon pursued the GMD system with multibillion-dollar budgets and little oversight, and repeatedly claimed the system was highly effective and would provide significant protection. UCS scientists and other experts pushed back against this fanciful narrative with analyses showing that the system is ineffective, costly, and destabilizing. For more specifics, I highly recommend checking out a 2016 report by UCS Global Security Research Director Laura Grego, which provides a good, relatively up-to-date analysis of the GMD system’s technical and administrative deficiencies.

Without a doubt, abandoning the ABM Treaty and spending billions on missile defense has undermined US security. In March 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin specifically cited the US withdrawal from the ABM Treaty as the reason why Russia is now developing new “super weapons,” including hypersonic nuclear delivery systems. China is following suit, prompting the United States to respond to this new “threat” by developing its own hypersonic weapons as well as modernizing every leg of its nuclear arsenal.

EN: In a 2020 report, UCS scientists made a convincing case for retiring US land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). A year later, they punctured the hype over hypersonic weapons. Are US policymakers paying any attention?

DS: Unfortunately, they are paying more attention to the perceived threat that I just mentioned—a new “trilateral” cold war. And, at the same time, they are ignoring the way in which US actions are driving a new arms race.

The 400 land-based ICBMs scattered across the northern Great Plains states are immobile, their positions are well-known, and their main purpose is to “absorb” a nuclear attack from Russia, acting as a giant “nuclear sponge.” As then GSP co-directors Wright and Gronlund and their coauthor William Hartung pointed out in their 2020 report, Russian missiles could reach them within a half hour, giving a president 10 minutes or less to decide whether to launch them before they are destroyed by a perceived attack. That increases the possibility of mistaken nuclear war triggered by a false attack warning, and there have been a number of close calls over the last six decades due to human and technological errors.

ICBMs are not only dangerous, they are an unnecessary relic of cold war strategy. They may have made sense 60 years ago, when they were more accurate and powerful than submarine-launched ballistic missiles and when communications links with subs were unreliable. Since then, the accuracy of sub-launched missiles has increased dramatically, and the Navy has secure submarine communication links, making the ICBMs superfluous.

If ICBMs are now passé, hypersonic weapons are now all the rage—with no scientific justification. A 2021 analysis by Wright and UCS Kendall Fellow Cameron Tracy found that hypersonic weapons fail to live up to the glowing claims made about them. Despite what their name suggests, they are not faster than conventional missiles, nor are they stealthier or harder to detect. Regardless, as I mentioned earlier, hypersonics have triggered a high-tech arms race with Russia and China because US policymakers mistakenly see them as cutting-edge technology.

In many ways, hypersonics are yet another example of illogical cold war thinking that goes like this: If our adversary has them, we have to have them too, even if we’re not quite sure why.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYmxvZy51Y3N1c2Eub3JnL2VsbGlvdHQtbmVnaW4vYXNrLWEtc2NpZW50aXN0LXNjaWVudGlzdHMtYW5kLWFybXMtY29udHJvbC1mcm9tLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXRvLXRvZGF5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

StarSolid StarSolid StarHalf StarOutline ( 2.5 stars ) Physicist Ted Hall, who was recruited to join the Manhattan Project after graduating from Harvard at the age of 18, worked alongside J. Robert Oppenheimer at the project’s Los Alamos compound. Although his character is not depicted in “Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan’s sweeping biopic about the director of the Los Alamos lab, Hall’s smaller story — told in the documentary “A Compassionate Spy” — makes for a timely footnote to Nolan’s magnum opus.

As Hall has admitted, shortly before his death in 1999, he gave the Soviets critical information about the implosion technology being used for the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, information that may have helped them in the pursuit of their own nuclear weapon. The decision, he says in an old interview — footage of which, included here, contains his confession and other recollections of the past — was born out of “compassion”: Two superpowers with the same weapon of mass destruction would be less likely to use it against each other.

Suspicions about the loyalty of Oppenheimer — who like Hall and some others at Los Alamos had some sympathies toward leftist causes — figure prominently in “Oppenheimer.” But although Hall was interviewed by the FBI, he was never charged with a crime. By the time the U.S. government’s suspicions about Hall were confirmed (when a misspelled version of his name was recognized in an intercepted communication from Russia), the decision was made not to pursue espionage charges, which would have publicly revealed that the United States had broken Soviet code.

This small detail is actually the most fascinating part of “A Compassionate Spy,” but it is glossed over in the film by Steve James, director of the Oscar-nominated 1994 film “Hoop Dreams.” Instead, the film focuses mainly on an interview with Hall’s widow, Joan Hall, who adds some interesting perspective and insight into her husband’s thinking. Reenactments with actors playing the Halls (J. Michael Wright and Lucy Zukaitis) and Ted’s friend and co-conspirator Saville Sax (Nicolas Eastlund) are occasionally goofy and unnecessary. The threesome, it is suggested, formed a love triangle, so “A Compassionate Spy” is also a kind of romance.

Ted’s motivations are adequately defended, by his own words and Joan’s. But the other side of the moral coin is left largely unexplored, other than a brief clip in which we hear one of the film’s subjects opine that, if he had his druthers, Ted would have been shot as a traitor. Interludes related to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were convicted of espionage in 1951 (and executed in 1953), provide some helpful context.

“A Compassionate Spy” is less a full companion piece to “Oppenheimer” than an intriguing sidebar. When Ted Hall reminisces about how he sat alone in his room, disturbed, as his Los Alamos colleagues celebrated their team’s 1945 success, it’s hard not to remember those scenes of self-congratulation in “Oppenheimer” — but also to recall Nolan’s film as a better, bigger, bolder and more complex examination of all the nuance and contradiction associated with the dawn of the atomic age.

In 2020, at the height of the pandemic, Nolan unleashed Tenet – and with it, a digital prop watch that re-imagined how time could be told. The one thing both watches have in common is that they come from the brand Hamilton – a company known for its involvement in the movie industry.

2023-07-05 19:57:04+00:00,"Who is Oppenheimer and why is Christopher Nolan, one of the biggest directors in Hollywood, making a movie about him?","Oppenheimer's life, work, and complicated legacy are dramatic enough for the big screen. But what can audiences learn from his story in 2023?","J. Robert Oppenheimer.

Even if that name doesn’t ring a bell, you almost certainly know who he is. Known as the father of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer is one of the most important figures of the 20th century––and now he’s the protagonist of one of the year’s biggest movies from Christopher Nolan, one of the biggest directors working today.

Considering Nolan’s filmography––dark superhero epics like “The Dark Knight,” cerebral, twist-filled blockbusters like “Inception”––it might seem odd that he’s tackling a film about Oppenheimer. But the life, work and legacy of the man are more than deserving of a jump to the big screen, says Gretchen Heefner, an associate professor of history at Northeastern University.

Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer is an IMAX®-shot epic thriller.

His leadership in the Manhattan Project, the top secret operation to develop the atomic bomb before the Nazis, that culminated in the creation of a world-altering weapon is notable enough. His post-World War II disgust in what he had created and fierce attempt to regulate nuclear weapons even more so. But according to Heefner, he was also just “an interesting character” who seems almost tailor-made for the movies.

“He was this really complicated, interesting figure,” Heefner says. “He flirted with communism for a while. He was known to be volatile, difficult to work with yet apparently a good manager when he was at [the Manhattan Project’s] Los Alamos [lab].”

Based on Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning biography “American Prometheus,” “Oppenheimer,” due to hit theaters on July 21, stars Cillian Murphy in the titular role and, based on trailers, appears to follow his early days, time on the Manhattan Project and the post-war period that destroyed his career.

Oppenheimer quickly acquired a reputation as a brilliant theoretical physicist who was pretty clumsy in a lab. He was also incredibly driven––sometimes to the point of obsession––and, as a result, prolific. Oppenheimer is mostly known for his contributions to theoretical astronomy, astrophysics, quantum field theory and, of course, nuclear physics

But Oppenheimer was also known as much for his personality as his publications.

Tall, lanky and constantly smoking a cigarette, Oppenheimer was in many ways a renaissance man. He could learn other languages incredibly fast and was often as knowledgeable and passionate about philosophy and art as he was physics.

He also was not afraid to show how knowledgeable he was. As a university student, he would dominate class discussions to the point that his classmates threatened to boycott their class, according to Bird and Sherwin. During his university years, Oppenheimer also struggled with depression that manifested in some violent behavior toward some of his closest friends.

Politically, Oppenheimer was a supporter of progressive causes and left-wing politics throughout his life. Although he never formally joined the Communist Party, in the 1930s he was an active supporter, financially and philosophically, of reforms and ideas that aligned with the party. During the Red Scare of the ’40s and ’50s, this would prove his undoing.

With a character like that at the center of his film, the focus of Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” is largely what has come to define the physicist’s legacy––the creation of the first atomic bomb––and his response to that legacy.

In October 1941, two months before the U.S. entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt officially signed off on the development of an atomic bomb. Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves (played by Matt Damon in the film) was eventually made director of the Manhattan Project, the name for the top secret project for developing the atomic bomb.

Groves chose Oppenheimer to lead the project’s secret weapons lab in New Mexico. Oppenheimer assembled a team of top tier physicists, some from the U.S. and others who had fled from Europe and Nazi Germany. For those involved in the project, there was a sense of urgency unlike anything else.

“They were like, ‘If Hitler gets it, it’s all over,’” Heefner says. “There was a sense of if your enemy has it, they’ll use it and then it’s over. Early on that was the preoccupation. It’s the ultimate weapon, so if you have it, you can threaten anything.”

In 1945, the hard work of countless Los Alamos Laboratory scientists culminated in the first nuclear explosion at a New Mexico site, codenamed “Trinity.” The Trinity nuclear test is one of the most important and iconic moments of the 20th century––so important that Nolan was adamant he needed to recreate the explosion practically, without computer generated imagery.

“We knew the world would not be the same,” Oppenheimer said of that moment in a 1965 televised interview.

He was right. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 helped end the war but also ushered in a nuclear arms race and Cold War.

He was capable of remorse and reflection. He understood that his actions had consequences and was working for a greater good more than ego. Gretchen Heefner, an associate professor of history at Northeastern University

In the same television interview, Oppenheimer says in the moment the Trinity test went off he was reminded of a quote from the Bhagavad Gita: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” It’s a quote that came to define his relationship with his creation for the rest of his life.

In response to the U.S. dropping its second bomb on Nagasaki, Oppenheimer hand-delivered a letter expressing his disgust to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson. For the rest of his life, the father of the atomic bomb would be one of the fiercest advocates for its regulation.

“Oppenheimer’s post-war life is that he was in part horrified by what he had done,” Heefner says. “He was still involved in the U.S. military and the Atomic Energy Commission, which was the organization set up to manage the bomb and manage nuclear materials. … But he also was an advocate for international control of atomic energy, which was not as pie in the sky as it sounds.”

Oppenheimer hoped an international arms regulation could avert what he saw as a potential arms race. He was right, in a sense. The Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb in 1949, prompting the U.S. to start developing the more powerful hydrogen bomb, or “super bomb,” against the recommendations of Oppenheimer and members of the AEC.

Against his wishes, Oppenheimer’s creation completely altered post-war life and politics. The ability for global powers to develop tools of mass destruction changed geopolitics forever and created a sense of paranoia and fear that pervaded culture for decades.

“It was clearly destabilizing in the fact that it creates a certain hierarchy of power,” Heefner says. “Who has it? Who has the umbrella that lets you stay secure? Who says, ‘We’ll share it with you?’ It created strange alliances.”

But Heefner says Oppenheimer’s post-war efforts were not totally in vain––nuclear weapons are “highly regulated”––but they did cost him almost everything.

“Oppenheimer was opposed to it, and because of that he became a political football,” Heefner says. “He also was a contentious personality, so he didn’t do any of this smoothly. He was charged with being disloyal, possibly being a communist or Soviet sympathizer, which in this time period was incredibly damaging.”

A brilliant mind on a meteoric rise, a scientific breakthrough with world-shattering implications and a fall from grace due to convictions that flew in the face of the political powers that be: Oppenheimer’s life is full of enough material for several movies. Heefner can only speculate about Nolan’s interest in this story, but she says even decades later Oppenheimer, flaws and all, is a reminder of what scientists and forward thinkers can do for––and to––the world.

“Oppenheimer was a scientist, a big thinker and deeply compassionate,” she adds. “He was capable of remorse and reflection. He understood that his actions had consequences and was working for a greater good more than ego.”

Christopher Nolan's latest cinematic spectacle, ""Oppenheimer,"" has finally made its way into theaters, three years after the British director's previous film, ""Tenet.""

The new movie is all about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the mastermind behind the atomic bomb, with Cillian Murphy playing the titular American scientist.

While most theaters around the world will be showing ""Oppenheimer"" — and ""Barbie"" — there has been some speculation about whether ""Oppenheimer"" will be shown in Japan because of its subject matter.

In August 1945, the United States used Oppenheimer's work to create a nuclear bomb to hit the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing over 200,000 people.

Will 'Oppenheimer' be in Japanese theaters?

Japan hasn't completely banned ""Oppenheimer"" from its theaters, but neither is there a release date for the movie in the country.

A Universal spokesperson told Variety in June that ""plans have not been finalized in all markets.""

This suggests that Japanese audiences won't be able to see Nolan's movie at the same time as the rest of the world, as Toho-Towa — the biggest Japanese distributor of Hollywood films — has yet to decide on its release plans, per Variety.

Thankfully, Japanese audiences will soon be able to see the other big movie of the summer, ""Barbie,"" which arrives in the country on August 11.

""Oppenheimer"" opens Friday in theaters across other countries, including the US and UK, where it will face off against ""Barbie"" at the box office.

Nolan recently confirmed that his own daughter, Flora, makes a cameo appearance as a girl whose face melts off during a dream sequence.

The director also told Insider that it was ""essential"" to film sex scenes for the first time in his career.

OAK RIDGE, Tenn. — The highly anticipated film, ""Oppenheimer,"" opens on July 21 across the country.

Director Christopher Nolan tells the story of famed theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his work overseeing the Manhattan Project as director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico.

As the principal architect of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer also came to Oak Ridge. Back then, it was named ""The Secret City,"" and he had gone to oversee the work done there.

Oak Ridge historian Ray Smith shares stories of Oppenheimer's stay in the area at the ""Guest House"" at the time — the only hotel in town.

""Robert Oppenheimer was chosen by General Groves to lead the design for the atomic bomb,"" Ray said. ""He had a presence when he came into the room. He was very intelligent and didn't mind telling you if he knew more than you did.""

Not much is recorded about Oppenheimer's visits to the ""Secret City."" His brother, Frank Oppenheimer, is also a respected physicist and lived in the Oak Ridge area while working on the Calutron machines.

Mike Stallo, a history specialist with the Oak Ridge Public Library, says Robert was kept protected during his visits.

""He wasn't supposed to drive by himself, travel by air,"" Mike said. ""They were very protective of him.""

Oppenheimer's work was mainly done in Los Alamos, a place he had a personal connection to.

""When he was a young man, he became ill,"" said Ray. ""His father sent him to the area and later on, he had a ranch there. He said he loved combining his love for Los Alamos and his love of physics.""

The Christopher Nolan movie will explore his time in Los Alamos and his downfall after the war when he became an outspoken critic of the hydrogen bomb, which had the potential to be several times more deadly than the atomic bomb. In the early 1950s, during the McCarthy Era, the government revoked his security clearance effectively ending his career as a physicist.

""A lot of workers here were very supportive of him,"" Mike Stallo said. ""169 scientists signed a petition protesting his clearance being pulled. I think he wrote a letter thanking them.""

The AEC issued its decision on June 29, 1954, to revoke his security clearance. They cited ""fundamental defect of character"" and Communist associations ""far beyond the tolerable limits of prudence and self-restraint which are to be expected of one holding the high positions,"" according to the American Physical Society.

In December 2022 the Biden Administration reversed the decision to revoke Oppenheimer's security clearance, which Ray Smith said weighed heavily on him the rest of his life.

""As you see pictures of him through the years you can see the strain,"" Ray said. ""He was creating something that had never been done before. he was able to do that. He was under strain and stress when he went through the security clearance removed. I think what Oppenheimer did for the United States is admirable. The way he was mistreated is not.""

Today, Oppenheimer is remembered in Oak Ridge at the town's history center and at the Alexander Guest House, a senior living home that sits in the former hotel where the famed physicist was a guest.

2023-07-29 20:53:12+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’ and the TCU professor who helped build the bomb,"When I saw “Oppenheimer” last weekend, it reminded me of a story I had heard about a former TCU professor who had some involvement in the Manhattan Project.","When I saw “Oppenheimer” last weekend, it reminded me of a story I had heard about a former TCU professor who had some involvement in the Manhattan Project.

“Oppenheimer,” in case you haven’t seen it, tells the story of Robert Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project’s Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. He’s credited with developing the atomic bomb, and the Manhattan Project was the U.S. effort to build an atomic weapon during World War II.

The film brought in $82.5 million, behind “Barbie,” but quite an achievement for a three-hour movie about an event now nearly 80 years old.

I dashed off a quick note to TCU to see if my memory was on target and received a flood of information on Harrison Miller Moseley, former professor of physics.

It was Moseley who I recalled hearing about and who was involved in the Manhattan Project, though he didn’t speak about it until late in his life.

I spoke with Magnus Rittby, professor in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at TCU, who has been compiling a history of the physics department at the school.

Moseley (1922-2014) grew up in Fort Worth at the Masonic Home, a facility for widows and orphans, following the death of his father. He played on some of the school’s famed football teams and graduated valedictorian in 1938, earning a full ride to TCU. There he came under the tutelage of the chairman of the department, Newton Gaines, who probably deserves his own story as he recorded folk songs for Alan Lomax in the 1930s. At TCU, Moseley graduated the top of his class in 1943, then headed to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he worked with Nathan Rosen, a friend and fellow scientist with Albert Einstein.

Rosen and Einstein, together with another physicist, Boris Podolsky, in 1935 wrote one of the most famous papers in physics history, called “Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete.”

That paper’s impact continues, Rittby said.

“There was a Nobel Prize given in 2022 about some of the same issues raised in the paper, on quantum entanglement,” he said.

When Rosen was asked by Einstein to join the Manhattan Project at the Naval Research Laboratory, Rosen asked if he could bring his brightest student, Moseley. Moseley enlisted in the Navy and began working in the Naval Research Laboratory with Rosen on a process to produce the enriched uranium needed for the atomic bomb. Their process was called liquid-thermal diffusion.

“Unbelieveable: The Unmasking of Dr. Harrison Miller Moseley,” by Fort Worth author Stella Brooks. (Fort Worth Report| Bob Francis)

This approach to making enriched uranium was not originally favored, but it eventually proved to be the one that could produce the most material effectively. That is demonstrated in the film when Oppenheimer fills a fish bowl with marbles as the Manhattan Project grows its supply of enriched uranium. Without that enriched uranium, there would have been no bomb.

“He was at the very basic level of figuring out how they could get the necessary material for the first bomb. Which I think is pretty cool,” Rittby said.

While Moseley was doing serious work, he had a sense of humor, Rittby said. Rittby has some correspondence between Moseley and TCU’s then chairman, Gaines.

Moseley writes Gaines to advise him to to use a non-Navy mailing address since the guards are checking what goes in and out of the Navy Yard and that any physics writings would be suspect:

“Comic books, red apples, and second-hand submarines – these I could get away with. But should I start out with a sheet of solved problems in electricity I would no doubt be called in by Naval Intelligence for peddling A-Bomb secrets on the open market”.

While Moseley’s work on the Manhattan Project was not discussed much during his time at TCU, he did speak with Fort Worth author Stella Brooks about his life. She chronicled his life story in a book, Unbelievable: The Unmasking of Dr. Harrison Miller Moseley.

The book details Moseley’s remarkable life and offers an interesting peek behind the curtain at one of the most important scientific and technical achievements of the 20th century. All through the lens of a man who either led or was a member of the physics department at TCU for 40 years.

So if you go see “Oppenheimer,” when you see the scenes with the marbles in the fishbowl, just remember, a guy that taught at TCU for 40 years helped do that.

2023-07-21 16:14:22.801000+00:00,How Matt Damon went full Army for “Oppenheimer”,"“[It’s] that tension between the military and the science community,"" Damon said.","If Cillian Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer was the anti-hero of director Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves, portrayed by Matt Damon, is his equally controversial counterpart.

Tasked with staffing what would eventually become known as the Manhattan Project, Damon’s character is the dutiful Army servant given the dubious honor of presiding over a team of brilliant scientists who in no way conform to the military’s notions of hierarchy.

“The frustration [for] Groves — what he lived with as a military person — he suddenly finds himself in charge of a bunch of civilians who don’t really recognize the chain of command,” Damon told Military Times.

In a serious film about one of the most devastating weapons ever created, Damon manages to bring a bit of levity via the near-comical level of rigidity with which he portrays Groves.

“I would have played anything that Chris asked me to,” Damon said. “But Groves was really fun because I’d never quite had a role like that. Nobody liked him, which was really fun. And he didn’t care at all, he was just completely focused on what he was doing.”

Damon played off of Murphy’s character particularly well — creating a relationship between Groves and Oppenheimer that, despite tension, facilitates both individuals’ lofty aspirations to get ahead. Despite the arm’s length distance between the duo, the pairing ultimately results in a friendship based on mutual respect.

“They both appreciated each other — they helped each other fulfill each other’s ambitions,” Damon noted. “Each couldn’t have done it without the other. There was a lot of genuine affection there.”

Despite having vastly different backgrounds and personalities, both characters accomplish the unbelievable amid the constant push and pull between the military, which Groves represents, and the enterprising civilian so perfectly illustrated by Oppenheimer.

“[It’s] that tension between the military and the science community, just because the military is just completely obsessed with compartmentalization and secrecy,” Damon noted. “You’re talking about an existential threat to humankind, but the scientists are all about kind of keeping things open and learning from one another. They were philosophically totally opposed, and that led to this kind of natural tension between Groves and everybody else.”

Ultimately, in the film’s following of the development of the atomic bomb, Nolan, Damon noted, developed something more akin to a horror film or psychological thriller.

“I was terrified when I when I got to the last line of the script, and then seeing it in the film,” Damon said. “I’ve been kind of filled with dread.”

Artful anxiety is something that Damon attributes often to the genius of Nolan, who both wrote and directed the film.

“His movies do this really incredible thing where he’s always grappling with these big concepts, but they’re also very intimate,” Damon said. “He always wants to put interesting questions in front of his audience and let them ponder them, but at the same time, they’re not lectures or thought exercises. They’re very emotional movies and they’re very intimate and and so he’s always got these compelling characters.”

“Oppenheimer” is in theaters July 21.

,The threat is real: Our nuclear weapons are much more powerful than Oppenheimer's atomic bomb,"Nine countries now have nuclear weapons. After you see Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer,' demand our leaders work toward building a safer world.","Joan Rohlfing and James McKeon

Opinion contributors

Sure, it’s no ""Barbie,"" but Christopher Nolan’s ""Oppenheimer"" is the most highly anticipated film about nuclear weapons in decades.

With its impending release, we at the Nuclear Threat Initiative created a primer to set the scene and arm audiences with the most accurate information possible before you head to the theater to see the action yourself.

Which country has the most nuclear weapons?

""Oppenheimer"" is a historical film, but the threat posed by nuclear weapons is very real today. Nine countries now have nuclear weapons, with the United States and Russia possessing about 90% of the world’s nearly 13,000 weapons.

At the same time, China’s nuclear arsenal is rapidly increasing, potentially to 1,500 warheads by 2035 (Beijing currently has more than 400). Diplomatic relations between Washington and Moscow have plummeted. U.S.-China relations are at a historic low. Tensions between India and Pakistan – both nuclear-armed countries – and India and China continue to simmer. And North Korea’s nuclear program is advancing.

Unfortunately, public awareness of all these steadily increasing threats is very low, which is why many nuclear experts fear we could be sleepwalking into a nuclear disaster.

Today's nuclear weapons are much more powerful than Oppenheimer's nukes

J. Robert Oppenheimer played a critical role in developing the first nuclear weapons as part of the top-secret Manhattan Project. Two of those weapons were used against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, obliterating both cities and killing hundreds of thousands of people.

Who was J. Robert Oppenheimer?What to know about atomic bomb physicist's life, career, death

Oppenheimer was shaken by the destruction brought by the weapons and the potential for them to inflict even greater destruction in the future. After seeing the first-ever nuclear detonation in New Mexico on July 16, 1945, he reflected that he “knew the world would not be the same” and then recited a line from Hindu scripture: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”

A few years after the end of World War II, Oppenheimer opposed the U.S. government’s plan to develop even larger nuclear weapons called hydrogen bombs, which were created anyway. Today, these kinds of weapons still exist in modern arsenals that include nuclear weapons 80 times more powerful compared with the bomb detonated over Hiroshima, and they have more accurate and survivable delivery systems (missiles, not just bombers) that can fly faster than the speed of sound.

Russia has plans to deploy even more powerful nuclear weapons soon. Oppenheimer and his colleagues predicted that a strategy of nuclear competition would cause an arms race, and he was right.

US shouldn't send Ukraine cluster bombs:Biden is wrong to send cluster bombs to Ukraine. 50 years later, they're still killing in Laos.

No such thing as 'small scale': Nuclear war would impact the entire world

You might be tempted to think you would be safe if nuclear weapons were used halfway across the globe from your location. Sure, you would be able to avoid the immediate blast effects, but you would experience the after-effects. There is significant evidence that the entire globe could be impacted by even a small-scale nuclear war.

For example, one study assessed the global effects of a “limited” nuclear war between India and Pakistan, revealing that the fires produced in the conflict would send so much soot into the atmosphere that the sun’s rays would be diminished for years. This would result in reduced global temperatures, which in turn would cause widespread crop failures and worldwide famine, potentially affecting billions of people.

For many decades, scientists have been warning about this phenomenon, often referred to as “nuclear autumn” or “nuclear winter.”

No, Christopher Nolan did not detonate a nuclear weapon for 'Oppenheimer'

Even the best in Hollywood wouldn’t have the scientific and technical capabilities to develop, let alone detonate, a real nuclear weapon. But even if they somehow did, it would be illegal.

In 1963, President John F. Kennedy signed an agreement to ban aboveground and underwater nuclear tests as part of an effort to prevent additional countries from developing nuclear weapons. That agreement is still in effect.

The United States is also a signatory to a global test ban treaty that, once in full effect, would ban all nuclear explosions anywhere on earth.

So, no, director Nolan did not detonate a real nuclear weapon in the making of ""Oppenheimer."" He did not use computer-generated images, either. Instead, he simulated a nuclear explosion using conventional explosives.

There are many reasons to be grateful that a real nuclear weapon couldn’t be used for the film. Victims of nuclear testing in New Mexico and in native communities across the Southwest and U.S. island territories are still seeking compensation for the very real harm caused by the lasting effects of the Manhattan Project and nuclear testing.

When will Ukraine join NATO?Russian military fortifications may hold the answer.

It is possible to eliminate nuclear weapons once and for all

In a recent interview with Wired, Nolan stated that those lucky enough to preview his film have been left “devastated” and that the film is almost part of the “horror” genre.

While progress on nuclear disarmament has stalled, the world has made significant gains in reducing global stockpiles of nuclear weapons. At their peak, the United States and Russia (then the Soviet Union) had more than 60,000 nuclear weapons between them. Today, they have about 11,000.

Obviously, that’s a huge reduction. But we have a long way to go. From Oppenheimer to Barack Obama to Henry Kissinger, politicians and experts from all political persuasions have been convinced that we should fully eliminate nuclear weapons and the threat they pose to humanity.

Today, we have the capability to monitor and control nuclear weapons technologies that didn’t yet exist in Oppenheimer’s time. It’s now possible to create the international control system that Oppenheimer and others advocated for in 1945.

The first step to elimination is raising public awareness about nuclear threats. We hope that’s exactly what ""Oppenheimer"" will do, and we call on those motivated to speak out after seeing the film to demand that our leaders work toward building a safer, nuclear weapons-free world – now and for future generations.

,How Lewis Strauss Orchestrated Robert Oppenheimer’s Downfall,Amateur physicist Lewis Strauss spurred the hydrogen bomb’s development—and became Robert Oppenheimer's nemesis.,"A Wall Street financier who skipped college to sell shoes, Lewis Strauss became one of America's most important atomic-energy advisers during the Cold War. He also became known for his role in the dramatic downfall of the A-bomb's chief developer, physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer.

Strauss took an unlikely path to his perch as atomic policy czar. Born into a horse-and-buggy world in 1896, he first developed an interest in physics as a boy when he used a vibrating tuning fork to make waves in a bowl of mercury while waiting for a dentist to repair his tooth. He devoured books on radiation and wave mechanics in high school, but his dreams of studying physics in college after graduation yielded to the reality of his father’s struggling footwear business.

Instead of toting textbooks, Strauss lugged trunks of shoe samples across the Southeast as a traveling salesman until he volunteered to help with World War I relief efforts spearheaded by Herbert Hoover. “It was clear that to have a hand in feeding the hungry and clothing the naked in Belgium and northern France was to have a hand in history,” Strauss recalled. Strauss so impressed Hoover that he became the future president’s personal secretary before joining a New York investment banking firm in 1919 and eventually earning more than $1 million a year.

After both his parents died of cancer, Strauss established a fund that financed the use of radium as a treatment. That philanthropic work deepened his relationships with physicists working on discovery of nuclear fission. After working administrative jobs with the U.S. Navy during World War II, Strauss emerged at the forefront of America’s Cold War nuclear program.

History Shorts: How the Atomic Bomb Was Used in WWII

Strauss Champions U.S. Hydrogen Bomb Development

In 1946, President Harry S. Truman appointed Strauss as one of the first five commissioners of the newly established Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which assumed control of the U.S. nuclear program from the Manhattan Project, the top-secret wartime research and development team that built America’s first atomic bomb. Strauss urged the Pentagon to establish an atmospheric monitoring system, which successfully detected the Soviet Union’s own first atomic bomb test within days of its detonation in August 1949.

With the United States no longer the world’s sole nuclear superpower, Strauss vigorously supported a massive program to develop a thermonuclear “super bomb” that would be 1,000 times more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. “The time has now come for a quantum jump in our planning,” he wrote. “I am thinking of a commitment in talent and money comparable, if necessary, to that which produced the first atomic weapon. That is the way to stay ahead.”

Strauss found his support for a hydrogen bomb doggedly opposed by physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the chairman of the AEC’s general advisory committee who led the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Fearing the hydrogen bomb would only accelerate a dangerous Cold War arms race, Oppenheimer also argued for more openness about the size and capabilities of America’s nuclear arsenal, which Strauss thought would only benefit the Soviets.

Strauss successfully lobbied Truman, who publicly announced his decision to develop the hydrogen bomb on January 31, 1950. Less than three years later, the U.S. detonated the world’s first H-bomb, only to have the Soviets follow suit 10 months later.

After leaving the AEC in 1950, Strauss re-entered government when newly elected President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him as an atomic energy adviser in February 1953. Strauss, who had been a major donor to Eisenhower’s presidential campaign, wielded considerable power as all federal agencies were required to clear their atomic-related activities with him. Months later, Eisenhower asked Strauss to chair the AEC. Strauss agreed on one condition—that Oppenheimer no longer serve as a consultant to the commission.

Strauss Orchestrates Oppenheimer’s Blacklisting

After Strauss appointed Oppenheimer as director of the Institute for Advanced Study in 1947, the relationship had quickly frayed. Oppenheimer perceived Strauss as a meddler and mocked the amateur physicist’s opposition to exporting radioisotopes for medical purposes at a U.S. Senate hearing, leaving Strauss flush with rage. “There was a look of hatred there that you don’t see very often in a man’s face,” AEC chairman David Lilienthal recalled.

The thin-skinned Strauss didn’t forget slights easily. “He has more elbows than an octopus,” noted a colleague. Within days of being sworn in as AEC chairman, Strauss directed the removal of classified documents from Oppenheimer’s office, and he was determined to prove that the “father of the atomic bomb” was no longer a national hero—but a national security threat.

Amid the anti-communist hysteria of the Second Red Scare and the hearings of Senator Joseph McCarthy to expose suspected communists in the federal government, Strauss questioned Oppenheimer’s patriotism. Although he never officially joined the Communist Party, Oppenheimer had been drawn to left-wing political causes and had close friends and family who had been party members at various times. Strauss believed the physicist may have opposed the hydrogen bomb and concealed Soviet attempts to infiltrate the Manhattan Project because he was a foreign agent.

According to Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin's American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, Strauss used his media contacts to print defamatory stories about Oppenheimer. After he pressed J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to monitor the physicist, the agency tracked Oppenheimer and illegally tapped his telephone. And having gained Eisenhower’s ear, Strauss sowed doubts about whether Oppenheimer could be trusted; a letter written by one of Strauss’ close confidants made its way to the president, declaring “more probably than not J. Robert Oppenheimer is an agent of the Soviet Union.”

In December 1953, Strauss informed Oppenheimer that his security clearance had been stripped, but the physicist appealed the decision to a three-member panel that launched a month-long hearing in April 1954. After a one-sided proceeding in which Oppenheimer’s lawyers were blocked from accessing confidential material, the panel acknowledged he was a loyal citizen but voted 2 to 1 to revoke his security clearance.

The decision left Oppenheimer’s reputation in tatters. “He was a man of peace, and they destroyed him. He was a man of science, and they destroyed this man,” lamented close friend and fellow physicist Isidor Isaac Rabi.

Five years later, Strauss paid a price for Oppenheimer’s blacklisting. When Eisenhower appointed Strauss as U.S. secretary of commerce, the Senate rejected his nomination after a bitter confirmation hearing in which his treatment of Oppenheimer played a critical role. Strauss was only the eighth Cabinet nominee in U.S. history—and the only one between 1925 and 1989—who failed to win confirmation. Following the defeat, Strauss focused on philanthropic ventures until his death in 1974.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhpc3RvcnkuY29tL25ld3MvbGV3aXMtc3RyYXVzcy1udWNsZWFyLXByb2dyYW0tb3BwZW5oZWltZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-28 22:00:00+00:00,The True Story of Lewis Strauss' Rivalry With J. Robert Oppenheimer,Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' features Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss  Here's what to know about Strauss' career and feud with J. Robert Oppenheimer.,"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, the three-hour epic chronicling the invention of the nuclear bomb and its aftermath, features a virtuosic performance from Cillian Murphy and focuses largely on his titular scientist as he grapples with the ramifications of his own hubris. Supporting Murphy is an all-star cast of actors portraying real-life figures from that time period, including Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife Kitty, Florence Pugh as his lover Jean Tatlock, and Gary Oldman as U.S. President Harry Truman.

Especially pivotal to the film's third act is former MCU star Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, a member of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and an increasingly antagonistic party in the security hearings that ultimately result in Oppenheimer's clearance being revoked.

As the film tells it, Strauss is initially driven by professional jealousy and resentment towards Oppenheimer, as well as a degree of perceived humiliation: he believes Oppenheimer ""badmouthed"" him to renowned physicist Albert Einstein (Tom Conti).

And while some of the enmity between the two men may be narrativized and played for dramatic effect, the details of Strauss' vendetta against Oppenheimer are based in well-documented facts.

Who was Lewis Strauss?

As a founding member of the AEC, Strauss played an instrumental role in the development of nuclear weapons and energy in the United States during the Cold War. However, while Strauss was a supporter of research into the creation of the hydrogen bomb, which J. Robert Oppenheimer vehemently opposed due to his own guilt following the destruction at Hiroshima.

Strauss' grudge against J. Robert Oppenheimer is believed to have worsened in 1947, when the physicist was offered a job as director at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study—a position for which Strauss had momentarily been considered. He also disliked Oppenheimer on personal and political grounds: Oppenheimer was a liberal who associated with Communists and spoke seldom of his Jewish heritage, while Strauss was a Republican, sat on the American Jewish Committee, and had attempted (unsuccessfully) to influence U.S. policy to increase the number of refugees allowed into the country during the Holocaust.

These resentments culminated in Strauss arranging for Oppenheimer to be stripped of his security clearance following the 1954 hearings—just one day before they had been due to expire, seemingly confirming that his primary intention had been to humiliate and discredit Oppenheimer.

In an interview with Vulture prior to the release of Oppenheimer, Downey shared his thoughts on Strauss and offered an alternative take on the man, who is presented in stark antagonism to Murphy's Oppenheimer.

""I had a previous fair understanding of Strauss because I was fascinated with the mechanics of warfare, particularly in the Pacific theater in World War II,"" he said. ""I challenged a little bit the Mozart-Salieri of it all. I said, I’m not sure in some ways that Strauss isn’t a bit the hero here, which kind of raised an eyebrow on Chris [Nolan]. I half-jokingly challenged him on whether Admiral Strauss hadn’t done everything that any patriotic American would’ve done. And he said, Well, this will be a wonderful ongoing dialogue.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNoZWFsdGguY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYTQ0NjYxODU3L2xld2lzLXN0cmF1c3Mtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItcml2YWxyeS10cnVlLXN0b3J5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The former Disney star, 36, rose to fame starring in the hit teen sitcom Drake & Josh from 2004 to 2007.

One of the long-running jokes in the Nickelodeon sitcom revolved around the cheeky character named Megan (played by iCarly star Miranda Cosgrove) who was always pulling pranks on her brothers.

Josh's expression became a meme over the years and eagle-eyed cinemagoers who watched Oppenheimer at the weekend, in which Peck stars as Kenneth Bainbridge, has gone viral once again.

In one scene featured in Christopher Nolan's acclaimed new film, Peck does an expression which has reminded Nickelodeon fans of his 'Megan Face'.

The tweet has received 62,000 likes and over 1.4M views, so clearly a lot of people had the exact same thought.

“THATS why this shot was so distracting to me,” a Twitter user replied.

2023-07-12 11:23:29.599000-04:00,Which Supporting Characters in Oppenheimer Will Die of Radiation Poisoning?,"Let’s go one by one down the 70-person cast list of Christopher Nolan’s ‘Oppenheimer,’ from Cillian Murphy through Florence Pugh’s Jean Tatlock, until we find the most likely suspects.","Boom. Photo: Universal Pictures

It is a truth universally acknowledged that, if you’re going to make a movie about nuclear physicists, one of them must eventually fall victim to a lab accident that causes them to die an excruciating death by radiation poisoning. If in the course of this accident, they heroically sacrifice themselves to save their fellow scientists, all the better.

However, standing between Christopher Nolan’s upcoming Oppenheimer and the obligatory radiation-poisoning death scene is the same historical fact that has bedeviled all other depictions of the Manhattan Project: The only two such occurrences at Los Alamos, the tragic deaths of Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin, happened after the bomb had already been dropped.

This will not do. How else can a filmmaker represent the terrible dawn of the atomic age than by showing the devastating effects of radiation on a single American scientist? (Before you say, “What about the hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians?,” sorry, that’s not allowed.)

The 1989 movie Fat Man and Little Boy got around this issue by killing off a fictional character, John Cusack’s Michael Merriman, who was loosely based on Slotin. Could Oppenheimer do the same? Let’s go down the 70-person cast list one by one, crossing off the people who canonically did not die of radiation poisoning, until we find the most likely suspects.

J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy)

We’ll start with the easy ones. Since Oppenheimer also delves into what happened to Robert Oppenheimer after the war, we know Nolan is not going to invent a fictional death for him. A lifelong smoker, the real Oppenheimer died of throat cancer in 1967 at age 62.

Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt)

After her husband’s death, Kitty started dating his old colleague Robert Serber, who’d recently lost his wife. In 1972 they bought a sailboat and set off on a trip through the Panama Canal and across the Pacific. However, they only got as far as Panama, where Kitty died of an embolism in a U.S. Army hospital.

Frank Oppenheimer (Dylan Arnold)

Robert Oppenheimer’s little brother also worked on the Manhattan Project, but as tragic as it would be for him to perish in the name of science, he lived to age 72.

﻿You see Jason Clarke’s name in a cast list, you naturally assume he’s either going to get cucked, or he’s going to die. (Or sometimes both!) But these all appear to be characters from Robert Oppenheimer’s security-clearance hearings in 1954, which ipso facto means they will not die in a terrible nuclear accident ten years earlier.

Patrick Blackett (James D’Arcy), Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), Isidor Rabi (David Krumholtz), Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), Hartlan Snyder (Rory Keane), Kurt Gödel (James Urbaniak), and Leo Szilard (Máté Haumann)

All of these people are real scientists who crossed paths with Robert Oppenheimer, sometimes as mentors, sometimes as friends. They survived the war without being killed by rogue masses of plutonium.

Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), Harry Truman (Gary Oldman), and Lyndon Johnson (Hap Lawrence)

Similarly, I do not think Oppenheimer is going to invent fictional deaths for these famous historical figures.

Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer)

During World War II, U.S. intelligence reportedly considered assassinating the Nobel laureate if they learned he was helping Germany produce an atomic bomb. He wasn’t, so they didn’t, and he lived until 1976.

Leslie Groves (Matt Damon)

Listen, it would be hilarious for Damon to be killed in yet another Christopher Nolan film. But Groves, the general who directed the Manhattan Project, didn’t die until 1970.

Did you think Dunkirk had a lot of young actors who were impossible to tell apart? Welcome to Oppenheimer’s squadron of nerdy young hunks, all of whom are playing real Los Alamos scientists who made it through the war.

Klaus Fuchs (Christopher Denham)

On the TV series Manhattan, Denham played a fictional scientist at Los Alamos who turned out to be spying for the Soviets. In Oppenheimer, he’s playing the real-life scientist who turned out to be spying for the Soviets. The guy knows his type. Anyway, Fuchs was caught, sent to prison, then moved to East Germany, where he died the year before the Wall fell.

Rossi Lomanitz (Josh Zuckerman)

Lomanitz was denied a spot at Los Alamos due to his membership in the Communist Party. He wound up fighting in the Pacific Theater, but survived, dying of cancer in 2002.

Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh)

Oppenheimer’s Communist ex was found dead in her apartment in 1944. Was her death a suicide, as the official story goes, or was she murdered? The authors of American Prometheus, the book Oppenheimer is based on, admit that much of the evidence is consistent with suicide, but they also quote a doctor who says, “If you were clever and wanted to kill someone, this is the way to do it.” Anyway, there’s enough drama to Jean’s story without making nuclear physics the culprit.

Jackie Oppenheimer (Emma Dumont), Mary Washburn (Sadie Stratton), Haakon Chevalier (Jefferson Hall), Barbara Chevalier (Britt Kyle), and George Eltenton (Guy Burnet)

Jackie was Frank’s wife and Robert’s sister-in-law. She and everyone else in this section were Communists who crossed paths with Oppenheimer without dying of radiation poisoning.

Richard Tolman (Tom Jenkins) and Vannevar Bush (Matthew Modine)

Science bigwigs! Much too important to be doing hands-on research with radioactive elements until the fateful moment their hand slips, just for an instant …

Ruth Tolman (Louise Lombard)

Richard Tolman’s wife, who allegedly had an affair with Oppenheimer. She died in 1957, for reasons unrelated to the development of the atom bomb.

Lili Hornig (Olivia Thirlby)

The rare woman working for the Manhattan Project. Hornig died in November 2017 at age 96, meaning she theoretically lived long enough to see Dunkirk in theaters.

Charlotte Serber (Jessica Erin Martin)

The librarian at Los Alamos; Serber died by suicide in 1967.

J. Ernest Wilkins (Ronald Auguste)

A Black nuclear physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project, though not at Los Alamos. He lived until 2011, and Oppenheimer wouldn’t dare put him in New Mexico just to kill him off.

David Hill (Rami Malek)

I gotta be honest, when I began this project, I thought Malek was going to be the one to bite it for sure. A name like “David Hill”? That sounds like a fictional character. And can’t you just see Malek’s eyes go wide (or wider) in panic when he realizes he’s doomed? But no — Hill was a real guy too, who lived to 89.

Lyall Johnson (Jack Cutmore-Scott), Boris Pash (Casey Affleck), Henry Stimson (James Remar), George C. Marshall (Will Roberts), James Byrnes (Pat Skipper), and James Conant (Steve Coulter)

U.S. government employees of varying ranks: Johnson was a lowly security officer; Marshall was secretary of state. What they all have in common is that none of them died of radiation poisoning.

With them, we’ve come to the end of all the named characters in the Oppenheimer credits, all of whose deaths are accounted for. Could it be that Oppenheimer will somehow not include the obligatory movie scene of a scientist dying in a lab accident? Perhaps! However, the movie’s credits also include a handful of characters who lack proper names. Let’s run through them quickly to see if any of them are candidates.

Senate Aide (Alden Ehrenreich), Counsel (Scott Grimes), and Congressman (Jeff Hephner)

These guys also seem like they come from the 1950s scenes. They’re safe! (Sidenote: Five years ago, Ehrenreich was the future of Star Wars. Now he’s playing an unnamed character in the framing device of a Christopher Nolan film. Time moves fast in Hollywood.)

Dutch Student (Petrie Willink)

He’s listed in the section with people Oppenheimer met as a young man traveling Europe, so I think he’s probably safe as well.

AAF Officer (Jeremy John Wells), Weatherman (Sean Avery), Army Captain (Adam Kroeger), Soldier (Drew Kenney), and AAF Officer 2 (Bryce Johnson)

Every World War II movie needs guys like this. I don’t expect any of them will have the screen time to die in a nuclear accident.

Burn Victim (Flora Nolan)

A possibility from the name alone, until you realize she’s being played by Nolan’s college-age daughter.

Laughing Woman (Kerry Westcott), Kissing Woman (Christina Hogue), Kissing Man (Clay Bunker), Weeping Man (Tyler Bearsley), and Consoling Woman (Maria Teresa Zuppetta)

I like to imagine these characters will all appear together in the summer’s weirdest sex scene.

Presidential Aide (Kate French)

Next!

Concerned Scientist (Brett Delbuono)

If Oppenheimer is going to make a supporting character die of radiation poisoning, it all comes down to this guy.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvd2hpY2gtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY2hhcmFjdGVycy1kaWUtb2YtcmFkaWF0aW9uLXBvaXNvbmluZy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,The Atomic Bomb’s First Victims Were in New Mexico,"The Manhattan Project’s Trinity test—the first atomic bomb detonation—led to infant deaths, cancer and decades of health problems.","On July 16, 1945, J. Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project scientists detonated an atomic bomb for the first time ever at the Trinity test site in New Mexico. The explosion took place more than 200 miles away from the Los Alamos Laboratory where they’d built the weapon. But the testing site, located in the Tularosa Basin, was not an isolated area. Nearly half a million people, many of them Hispanos and Native Americans, lived within a 150-mile radius of the detonation—some only 12 miles away. These people and others downwind of the blast became the first victims of nuclear fallout.

Many of them heard (and felt) the Trinity explosion around 5:30 that morning, and saw the bright blast it created in the sky. Some had direct contact with the fallout material. One witness at a summer camp in Ruidoso, New Mexico, later told Vice that she and other girls played in falling white debris like it was snow, catching it on their tongues and rubbing it on their faces. Others came into contact with the fallout through their environment as the radioactive debris infected the surrounding water, crops, livestock and land.

The U.S. government, keen on avoiding panic and maintaining the project’s high level of wartime secrecy, told Tularosa Basin residents that the blast they’d seen was simply an accidental explosion of ammunition and pyrotechnics. Officials chose not to evacuate the area, nor to warn residents of potential health effects. Yet even after the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki a few weeks later—killing an estimated 110,000 to 210,000 people and effectively ending the war—government officials still failed to inform Tularosa Basin residents about the potential effects of the blast. When asked directly about the detonation’s health risk, they denied any potential hazard.

Atomic Bomb History

US Officials Ignored Infant Deaths

One of the most immediate health impacts of the Trinity test was a spike in infant deaths. In 1947, an alarmed health care provider in Roswell named Kathryn S. Behnke wrote to Stafford Warren, who was responsible for radiation safety during the Manhattan Project, to ask him if these deaths had any connection to the Trinity test.

“As I recall, in August 1945, the month after the first bomb was tested in New Mexico, there were about 35 infant deaths here,” Behnke wrote in her letter to Warren, according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. “I understand the rate at Alamogordo, nearer the site of the test, was even higher than Roswell.”

At the time, scientists understood that exposure to nuclear radiation could lead to tumors, cancers and other negative health effects. In fact, five days after the Trinity test, Warren had told Manhattan Project leader General Leslie Groves that the nuclear fallout from the test represented “a very serious hazard” over a 2,700-square-mile area downwind of the Trinity site.

Despite Warren’s knowledge that the fallout represented a huge health risk, his assistant wrote back to Behnke that he hadn’t heard about an increase in infant mortality, but in any case “wanted to assure you that the safety and health of the people at large is not in any way endangered.”

Trinity Test Created an Ongoing Health Crisis

Over the next several decades, people who lived through the blast began to develop cancer, heart disease and other health problems. People born after the blast developed these problems, too. This occurred not only because the radioactive fallout from Trinity stuck around in the environment; other factors included local uranium mining (uranium is a key component of the A-bomb’s construction) and migrating fallout from nuclear tests in Nevada starting in the 1950s.

People who lived near Trinity and other nuclear test sites began to identify themselves as “downwinders,” and made connections between their communities’ health problems and the government’s nuclear tests. In 1990, the United States passed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act to provide money to some downwinders of the Nevada test site near Las Vegas. However, the act doesn’t provide any compensation or apology to the downwinders of the Trinity test site.

In 2005, Tina Cordova co-founded the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium to draw attention to the region’s radiation exposure and demand government action. The organization promotes amendments to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act that would include New Mexico downwinders and other people with nuclear radiation exposure.

The 1990 act “is an admission on the part of our government of the harm that they did to other downwinders,” says Cordova, who was born in Tularosa in 1959 and is a cancer survivor. “The problem is, the program doesn’t go far enough because it left out the first people ever exposed to radiation from a bomb, which are the people of New Mexico.”

In a 2010 report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that exposure rates from the Trinity test “were measured at levels 10,000 times higher than currently allowed.” The first nuclear detonation caused an ongoing health crisis for which New Mexico’s downwinders are still demanding an apology and compensation.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhpc3RvcnkuY29tL25ld3MvYXRvbWljLWJvbWItdGVzdC12aWN0aW1zLW5ldy1tZXhpY28tZG93bndpbmRlcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-30 23:31:59+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’ star Cillian Murphy acknowledges Rays pitcher as doppelganger: ‘He’s a lot better at baseball than I am’,"Ever since Christopher Nolan's blockbuster hit ""Oppenheimer"" premiered in theatres, many have noticed that Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Tyler Glasnow looks eerily similar to Cillian Murphy, who plays the lead role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in the film.","TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) – Ever since Christopher Nolan’s blockbuster hit “Oppenheimer” premiered in theatres, many have noticed that Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Tyler Glasnow looks eerily similar to Cillian Murphy, who plays the lead role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in the film.

After Glasnow went viral on social media for looking like Murphy’s “long-lost twin,” many wondered if Murphy even knew he had a “doppelganger” since he’s not online, let alone one who plays professional baseball.

It turns out he’s very aware.

In an interview with Josh Horowitz on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast, Murphy was asked who’s the last actor he got mistaken for. When Murphy responded, saying it doesn’t really happen to him, Horowitz brought up Tampa Bay’s Tyler Glasnow.

“Are you aware – again, I know you’re not online, this baseball player that’s been mistaken for you?” Horowitz asked.

To which Murphy surprisingly replied, “Yes, I’ve been sent that.”

“You’re the first person to say, but wasn’t that like an AI-generated image or something?” Murphy asked. “Many people have sent the [picture]. I need to turn off more notifications.”

While the Rays’ photo of Glasnow may have been a little touched up, the resemblance between the two is still uncanny.

Although there are several differences between Glasnow and Murphy, like the staggering 18-year age gap and the fact Murphy probably can’t throw a 96 mph fastball, fans can’t help but be in awe over their looks.

“You’ve got a long-lost twin,” Horowitz told Murphy.

“Yeah, well, he’s a lot better at baseball than I am,” Murphy said. When told that he’s probably “a bit better at acting” than Glasnow, Murphy joked, “Well, we’ve all got our skills.”

Horowitz shared that clip of his interview with Murphy on Twitter with the caption, “Yes, Cillian Murphy is aware of his baseball doppelgänger.”

As of right now, Glasnow has yet to publicly comment on the resemblance.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZmxhLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LW5ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc3Rhci1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1hY2tub3dsZWRnZXMtcmF5cy1waXRjaGVyLWFzLWRvcHBlbGdhbmdlci1oZXMtYS1sb3QtYmV0dGVyLWF0LWJhc2ViYWxsLXRoYW4taS1hbS_SAZ0BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2ZsYS5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1uZXdzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXN0YXItY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktYWNrbm93bGVkZ2VzLXJheXMtcGl0Y2hlci1hcy1kb3BwZWxnYW5nZXItaGVzLWEtbG90LWJldHRlci1hdC1iYXNlYmFsbC10aGFuLWktYW0vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-23 09:50:00+00:00,Oppenheimer: Christopher Nolan’s movie has a devastating ending. Is it enough?,What the anti-nuclear movement thinks of Christopher Nolan’s movie.,"In Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) yells that the Manhattan Project is “the most important fucking thing to happen in the history of the world!” Many historical dramas feel that way about their subjects, but most don’t come right out and say it. Nolan’s movie attempts to back that sentiment up, though, by dramatizing the fears and guilt the bomb inspired in J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) in the postwar years. But does it matter that Oppenheimer felt guilty? Was Oppenheimer, as Nolan is telling the press now, hopelessly naïve? And is Oppenheimer, the movie, telling the right story about a weapon that, almost 80 years later, still stands at the ready to annihilate the world?
My friend Seth Shelden is the United Nations Liaison for the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, which has spent more than a decade developing a treaty banning nuclear weapons through international law and has now gotten nearly 100 nations to sign on. (Everyone has a friend who makes them feel like a slacker, but you get a special feeling of insignificance from a friend who had a hand in winning the Nobel Peace Prize.) After I saw Oppenheimer, Seth was the first person I wanted to talk to. We discussed what Nolan’s movie leaves out, what people forget about how many nuclear bombs have already been deployed in the world, and how ICAN plans to get the world’s great powers—including the U.S.—to agree to give up their nukes. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dan Kois: The centerpiece of the movie is the first Trinity test, which seems gigantic on an IMAX screen. How does a typical bomb in 2023 compare in strength to that test?
Seth Shelden: The average bomb in one of the U.S. arsenals, let’s say, is somewhere between five times and 30 times bigger than what was used in the Trinity test, which was the same size as the Hiroshima bomb. We have some in our arsenal that are over a megaton, so 80 times bigger than what we dropped in Hiroshima. The largest weapon that’s ever been tested, I think it’s over 3,000 Hiroshima bombs. That’s the Tsar Bomb. It shattered windows in other countries when it was tested.
Jeez.

The basic answer is that the weapons that were used in New Mexico—and in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which killed hundreds of thousands of people—look like colonial muskets by comparison to what we have now.
In the movie, Oppenheimer declares that developing these weapons will usher in “a peace mankind has never seen.” That seems, like, hopelessly naïve to me. Why did people once believe that?
You say “why did people once believe that” as if they don’t believe it anymore.
Advertisement

I guess some people still do. You don’t agree with the idea that nuclear weapons are an insurer of peace, as opposed to an eventual destroyer of the world.
This is a pervasive myth, one that primarily benefits the companies that build nuclear weapons. It’s the myth that military power prevents conflict. A lot of our work is to help people understand that this realpolitik that came about, that really crystallized in the post–World War II era, is incredibly dangerous, actually. The real realists recognize that by perpetuating this system of valuing nuclear weapons, we are going to ensure that they’re used. The only way to usher in “a peace mankind has never seen” is to prohibit and eliminate the weapons.
Advertisement
Oppenheimer seems to come to a similar conclusion in the movie, which focuses a great deal on his postwar career. It argues that he became something of an anti-nuclear agitator. How does the modern anti-nuclear movement actually view Robert Oppenheimer?
It’s true that the film depicts Oppenheimer’s later conviction that arms control and regulation is what is needed. But it’s also true that that he spends a lot of the movie talking about how the scientists don’t get a role in what the government does with it.
Advertisement
Advertisement
You pursue the science. That’s your job. And then it’s not up to you to figure out how to utilize it.
A lot of our movement’s success has been contradicting that notion. The experts are not these military strategists. The experts are the scientists who can really understand the way the weapons work. They’re the doctors who understand that there’s no adequate medical response to these weapons. They’re the climatologists who understand that in the event of a full-scale conflict between the U.S. and Russia, up to 5 billion people will die because of the crop reduction following the climate chaos that would ensue. And the experts are the victims, the affected people who can testify to what happens when these weapons are used.
Advertisement
So, on one hand, yes, Oppenheimer, like so many people who have worked in the military, later realized, “Oh, you know what? This was a terrible idea.” But at the same time, a lot of people in the modern anti-nuclear movement, especially those who are or speak for affected communities, are quite traumatized by the celebration of Oppenheimer as some sort of, I don’t know, honorable person who felt guilty.
Advertisement
Advertisement
When you’re talking about affected communities, you’re talking about people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki?
Not only them. You hear even very high-level people saying that nuclear weapons were only used twice. Nuclear weapons were not used twice. In fact, they’ve been used over 2,000 times, with all the tests that each of the nuclear-armed states have conducted. And each of those uses has had intergenerational impacts. And there are studies, including by the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, concluding that 2.4 million people are predicted to eventually die from cancers as a result of the tests that have been conducted so far.
Advertisement
Advertisement
These tests have been done generally in Indigenous lands, in lands of their imperial control, in lands of marginalized communities. In addition to New Mexico, the French tested in Algeria, the British and the U.S. tested in the South Pacific, Russians in Kazakhstan, Chinese in Uyghur territories. They’re not testing where their power centers are, for obvious reasons.
Nolan makes a very deliberate choice not to show the effects of the bomb at Hiroshima or Nagasaki. There are some stylized moments when Oppenheimer is visualizing bomb impacts in times of great personal crisis. And there are moments when those effects are described in audio but we don’t see them. Do you think the movie should have shown those impacts?
Advertisement
Advertisement
The most unfortunate aspect of this film, again, I think, is its erasure of those who are affected by the weapons. I don’t know that we always need to depict the hundreds of thousands of people dying on film, especially because these are incredibly painful and traumatic images for those who continue to suffer. But I do think it’s a disservice not to tell their story. As you say, everything is framed through the perspective of this tortured white scientist, struggling with this challenge of the scientific and moral challenge of the unknown.
The more time you spend valorizing the scientific achievement, the more you encourage people to view it as some kind of triumph that needs to be celebrated or recognized despite the possible problems it might cause in the future.
Advertisement
You could argue that the main premise of the film is that the true injustice that we’re analyzing is the refusal to renew Oppenheimer’s security clearance.
To punish him for his conscience.
Yeah.
You mention the specter of the 5 billion, as you say, who would die if there’s a full-scale war between the United States and Russia. That apocalyptic possibility isn’t exactly ignored in the movie. It’s certainly touched on. Do you think that Nolan takes that danger seriously enough, or could you never take that danger seriously enough?
Well, I think you can take that danger seriously enough.
By banning nuclear weapons.
Advertisement
Advertisement
Advertisement
Yeah. By working towards a real solution instead of perpetuating the notion that nuclear weapons are terrible things but we need them. Obviously, I didn’t expect the last line of the movie to be, like, “Every country should join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.” But even if you walk out of the film being like, Wow, these are incredibly destructive, there is a big risk that especially U.S. viewers will just come back to the false conclusion that the weapons, while clearly terrible, are better for us to have than not have, because they “keep us safe.”
Advertisement
I mean, the last line of the movie isn’t a full-throated declaration of loyalty to ICAN, but it is Oppenheimer basically saying, like, “I think I destroyed the world.”
Sure. You’re gambling, as a director, that the audience is going to walk away thinking about that moment and chewing on that. Some audience members will, probably, but in light of the three hours that have preceded it, I’m not sure it has the impact that Nolan might think it has simply by dint of being the last beat.
Let’s talk a little bit about solutions and what your organization does. ICAN is making a bet that you can persuade people not to use this weapon, on a country-by-country basis. What is the state of your treaty?
Advertisement
Advertisement
You say we’re making a “bet” that we can convince people not to use this weapon, but the fact is that it’s self-evident to most of the world that these weapons do not provide security and need to be eliminated. Now, in the U.S., this isn’t top-line news, in part because the U.S. has worked so hard to ignore this treaty.
Advertisement
We negotiated the treaty through 2017, which is when we won the Nobel Peace Prize. It’s the first treaty that builds a framework for the total elimination of nuclear weapons by international law. It also contains provisions to address the harms from past nuclear weapons use and testing. The treaty would enter into force once 50 countries ratified it and fully joined it. That happened in January 2021. By now 95 states in total have made some legal commitment to the treaty, so that’s close to half of the U.N. membership.
Advertisement
We had the first meeting of states parties last June in Austria, where they adopted this really powerful declaration that condemned any and all threats to use nuclear weapons, which had a demonstrable impact on the Kremlin’s threats in the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Advertisement
Advertisement
It may be impossible to answer this question, but what is the pathway to getting the U.S. to sign a treaty like this?
No, it’s not impossible. It’s sometimes difficult to understand how massive shifts happen when you’re in the middle of the problem. It took 70-plus years, but in 2021 nuclear weapons became comprehensively illegal under international law for the first time. So that was Step 1.
Advertisement
And the second step is then to build the norm, using this treaty to stigmatize and delegitimize the weapons as some great badge of power. Because in the U.S. right now, nuclear weapons are bizarrely baked into our national psyche as something we value, when in fact they’re just horrible, indiscriminate, and life-ending. A shift in public consciousness is a major part of this. But of course it can happen. You think about people who lived in the middle of a millennium of slavery, let’s say, who were just like, “Well, this is just the way the world works” and couldn’t ever see a way out of that. And now it’s not that slavery doesn’t exist anywhere, but it’s something incomprehensible to the vast majority of people, and it’s banned under customary international law.
Advertisement
Advertisement
Step 3: You build the prohibition, you build the norm, and then you negotiate how the disarmament happens.
Now, the question I think that we should be asking is not whether the U.S. will sign, but whether the U.S. will join this treaty before or after there’s a great nuclear disaster.
Was the development of the atomic bomb, as Matt Damon says, the most important fucking thing ever to happen?
Well, I can tell you that it was the most important fucking thing ever to happen for the hundreds of thousands of people it killed in the days after, and the millions of people who died of or continued to suffer from it. I mean, that’s not what Matt Damon meant, of course, but it goes back to one issue I take with how the story is told. Somehow, we—and the U.S. government was a big part of this—have imbued nuclear weapons with magical powers. And Matt Damon’s line reinforces that. But in fact, we should all push back against that. We should start by actually recognizing what they do and who’s actually affected by them, instead of celebrating these people who made them. If we do that, that’s a step toward finally eliminating nuclear weapons before they eliminate us.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy8wNy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1tb3ZpZS1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1lbmRpbmctaGlyb3NoaW1hLW5hZ2FzYWtpLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,The Real History Behind Christopher Nolan’s ‘Oppenheimer’,"The ""father of the atomic bomb"" has long been misunderstood. Will the new film finally get J. Robert Oppenheimer right?","Since the end of World War II, historians and artists alike have been fascinated by the brilliant, enigmatic J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who led the Manhattan Project laboratory that developed the atomic bomb. Beginning as early as 1946, documentaries, television miniseries, plays, books, graphic novels, feature films and even an opera have explored the scientist’s life, work and legacy. In recent years, however, much of that complexity has been reduced to a single popular image: the broken genius, haunted by his own invention, reciting a line from the Bhagavad Gita in a 1965 NBC News documentary. “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds,” Oppenheimer intones.
But Oppenheimer’s life was about far more than regret. “[He] was interesting as the father of the bomb,” says Kai Bird, co-author of the 2005 Pulitzer Prize-winning biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer. “But the real arc in the story is the tragedy.”
Oppenheimer | New Trailer Watch on
Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, which opens in theaters on July 21, will be the first feature-length film to tackle the scientist’s life in its entirety, and it promises to be spectacular. Starring Cillian Murphy of “Peaky Blinders” fame in the title role alongside an ensemble A-list cast, the film (which uses American Prometheus as its main source material) will reintroduce the scientist and the top-secret bomb project he helmed to a new generation of Americans. Oppenheimer provides an opportunity to revisit this charismatic, contradictory man and reconsider how previous attempts to tell his story have succeeded—and failed—at fathoming one of the 20th century’s most fascinating public figures.
Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project
Born into a secular Jewish family in New York City in 1904 and educated at Manhattan’s Ethical Culture School, Oppenheimer graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University in just three years. If Harvard was easy, growing out of his awkward adolescence was harder. He struggled with mental health issues while pursuing a graduate degree at the University of Cambridge—“I was on the point of bumping myself off,” he later recalled—and ended up on probation after lacing an apple with chemicals and leaving it on his tutor’s desk. But by the time World War II broke out in 1939, Oppenheimer had transformed himself into a respected physicist at the University of California, Berkeley. “He was sort of a caricature of the eccentric professor,” Bird says, an intellectual omnivore who read Sanskrit, loved Elizabethan poetry, rode horses and made a great martini.
He had also fallen in love with Jean Tatlock (played by Florence Pugh in Nolan’s film), a dues-paying member of the Communist Party who awakened his interest in politics. Oppenheimer was “likely sympathetic to … communist goals,” according to the nonprofit Atomic Heritage Foundation, but he never officially joined the party. (“Any attempt to label Robert Oppenheimer a party member is a futile exercise—as the FBI learned to its frustration over many years,” wrote Bird and co-author Martin J. Sherwin, who died in October 2021 at age 84, in American Prometheus.) But many of his closest friends and family were party members at one point or another: his brother, Frank Oppenheimer; his friend Haakon Chevalier; and his future wife, Kitty Oppenheimer. These associations would cast suspicion on the physicist himself later in his life.
Oppenheimer’s political leanings didn’t prevent him from being recruited, in early 1942, for a secret project authorized by President Franklin D. Roosevelt that was drawing scientists from all over the country. Three years earlier, Albert Einstein had written a letter to Roosevelt warning that breakthroughs in nuclear fission promised “extremely powerful bombs of a new type.” Now, the race was on to figure out how to build one of these bombs before Germany did.
In the summer of 1942, Oppenheimer organized a series of secret seminars at Berkeley, where the United States’ top physicists roughed out the outlines of a possible bomb. As it turned out, Oppenheimer was a natural manager. “I don’t know how he had acquired this facility for handling people,” said Edward Teller, a colleague who would later testify against him. “Those who knew him well were really surprised.”
That September, General Leslie Groves (played by Matt Damon in the new film), an Army engineer who’d previously overseen construction of the Pentagon, took over as head of what was by then called the Manhattan Project, after its inaugural offices in lower Manhattan. Groves knew construction but not physics, so the charming Berkeley physicist caught his eye. “Oppenheimer was the first scientist Groves had met on his tour who grasped that building an atomic bomb required finding practical solutions to a variety of cross-disciplinary problems,” wrote Bird and Sherwin. He wasn’t an obvious choice—“He couldn’t run a hamburger stand,” said a Berkeley colleague—but in October 1942, Groves named Oppenheimer the project’s scientific director.
The government operation brought hundreds, and eventually thousands, of scientists, civilians and Army personnel to a mesa in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Their ranks eventually included Teller, Hans Bethe, Richard Feynman, Seth Neddermeyer, Robert Serber, Kenneth Bainbridge, Enrico Fermi and many others. (Nolan’s film portrays each of these figures and, judging by the full cast list, more or less recreates the entire field of theoretical physics in the 1930s and ’40s, including Kenneth Branagh as Nobel Prize winner Niels Bohr.) The scientists reported directly to Oppenheimer, who, at 38, was learning on the job how to run a lab.
Oppenheimer’s lab was only one part of the Manhattan Project. Built on the site of a former boys’ school, Los Alamos was one of three “secret cities” seized and transformed by the U.S. government in late 1942 and early 1943. The other two—Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington—accounted for the vast majority of the manpower, expense and industrial scale of the project, which employed an estimated half a million people between 1942 and 1945. At Oak Ridge, uranium was refined at the largest factory in the world, newly built for that purpose. In Hanford, an area half the size of Rhode Island was cleared of residents, their houses bulldozed to make way for reactors to produce plutonium. “I told you it couldn’t be done without turning the whole country into a factory,” Bohr said to Teller in 1944. “You have done just that.”
At Los Alamos, Oppenheimer came into his own as a gifted leader. “[He] had a very distinctive voice that was very soft,” says Bird. “You had to listen very carefully, but he was magnetic.” That magnetism kept the lab productive even after an initial design for the bomb, known as Thin Man, had to be scrapped in July 1944. Ultimately, the scientists settled on two workable designs for a bomb, which they called Fat Man and Little Boy. At 5:29 a.m. on July 16, 1945, almost three years of work culminated in the first nuclear detonation in history. Known as the Trinity test, it lit the hills of the New Mexico desert.
Oppenheimer, already famously thin, had lost weight during the project, and during the countdown, he reportedly barely breathed. Later dramatizations had the scientist reciting the line from the Bhagavad Gita during the moment of detonation (Oppenheimer himself later claimed the line had come to him then), but he reportedly said something closer to “It worked.”
After the test, Oppenheimer was transformed by relief. “I’ll never forget the way he stepped out of the car,” fellow Manhattan Project scientist Isidor Isaac Rabi later said. “His walk was like High Noon … this kind of strut. He had done it.”
On August 6, 1945, the Enola Gay dropped Little Boy on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Three days later, Bockscar dropped Fat Man on Nagasaki. Estimates of deaths from the two bombings vary widely, from a contemporary figure of around 110,000 to a later estimate of closer to 210,000. On August 15, Emperor Hirohito announced Japan’s surrender.
The battle over the bomb
In the years immediately following the war, public opinion about the use of the atomic bomb hadn’t yet solidified. The first time Oppenheimer appeared on the big screen was in August 1946, when he starred in the 18-minute documentary “Atomic Power,” which was part of Time’s “The March of Time” series. Onscreen, Oppenheimer (one of several figures who participated in the film, including Einstein, Groves and Rabi) re-enacts waiting anxiously for the detonation at Trinity with Rabi, who gives a stilted performance as he reassures his boss, “It’s going to work all right, Robert. And I’m sure we’ll never be sorry for it.”
HISTORY OF THE ATOM BOMB, MANHATTAN PROJECT AND ATOMIC POWER (Print 2) 71674z Watch on
In fact, Oppenheimer was already sorry. In October 1945, he told President Harry S. Truman (played by Gary Oldman in Nolan’s film), “Mr. President, I feel I have blood on my hands.” The tide of public opinion was also beginning to turn. Three weeks after “Atomic Power” was released, John Hersey’s searing, book-length article “Hiroshima” appeared in the New Yorker, awakening many Americans for the first time to the horrors of the bomb.
Fearing they were losing the battle for the history books, Truman and other officials sprang into action, compelling former Secretary of War Henry Stimson to defend the use of the bomb in a Harper’s magazine article published in February 1947. The story, which reads as a simple recitation of the facts, portrays the decision to use the bomb as one made with sagacious care. It introduced the argument—repeated often since—that the bomb prevented an Allied land invasion of Japan that would have cost “over a million casualties, to American forces alone.”
“That article really set the history for most Americans for the next generation,” Bird says. “And the narrative was, ‘Oh, it was a difficult decision. It was terrible. But it was necessary, and it saved perhaps a million American lives.’”
The first major Hollywood film about the bomb, The Beginning or the End, debuted the month after Stimson’s article. Initially conceived by atomic scientists as a way to educate the public about the dangers of nuclear warfare, the movie went through script approvals and retakes ordered by Groves and Truman that turned it into a “pro-bomb celebration—dictated by the Pentagon and White House,” wrote Greg Mitchell in his 2020 book, The Beginning or the End: How Hollywood—and America—Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.
Directed by Norman Taurog, the film “is so instructive because it is the earliest, and one of the most complete, reassertions of the pro-bomb narrative just when doubts were being raised,” Mitchell tells Smithsonian magazine. “Even Truman got involved, to the extent of ordering a costly retake and getting the actor playing him fired. The studio voluntarily handed over control of the film to the Pentagon, via Groves, and the White House. Oppenheimer himself caved to pressure.”
The Beginning or the End claimed the American military dropped warning leaflets about the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and that the Enola Gay came under attack from Japanese antiaircraft missile fire on its bombing run. Like Stimson’s article, it depicted Truman carefully working through the decision to drop the bomb before arriving at a pivotal moment.
In fact, the U.S. did not drop leaflets warning of the atomic bomb specifically, though pilots may have dropped more general notices of impending attacks on Hiroshima, and the Enola Gay did not come under antiaircraft fire. Many historians disagree that there was a single moment of “decision” on Truman’s part. In an essay included in the 2020 anthology The Age of Hiroshima, Alex Wellerstein, a nuclear historian at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey, wrote that Truman “was actually quite peripheral to most of the decisions that led to the use of the weapons.” Wellerstein argued that Truman may have even mistakenly believed that Hiroshima was a military target rather than a city made up largely of civilians. As for that figure of one million projected American casualties, Bird later asked Stimson’s ghostwriter, Mac Bundy, where he got it. “He looked at me,” Bird recalls, “and he says, ‘Oh, we pulled it out of thin air.’”
Oppenheimer described the script of The Beginning or the End as “without purpose or insight.” Another physicist, Leo Szilard, put it even more bluntly: “If our sin as scientists was to make and use the atomic bomb, then our punishment was to watch The Beginning or the End.”
The Oppenheimer security hearing
Almost immediately, Oppenheimer began speaking out publicly about the dangers of atomic warfare, even as he continued to act as a nuclear weapons consultant for the U.S. government. In November 1945, he told an audience in Philadelphia that the bomb was “by all the standards of the world we grew up in … an evil thing.” He gave television interviews starkly elucidating the risk of nuclear war. In 1949, as the head of an advisory committee for the newly formed Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), he delivered a report warning against developing a hydrogen bomb—a fusion weapon more powerful than the Trinity, Hiroshima or Nagasaki bombs—that had been conceived by fellow Manhattan Project scientist Teller. “A super bomb might become a weapon of genocide,” Oppenheimer wrote. “A super bomb should never be produced.” In 1953, he gave a speech likening the nuclear-capable United States and Soviet Union to “two scorpions in a bottle, each capable of killing the other, but only at the risk of his own life.”
Oppenheimer’s outspoken warnings made him a target, and in December 1953, amid McCarthy-era paranoia about Soviet spies in the highest levels of government, AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss (played by Robert Downey Jr. in Nolan’s film), who harbored a dislike for Oppenheimer, called the scientist into his office and told him his top-secret security clearance had been revoked. Oppenheimer insisted on defending himself, leading the AEC to call what became a highly publicized security hearing to resolve the matter.
The monthlong hearing, which began on April 12, 1954, amounted to an X-ray of Oppenheimer’s adult life. Transgressions large and small were dragged into the open and held up to exacting scrutiny. Key pieces of the case against Oppenheimer included his close friendship with Chevalier, a scholar of French literature at Berkeley and a card-carrying Communist whom the physicist had once protected from incrimination, as well as Oppenheimer’s opposition to Teller’s hydrogen bomb. The usually persuasive scientist panicked under questioning by AEC lawyer Roger Robb; at one point, caught in a contradiction, Oppenheimer accounted for his defense of Chevalier by admitting bluntly, “I was an idiot.” But he also had to defend personal matters, such as his decision to spend a night with his communist ex-fiancée, Tatlock, in the summer of 1943, while he was working at Los Alamos, six months before she died by suicide in 1944. Why did he have to see her? The committee asked. “Because she was still in love with me,” Oppenheimer responded.
On May 27, the board overseeing the hearings voted 2 to 1 not to reinstate Oppenheimer’s security clearance. “I personally think that our failure to clear Dr. Oppenheimer will be a black mark on the escutcheon of our country,” wrote lone dissenter Ward V. Evans. Either way, Oppenheimer’s relationship with the U.S. government was now officially over. He returned to Princeton, New Jersey, where he’d been the director of the Institute for Advanced Study since 1947. The hearings “destroyed him,” Rabi later said. Another friend, diplomat George Kennan, remembered trying to comfort Oppenheimer by telling him he’d surely be welcome abroad. “His answer, given to me with tears in his eyes: ‘Damn it, I happen to love this country.’”
Oppenheimer tried to minimize the importance of the hearings. “I think of this as a major accident, much like a train wreck or the collapse of a building,” he told a reporter. “It has no relation or connection to my life. I just happened to be there.” As much as he might have wished that to be true, Oppenheimer’s downfall during the hearings came to define him in the public eye. In 1964, the German playwright Heinar Kipphardt drew directly on the published transcripts of the security hearings for his In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Discussing the play with the Washington Post, perhaps still trying to prevent his downfall from defining him, Oppenheimer said, “The whole damn thing was a farce, and these people are trying to make a tragedy out of it.”
In an attempt at public rehabilitation, President Lyndon B. Johnson presented Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award, the AEC’s highest honor, in 1963. Nonetheless, the physicist never fully recovered from the blow to his reputation. He lived out the rest of his days in Princeton, where he kept his job at the Institute for Advanced Study until 1966, and died of cancer there in February 1967. As the New York Times wrote in his obituary, “This bafflingly complex man nonetheless never fully succeeded in dispelling doubts about his conduct.”
Oppenheimer’s security clearance remained revoked until December 2022, when the Department of Energy vacated the commission’s 1954 decision. “Oppenheimer occupies a central role in our history for leading the nation’s atomic efforts during World War II and planting the seeds for the Department of Energy’s national laboratories,” said Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm in a statement. “As time has passed, more evidence has come to light of the bias and unfairness of the process that Dr. Oppenheimer was subjected to, while the evidence of his loyalty and love of country [has] only been further affirmed.”
The myth of Oppenheimer
In the more than 50 years since Oppenheimer’s death, popular culture has taken varied approaches to exploring his life. The Peabody Award-winning 1981 documentary The Day After Trinity focused on his regret over his role in building the bomb. The 1980 BBC TV miniseries “Oppenheimer,” by contrast, starred a thin, quietly charismatic Sam Waterston and was more interested in the question of Oppenheimer’s communist ties and his downfall.
Later fictional depictions of Oppenheimer grew less interested in complex readings of his psychology and often flattened him into a character who sometimes bordered on the ridiculous. In 1989, director Roland Joffé made a big-budget bet on the story of the Manhattan Project in Fat Man and Little Boy. Despite an A-list cast—Paul Newman as Groves, John Cusack as a fictional Manhattan Project scientist, Laura Dern as that scientist’s girlfriend—the film flopped. The script was simplistic, the dialogue groan-inducing (“Naked. Isn’t that a beautiful word?” Dern says to Cusack when propositioning him) and veracity an afterthought. But the film suffered most from the performance of Dwight Schultz, best known to viewers from “The A-Team” and “Star Trek: The Next Generation,” as Oppenheimer. Schultz brought a blankness to his portrayal of a man who famously had charisma to spare. “Schultz is stiff and actorly,” wrote the Washington Post. “Like an irredeemably tone-deaf singer, he hits only false notes.”

In the otherwise excellent TV show “Manhattan,” which ran for two seasons in 2014 and 2015, Daniel London played Oppenheimer as an already broken man, as though the actor’s only reference for the character was the famous “I am become death” interview. His Oppenheimer was more interested in self-preservation than the success of the project, whereas the real Oppenheimer of the Los Alamos years was a nimble ball of energy, guiding the complex endeavor toward completion thanks to his keen feeling for the challenges his fellow scientists faced.
No list would be complete without one other fictional depiction of Oppenheimer: Pulitzer Prize-winning composer John Adams’ 2005 opera, Doctor Atomic. If Oppenheimer objected to Kipphardt’s play, he surely would have found Doctor Atomic’s elevation of his life into an operatic Faustian tragedy ridiculous. But the opera, which centers around the days leading up to the Trinity test and culminates in the detonation of the first atomic bomb, was rapturously received by critics and has been restaged several times since its debut. In the New York Times, science writer Dennis Overbye wrote that the opera had disabused him of his preconceptions about the bomb: “I long ago concluded that there was not much new to say about the atomic bomb. But I was wrong. As I was watching … I began to wonder if anything had yet been said that counted.”
Nolan’s Oppenheimer
Before Sherwin’s death in 2021, he and Bird read several scripts based on American Prometheus. One, Bird says, was boring. Another was just weird: “It had dream sequences, a ghost speaking Oppenheimer’s poetry. It had a scene in which [Oppenheimer] is at a cocktail party in Berkeley and imagines himself dropping a cyanide pill into Edward Teller’s drink and watching him collapse on the floor and die in agony.” Bird and Sherwin sent back a long memo detailing the script’s many historical errors.
So Bird was relieved when, in fall 2021, he became one of a handful of people outside the film’s production to read Nolan’s take on Oppenheimer. “I think it’s a fabulous script,” Bird says. Unlike other recent depictions, it covers scenes from Oppenheimer’s entire life and doesn’t shy away from the moral questions of the bomb. “Nolan covers in a very deft way the argument among the physicists over whether the bomb was necessary or not and has Oppenheimer after Hiroshima saying the bomb was used on a virtually already defeated enemy,” Bird adds. “People who know nothing about Oppenheimer will go thinking they’re going to see a movie about the father of the atomic bomb.” Instead, “they’re going to see this mysterious figure and a deeply mysterious biographical story.”
Regardless of whether subject matter experts believe there is nothing new to say, the general public’s understanding of Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project hasn’t changed significantly since Stimson’s 1947 Harper’s article. After all, most people’s sense of history doesn’t come by way of the academy or densely researched biographies. Visiting Los Alamos myself a few years ago, I asked a docent what they thought might renew public interest in the history of the Manhattan Project.
The answer? “A movie.”
“Oppenheimer himself couldn’t make up his mind how he felt about making and helping to use the bomb, right to the end of his life,” says Mitchell. Until now, “filmmakers also couldn’t seem to get a handle on his conflicting emotions and statements. In that sense, he is a valuable audience surrogate, severely divided or conflicted on these questions.”
Nolan’s film arrives at a precarious moment in which optimism about nuclear disarmament is giving way to talk of a new nuclear age. Few world leaders today have direct experience with the horrors of nuclear bombs, and some younger people are ignorant of even basic facts about World War II. But perhaps our distance from Oppenheimer’s era also presents an opportunity.
“Today, almost 80 years have passed since the end of World War II,” says Cynthia C. Kelly, president of the Atomic Heritage Foundation. Now, she adds, “the public can more openly consider different interpretations of atomic history.”
Why did it take so long for a director of Nolan’s caliber to take on Oppenheimer’s story? Perhaps it’s because we’re only now far enough away from those world-changing events to be open to seeing them—and him—with fresh eyes.
That’s no easy task. As Oppenheimer himself told an interviewer in 1948, “If you’ve lived a life that isn’t free and open with people, it’s almost impossible to unsnarl it, to unravel the ball of twine.”

Christopher Nolan says the strike is about ""jobbing actors, staff writers trying to raise a family, trying to keep food on the table""
Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan has said he ""absolutely"" will not work on another film until the Hollywood strikes are resolved.
Tens of thousands of Hollywood actors have joined writers in taking industrial action, because they want streaming giants to agree to a fairer split of profits and better working conditions.
The Screen Actors Guild also wants to protect actors from being usurped by digital replicas.
Nolan admitted he was ""very fortunate with the timing"", as his film's premieres were held just before the strike began, meaning Oppenheimer would not be affected by industry members stopping work.

When asked if he would write another film during the strike, he told BBC Culture editor Katie Razzall: ""No, absolutely. It's very important that everybody understands it is a very key moment in the relationship between working people and Hollywood.
""This is not about me, this is not about the stars of my film,"" the acclaimed director, writer and producer added.
""This is about jobbing actors, this is about staff writers on television programmes trying to raise a family, trying to keep food on the table.""

Oppenheimer stars Peaky Blinders' Cillian Murphy, who has already appeared in five Christopher Nolan films
As more production companies use streaming platforms - like Netflix and Amazon Prime - for their shows, it has changed how actors and writers get paid.
Previously every time an episode was re-run on a TV network, it would tend to involve payment, allowing those who worked on projects to get by in between jobs.
The director said the companies involved had not yet ""accommodated how they're going to in this new world of streaming, and a world where they're not licensing their products out to other broadcasters - they're keeping them for themselves"".
Nolan, who was Oscar-nominated five times for the films Dunkirk, Inception and Memento, added: ""They have not yet offered to pay appropriately to the unions' working members, and it's very important that they do so.
""I think you'd never want a strike, you never want industrial action.
""But there are times where it's necessary. This is one of those times.""
Speaking ahead of the London premiere, where several of Oppenheimer's stars left the red carpet early to strike, he explained: ""It's very important to bear in mind that there are people who have been out of work for months now, as part of the writers strike, and with the actors potentially joining - a lot of people are going to suffer.""
Watch: How the Hollywood strike affects you in 75 seconds
Despite the row in California, British-born Nolan has no current plans to work more in the UK, his home country, as he prefers to be ""on the real locations"" where his films are set.
""The UK has wonderful film studios,"" he explained. ""It's a great place to come to shoot a film if you're going to be on sound stages.""
Oppenheimer tells the story of J Robert Oppenheimer, the enigmatic Manhattan Project scientist, who had a leading role in developing the atomic bomb that made him a ""destroyer of worlds"".
He ""gave us the power to destroy ourselves and that had never happened before"", Nolan said.
Commissioned by the US Government during World War II, and believing themselves in a nuclear race with the Nazis over who would create the bomb first, in 1945 scientists in Los Alamos, New Mexico detonated a test bomb, codenamed Trinity.

""There's a possibility that when you push that button, you might destroy the entire world,"" Nolan told the BBC.
""And yet they went ahead and they pushed it. How could you make that decision? How could you take that on yourself?""

Another existential threat to civilization is AI, which is also part of the Hollywood strike and makes the Oppenheimer movie more timely.
""One of the interesting things about putting this film out is it's coming at a time when there are a lot of new technologies that people start to worry about the unintended consequences,"" he said.
""When you talk to leaders in the field of AI, as I do from time to time, they see this moment right now as their Oppenheimer moment. They're looking to his story to say, 'what are our responsibilities? How can we deal with the potential unintended consequences?' Sadly, for them, there are no easy answers.""
Nolan is one of a rare number of Hollywood directors. His films - Interstellar, the Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception amongst them - are both blockbusters and arthouse fare; critically acclaimed and, Tenet aside, which was released during the pandemic, box office successes.
""I make the films that I really want to go to the cinema and sit down with my popcorn and watch"" he says. ""I started making films when I was a kid. I made Super 8 films from when I was seven or eight years old and I've never stopped"".

He's a champion of the big screen who, famously, left Warner Bros for rival Universal to make Oppenheimer.
Nolan's known for wanting his films to feel authentic rather than computer-generated.
There was even a rumour doing the rounds on the internet that he had set off a real atomic bomb in New Mexico for Oppenheimer.
""We recreated the circumstances of it,"" he said, ""obviously not using an atomic weapon. What we're trying to portray is this moment of absolute beauty and absolute terror.

The director appeared alongside wife Emma Thomas at Monday's event, where its stars — including Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett and more — were notably absent.
Nolan, 52, wore a dark-gray suit and silver tie with black shoes, while film producer Thomas, 51, rocked a black midi-length dress with matching peep-toe pumps.
Oppenheimer's N.Y.C. premiere came four days after its U.K. premiere in London on Thursday, where its stars walked the red carpet but left soon after to support the then-impending strike.

Speaking to an audience from onstage at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London Thursday, Nolan said, ""We have to acknowledge, you've seen them here earlier on the red carpet. Unfortunately, they're off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by SAG.""
""Joining one of my guilds, the Writer's Guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of their union, and we support them,"" the director added, as seen in video shared by Deadline.
Soon after, leadership for SAG-AFTRA (aka the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) announced that the union would go on strike Friday, with union president Fran Drescher and national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland writing in a memo that members were ordered “to cease rendering all services and performing all work covered by the TV/Theatrical Contracts” once the strike began.
Ahead of Nolan's comments, Blunt, 40, told Deadline she hopes ""everyone makes a fair deal and we're here to just celebrate this movie.""
But she was prepared for what ended up being the case, adding, ""If they call [a strike], we’ll be leaving together as a cast in unity with everyone. … We're gonna have to. We're gonna have to. So we'll see what happens. But right now, it’s the joy to be together.""

Damon, 52, told the same outlet that despite some of the difficulties a strike would pose professionally, including for his newly launched independent studio with longtime friend Ben Affleck, a fair deal was the priority.
""It's brutal for our sister unions,"" he added. ""And it's gonna be tough for 160,000 actors. Nobody wants a work stoppage.""
""But if our leadership is saying that the deal isn’t fair, then we gotta hold strong until we get a deal that’s fair for working actors,"" Damon said. ""It’s the difference between having healthcare and not for a lot of actors, and we gotta do what’s right by them.""
""I stand by my colleagues — that's all I can say to you, really,"" Murphy, 47, told Irish outlet RTÉ.

“I have to to acknowledge the work of our incredible cast, led by Cillian Murphy,” Nolan said from the stage. “The list is enormous — Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek and so many more. … You’ve seen them here earlier on the red carpet. Unfortunately, they are off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by SAG, joining one of my guilds, the Writers Guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of their union.”
Watch the video below of Nolan’s comments, which he gave at both London screening venues today that showed the film simultaneously.
The Oppenheimer actors came into the Odeon Luxe theater and filed into a reception. One by one they came through the lobby. Deadline saw Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt leave before Nolan came onstage. All of the cast members Deadline spoke with declared their support for the strike action.
Deadline understands the cast members who exited went out for dinner in the West End. Later, Nolan and his creative team left for dinner with some Universal executives; some of the cast ate separately due to SAG-AFTRA regulations about accepting studio hospitality while on strike.
Speaking to Deadline on the red carpet earlier, Emily Blunt said that she and the other cast members would leave the event if the guild’s leadership officially approved a walkout. “I think right now we are just sort of — I hope everyone makes a fair deal and we are here to celebrate this movie. And if they call [a strike], we’ll be leaving together as cast in unity with everyone. … We are gonna have to. We are gonna have to. We will see what happens. Right now it’s the joy to be together.”

2023-07-24 02:07:18+00:00,Christopher Nolan Forgot To Credit Over 80% Of VFX Crew On ‘Oppenheimer’,VFX workers get screwed by Hollywood yet again.,"During the publicity junket for Oppenheimer, director Christopher Nolan repeatedly pointed out how his latest film doesn’t contain any cgi shots, leading many to believe that there were no digital vfx in the film. That interpretation of his statement is inaccurate.
While Oppenheimer may not contain cgi – or computer-generated imagery that is rendered in the computer – it absolutely does contain digital vfx. A lot of it may be ‘invisible vfx,’ a style of vfx often used in period films and adult dramas where the goal is to enhance the authenticity of the setting but not call attention to the fx work as superhero and action films tend to do. With invisible vfx, if the crew does their job well, then audiences won’t even realize that vfx are being used.
We don’t know how Nolan employed digital vfx on Oppenheimer, and won’t know until (and if) the effects breakdowns are released, but we do know for a fact that vfx were used on the film. We also know that the vfx studio on the film was DNEG, marking the eighth time they’ve collaborated on a film with Nolan.
UPDATE: DNEG has provided further information to Cartoon Brew to explain how compositing was the primary use of vfx in the film:
[Production vfx supervisor] Andrew Jackson spent several months of the project in Scott Fisher’s workshop, working with him and his SFX crew to develop the various simulations and effects. The process involved shooting an extensive library of elements. They shot these explosions at high speed, slowed them down then brought layers of footage together in post-production. The final shots ranged from using the raw elements as shot, through to complex composites of multiple filmed elements. Almost all the VFX shots in the movie were recreated using only real elements combined together. Chris Nolan was determined to keep the VFX grounded in reality and maintain the raw feeling of the actual footage.
Additionally, we now know that Nolan and Universal decided to not credit the majority of the film’s vfx crew. The film credits list 26 vfx crew, in addition to vfx supervisor Andrew Jackson. Ten of these roles are supervisors while fifteen are workers and support roles. This is a particularly high ratio of supervisors to workers, and it doesn’t make sense unless those in the management roles were overseeing a larger group of artists.
And there you have it, Oppenheimer has a VFX crew of 27 people from @dneg (including the overall VFX Sup). It looks like it’s only compositing and no CG. Congratulations to the team. The film looks amazing. Won’t spoil or review it now. I will wait a bit longer to do that. pic.twitter.com/FSsE8MCbvJ — Hugo Guerra (@HugoCGuerra) July 21, 2023
Indeed, it has now been revealed that a much larger group of people worked on the film than were actually credited. DNEG’s own website has a scrolling list of vfx crew who worked on Oppenheimer and it totals over 160 people. Meanwhile, people online have even created a spreadsheet to try and properly identify the roles of all the film’s vfx workers.

Thus, Universal and Christopher Nolan excluded over 80% of the film’s vfx crew from the credits. Why? Who knows. It certainly wasn’t a running time issue. At three hours in length, an additional 10 seconds of credits wouldn’t have made a bit of difference to the audience. But it would have meant the world to the workers who could have had a screen credit on a blockbuster film. (It’s telling that many of the workers who were left out of the credits worked at one of DNEG’s facilities in India.)
Not crediting the vfx crew is actually fairly common practice in Hollywood, and because vfx artists aren’t unionized, there is no recourse for the worker and no penalty for the studio when credits are omitted or misrepresented.
In a day and age when literally everyone connected to a film production gets a credit, from craft services to on-set teachers of child actors to random “production babies” who didn’t even work on a film, it is utterly incomprehensible that vfx artists, whose work makes possible the final images that appear onscreen, are routinely omitted from screen credits.
Oppenheimer is yet another example of how live-action filmmakers like Nolan denigrate and misrepresent the work of vfx workers to the media, and then add insult to injury by not even acknowledging them in the credits. The fact that over 125 people who contributed to Oppenheimer’s success aren’t listed in the credits is a reminder of how the vfx industry is a corrupt and broken enterprise that undermines and disrespects its workers at every juncture.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXJ0b29uYnJldy5jb20vaWRlYXMtY29tbWVudGFyeS9jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1mb3Jnb3QtdG8tY3JlZGl0LW1vcmUtdGhhbi04MC1vZi12ZngtYXJ0aXN0cy1vbi1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci0yMzA3NzUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-01 00:46:10+00:00,How Accurate is Christopher Nolan’s ‘Oppenheimer’?,A nuclear engineer reviews the blockbuster film.,"The critics rave—and I don’t disagree—that the box-office blockbuster Oppenheimer is the greatest film, or at least biopic, since Lawrence of Arabia. The cinematography is grand, the acting is fine, the pace is excellent, and the story has real importance. If, considered as a meal, most movies today are a bag of skittles, Oppenheimer is a thick juicy corn-fed Iowa steak. So, if all you need to know from a film’s review is whether you should go see it, the answer, in Oppenheimer’s case, is unquestionably yes.
But is Oppenheimer accurate? That’s the question that Claire Lehmann asked me to answer for the readers of Quillette.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vcXVpbGxldHRlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4LzAxL2hvdy1hY2N1cmF0ZS1pcy1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbnMtb3BwZW5oZWltZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"An extended interview with Christopher Nolan, director of Oppenheimer","The director of the film ""Oppenheimer"" tells of how he came to choose the ""father of the atomic bomb"" as the subject of a movie, and describes how he went about translating the physicist’s sprawling life—as laid out in the 700-plus-page, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, ""American Prometheus""—into a single film.","In the middle of May, I drove to Universal Studios Hollywood and proceeded, per instruction, to Jurassic Parking (yes, that really is the name of the parking garage). I then walked down the Citywalk “street” to the Universal Cinema AMC theaters, where I watched a five-minute montage edited from the soon-to-debut Christopher Nolan film Oppenheimer.
The film clip was brisk and intriguing but not particularly revealing as to plot, so you don’t have to worry about reading further into this piece; I have no spoilers to offer (though I can say Matt Damon plays a mean Gen. Leslie Groves). After the screening, I drove to a leafy and placid part of Hollywood and what appeared to be a converted residence that serves as a cutting studio, where I spoke with Nolan about how he came to choose J. Robert Oppenheimer, the enigmatic director of the Los Alamos laboratory that birthed the atomic bomb, as the subject of a mass-market film.
For those not up on their recent Hollywood history, Nolan has directed a series of major films over the last several decades—among them Tenet, Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception and three Batman-related films known as The Dark Knight trilogy—that have featured complex narrative approaches and achieved remarkable success, commercial and critical. (Nolan’s films are said to have earned more than $5 billion in the global box office and won 11 Oscars, among 36 total Academy Awards nominations).[1]
Even taking the wide range of his previous work and predilection for innovative storytelling into account, Oppenheimer seems an ambitious choice of subject. The story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called father of the atomic bomb, certainly doesn’t lack for historical sweep. Oppenheimer was a key figure in the revolution in physics that started in December 1938, when physicists Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch [2] found that something previously thought impossible was actually happening: a uranium nucleus had split in two. Subsequent theorizing and experimentation led scientists to confirm that a chain reaction of such atomic “fissions” was possible. And that such a chain reaction could lead to a massive release in energy, dwarfing what conventional explosives produce.
The race to build an American atomic bomb before Nazi Germany could acquire one is, in its own right, a complicated and existential drama of the highest order. Many of the top physicists at Los Alamos had earlier fled the Third Reich; they knew Werner Heisenberg and other scientists in the emerging field of quantum mechanics had stayed in Germany and worked on a Nazi bomb (though how faithfully later came into question). Beyond the gargantuan task of building a secret laboratory in an isolated part of New Mexico, attracting top scientists to it, and managing their quirky and sometimes conflicting personalities, the Oppenheimer saga includes a variety of complex personal, psychological, and political strands. A polymath seemingly as interested in psychotherapy, poetry, Eastern religion, the arts, and horseback rides across the New Mexican outback as in physics, Oppenheimer was both a commanding figure—a hero of sorts to many at Los Alamos—and a sensitive, ambiguous soul of some fragility.[3]
After education at Harvard, Cambridge, and the University of Göttingen in Germany during the 1920s, Oppenheimer grew to become a major figure in US and world science as he built a physics program at the University of California, Berkeley, along with a joint appointment at the prestigious California Institute of Technology, or Caltech. His contributions to theoretical physics were important across several of its subfields, from quantum field theory to the phenomena that came to be called black holes. In California in the 1930s, Oppenheimer also developed an interest in left political causes. His membership in progressive circles that contained members of US communist and socialist groups was not particularly unusual in the context of a great depression then ravaging the US working class and the rise of fascism in Europe. Many American intellectuals on the political left felt some connection with the Soviet Union, especially as regards its support of the Republican government in the Spanish Civil War, against the fascist Nationalists of Gen. Francisco Franco.
Oppenheimer always maintained that he had never belonged to the Communist Party or taken direction from it, and the public record contains little documentary evidence to the contrary. Still, because of his interactions with a variety of people who were members of the party and allied groups, Oppenheimer became a focus of FBI surveillance and wiretapping well before he was appointed director of the Los Alamos lab.
After the war, Oppenheimer and other scientists involved in creating the first atomic bombs feared that political leaders did not fully appreciate the danger they posed. In hopes of avoiding a global nuclear arms race, some of those scientists, including Oppenheimer,[4] advocated placing nuclear technology under international control (an effort that failed, at least in the short term). A group of Manhattan Project scientists and engineers also focused on wider public education on nuclear weapons and energy (and science generally) through the creation of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists; Oppenheimer served as the first chair of the magazine’s Board of Sponsors.[5]
As the atomic bomb’s so-called father, the porkpie-hatted, cigarette-smoking Oppenheimer became a scientific celebrity in the post-World War II years, serving as director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and appearing on the covers and in the pages of major magazines. But in 1953, a former congressional aide alleged to the FBI that Oppenheimer was a Soviet spy, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered that a “blank wall be placed between Dr. Oppenheimer and secret data.”[6] Oppenheimer challenged the suspension of his security clearance, but after 19 days of highly publicized hearings, a panel of the Atomic Energy Commission’s Personnel Security Board ultimately refused to reinstate the clearance, effectively ending Oppenheimer’s government service.[7]
It was a decision that haunted Oppenheimer until his death in 1967, and one that was not rescinded until December 2022, when Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm vacated the order that stripped Oppenheimer of his security clearance “through a flawed process that violated the Commission’s own regulations. As time has passed, more evidence has come to light of the bias and unfairness of the process that Dr. Oppenheimer was subjected to while the evidence of his loyalty and love of country have only been further affirmed.”[8] Decades after the fact, records of the Oppenheimer security hearing made it clear that, rather than any disloyalty to the nation, it was his principled opposition to development of the hydrogen bomb—a nuclear fusion-based weapon of immensely greater power than the fission weapons used to decimate Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945—that was key to the decision to essentially bar him from government service.
So the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer is rich, nuanced, dramatic, politically fraught, existentially important, morally challenging—and therefore a narrative that stands out against the general run of animated superhero sequels and other Hollywood franchise fare as starkly (to my way of thinking) as Raymond Chandler’s tarantula on an angel food cake. In the following interview, I asked Nolan how he came to choose Oppenheimer as the subject of a movie and how he went about boiling down the physicist’s sprawling life—as laid out in Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s 700-plus-page, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, American Prometheus—into a manageable film script.[9] His answers constitute a cinematic origin story of sorts, and one that seemed, to me, both important and interesting during the interview and, on subsequent review, even more worthy of thoughtful attention, as Russia’s sporadic threats of nuclear weapons use in Ukraine continue.
John Mecklin: I work in a field where the material is naturally off-putting; nuclear weapons are not something that people want to talk about. So, the first thing I am interested in is: How did you come to choose Oppenheimer as a movie? It’s not Batman or something.
Christopher Nolan: No, it’s something that’s been on my radar for a number of years. I was a teenager in the ‘80s, the early ‘80s in England. It was the peak of CND, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the Greenham Common [protest]; the threat of nuclear war was when I was 12, 13, 14—it was the biggest fear we all had. I think I first encountered Oppenheimer in that relation; I think he was referred to in Sting’s song about the Russians that came out then and talks about Oppenheimer’s “deadly toys.” He was part of the pop culture then, without us knowing a lot about him.
And at some point, in the intervening decades, I got ahold of the information, the fact that the scientists at Los Alamos at a point had determined there was a small statistical possibility that the Trinity test would ignite the atmosphere and destroy all life on Earth. They couldn’t mathematically, theoretically, completely eliminate that possibility; they went ahead anyway. And that struck me as the most dramatic situation in the history of the world, with any sort of possibility being an end to life on Earth. That’s a responsibility that nobody else in the history of the world had ever faced.
I put a reference to that in my last film, Tenet; there’s dialogue, a reference to that exact situation by Oppenheimer. That film deals with a science-fiction extrapolation of that notion: Can you put the toothpaste back in the tube? The danger of knowledge, once knowledge is unveiled—once it’s known, once it’s fact—you can’t wind the clock back and put that away.
So having dealt with that, in a science-fiction sense, at the end of that film, I was sort of left with that as a hanging question. And actually, Robert Pattinson, who’s in Tenet, as a wrap gift, he gave me a book of Oppenheimer speeches, post-World War II speeches. And reading those and reading about the great minds of that time, in the early ‘50s, trying to wrestle with and create some kind of intellectual framework by which to understand and deal with a new existential threat, the first ever truly existential threat to life on Earth—it’s a frightening time to read about, when it’s so new. Then over the decades, we’ve managed to dress it up in all kinds of policy statements, philosophical discussions, you know, all the rest. So, we’ve got generations of people giving intellectual context to the idea of Armageddon, which disguises it and makes it all feel a bit more acceptable as part of the life that we’ve grown up with under the shadow of the bomb. And other than the Bulletin and the Doomsday Clock, [that’s all we have] to remind people of the terrible situation we’re in.
My goal when making the film—I don’t make films to send a message, I made it because it’s a fascinating story. But part of that storytelling is getting back to basics about the bomb, stripping away policy statements, philosophy, the geopolitical situation and just looking at raw power that’s about to be unleashed and what that means for the people involved and means for all of us.
Mecklin: So that was obviously a long runway, a long period of interest. When you sit down to write your screenplay, as I understand, basically based on the American Prometheus book—I mean, that book is 700 pages, and it covers a lot of ground. Just talk a little bit about what the process of getting to a movie is.
Nolan: The process was an interesting one because of everything that makes American Prometheus firstly such a brilliant record of Oppenheimer’s life and interpretation of Oppenheimer’s life. But everything that makes it seem daunting as adaptation is what I found wonderful to adapt, because dealing with real life, with history, and in trying to then make an entertainment from it, an expressive dramatic piece—your biggest hindrance as a screenwriter is authority, is knowledge. I’m not a scientist; I have no way to become a scientist in the period of time it would take me to write the script. You look to experts and expert knowledge.
So, in the past, I’ve collaborated with [Caltech physicist and Nobel laureate] Kip Thorne, for example, on Interstellar and on Tenet. With American Prometheus, Kai Bird and Marty Sherwin (and Marty Sherwin in particular spent 25 years researching the book)—there is an enormous amount of authoritative information, every rock’s been lifted, no stone left unturned. And so, you’re then dealing with an enormous amount of knowledge that, thankfully, has an index at the back. So, once you’ve read it, you can say, “Hang on, what was that bit about [Edward] Teller?” [and] you can look at all the references. And so it was this incredible wealth of knowledge to be able to then start writing a much more subjective script from. I took the view of wanting to tell the story from Oppenheimer’s point of view. That’s what I got from Kai and Martin’s book; I got a feeling of what it is to be this guy, what’s going on in his head. And I felt like that’s the movie.
Mecklin: He’s a tough someone to pin down. I mean, he is ambiguous, shifting, whatever. Did you find that fun to try to put into a movie, or…
Nolan: Yeah, if you look at the films that I’ve made, I’ve always been drawn to ambiguous storytellers, possibly unreliable narrators, people who have interesting layers—those are the characters, right? You know, back to Bruce Wayne, Batman, all the rest, I was interested in characters who in some sense are imprisoned by paradox, who are at the mercy of paradox. And so, for me, it was a very natural fit. And the fact that his story is real, verifiable documentary record, history, really frees you up to just take the audience on the journey. But [for] my interpretation—and ultimately Cillian Murphy’s interpretation of what’s going on in his head, his interior state, which we’re trying to represent—we’ve got a lot of information about where he went, how he got there, what he did.
I’ve always actually favored the medieval, Middle English approach to characterization to the more modern, psychological, novelistic approach to characterization in film, because in film, character defined through action has always been the strongest, because it’s visual, and it’s narrative-based; it’s for me the strongest, most interesting form of building character and characterization. And so, in approaching Oppenheimer, my feeling was by researching, looking at what he said and what he did—where they’re the same, where they’re different—you start to get a sense of the contradictory impulses, and how he dealt with these impossible situations that he was put into.
Mecklin: It’s certainly an open field. In the book, everybody has a slightly different view of who Oppenheimer is. Was he a communist, wasn’t he, all of that. So, I’ll be fascinated to see how he’s handled.
Nolan: He is the ultimate Rorschach test. I believe you see in the Oppenheimer story all that is great and all that is terrible about America’s uniquely modern power in the world. It’s a very, very American story. And there are no simple answers to the questions that it raises, and anyone claiming simple answers to Oppenheimer’s story, let alone to the film itself, is definitely ignoring certain aspects.
Mecklin: These are subjects that deal with physics; physicists are notably persnickety about facts and details. Did you have science advisors along the way, looking at what you’ve done or at the script?
Nolan: I did. We had a very helpful chap from UCLA, David Saltzberg, who was helping us with certain scientific aspects on set. We also brought Kip Thorne into the fold because we’d worked with Kip on a couple of movies. Kip attended Princeton, among other institutions, and while at Princeton went to seminars at the [Institute for Advanced Studies] under Oppenheimer and actually met him; he actually watched him teach. And so I was able to put Kip on the phone with Cillian—and then he visited the set—to talk about what it was like to watch Oppenheimer manage a group of minds in a seminar, how he would organize a debate, how he would apparently listen to all these different points of view and summarize them very, very efficiently and eloquently, and move the dialogue forward.
Kip was also able to answer some of my questions about, for example, there’s a moment where [physicist and subsequently Nobel laureate] Luis Alvarez, [physicist and Nobel laureate] Ernest Lawrence, and Oppenheimer, reading about the splitting of the atom in Germany, apparently then immediately went off and proved on the board that it couldn’t be done. So, of course, we then have to portray it as, “Okay, what does he write on the board?” So, Kip was able to go into it and say, “Okay, this is what we think he may have written. And this is what’s wrong with it; this is where the mistake is, if you like.”
Mecklin: Wow, that’s fascinating. You would think, trying to introduce a general audience to fission, fusion, quantum mechanics, trying to get that into a movie narrative—it must have been some trick.
Nolan: Well, luckily, I’ve had a bit of practice, because my last couple of films have gone in pretty hard on some of the aspects of the science, of the physics, where they create dramatic opportunity. And the thing about fission and fusion, the thing about the revolutionary nature of quantum physics in the 1920s, that’s very dramatic, when you’re dealing with a person’s life. You’re dealing with people who were engaged in a revolutionary reappraisal of the laws of the universe, just as Picasso and other artists were engaged in a revolutionary reappraisal of aesthetic art, of visual representation, just as Stravinsky, you know, was there writing all his music, and indeed, Marx, the communists—that is to say, moving on from Marx, the communist 1920s, the Russian Revolution. I mean, you’re literally rewriting all aspects of the rules whereby we live, physics being the most radical of any of those. So the difference between classical physics and quantum physics is extraordinarily dramatic, even if you can’t understand it.
I can’t explain to the audience—I could barely understand myself—what those differences really constitute, where Einstein’s theory of relativity really takes us. But everybody knows who Einstein is, everybody knows the theory of relativity as a thing that happened, that changed the world. And it lets me position Oppenheimer at the most exciting time in physics, when, literally, the laws of the universe are reappraised and looked at in a completely different way. It’s a paradigm shift that’s, I think, really very unprecedented.
It’s kind of an amazing time. And then, of course, as you start to research and look at the drama of his story and where it then went, where this revolutionary fervor actually wound up—that’s when so many revolutions wound up in a pretty awful place. So trying to give the audience the terms and the grounding, just enough to know that yes, we can’t explain to the audience how quantum physics is different, just that it is radically different.
The difference between fission and fusion becomes very important in terms of the atom bomb versus the hydrogen bomb, how that plays into the politics, the situation where Oppenheimer is, where Teller is. That’s a very relatable human dynamic between the guys interested in fission and the guys interested in fusion and the conflict between them. So I was able, in the screenplay and then the finished film, to build on the sort of pop culture understanding of some of these concepts, because people know the A-bomb, and they know the H-bomb. Do they know the difference between them? No, not really, but that we can explain in the film. So there are lots of ways in which we’re able to dramatize the scientific concepts.
But there are a lot of ways in which—this is what my brother and I found working with Kip on Interstellar—a lot of ways in which the science itself is so dramatic, the theory itself is what’s presenting the possibility of the end of the world, the possibility of enormous destruction, really fearful destruction. These are the most dramatic stakes imaginable. So following the science leads you to some very, very extreme dramatic situations. And as a filmmaker, that’s really what you’re after.
Mecklin: It’s a real departure from the day-to-day ignoring of the ultimate meaning of nuclear weapons. They really could end the Earth, and most people don’t really have a concept of nuclear weapons, or the difference in their sizes. How important was it to you in portraying the Trinity test, or whatever nuclear explosions are going to be portrayed in your movie, and how did you come to the decision about “We’re going to do it [the Trinity test] this way.”
Nolan: The first person we showed the script to after Emma Thomas [my producing partner] was Andrew Jackson, who has been my visual effects supervisor in the last couple movies. Because what I wanted to say to him right out of the gate was, “In this film, we’re going to try and portray the inner state of the character, we’re going to try and show atomic activity, we’re trying to show the quantum world to a degree, which is something that’s unshowable and might obviously lend itself to fancy computer graphics. I don’t want to use any computer graphics for that. We’ve got to show the Trinity test, we’ve got to show the destruction of that; I don’t want to use any computer graphics for that.”
In one of my previous films we portrayed an atomic explosion using CG, and whilst I thought the team did a very good job, and technically the result was good, it confirms to me something that I’ve always felt about computer graphics, which is they tend to feel inherently, in the subconscious of the audience, that they’re animations; they’re not something that’s been photographed in the real world. And so there isn’t really a feeling of danger. And in The Dark Knight Rises, where we have the nuclear explosion, it’s not meant to feel particularly dangerous at the time, because the danger is past, it’s happening out to sea, it’s far enough away.
The point of the Trinity test being there for that birth of atomic weaponry, you want to be terrified. You want it to be beautiful but also frightening, and things that are photographed for real, they’re going to inherently have more weight to them, they’re going to have that threat. Computer graphics tends to feel a bit safer. It’s one thing if the whole film was fanciful. But if the whole film was grounded and real and recognizable as the world we live in, you want this most important event of the film to be equally valid, to have the weight of reality to it. So Andrew thought long and hard about ways in which to photograph real things, both microscopic and macroscopic; he collaborated with our special effects coordinator. Visual effects are the things you do in post-production: optical effects, computer graphics, all those kinds of things that you do after the fact. And special effects are what you do on the floor with the actors, in the moment. Scott Fisher does our special effects, has done for years. He worked very closely with Andrew on some small-scale things to photograph that could be proxies for bigger events and could use the scale of things but also some massive explosions on set that the actors were tied in with; they were there. By using different frame rates and forced perspectives and different combinations of chemicals—magnesium flares in combination with black powder explosions and petrol—to create a variety of explosive effects that could stand in for the Trinity test. Rather than detonating a real atomic bomb, which would be a little extreme (laughs).
Mecklin: Extremely extreme. But it sounds like fun.
Nolan: It was a lot of fun. And they took a very long time to do it. But where their methods became very interesting to me was in the attempts to visualize the quantum world. Because what we were looking for, and what I think we managed to achieve, was a combination of shooting very large things and shooting very tiny things. There is a confusion of scale in the imagery. Are we looking at distant stars and planets or are we looking at atoms and molecules? You don’t quite know; the scales are confused. And to me, one of the most fascinating things about quantum mechanics and everything that’s come from it is this shift between the absolute tiniest things that we know of and the largest that we know of, and both being clearly defined by, determined by, the same set of rules. It’s what’s in the middle that gets a bit complicated, and the interactions between quantum physics and that world in the middle that we all live in, the human-scale world, are some of the most destructive things imaginable. The micro and the macro, the sort of two ends of the scale, I think, are really fascinating.
Mecklin: Do you have any thoughts or expectations about what the response to your movie might be? I know that everybody wants it to be a great success, and you think it’s obviously good. But it really is a touchy subject. Right?
Nolan: I have shown the film to a lot of people by this point; it is a Rorschach test that prompts a variety of responses. There are people who come out of the film literally speechless. They can’t talk; they’re upset in some way. They’ve enjoyed the film, but they don’t understand why they’ve enjoyed it. It’s a very conflicted set of feelings that the film gives you. And that was the goal, that peculiar mixture of emotions, and from the responses so far, we seem to have achieved that. How that fits into the culture, I have no real way of knowing until after it happens. We give it to the audience, and it becomes theirs. What I do know is that, in the history of movies, there are many times in which a complicated emotional response or subject matter can be very powerful for people, can be very entertaining.
Entertaining is a sort of reductive word, we tend to think of that as happy, funny things, whatever, but it’s not. It’s about engagement. It’s about: Does the film resonate with people, do they think about it afterward, do they tell other people to go see it, and that kind of thing? And movies embrace all sorts of different types of engagement. So yes, this is a complicated form of engagement that we’re after. And we’re looking for an extremity of response, an emotional response that’s not necessarily clear-cut. But the film does seem to resonate with people. It does seem to mean something to people. And I think, as a filmmaker, that’s all you can hope for. What that translates to in the culture, we’ll see.
Mecklin: The other current-day question I have is: Obviously, you started this movie well before the invasion of Ukraine. But that invasion has happened since then, and Vladimir Putin and various people in his government have threatened to use nuclear weapons. I’d just like to hear you talk about what you think about your movie being birthed into that current reality.
Nolan: Well, you don’t have any way of knowing the circumstances of the world in which your film will be released, because you started years before. And when I first started writing Oppenheimer, I remember clearly a conversation I had with one of my teenage sons where I told him what I was working on. And he literally said to me, “Well, nobody really worries about nuclear weapons anymore. Are people going to be interested in that?” And, of course, my response to that at the time was, “We should be, and maybe the film would help with that.” But, of course, what then in awful, actual fact has happened is the world has once again been reminded of the threat. Which is, you know, it’s a terrible circumstance. It’s a terrible circumstance. But certainly, our intention with the film—whatever world it was coming out into—absolutely part of the intention of the film is to reiterate the unique and extraordinary danger of nuclear weapons. That’s something we should all be thinking about all the time and care about very, very deeply. But obviously, it’s extraordinarily troubling that the geopolitical situation would have deteriorated once again to the extent that it’s being talked about in the news.
Mecklin: Well, I appreciate you taking all this time to talk to me. So, I think I will turn to a final question: Did anything about making the movie change your mind, change how you think about nuclear weapons? Did it make you more, or less, or the same concerned about this world situation?
Nolan: It’s a hard question to answer. I think the honest answer is that, the deeper into the research I got, and the more that we all talked and thought about it, there’s a phase in which the more you know about nuclear weapons, you start to see them as more ordinary armaments. Because you’re comparing, for example, atomic munitions with hydrogen weapons, so you’re starting to engage in the slippery slope of looking at the scale of things, and how many people were killed by this particular device, you’re starting to get used to the analysis of these things.
Mecklin: You’re normalizing the killing of tens of thousands of people.
Nolan: You’re normalizing killing tens of thousands of people. You’re creating moral equivalences, false equivalences with other types of conflict, et cetera, et cetera. So, you’re going down a lot of different roads toward a more accepting, normalizing of the danger. But then that ultimately leads you around to: That’s the real danger. And that’s when, you know, even Oppenheimer himself, when you start talking to the Army about let’s bring battle back to the battlefield and start talking about tactical nukes—that’s the conversation that I now am most afraid of, because I hear that from both sides of the political spectrum, not just from Putin. I feel we’re in a world now where people are starting to once again talk about those things as some kind of acceptable possibility for our world. And, of course, if we want to think about how nuclear Armageddon ultimately is probably going to happen, is it going to be some Dr. Strangelove-type scenario with bombers getting the wrong signal? I think it’s far more likely to be the normalizing of atomic weapons at the beginning, the use of tactical nukes leading to larger- and larger-scale conflict that will ultimately destroy the planet. So yeah, I came away with a different understanding, a different set of fears that ultimately are founded on the same ultimate fear, which is that the world is going to be destroyed by these things.

On the surface, the release of ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Barbie"" on the same weekend seems to be because of an overcrowded summer movie season, resulting in a playful box-office battle that the internet has dubbed ""Barbenheimer.""
The reality, though, is a little more complicated and may have something to do with the recent skirmish between the ""Oppenheimer"" director, Christopher Nolan, and Warner Bros., the studio releasing ""Barbie.""
For most of his career, Nolan released his movies through Warner Bros. Starting with 2002's ""Insomnia,"" the studio released some of his most beloved titles like ""Inception,"" ""Dunkirk,"" and his ""Dark Knight"" trilogy.
But that changed soon after the studio released his 2020 film, ""Tenet,"" exclusively in theaters during the height of the pandemic. When the studio's parent company, WarnerMedia, made the shocking decision in late 2020 to release its 2021 slate exclusively on its streaming service, HBO Max, Nolan lambasted the move.

""Some of our industry's biggest filmmakers and most important movie stars went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the worst streaming service,"" Nolan said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter in December 2020.
Then, in September 2021, Deadline reported that Nolan would be making his next movie about the atomic-bomb creator, J. Robert Oppenheimer, at Universal.
As theatrical-release dates began to fill the 2023 calendar, ""Oppenheimer"" was scheduled for July 21 — not a surprise, given that mid-July has been Nolan's preferred-release week for his films since 2008's ""The Dark Knight (save for ""Interstellar,"" which opened in November; ""Tenet"" would have also opened in mid-July if it weren't for the pandemic).
But a new title also showed up on that date: the ""Barbie"" movie Warner Bros has been developing for years.

Was this a coincidence, or was this Warner Bros. enacting some form of payback on Nolan? Would Warner Bros. be so petty that it would purposely attempt to undercut the auteur that used to be a star in its stable?
I had to ask Nolan himself.

Sources said Nolan was upset that ""Barbie"" was scheduled for release on the same weekend as ""Oppenheimer""
""Have you seen 'Barbie' yet?"" I asked Nolan at a press event for ""Oppenheimer.""
""No,"" he said. It was a curt response with a hint of disinterest.

I told him my theory that ""Barbenheimer"" was born through his complex history with Warner Bros.
""Now, you must know I'm not going to answer that question,"" he said with a chuckle, ""only to say those who care about the theatrical experience, we've been longing for a crowded marketplace with a lot of different movies. That's what theaters have now, and those of us who care about movies are thrilled about that.""
Margot Robbie in ""Barbie."" Warner Bros. Pictures
Four sources familiar with the matter said Nolan wasn't nearly as diplomatic in his stance behind the scenes. The sources — who didn't authorize Insider to use their names as they didn't have the authority to speak on the matter publicly — told Insider that Nolan was upset that Warner Bros. scheduled ""Barbie"" for release on the same weekend as ""Oppenheimer,"" especially since mid-July has been known in the movie business as ""Nolan's weekend"" for years.
There was even an attempt by the movie-theater community, in which Nolan is beloved, to convince Warner Bros. to move the release date of ""Barbie."" But two of the sources said the studio wouldn't budge. Insider contacted Warner Bros. for comment on this story but did not receive a response.

The showdown between ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Barbie"" is rare because studios typically want to keep their big releases away from other major titles because opening on the same weekend can result in fewer box-office dollars for both.
But clearly, Warner Bros. feels ""Barbie"" is up for the challenge. The studio has blitzed the public with promotion for months: First came the on-set shots of Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken dressed in matching roller-blading outfits. Then came the instantly memed character posters, stories about ""pink days"" on set, and news of the film contributing to an international shortage of pink paint.
Meanwhile, Universal has stayed surprisingly quiet about ""Oppenheimer."" Outside of revealing a countdown clock and ominous trailers featuring the film's star, Cillian Murphy, there hasn't been much information about the movie — and most people are shocked when I tell them Florence Pugh is in it.
Awareness is set to increase soon — Universal held a press junket for ""Oppenheimer"" in New York City this past weekend — but is it too late? Early box-office forecasts said that ""Barbie"" would earn about $80 million in its first three days and that ""Oppenheimer"" would take in only $40 million.

Now here's the crazy part: Warner Bros. wants Nolan back!
Despite all this, don't be surprised if Nolan returns to Warner Bros.
""Oppenheimer."" Universal
In June, Variety reported that the new heads of Warner Bros., Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy, want Nolan to return. The magazine reported that they sent the director a seven-figure royalty check for ""Tenet"" in an attempt to extend an olive branch.
On top of all that, I've been told by a source that Nolan and Emma Thomas, his wife who is also his producing partner, still have an office on the studio lot.
After all this, could Nolan really go back to Warner Bros.? Some sources tell me a decision to return would be less about ""Barbenheimer"" and more about the respect Nolan and Thomas have for De Luca and Abdy.

But the Universal head Donna Langley isn't going to give up Nolan without a fight, either. Insider contacted Universal for comment on this story but did not receive a response.
As many moviegoers happily plan a ""Barbenheimer"" double feature (I suggest seeing the intense, three-hour ""Oppenheimer"" first, and then finishing with the fun ""Barbie""), Nolan will have to begin soul-searching to decide his best path forward.
And if recent history has taught us anything, we shouldn't be shocked by decisions made in Hollywood. If Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel can work together again, don't be surprised if Nolan and Warner Bros. patch things up, too.

2023-07-22 14:32:02+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Barbie’ Breaks Ground With Biggest Opening Day of 2023, ‘Oppenheimer’ Dolling Up to $77 Million Debut","Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" and Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" are both impressing in their box office openings.","Greta Gerwig’s hot pink fantasia “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s intricately bleak historical drama “Oppenheimer” are both putting up box office openings to remember. In a summer movie season that has largely failed to keep spirits up, two bona fide blockbusters are showing that everyone can be a winner.
But the more winning winner between the two — the number one movie in North America — is Warner Bros. Discovery’s “Barbie.” After scoring $22.2 million on Thursday, the highest preview ticket sales of the year, the big screen bonanza about Mattel’s marquee doll kept the superlatives going on Friday, adding another $48.2 million from 4,243 theaters. That’s a $70.5 million total — the biggest opening day of the year, blasting past the $51.8 million earned by “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” in June.
The pink wave may not stop there, as “Barbie” now looks to score the biggest three-day debut of 2023. In the crosshairs is another branding flex — “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” which landed $146.3 million in three days in April (as a caveat, the film opened with Tuesday previews and also played through the Easter holiday, drawing $224 million through that stretch). That animated feature currently stands as the highest-grossing release of the year, with $573 million domestically and $1.34 billion worldwide.
Gerwig’s “Barbie” also has a shot at scoring the biggest opening weekend ever for a feature with a female director. “Captain Marvel,” co-helmed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, earned $153 million in its 2019 opening. The record for a feature solely directed by a woman is currently held by Patty Jenkins’ “Wonder Woman” at $103 million, which “Barbie” will easily surpass.
All of this is to say, “Barbie” has gone boom. The film was a gambit by Mattel to enter the filmmaking space, costing $145 million to produce, not to mention more spending for a ubiquitous marketing campaign that went down to bus stop benches being painted pink and a Dreamhouse in Malibu. Reviews are glowing with a 90% approval rating from top critics on aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes and audiences are also ecstatic, as indicated by the enthusiastic “A” Cinema Score grade determined by surveying the first round of moviegoers. This weekend is proving to be an eruption, but the summer is far from over for “Barbie.”
Starring Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, the comedy follows the iconic doll as she travels from the fantastical Barbieland to the real world — which has some problems! The deep bench of ensemble talent includes Issa Rae, America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, Simu Liu, Helen Mirren, Will Ferrell and many more.
The penultimate weekend of July had become Christopher Nolan territory over the past few years, as the renowned filmmaker opened two of his last four features (“The Dark Knight Rises,” “Dunkirk”) in that slot. (“Tenet” was also originally slated for it, but faced release delays due to the COVID pandemic.) Months after Nolan exited Warner Bros. and voiced blistering frustrations about the then-current leadership’s lack of commitment to exclusive theatrical releases, Warner Bros. followed up — arguably retaliated — by dating “Barbie” for the same weekend as Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” which the director had brought to Universal.
What once seemed like a contentious collision course now seems to have proven nothing but fruitful. “Barbie” may be winning the weekend, but “Oppenheimer” is still impressing. Playing in 3,610 locations, the sweeping biopic earned $33 million on its opening day, which includes $10.5 million in Thursday previews.
“Oppenheimer” is now looking to rank among the biggest opening weekends ever for an R-rated release. At the top of that list are a swath of franchise films, like “Deadpool” and its sequel, “It” and its sequel, plus the “Batman” spinoff “Joker” (which has already shot its own sequel). The film is currently projecting $77 million through Sunday, which would put it behind only “The Passion of the Christ” ($83 million) among the highest openings ever for a non-IP R-rated film — and the titular role of “Passion” has a bit more of a built-in fanbase than J. Robert Oppenheimer, to say the least.
The Nolan feature is also strongly benefitting from its showtimes in Imax auditoriums and other premium formats, which come with increased ticket prices. The filmmaker has a longstanding relationship with Imax, shooting large fractions of his features with the company’s heavy-duty cameras. (Also of note, the performance of “Barbie” is all the more impressive because it isn’t playing Imax auditoriums.) “Oppenheimer” is shaping up to be the third-biggest opening of Nolan’s career, behind “The Dark Knight” and “The Dark Knight Rises.”
On top of that, Nolan features tend to stick around in theaters. “Interstellar” and “Dunkirk” nearly quadrupled their opening weekend numbers in their final domestic earnings. Even “Tenet” legged out to $58.5 million after its wide release debut of $9 million — in a time before a widely distributed COVID vaccine no less. “Oppenheimer” has drawn some of the strongest reviews of Nolan’s career (a 96% approval rating from top critics on Rotten Tomatoes), but — even more encouraging — audiences seem to have truly taken to the despairing three-hour epic, as inferred by the sterling “A” grade through Cinema Score. With strong buzz and already some good fortunes for awards season, “Oppenheimer” has the right stuff to keep drawing audiences in.
The film follows the life of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy, who was tapped by the U.S. military to spearhead the construction of the first atomic bomb. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Casey Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Benny Safdie, Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek and many others also star.
Paramount’s “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” had Imax screens snagged away by “Oppenheimer” after only eight and a half days of showtimes. Without premium ticket prices in play, the Tom Cruise sequel is facing a sizable tumble of about 62% in its second weekend, projecting a $21 million haul. That’d be much steeper than the 54% drop that “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” took in its sophomore outing.
That isn’t exactly what Paramount wants to see for a “Mission: Impossible” entry, which typically show formidable endurance at the box office. The previous two installments, “Fallout” and “Rogue Nation,” fell only 42% and 48% in their sophomore outings, respectively. Even as “Dead Reckoning” continues the critical hot streak for the series, that buzz isn’t translating to a very strong hold. Adding to the pain, this was by far the most expensive franchise entry yet, ballooning to a $300 million production price tag due to costly COVID-related delays and safety measures.
Domestic total should reach $120 million by Sunday, but “Mission: Impossible” has always been a stronger performer overseas. The series often finds more than two-thirds of its total gross in international markets. “Dead Reckoning” looks to maintain that pattern to keep afloat in the coming weeks.
“Mission: Impossible” might lose third place to Angel Studios’ “Sound of Freedom,” which continues to impress in its third weekend of release. Rivals are estimating a $20.1 million haul for the human-trafficking thriller, which would mark a slim 26% tumble — this after sales actually went up a staggering 38% last weekend. The film has proven controversial — Rolling Stone deemed “Sound of Freedom” a “QAnon-tinged thriller” that targets “the conscience of a conspiracy-addled boomer” — but it has certainly proven to have a target audience. Total domestic gross stands at $124 million, with no real signs of slowing down.
Religious and conservative media groups have rallied behind “Sound of Freedom.” Angel Studios has also instituted an unconventional “Pay It Forward” system, allowing people to donate money to the distribution banner so that the studio can purchase tickets for its own movie and distribute them for free. The company touts the initiative as a tool to raise awareness of its subject matter.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” looks to take fifth place, adding $1.9 million on Friday. The Harrison Ford finale didn’t exactly light up the box office since its disappointing debut in June, but it hasn’t fallen like a stone since then. In its fourth weekend of release, the adventure film will push close to a $160 million domestic gross through Sunday.
Lionsgate is also opening its horror film “Cobweb” in 310 theaters this weekend. Rivals are projecting a $450,000 weekend gross for the genre spin.
Additionally, Searchlight Pictures is expanding “Theater Camp” into 51 locations after debuting in six New York and Los Angeles venues last weekend. The ensemble comedy added $113,000 on Friday, up only 2% from its more limited opening.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItb3BlbmluZy1kYXktcHJvamVjdGlvbnMtMTIzNTY3NjY4MS_SAW5odHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL2JveC1vZmZpY2UtYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLW9wZW5pbmctZGF5LXByb2plY3Rpb25zLTEyMzU2NzY2ODEvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The script behind Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer” has jumped to the top of bestseller lists on Amazon following the film’s smashing blockbuster release last month.
Oppenheimer $17.95 $16.16 Buy Now On Amazon
The film, based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book “American Prometheus,” tells the definitive story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the father of the atomic bomb. The film, starring Cillian Murphy as the eponymous scientist, pulls straight from the 700-page biography, which traces Oppenheimer’s life starting with his time at Cambridge, where he earned a reputation as an intellectual prodigy. As a physicist, Oppenheimer made significant contributions to quantum mechanics and theoretical physics, earning him great respect among his peers.
The narrative takes a dramatic turn with the onset of World War II, when Oppenheimer was appointed as the scientific director of the Manhattan Project, a top-secret government initiative aimed at developing the first atomic bomb. His leadership and organizational skills were instrumental to the project, which culminated with the devastating nuclear weapons dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing over 200,000 Japanese people.
In his introduction to the screenplay, Bird praises Nolan’s skill in extremely complex life story and miraculously turning it into “visual art that is faithful both to the history and the man.”
When Bird read Nolan’s screenplay, he was “struck by how faithful it was to the book, capturing what was always most important to Sherwin: the paradoxes at the heart of Oppenheimer’s character and the intimate details that dovetailed with enormous plate shifts of world history.”

2023-07-18 20:00:56+00:00,Why 'Oppenheimer' director Christopher Nolan doesn't use a smartphone,"Nolan revealed that his ""kids would probably say I'm a complete Luddite"" because of how tech-averse he is in his working life.","Director Christopher Nolan is well known for avoiding computer generated effects in his films when possible, preferring instead to capture all the action in-camera. But Nolan's penchant for doing things the old-fashioned way goes beyond what moviegoers see on screen.
In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter this week, Nolan revealed that his ""kids would probably say I'm a complete Luddite"" because of how tech-averse he is in his working life.
The ""Tenet"" director, who in 2020 told People that he uses a flip phone over a smartphone, said that he chooses to not get too ""involved"" with technology so as to maintain focus.
""It's about the level of distraction,"" Nolan said. ""If I'm generating my material and writing my own scripts, being on a smartphone all day wouldn't be very useful for me.""
Back in 2020, he described himself as ""easily distractible.""
""I don't really want to have access to the internet every time when I'm bored,"" he said at the time. ""I do a lot of my best thinking in those kind of in-between moments that people now fill with online activity, so it benefits me.""
But his old-school ways don't stop there. The computer that the 52-year-old writes his scripts on isn't connected to the internet, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
Nolan also prefers to hand deliver his scripts to actors rather than sending them digitally. While he said this has given him a reputation for working ""in secrecy,"" Nolan said the truth is anything but.
""It's not secrecy, it's privacy,"" he said. ""It's being able to try things, to make mistakes, to be as adventurous as possible. And to be able to sit with somebody who's just read what you've written and get their take on it, see how they connect with it in a very human, face-to-face way.""
Dating back to his 2000 breakout hit ""Memento,"" Nolan has written every one of his films save for 2002's ""Insomnia."" His latest movie, the hotly anticipated ""Oppenheimer,"" will hit theaters on July 21.

2023-07-27 08:29:48.826000+00:00,Christopher Nolan Has Earned Filmgoers’ Trust Like No Other Director,"Ever since the runaway success of “The Dark Knight,” the director has proven to audiences that there’s fun to be had in watching something cerebral—especially on a big scale.","Over the next few weeks, we’re going to hear a lot about what “Barbenheimer” really means for the film industry. One movie massively exceeding expectations is, these days, a major event. But two over a single weekend? Barbie and Oppenheimer—the yin-and-yang hits of this summer movie season, radically different spectacles united through the unexpected good luck of concurrent release—will surely inspire a lot of reactive thinking on the part of studios hoping to replicate the phenomenon of their joint success. If Hollywood learns any lessons from Barbenheimer, however, it’ll probably be the wrong ones.
One of the simplest takeaways of this past weekend is more of a forceful reminder of something that should be conventional wisdom, even gospel for executives by now: Christopher Nolan, the writer, director, producer, and reigning blockbuster visionary of our age, can turn just about anything into a hit. Oppenheimer, much more so than Barbie, is the traditional definition of a tough sell. It’s a three-hour drama about quantum physics and McCarthyism, a summer movie set in laboratories and courtrooms; it’s a true gabfest blown up to IMAX proportions. Movies like this don’t make big money, especially not in 2023. Except, apparently, when they have Nolan’s name on them.
Oppenheimer, which opened to a staggering $80 million domestically last weekend, doesn’t simply count as another smash in a career full of them. It also feels like a culmination of Nolan’s whole deal: his heartening, unfashionable tendency to respect the intelligence of his audience. Cinephiles may debate how truly ""deep"" his blockbusters are, but there’s no denying that almost all of them are conceptually audacious, applying complicated structural gimmicks to their narratives and traipsing into matters of theoretical science. Nolan trusts viewers to keep up with the pretzel logic of his movies. Remarkably, those viewers have rewarded his trust over and over again, by coming out in droves to each new picture, undeterred—maybe even exhilarated—by the very real possibility that it will require some intellectual labor.
Tracing the arc of Nolan’s career backwards, Memento-style, takes you to the origins of his reputation for crafting uncommonly brainy blockbusters: 2008’s The Dark Knight, still the biggest hit he’s ever helmed. The success of that magisterial superhero movie, the middle chapter of his seminal Batman trilogy, wrote a blank check that he’s been cashing ever since. The movie was such a sensation—not just a record-breaking box-office juggernaut, but one of those rare films that seems to dominate the entire pop-cultural attention span for months on end—that it all but guaranteed its maker some runway, the ability to chase his muse out of the franchise trenches.
More than simply buying him that leeway, The Dark Knight also made Nolan one of the few Hollywood filmmakers that can be called a household name. He used the plum gig to assert his interests and personality—to tell the world, through the big stage of a big event picture, that this is what you could expect from a Christopher Nolan movie. His later films would push further into his particular obsessions, but the funneling of big ideas through IMAX-scaled entertainment begins with The Dark Knight. It’s a comic-book movie about chaos and order, cause and effect, and whether ends justify means—a Batman movie that sells the vision of its filmmaker as much as it sells Batman.
Arriving between this historic success and the less rapturously received closing chapter of the Dark Knight saga, Inception was the true test of Nolan’s stature—and the movie that solidified his standing as a reliable purveyor of big-idea blockbusters, the thinking man’s Hollywood hitmaker. ""From the writer-director of The Dark Knight"" may have put asses in seats, but his follow-up’s runaway popularity dispelled any concerns that Nolan was a flash in the pan, that his powers might weaken beyond Gotham City limits. Without the safety net of beloved intellectual property, the director thrust audiences into a heist movie of M.C. Escher complexity: a brain-bending sci-fi action picture that layered its dream reality like nesting dolls, daring audiences to keep track of multiple planes of dilemma unfolding at different speeds.
The convoluted nature of Inception’s plotting would inspire lots of jokes at its expense (Dan Harmon had a field day), but it wouldn’t hurt the movie. Quite to the contrary, that byzantine structure made it a must-see in summer 2010, amassing fans with each sold-out screening. What became clear quickly was that viewers weren’t putting up with the bewildering-but-plainly thought-out zig zag of Nolan’s storytelling as a tradeoff for the more conventional pleasures, the zero-gravity fights and city-folding special-effects shots. They were actually feeding on the brain candy Nolan provided, getting hooked on the way he sent their minds racing to keep up with the implications of the premise.
Inception, with its twisty temporal mechanics and teasingly ambiguous ending, made Nolan into his own brand, nearly as bankable as that of the masked superhero he sent into action once more afterwards. His name became a promise of a certain kind of rare theatrical experience: a big-budget contraption that would buzz the brain as surely as it quickened the pulse. In the years after, Nolan would continue to issue comprehension challenges to his audiences, and those audiences would continue to rise to them every time. He didn’t need a blank check anymore; each new hit paid for the next one.
2014’s Interstellar is a gushy, all-the-feels space odyssey built on a foundation of hard science fiction. The film tells a tender father-daughter story through the lens of time’s cruel relativity and with a lot of dense jargon. Dunkirk, released in 2017, is a war film of rare immediacy, reducing WWII to a series of ticking-clock, life-and-death scenarios by air, land, and sea. It also happens to take the Matryoshka games of Inception even further, crosscutting the timeline into three distinct stories—one set over roughly a week, another set over a day, and the last set over a single hour, all converging at the exact same point in time and space. And 2020’s Tenet might be the most proudly, stubbornly confounding exercise in espionage action ever inflicted upon moviegoers: The film’s Rubik’s Cube inscrutability begins with its very conceit—the inversion of cause and effect on which the increasingly befuddling time-travel hijinks all rest.
Again, whether Nolan’s movies are as smart as his biggest fans insist they are is a matter of opinion, and irrelevant besides. They are undeniably cerebral in basic shape, especially for movies of their budget. More importantly, they don’t hold the viewer’s hand or over-explain themselves; they count on us to work out their loopy structural games, and to keep pace with the way they fold into themselves. That just about all of them have been big hits—Tenet, the exception, has the excuse of opening in the throes of the pandemic, an unwise decision for multiple reasons—is proof that Nolan has turned the promise of a mental workout into a selling point. At this point, people go to his films with the expectation, maybe even the hope, that they’ll have to work out what they’re seeing. His movies make you feel smart for keeping up.
Oppenheimer might be the ultimate consummation of that special relationship between director and fanbase. It’s a new benchmark in Nolan’s ongoing project to treat the multiplex masses like adults, intellectually capable and curious. Beyond its inherently heady subject matter, Oppenheimer is another structural wonder, applying a sophisticated nonlinear framework to historical events. This time, Nolan takes his cues from actual scientific theory, coding the separate timelines in color and black-and-white, but also with the words “fission” and “fusion”—a choice with all kinds of fascinating interpretative potential. Oppenheimer wants us to grasp the race for the atomic bomb in scientific, historical, political, and moral terms all at once. That big opening weekend suggests that plenty are at least game to try and follow his train of thought.
And that’s worth celebrating in an era when the American box office is mostly dominated by movies that treat all audiences like children. Pick a year, any year in recent memory, and its biggest hits will almost invariably be aimed at all ages; our theaters are now the almost-exclusive dominion of superheroes, cartoon mascots, and other figures of juvenilia. In fact, for all the money they’ve made so far, Barbie and Oppenheimer have a long road ahead of them if they hope to surpass the year’s true box-office winner, The Super Mario Bros. Movie—the epitome of how the studios have child-proofed their dream factory.
Love or hate his movies, Nolan is an anomaly in the field, a thinker who looks out into the dark of the proverbial auditorium and sees a mirror of his own intellectual hunger. For all the grimness of the future Oppenheimer finds in the aftermath of its subject’s achievement, it counts as a hopeful vision in another respect. Once more, Nolan has shown that he believes in a market for grownup entertainment. And once more, the American moviegoing public has justified that faith.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL29ic2Vzc2VkL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLWhhcy1lYXJuZWQtZmlsbWdvZXJzLXRvdGFsLXRydXN00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-21 14:20:53+00:00,Christopher Nolan Says Some ‘Oppenheimer’ Viewers Walk Out ‘Devastated’ and ‘They Can’t Speak’: ‘It’s Kind of a Horror Movie’,"Christopher Nolan says some viewers are not able to speak after watching ""Oppenheimer.""","Christopher Nolan has a warning for anyone purchasing “Oppenheimer” tickets: The film might emotionally destroy you. Speaking to Wired magazine in a new interview, Nolan said that some early “Oppenheimer” viewers have had a visceral reaction to the film, which follows theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) as he creates the atomic bomb to end World War II.
“Some people leave the movie absolutely devastated,” Nolan said about early screenings. “They can’t speak. I mean, there’s an element of fear that’s there in the history and there in the underpinnings. But the love of the characters, the love of the relationships, is as strong as I’ve ever done.”
Nolan later added, “It is an intense experience, because it’s an intense story. I showed it to a filmmaker recently who said it’s kind of a horror movie. I don’t disagree.”
“Oppenheimer’s story is all impossible questions,” Nolan added. “Impossible ethical dilemmas, paradox. There are no easy answers in his story. There are just difficult questions, and that’s what makes the story so compelling. I think we were able to find a lot of things to be optimistic about in the film, genuinely, but there’s this sort of overriding bigger question that hangs over it. It felt essential that there be questions at the end that you leave rattling in people’s brains, and prompting discussion.”
One outspoken fan of “Oppenheimer” ahead of the film’s July theatrical release is historian Kai Bird, who co-wrote the 2005 biography “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” with Martin J. Sherwin. Nolan adapted the book into “Oppenheimer.”
“I am, at the moment, stunned and emotionally recovering from having seen it,” Bird said during a recent conversation. “I think it is going to be a stunning artistic achievement, and I have hopes it will actually stimulate a national, even global conversation about the issues that Oppenheimer was desperate to speak out about — about how to live in the atomic age, how to live with the bomb and about McCarthyism — what it means to be a patriot, and what is the role for a scientist in a society drenched with technology and science, to speak out about public issues.”
Starring opposite Murphy in the drama are Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh and more. The film is Nolan’s first R-rated release since 2002’s “Insomnia.”

2023-07-30 13:00:00+00:00,Those Controversial Oppenheimer Sex Scenes Are a Departure for Christopher Nolan,Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh's prolonged sex scene in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is one of the film's most memorable moments. Here's what to know.,"Spoilers follow.
Christopher Nolan's historical biopic Oppenheimer has finally been released, prompting all kinds of conversations about humanity's capacity for destruction. But viewers are also keenly discussing the film's sex scenes—the first that Nolan has ever included in one of his movies.
Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh, who play J. Robert Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, appear in three nude scenes together throughout the movie. In the first, the pair have sex after flirting at a party. During this encounter, Tatlock pauses the intercourse to browse Oppenheimer's bookshelf, remark on how many languages he speaks, and pull down a copy of the Hindu holy text the Bhagavad-Gita. The scene culminates in Oppenheimer reciting the famous line ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"" while having sex with Tatlock, a moment which has been deemed offensive by some Hindu viewers.
The second nude scene is stark by comparison; the two characters sit naked as Oppenheimer breaks off his affair with Tatlock, who later dies by suicide.
However, Pugh's character makes a surreal reappearance towards the end of the film, in a sequence where Oppenheimer and his wife Katherine (Emily Blunt) are being questioned by senators in a security hearing, and his private life is splayed out—quite literally—for all to see, with the film showing Oppenheimer and Tatlock having sex in the room.
Universal
""One of the things that was so striking about the real-life situation in which Oppenheimer found himself in these security hearings is they were conducted in a very shabby small space with a very peculiar intimacy,"" explained director Christopher Nolan. ""He was being interrogated about the most intimate details about his entire life and the witnesses who would testify, he was sitting three feet behind them the entire time... His wife was sitting right behind him as these most intimate details of his life were being unfolded and he was being split open for all to see.""
""I really wanted to push as hard in the direction of showing how uncomfortable that must have been and how strange that must have been for everyone involved,"" he continued. |""The dialogue in that moment is from the transcripts. I didn't write it. It really is what was said there. It's a really shocking piece of history and I wanted to really bring that to life for people.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNoZWFsdGguY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYTQ0NjE4OTYzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWNpbGxpYW4tbXVycGh5LWZsb3JlbmNlLXB1Z2gtc2V4LXNjZW5lLWV4cGxhaW5lZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

You likely know J. Robert Oppenheimer best as the father of the atomic bomb.
After seeing ""Oppenheimer,"" you will also know him as a ladies' man.
Christopher Nolan's latest movie recounts Oppenheimer's work in the Manhattan Project, but it also reveals that the renowned physicist had several affairs while he was married, including one with a Communist, which got him into hot water.
Because of this side of Oppenheimer's life, Nolan featured something he's never done before in his filmography: sex scenes.

""When you look at Oppenheimer's life and you look at his story, that aspect of his life, the aspect of his sexuality, his way with women, the charm that he exuded, it's an essential part of his story,"" Nolan told Insider about the choice of including sex scenes.
One woman in particular holds an important part in the ""Oppenheimer"" story.
Jean Tatlock, played by Florence Pugh, is someone Oppenheimer is completely infatuated with leading up to the Manhattan Project.
Their steamy love affair continues after Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy, marries Kitty, played by Emily Blunt.

But Tatlock is also a Communist. Due to her political affiliations, Nolan said his affair with her ""had enormous ramifications for his later life and his ultimate fate.""
Essentially, a decade after Oppenheimer successfully tested the atomic bomb, his security clearance was revoked following a 1954 security hearing in which he was accused of having Communist ties.
Nolan said he wanted the sex scenes between Oppenheimer and Tatlock to show why the relationship transcended politics.
""It felt very important to understand their relationship and to really see inside it and understand what made it tick without being coy or allusive about it, but to try to be intimate, to try and be in there with him and fully understand the relationship that was so important to him,"" he said.

Nolan also answered whether he's nervous about how audiences will react to seeing sex scenes in one of his movies.
""Any time you're challenging yourself to work in areas you haven't worked in before, you should be appropriately nervous and appropriately careful and planned and prepared,"" he said.

Nolan gave all the praise to his actors: Murphy, who he has worked with on several movies, and Pugh, who he's wanted to work with.
""I met with her and immediately felt a creative connection,"" he said of the acclaimed ""Little Women"" actor. ""I felt this is somebody who could bring Jean Tatlock to life and have the audience understand the significance of this figure in Oppenheimer's life.""

""Oppenheimer"" opens in theaters on Friday.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXIuY29tL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLXNleC1zY2VuZXMtZXhwbGFuYXRpb24tZXNzZW50aWFsLTIwMjMtN9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXIuY29tL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLXNleC1zY2VuZXMtZXhwbGFuYXRpb24tZXNzZW50aWFsLTIwMjMtNz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Only 19 US theaters have IMAX 70mm screens to show 'Oppenheimer' as Christopher Nolan intended,"While 'Oppenheimer' has been digitized to work for all screens, director Christopher Nolan said it is best viewed in specific IMAX theaters.","While more than 20,000 people have already bought tickets for Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer,"" only 19 theaters in the U.S. have the capacity to show the movie as the director intended.
In an interview with The Associated Press, Nolan explained that the ""best possible experience"" of the movie is in IMAX 70mm theaters, as both the aspect ratio and the sound will be ideal.
So what difference does the size of the screen make for the viewing experience? Here's what to know about the IMAX 70mm experience.
More:Christopher Nolan made 'Oppenheimer' because he thought he'd die in a nuclear Armageddon
What's the importance of 70mm screens?
""Oppenheimer"" was shot using some of the highest-resolution film cameras that exist. The film was shot entirely on large format film stock, meaning a combination of IMAX 65mm and Panavision 65mm
""The sharpness and the clarity and the depth of the image is unparalleled,"" Nolan said in an interview with the AP. ""The headline, for me, is by shooting on IMAX 70mm film, you’re really letting the screen disappear. You're getting a feeling of 3D without the glasses. You’ve got a huge screen and you’re filling the peripheral vision of the audience. You're immersing them in the world of the film.""
While it's impossible to shoot all of the movie in IMAX (as the cameras are too loud for scenes with dialogue), sequences that used the IMAX cameras will expand to fill the entire screen in 70mm theaters.
How else can you watch 'Oppenheimer'?
If you aren't near one of the few theaters with IMAX 70mm screens, you'll still be able to enjoy the film, Nolan said.
In any IMAX theater, including IMAX digital, the sequences shot with IMAX cameras will still expand to fill the entire screen, allowing viewers to experience the full effects.
Viewing on other ""premium large format"" (or PLF) screens 70mm, 35mm and Dolby Cinema will be impressive for audiences.
Nolan said his team has worked for six months to digitize the original film for other formats to ensure the best experience on every screen.
Where are the best seats in movie theaters?
While seats are a personal preference, Nolan said he likes to sit in different places for different kinds of screens.
""When I'm in a theater that’s Cinemascope ratio, I like to be right near the front, middle of the third row,"" he said. ""When I’m in a stadium, IMAX 1.43:1, then I actually like to be a little behind the center line right up at the middle. So, a little further back.""
What is IMAX?
IMAX by definition refers to the firm that manufactures high-resolution lenses, film codecs, projectors, and movie theater equipment.
However, the term is often used to describe the movie format and the viewing experience specific to IMAX cameras and theaters, according to the Nashville Film Institute.
IMAX theaters have a screen the entire width of the movie theater and loudspeakers behind the screen. IMAX cameras produce high-quality images, using 70mm film.
Additionally, IMAX theaters have a large circular dome and a flat screen, giving viewers a more life-like experience and the same view of the screen from any seat.
IMAX film resolution is almost 10 times more than a 35mm projector and each frame has some 18,000 pixels of resolution versus a home HD screen that has 1,920 pixels.

2023-07-08 06:00:07+00:00,"Cillian Murphy on Oppenheimer, sex scenes and self-doubt: ‘I’m stubborn and lacking in confidence – a terrible combination’","If Peaky Blinders made the Irish actor a household name, will Christopher Nolan’s nuclear blockbuster send him into the stratosphere? He talks about extreme weight loss, hating school and why his next character won’t be a smoker","Cillian Murphy is struggling with what he can and can’t say about his title role in Oppenheimer, the latest Christopher Nolan epic, such is the secrecy surrounding this film. Murphy is under “strict instructions” not to talk about the content. Which is awkward when you’ve flown to his home in Ireland to interview him specifically about playing the physicist who oversaw the creation of the atomic bomb, later detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It’s not clear who issued these instructions. Nolan? The studio? The US government? All I know is that as well as Murphy being gagged by hefty NDAs, I am not allowed to see it (“bit unfortunate”, he concedes).
So, yes, here we sit in an empty upstairs room of a restaurant near his house in Monkstown, Dublin, working out how to do this. The room is dark, the sun shining through a solitary Velux lighting his features like a Géricault. The only background noise is the low hum of a wine refrigerator. Murphy loathes interviews, looks visibly tortured at points. But he relaxes when I ask if he’s pleased with Oppenheimer. “I am, yeah,” he says. “I don’t like watching myself – it’s like, ‘Oh, fucking hell’ – but it’s an extraordinary piece of work. Very provocative and powerful. It feels sometimes like a biopic, sometimes like a thriller, sometimes like a horror. It’s going to knock people out,” he adds. “What [Nolan] does with film, it fucks you up a little bit.”
Nolan wouldn’t disagree. The director recently told Wired magazine that some of those who’d seen it were left “absolutely devastated … they can’t speak”. Which sounds like a bad thing, but is related perhaps to the thought of the 214,000 Japanese people, overwhelmingly civilians, who lost their lives when the bombs were dropped. Kai Bird, the historian who co-authored American Prometheus, the 2008 biography of J Robert Oppenheimer upon which the film is based, said he was still “emotionally recovering” from seeing the film, clarifying that it was “a stunning artistic achievement”.

Murphy’s portrayal is said to be astonishing (“Oscar-worthy” is the buzz). This is not unbelievable. While Hollywood might not know him as a leading man, this quietly intense actor has long been celebrated in the UK and Ireland, most notably for his nine-year stint as Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders. When he first appeared on our screens, looking like a renaissance painting of Saint Sebastian – chiselled head contrasting with translucent blue eyes – it was impossible not to be distracted. He appeared first on stage in Enda Walsh’s Disco Pigs, then the screen adaptation. Then 28 Days Later; Intermission; Ken Loach’s The Wind That Shakes the Barley. Previous collaborations with Nolan include the Dark Knight trilogy, Inception and Dunkirk, “significant milestones in my career,” he says, adding that Nolan “might be the perfect director”.
It was Nolan’s wife, the producer Emma Thomas, who called Murphy one afternoon at the home he shares with his wife, artist Yvonne McGuinness, and two teenage sons. Nolan doesn’t actually have a telephone, or an email, or computer for that matter: “He’s the most analogue individual you could possibly encounter.” So, Emma said Chris would like a word and passed the receiver, then the director came on the line. “Cillian, I’d love you to play the lead in this new thing,” he said. Murphy tries to recreate his response to this news. “I was lost for words. But thrilled. Like beyond thrilled.” It is characteristic of Murphy that the modulation of his voice barely changes as he expresses this. He was so stunned, he had to sit down. “Your mind explodes.”
In the absence of the three-hour feature, I scrutinise Oppenheimer’s three-minute trailer. It’s a rush of snapshots against the crackling of a Geiger counter. There’s Murphy, short back and sides, lifting 1940s eye goggles; blue and red atoms coming at him fast; orange light; white light; blackout; silence. Massive explosion against the backdrop of space. Overlaid is Murphy’s narration, “We’re in a race against the Nazis / and I know what it means / if the Nazis have a bomb.” There’s Matt Damon looking porky as army general Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project: “They have a 12-month head start.” Murphy, pointing with cigarette: “18.”
He has put back on some of the weight he lost for the part, I’m relieved to see; his skin isn’t quite so taut over his skull and there are freckles over those eagle-wing cheekbones. He was determined to nail the scientist’s silhouette “with the porkpie hat and the pipe”, testing himself to see how little he could eat. “You become competitive with yourself a little bit which is not healthy. I don’t advise it.” He won’t say how many kilograms he lost, or what food the nutritionist told him to cut out. NDA? “Ach, no. I don’t want it to be, ‘Cillian lost x weight for the part’.”

Then again, the hurtling speed at which Nolan worked, crisscrossing the US, made it easy to skip meals. Murphy began to forget about food in the same way he began to forget about sleep. “It’s like you’re on this fucking train that’s just bombing. It’s bang, bang, bang, bang. You sleep for a few hours, get up, bang it again. I was running on crazy energy; I went over a threshold to where I was not worrying about food or anything. I was so in it, a state of hyper …” he gropes for the word, “hyper something. But it was good because the character was like that. He never ate.” Oppenheimer subsisted on little more than Chesterfield cigarettes and double-strength martinis, rims dipped in lime. “Cigarettes and pipes. He would alternate between the two. That’s what did for him in the end,” Murphy adds, a nod to the scientist’s death from cancer in 1967. “I’ve smoked so many fake cigarettes for Peaky and this. My next character will not be a smoker. They can’t be good for you. Even herbal cigarettes have health warnings now.”
I raise method acting and Murphy tilts his head and frowns. “Method acting is a sort of … No,” he says, firm but with a half smile. Oppenheimer had many defining characteristics, not least walking on the balls of his feet and a vocal tic that sounded like nim-nim-nim, but Murphy didn’t want to do an impression. Nolan was obsessed with the Brillo-texture hair, so they spent “a long time working on hair”. And the voice. The real question for Murphy was what combination – ambition, madness, delusion, deep hatred of the Nazi regime? – allowed this theoretical physicist to agree to an experiment he knew could obliterate humankind. “He was dancing between the raindrops morally. He was complex, contradictory, polymathic; incredibly attractive intellectually and charismatic, but,” he decides, “ultimately unknowable.

“Listen, it’s not like a spoiler,” he says, checking himself before he leans in, “but there are incidents in his early life that were quite worrying; very erratic.” They are in the film and the book, he steers. I suspect he is referring to Oppenheimer’s postgrad at Cambridge in 1926, when he placed a poisoned apple on the desk of a tutor towards whom he harboured complicated feelings of inadequacy and jealousy. Arguably, this was attempted murder. But Oppenheimer’s rich New York parents rushed in to bundle him into psychoanalysis. He was diagnosed with “dementia praecox”, a term describing symptoms associated with schizophrenia.
Murphy likes these complex characters; they’re his meat. People that don’t necessarily follow the – yawn – traditional transformative arc of storytelling. Not villains, exactly (although he’s played a few, including Scarecrow in Dark Knight and Jackson Rippner in Red Eye): “Villains are good if they’re well written, but if it’s one note or a trope, then they are dull.” He likes a script to stretch leisurely into all corners of the human condition, “all the shades”. At the same time, you have to understand his exceptional ability to portray interiority, physically manifesting intense human emotion without a word, radiating fierce, consuming energy. Which he does today, actually, when I stray off track.
Although Nolan is usually, shall we say, antiseptic in his approach to romance, Oppenheimer represents a significant shift. He told Wired the love story aspect “is as strong as I’ve ever done”. It features prolonged nudity for Murphy and Florence Pugh, who plays Oppenheimer’s ex-fiancee, as well as sex, and there are complicated scenes with Emily Blunt, who plays his wife, “that were pretty heavy”. Murphy turns coy: “I’m under strict instructions not to give away anything.”
‘Sometimes you get a chemistry’: with Emily Blunt in A Quiet Place II. Photograph: Album/Alamy
He asks if I’ve heard of chemistry tests. “They put two actors in a room to see if there’s any spark, and have all the producers and director at a table watching. I don’t know what metric they use, and it seems so outrageously silly, but sometimes you get a chemistry and nobody knows why.” This is a roundabout way of saying his scenes with Blunt and Pugh conjure this magic. His established bond with Blunt (they co-starred in A Quiet Place II) meant “the audience gets something for free”, he says. “You can be immediately vulnerable and open, and try stuff. There were moments where I remember saying, ‘I couldn’t have done that if it wasn’t with you.’”
Murphy, 47, grew up the eldest of four in Cork. His father was a civil servant, his mother a French teacher. They were a middle-class family, musical; his father “can pick up any instrument”, his brother played piano, and they regularly got stuck into “traditional Irish sessions”. Bookshelves were stuffed with literature, the radio often on, the “shitty” TV set not so much. Home life was busy but his parents taught him French and Irish, and sent him to an all-boys academic, rugby-playing private school. “I got all the education” he says, drily.
The story of how much he disliked the Presentation Brothers College, the hard-drinking masculine emphasis, how he found solace playing guitar in a band, is much rehearsed and he says today he doesn’t want “to slag the school off. I hear it’s great now.” Something about this experience seems nonetheless unsettling. He had one friend, who is still his best friend, “so I wasn’t, like, an outcast”. He played rugby for the first couple of years, but abandoned it “because everyone was all of a sudden towering over me.” Was it an unhappy time? He shifts. “It was OK. I was a bit of a messer, like I’d get in trouble and say nothing. It wasn’t the ideal school for me.”
I don’t enjoy the personality side of being an actor. I don’t understand why it’s expected I’ll be scintillating on a talkshow
He enrolled in and dropped out of a law degree at University College Cork, which created some friction with his parents (when I ask if his own sons will go to university in Dublin, he says, “Whatever they want”). He continued with the band, his first creative love but the one that got away. When they were offered a contract with Acid Jazz records, he turned it down for a number of reasons, he says, crucially that he didn’t feel good enough. He still writes and plays at home but, no, you won’t be hearing any of his recordings, ever, he says.
It’s a funny thing talking to Murphy. He’s at once garrulous (on the craft, or literature, or ideas) and reticent (pretty much anything else). I sense in previous interviews that he skates over issues close to his heart – such as the expression of emotion in Ireland and the need to teach empathy in schools. But when I try to drill in to these topics, get to the root, he clams shut, emitting energy like a nuclear reactor.

Later, in a different context, he will tell me a truth: “I’m stubborn and lacking in confidence, which is a terrible combination. I don’t want to put anything out that I don’t think is excellent.” But he clearly hates the pantomime of publicity, asking why I am returning to certain topics and repeating lines I’ve read elsewhere. I can almost see him at home with its views towards the Irish Sea, complaining to his wife as they tuck into supper: “Another one, asking the same fucking questions.”
If he could get out of going to Cannes, of standing on red carpets, dressed as is his habit for a funeral, hair shellacked, hands in pockets; if he could turn his back on the coloured-foam mics thrust in his face, he would. He really would. No, it dawns on him now, there’s something even worse than the red carpet; there’s the talkshow rounds. The very word “talkshow” comes out of him like a pain from his ribcage, as if the parcelling out of amuse-bouche anecdotes, offering them up to the forced laughter of that false god of show business, the studio audience, is in itself the most cheapening experience known to mankind.
“I do them because you’re contractually obliged to. I just endure them. I’ve always found it difficult. I’ve said this so many, many times.” Then there’s the double wince of realising that, yes, he’s done it again. He’s laid into the industry that feeds him. His hands raise slowly in surrender. “I want to just caveat this by saying, I’m so privileged. I’m so happy to be doing what I love. I’m really lucky. But I don’t enjoy the personality side of being an actor. I don’t understand why I should be entertaining and scintillating on a talkshow. I don’t know why all of a sudden that’s expected of me. Why?”
There’s an awkward silence. I say that he reminds me of Naomi Osaka, the tennis player who refused to talk to journalists after the French Open in 2021. He says he feels “100%” sympathy with her, “because why should she have to perform?” Then he relents. “But I get it. I get it’s a kind of ecosystem where the film feeds the publicity which feeds the talkshows which goes back and feeds the film, so, like, that’s how it works. I suppose I’m just not good at it. At interviews, at this stuff,” he gestures at me. He says after he leaves me today he’ll be going down the stairs thinking of all the things he’s said and worrying it’s come across all wrong. “Do you know what Sam Beckett said? ‘I have no views to inter.’ I love that. That should be the interview.”

We return to his art, the tension falls away and he’s back to his charming self, charged air evaporating. Since Oppenheimer, he’s also wrapped Small Things Like These, an adaptation of Claire Keegan’s brilliant novella set in 1985 in a small Irish town on the edge of which is a convent and “laundry”. Murphy is a huge fan of Keegan. He remembers reading her 2010 novel Foster on a train and having to pull his hoodie over his face because he was crying so hard. Anyway, he’d wanted to work with the Peaky Blinders director Tim Mielants and they were throwing ideas around in his sitting room when Murphy’s wife suggested Small Things. “No, there’s no way,” Murphy said. “That’s going to be gone already.” But when he called the agent, he found it was available. “I went, ‘No, you’ve got to be fucking kidding.’” Murphy pitched the idea to Matt Damon, who has set up a studio with Ben Affleck. “From there it all just happened really quickly.”
I’m always trying to cut lines in scenes. I like films that pose the big questions, then leave it to the audience
Murphy plays Bill Furlong who, funnily enough, is a man of few words. Keegan’s light-touch writing is everything he loves in art – the sense that you are not being bashed over the head by an idea. That’s how he tries to act, he adds. “I’m always trying to cut lines in scenes, because I feel like you can transmit it. Like when you see a person on a train thinking, or driving a car, and you are purely observing someone and feeling the energy that is vibrating from them. That’s the sort of acting I love. In a lot of film and television, they want to cut those bits to go to the action. I like films that pose the big questions and then leave it to the audience.” Perhaps this is at the heart of his reticence in interviews? That he doesn’t feel the need to explain.
He still finds it “nuts” that the last of the Magdalene laundries closed in 1996, that it was illegal to buy condoms in Ireland until 1985, that divorce was made legal only in 1996. He remembers vividly thousands of people still going to see moving statues in Cork when he was growing up. “Crazy. But, like, how far the country has come since then, we’re so socially advanced now compared with where we were. But you must look back. And art is a better way of doing that than reading all these reports [into the laundries].” (Afterwards, he emails me: “The nation is actually dealing with an unresolved collective trauma. Who knows how long this will take to heal, but I feel strongly that art, film and literature can help with that process. It’s a kinder and gentler sort of therapy. I hope that our movie can help with that in its own little way.”)
Because he’s a nice man, because he doesn’t want me to feel bad about our encounter, and because he’s generous and hospitable, Murphy finishes by telling me some of the best places to visit in Ireland. He and his family are staying here for the summer. They’ve had it with air travel and his home town of Cork is only a couple of hours away. He supplies me with other recommendations: a great book he’s just read, Brian, by Jeremy Cooper, oh, and there’s the Francis Bacon studio exhibition I should catch on my way out.
But before I go, what has he learned from playing Oppenheimer? Foremost, he says, that scientists think differently. He knew this already from playing physicist Robert Capa in Danny Boyle’s Sunshine (2007) and hanging out in Cern, home of the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, for research. “I had dinner with all these geniuses. I’ll never understand quantum mechanics, but I was interested in what science does to their perspective.” He sought their opinions on subjects that matter – love, politics, our place in the universe, “infinity, or whatever the fuck. Because they have a completely different way of taking in information than we do. I remember one scientist saying, ‘I don’t believe in love. It’s a biological phenomenon, the exchange of hormones between the female and the male. That’s all. Love is a nonsense.’” Murphy taps the table with his hand. “I couldn’t go along with that, obviously.”

,"Yes, Christopher Nolan really prints his scripts on red paper — just ask Robert Downey Jr.",Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt recall meeting with Christopher Nolan for 'Oppenheimer' — and reading the script printed on red paper.,"Oppenheimer stars Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy know the routine with director Christopher Nolan, having worked with him on previous movies: Nolan makes a call, they meet, the actor reads the script while Nolan waits nearby.
What Robert Downey Jr. didn't know is that those scripts are presented in a low-tech manner, which ended up being the Iron Man actor's one complaint about working with the filmmaker.

""I went over to his house. I read it,"" explains Downey in EW's Around the Table with Nolan and the cast. ""I don't want to complain, but it's on red paper printed in black, which is kind of difficult at best.""
""And a bit unnerving as well,"" interjects Emily Blunt, who plays Oppenheimer's wife Kitty in the film.
""I guess there's something about it that makes it that you forget it as soon as you read it,"" jokes Downey, who portrays Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss in Oppenheimer. ""I don't know what those colors are. Anyway, it's a thing. You read the script, it's written in the first person, you're transported, and it's a journey to read it, and then at the end of that, the guy who wrote the script you just read is asking you if you want to do it. It's kind of like being hypnotized.""

As it turns out, the red paper doesn't have any hypnotic powers at all — the color just makes it difficult to photocopy the pages.
Blunt, who is also a Nolan-movie first-timer, admits that she didn't realize she was actually being offered a role when she first met with the director.
""I went and met Chris in L.A., and I didn't know the process — I didn't know if you were meeting countless other people,"" she says. ""So we talked for an hour or so, and then he's just very casual, and he goes, 'So it's the part of his wife and I'd love you to take a look at it.' And you're like, is this an offer? [Laughs] So I went into the living room and read the script and it was just so heart-racing. It was so awesome.""
Emily Blunt in 'Oppenheimer'. Universal Pictures
Blunt reveals that she called Murphy, who has appeared in a slew of Nolan-directed movies, to ask what she could expect from the experience of working with the filmmaker.
""I knew Cillian from A Quiet Place II, so, of course, I called him and I said, 'What's it like? Come on, tell me,"" recalls the actress. ""And he just said, 'You're going to just love it. You're going to love it. It's so focused, there's no chaos, it's very giving, it's collaborative,' and [he said] how amazing he was with actors. I think that is the great beauty of Chris. There are directors who are led by the visuals, or there are directors who are pretty good with actors, but you never find where someone is as mirroredly brilliant at both. So I was excited about the focus of it, I was excited about the screws getting tightened on everybody, and what that atmosphere will feel like on a film set.""

2023-08-15 12:02:37+00:00,“Oppenheimer” Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema on Making History With Christopher Nolan,"Cinematographer collaborator Hoyte van Hoytema, Christopher Nolan's longtime collaborator, on how they recreated the Trinity Test and more.","“Oppenheimer” Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema on Making History With Christopher Nolan
Oppenheimer marks the fourth collaboration between director Christopher Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema. And like their past efforts, the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the theoretical physicist who spearheaded the effort to create the atomic bomb and then came under attack when he warned the world of its dangers, is anything but routine. It’s a three-hour epic that has mesmerized audiences around the globe, a masterclass in storytelling, and a visual feast that manages to blow your mind without deploying a single visual effect. In short, Oppenheimer is a masterpiece.
In a conversation with The Credits, Nolan’s longtime collaborator discusses the surprising things about working with the director, bespoke lenses, and recreating the Trinity Test by eschewing spectacle for something more intimate and far more harrowing.
In what ways does Oppenheimer differ from your past collaborations?
Obviously, every film is different with Chris. He is definitely challenging himself. He doesn’t want the next film to be similar to the previous one. How did this film differ? This was a biopic. He’s never done anything like that before. Also, this was one of the first films where he wanted to turn inward. This is essentially a film about faces and thoughts. There was a different way of thinking about that.
Oppenheimer features vivid scenes of color and segments in black and white. Can you talk about creating those various looks?
Well, I’m a little allergic to the word. “Looks” hints at a surface patina. Film, for me, is a visceral medium. I’m more concerned about organic flow. I love the idea that you can take it in and have an emotional reaction to it. I never build an entity with looks. I always hope that it becomes an organic soup that somehow makes sense.
How do you achieve this organic soup?
We wanted to create a feeling of living in Oppenheimer’s head…to touch on the way he changed traditional physics into the new abstract world of quantum physics. It’s a time in which people started thinking conceptually differently about music, the arts. And also physics — that the fabric of our world is not built from molecules, but waves and their energies. That was our color world.
(Lewis) Strauss (the government official, played by Robert Downey Jr., who instigated a campaign to discredit Oppenheimer in the 1950s), on the other hand, is Oppenheimer’s nemesis. And in order to distinguish between those two storylines, the choice was made to go black and white so we could maneuver within those two worlds.
And then you ask why black and white? It was something Chris and I grew up watching. Chris shot his first film in black and white. I went to a Polish film school and saw films that I adored in black and white. We had an intuitive connection to that medium. Above that, we love to do things in-camera. We love to work on real negatives with as little digital interference as possible. For us, it was an obvious method.
You mentioned Oppenheimer’s close-ups. What were the challenges of creating such personal images for large-scale viewing?
I think the fact that the scope has to be about big subjects is a misconception. I had to learn that myself. Can you find the scope in the face of a person? I posed that question early on and started working with that concept. I firmly believe that if you make a good close-up and people look into the eyes of the players and feel the peripheral vision, you see a wide, expansive world through that face. Faces become your landscape. You have to be able to look into Oppenheimer’s world through his eyes.
What do you remember most about recreating the atomic blast?
I remember reading this segment in the script and thinking, “Okay, let’s not read this thoroughly yet because how are we ever gonna do this?” Chris is extremely pragmatic, and his guidance is always important. He has already envisioned a lot of the storytelling obstacles in his head. He’s a master of the timeline and how consecutive images can paint one image. So when you’re thinking about the Trinity test, you don’t think about one single image; you think about the collection of images that tell that story. And you start to dissect. You break it down into smaller pieces. Some of those pieces bring the size and the scope. And along the way, you find ways to communicate that feeling of seeing it for the first time.
What images did you decide on to help re-create what that experience must have been like?
We read a lot of witness accounts of the scientists that were there. They’re very emotional. Everything else was physics, but they were overwhelmed the moment they saw that thing. They had a poetic way of describing what they were seeing — the colors, the brightness of light, for instance. That’s something I can translate into photography. I wanted to avoid trying to photograph this big thing that would blow everybody away. We wanted to stay close to the way people experienced it. Strangely enough, it is about restraint. Let go of the Hollywood inside you. Just be truthful to the experience. Trust that that experience is actually something that people haven’t seen in a film and deserve to witness.
A little of “less is more”?
“Less is more” is something that always sings in my head. I think that a lot of my best choices come from restraint. Film is a collection of thousands of “less is more” choices. You’re always struggling between what your Hollywood devil on your shoulder tells you to do and what purity on the other shoulder tells you. On one hand, it’s what you think the audience wants to see. On the other, it’s trying to distill things, be simpler and more truthful. I think that people recognize honesty.
Can you give us a peek into your toolbox?
We always use custom lenses. They’re not off-the-shelf. For this one, we wanted to be part of the game, the epicenter where stuff was happening. We didn’t want to peek from the outside. And in order to feel that proximity, we needed to tweak the lenses to focus closer on the faces.
We shot a lot of close-ups on slightly wider lenses than we usually do. Our IMAX workhorse lens is a 40-millimeter. Traditionally, we would never shoot close-ups on that. When you get close to an actor, you have to reduce the distortion on the face. So we needed to rebuild that lens to get closer while reducing the distortion. There was a balancing act, but we were fanatic about creating a language in which we feel we were participating and not just observing.
For the technical stuff — the atoms colliding with each other, the stars, the black hole — we built a super macro lens that didn’t exist before. It enabled us to actually put a wide lens in between two small entities and gaze through it as if it was a landscape. [He holds up a lens with the wording “HVH IMAX Oppenheimer Probe Prototype 2022.”] We were building and engineering those kinds of things all the time. But this lens became pivotal to a lot of that microworld.
Is there anything you’d like to say about Oppenheimer that no one has asked you yet?
You wouldn’t believe how much I’ve been talking about this film. I just returned from Holland, where I talked on live television for literally three hours straight. What I always love to say is something people don’t realize about working with Chris. People think that he’s all about precision and planning…being extremely meticulous. And in many ways, he is. But what I think people sometimes forget is how intuitive he is. He understands his audience on a visceral level. And that’s what I love about working with Chris. He’s a technical master but also allows himself to step away from that and feel. I can’t say that enough. It’s not only technical perfection; he infuses heart into it.
Oppenheimer is in theaters now.

2023-07-18 08:31:20-04:00,"Christopher Nolan, Warner Bros., and the Struggle for the Soul of Movies",The upcoming face-off between ‘Oppenheimer’ and ‘Barbie’ points to a conflict between two radically opposed visions of movies. On the one side: Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav. On the other: Christopher Nolan.,"From the moment Warner Bros. announced Barbie would arrive in theaters on July 21, 2023, the same day previously announced as Oppenheimer’s release date, the two films have been pitted against one another. But the face-off is ultimately a distraction from larger issues within the film industry, even if it involves some of the same players. In the battle between Barbie and Oppenheimer, the only rational response is to hope for both films to be (a) good and (b) successful. Both are, from all appearances, ambitious and unusual projects from major directors. (Greta Gerwig’s Barbie is rooted in IP but can’t be easily mistaken for the fashion-doll equivalent of The Super Mario Bros. Movie or a Transformers sequel.) Both, in other words, are the sorts of films treated as must-sees by those who consider themselves more than casual moviegoers, as suggested by AMC’s report that it’s already sold 20,000 tickets to those planning to take them in as a double feature and by the appearance of “Barbenheimer” T-shirts. For those who care about movies, the only real choice this coming weekend is “all of the above”; it doesn’t matter which ends up winning the weekend box office.
The matchup does point to another underlying conflict, however, between two radically opposed visions of movies, their place in culture, and their future at large. On one side: Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav. On the other: Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan, who, with each new revelation made about the man now in charge of Warner Bros., is starting to look like the anti-Zaslav. And though there’s ultimately a clear hero and obvious villain, the situation they’re both involved in isn’t a simple one.
Like a lot of the predicaments that the world now finds itself in, it features the COVID-19 pandemic in a major supporting role. On December 3, 2020, Warner Bros. announced that its 2021 films—all 17 of them, including Dune and the third Matrix sequel—would premiere simultaneously in theaters and on the service then known as HBO Max. It was an unexpected development, to say the least. Theatrical exhibition had been devastated by the pandemic, and the FDA would not authorize the first coronavirus vaccines for another week. But this was a major studio putting its bets on streaming rather than theaters for (at least) the next year, a move most speculated had as much to do with HBO Max’s flagging subscription numbers as a concern for public health and safety.
Four days after the announcement, Nolan weighed in, telling The Hollywood Reporter, “Some of our industry’s biggest filmmakers and most important movie stars went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the worst streaming service.” By Nolan’s logic, this wasn’t just about art, but about business. “Their decision makes no economic sense,” he added, “and even the most casual Wall Street investor can see the difference between disruption and dysfunction.” It was an issue disturbing enough for Nolan to end his relationship with Warner Bros., a collaboration that dated back to his 2002 remake of Insomnia, his first film for a major studio. In September 2021, news broke that Nolan’s next film, a biopic of atomic scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer, would be for Universal.
In some respects, Nolan was then an imperfect messenger for the primacy of the theatrical experience. In the year leading up to Warner Bros.’ decision, the release of Nolan’s 2020 film, Tenet, became a kind of beacon of hope, signaling the moment when movie theaters would resume business as usual. Its U.S. release date kept shifting, moving from July 17 to July 31 before finally opening in some cities on September 3. For many, it seemed too soon (and restrictions prevented the film from opening in New York and elsewhere). Warner Bros.—presumably with Nolan’s approval, if not at his insistence—refused to make the film available digitally for critics, requiring them to attend screenings. Some simply balked. It seemed like an instance in which Nolan favored theatrical evangelism at the expense of public safety.
Still, the merger of Warner Bros. and Discovery in April 2022 into the Brundlefly-like Warner Bros. Discovery seemed to confirm the wisdom of Nolan’s decision to bolt. With that merger came Zaslav’s ascent to CEO of the new company, a role he’d previously played at Discovery.
A catalog of Zaslav’s greatest hits since taking control of Warner Bros. Discovery would be an article unto itself. In fact, GQ had a pretty good article written by Jason Bailey earlier this month that detailed just that—you might have heard about it because the piece was edited to soften its criticisms at the request of a Zaslav spokesman, and then the story was pulled entirely when Bailey asked for his byline to be removed. (The original still exists in archived form.) Some highlights include the shelving of a nearly completed Batgirl movie, which allowed the studio to use it as a tax write-off; the removal of original series made for HBO and other networks, including the once-mighty Westworld, also seemingly for tax purposes; and the sell-off of over half of Warner Bros.’ film and TV music assets.
Nothing is as concerning, or as revealing of Zaslav’s vision of the movies, however, as the gutting of Turner Classic Movies, the beloved cable destination for classic film. Thoughtfully programmed to provide context for our cinematic past, TCM has been essential to cinephiles since 1994—increasingly so since the shuttering of video stores and other channels’ retreats from airing classic films. (It’s now a distant memory that AMC used to be TCM’s rival.) It was, from all evidence, a gutting performed less out of necessity than out of an attempt to save money, any money, no matter what was lost in the process. TCM was, by all reports, a profitable operation, if not one destined to pad out the coffers of Warner Bros. Discovery to Uncle Scrooge–like dimensions. An intervention by Steven Spielberg, Paul Thomas Anderson, and Martin Scorsese led Zaslav to restate his commitment to TCM and his love of classic film—which he also expressed via an unconvincing and glib Maureen Dowd column—but TCM remains a decimated operation with an unsure future in the climate Zaslav has created.
Here’s a thought exercise: Would Zaslav’s Warner Bros. Discovery have indulged Nolan’s pet project of a few years back: releasing an “unrestored” version of 2001: A Space Odyssey, created by using original negatives owned by Warner Bros.? The release earned a lot of cinephile attention, and viewers who turned out for its art-house run in 2018—the same year the Discovery-owned TLC debuted the first episode of Dr. Pimple Popper—saw a gorgeous version of one of the greatest movies ever made. But so what? Why indulge in that sort of small-potatoes exercise?
Another project is even more telling of how Nolan’s vision contrasts with Zaslav’s. In 2015, Nolan released the short documentary Quay and oversaw the release of The Quay Brothers in 35mm, projects dedicated to the work of stop-motion animators Stephen and Timothy Quay. The Quays’ work, largely unknown outside of cinephile circles, is exacting, laborious, and deeply rooted in the old ways of making movies. It makes perfect sense as a Nolan inspiration.
In some ways, it’s not fair to compare a CEO—who, by definition, has to be in charge of a sprawling operation—to a single filmmaker. But it’s possible that because of his dedication to the past, Nolan is better equipped for the future. Since the disastrous report in April 2022 that Netflix had lost 200,000 subscribers, sending its stock plummeting by more than 35 percent, there’s been a nagging sense that something isn’t right with the streaming model—that the vision of theatrical releases as advertisements for film’s real home on competing streaming services may be misplaced, and that at some point, the bill would come due on the spending sprees used to set up streaming services for future profits. It makes sense that so many issues involved in the simultaneous WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes can be explained by a combination of greed and fear.
Nolan’s approach, by contrast, puts the emphasis on theatrical exhibition and on movies made to be seen by crowds on the biggest possible screens. Most films aren’t released in eight different formats or accompanied by format viewing guides. Movies are an event, in other words. Home viewing is essentially the film’s afterlife. It’s, in many respects, the way things used to be and nothing like the world preferred by Zaslav and others in the streaming business.
That might be why the Barbie (a Warner Bros. film) vs. Oppenheimer showdown feels a little personal. In many cities, their press screenings have been, at least initially, scheduled on the same night, forcing critics to cover one or the other. At the same time, Warner Bros. has been vocal about wanting to coax Nolan back to the studio, where he’d fit right into a professed plan to emphasize theatrical screenings and risky projects, as expressed by Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy, co-CEOs of the division now known as Warner Bros. Film Group. And there’s no reason to think that De Luca and Abdy aren’t serious. They’re real film people with track records to prove it, including a recent stint together at MGM that included auteur projects like Paul Thomas Anderson’s Licorice Pizza and Ridley Scott’s House of Gucci.
But they also work for David Zaslav, whose record has so far been defined by the trading of artistic achievement and lasting prestige for immediate profits. De Luca and Abdy’s definition of success might not be the same as their boss’s, and it’s hard to imagine that Nolan wouldn’t be wary about a return to the fold no matter what promises are made. Whatever the case, the film industry status quo that Zaslav has come to symbolize seems unsustainable—and, with the ongoing strikes, it’s not being sustained at all—and Nolan’s adherence to tradition suggests movies can still be made, distributed, and watched the way they were before the disruptions of the last decade. Whether he’ll be a model for others to follow or one of the last of his kind remains the great, unanswered question.

2023-07-26 19:32:14+00:00,Oppenheimer: Is Christopher Nolan’s movie worth the trouble to see in 70 mm IMAX?,Here’s what you’re missing if you don’t see the movie in Christopher Nolan’s favorite format.,"If you want to see Oppenheimer the way Christopher Nolan wanted it to be seen, here’s what you need to do. First, live near one of the 30 theaters in the entire world where it’s being projected on 70 mm IMAX film, a format whose almost hyperreal resolution leads Nolan to call it “3D without the glasses.” Then, buy a ticket. Whoops, tonight’s sold out. Tomorrow? Sold out too. How’s Aug. 10 for you?
You get the point. Because of the delicate nature of the IMAX prints, which weigh 600 pounds and are 11 miles long—so long that the platters that feed the film into the projector had to be fitted with custom 3D-printed extensions—most theaters have guaranteed the movie only for a three-week run. And because of the sheer size of the image, which often opens up from a thin rectangle to fill the IMAX screen’s entire floor-to-ceiling height, you can rule out the first few rows in many theaters, which offer a distorted and decidedly nonoptimal experience. (One Twitter user posted a since-deleted video shot from a front-row seat in which Cillian Murphy’s face appeared swollen like a deformed balloon.) At the theater nearest me, there are still a few good seats left on the last day of the run—as long as you’re willing to start a three-hour movie at 11 on a weeknight. If you live in Manhattan, well, you’d better hope someone who’s already got tickets has a death in the family, and even then, they might charge you upwards of $100 apiece.
Haunting your local theater’s ticket app might turn up a cancellation—that was how I managed, scoring a fourth-row seat for a Saturday morning screening a mere five days in advance—but at this point, you’re getting the idea that seeing Oppenheimer in 70 mm IMAX is more like snagging Taylor Swift tickets than striding up to the counter and saying, “One, please.” And that leads us to a vital question, given the amount of effort you’re likely to be putting in at this moment: Is it worth it?

I’ve seen Oppenheimer twice, in digital and 70 mm IMAX—both times, as it turns out, in the exact same auditorium. So while I can’t speak to the full range of formats in which the movie is being exhibited—standard and 4K projection, laser and xenon IMAX, not to mention 35 mm and non-IMAX 70 mm film—I can say precisely how much of a difference seeing it in this most rarefied of formats brings to the process, and how much is just hype.

Setting aside the scattershot nature of contemporary multiplex projection—really the primary consideration here, but one that’s beyond the scope of this inquiry—Oppenheimer is going to look spectacular in any of them. Nolan and his cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema are famously meticulous, optimizing for various formats all the way down the line to Blu-ray and DVD (although with streaming, they kind of throw up their hands). But IMAX, and here I mean any kind and not just film, adds a layer of meaning that enhances the film, if not necessarily transforms it. Nolan divides the movie into two sections, labeled “Fission” and “Fusion,” the former shot in color and following the point of view of Cillian Murphy’s Robert Oppenheimer, the latter shot in black and white and dominated by Robert Downey Jr.’s Lewis Strauss, the ambitious and vindictive government official who arranged to have Oppenheimer persecuted during the McCarthy era for his left-wing associations.

In both the Fission and Fusion sections, the movie switches between widescreen and full-frame images, a long, thin rectangle and something closer to a square—a technique he has been using since 2008’s The Dark Knight. But where most IMAX movies are solely interested in exploiting its capacity for spectacle—making the big things bigger and the loud things louder—Oppenheimer is up to something different. While the Trinity test does fill the theater floor to ceiling with a cloud of nuclear fire, the movie is largely driven by conversations. (It’s the first Nolan movie in years where you can actually hear all the dialogue.) But by blowing those conversations up so much larger than life, to the point where Cillian Murphy’s eyes are not just the color but the size of swimming pools, Nolan underlines how seemingly mundane or undramatic events, the kind movies often don’t even bother with, can have absolutely massive consequences. When the time comes to pick which Japanese city will be the target of the deadliest weapon the world has ever known, Truman’s secretary of war starts by crossing Kyoto off the list, because he and his wife enjoyed their visit there on their honeymoon.

Because IMAX cameras are cumbersome and noisy, some of the decisions about which scenes are shot in which format seem to driven by technical concerns. If a scene involves two people in a room, it’s more likely to be shot in widescreen than full-frame IMAX. But in general, Nolan uses the larger frame when Oppenheimer’s world is expanding, and the more narrowly bounded widescreen when it’s contracting. When Oppenheimer meets with Albert Einstein by a pond in Princeton, it’s shot in black-and-white IMAX (a format that didn’t even exist until Nolan and Hoytema had Kodak manufacture a new kind of film stock). But when Strauss arrives and curtails their chat, black bars appear at the top and bottom of the screen, as if a sense of unlimited potential has suddenly been constrained by a huffy bureaucrat. In Dunkirk, I found this sort of back-and-forth distracting, and after seeing it in three different formats, I wound up preferring the fixed aspect ratio of traditional 70 mm. But because Oppenheimer isn’t an action movie, the effect is more impressionistic, something you feel more than you see.

The showstopper, so to speak, is the Trinity explosion itself, but the movie is dotted with arresting images all along, some of which remain abstract or ambiguous until the closing moments: the ripples of raindrops in a pond evolve into the blast radii of nuclear detonations covering the globe; an ethereal vision of clouds that we later realize are the ghostly trails of missile launches. And that’s where the added power of the 70 mm IMAX format, which offers more than four times the resolution of the best commercial digital projection, really comes in. Oppenheimer is most effective when the audience is as seduced and haunted by these images as its protagonist is. When a young Oppenheimer starts to really grasp the nature of theoretical physics, the movie shows us visions of atoms spinning in the air around his head, as if he’s peering directly into the fabric of the universe, and at the Trinity test, all the assembled scientists stare in awe, transfixed by the awesome beauty and terrible potential of what they’ve just unleashed. (One even rips off his safety goggles and runs outside in the seconds before the blast, as if possessed by the need to experience the totality of its power.) The movie never shows us the results of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki—Oppenheimer didn’t even know that the bomb had been dropped until he heard Truman announce it on the radio the following day—but we feel them anyway, as the martial pounding of feet on gym risers during a victory rally in a basketball gym morphs briefly but unmistakably into the piercing shrieks of the dead. For the movie to work best, that moment has to have an impact as profound as the blast itself.

I wouldn’t go so far as to say that if you haven’t seen Oppenheimer in 70 mm IMAX, you haven’t seen it at all, or even that it’s worth waiting to see it until you can watch it that way. (And miss out on all the Barbenheimer discourse? Perish the thought.) As stunning as a perfectly projected film print can be, I’ve seen reports of botched screenings from all over the country, whether because of poorly maintained equipment or untrained projectionists or any number of factors. One reason for the limited runs is that film prints wear over time, and a format this detailed shows the flaws more than most—a single hair over the lens is enough to mar the image. But with enough effort and a little bit of luck, you’ll be rewarded with one of the most visually stunning experiences you’ve ever had in a movie theater, and one there’s no guarantee you’ll ever be able to see again.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy8wNy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1tb3ZpZS1pbWF4LXNob3d0aW1lcy03MC1tbS10aGVhdGVycy1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"Christopher Nolan on J. Robert Oppenheimer, ""the most important person who ever lived""","In his latest film, the director examines the efforts of the physicist and his race to build the atomic bomb that ended World War II. What happened after the war proved to be an entirely different power struggle, as Oppenheimer was accused of being a Russian agent.","The world's first atomic explosion was conducted on July 16, 1945, during the final weeks of World War II, in the high desert of New Mexico.
At Ground Zero, the sand melted in the fireball, and rained back down to the ground, where it re-solidified in the form of a mineral – what we now call trinitite, after the name of the site: Trinity.
At 33°40'38.0""N 106°28'31.0""W, the world was changed. CBS News
Recalling the moment 20 years later, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man history calls ""the father of the atomic bomb,"" said it brought to mind a line of Hindu scripture: ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.""
Christopher Nolan, the director behind such films as ""Dunkirk,"" ""Inception,"" ""Interstellar,"" and the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy, has spent the last three years living in Oppenheimer's world, writing and directing the movie ""Oppenheimer"" (opening this week). ""I view Oppenheimer as the most important person who ever lived,"" he told Martin. ""Oppenheimer's story is one of the biggest stories imaginable.""

""By unleashing atomic power, he gave us the power to destroy ourselves that we never had before, and that changes the human equation,"" said Nolan.
To watch a trailer for ""Oppenheimer"" click on the video player below:
Kai Bird is co-author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Oppenheimer, ""American Prometheus,"" on which the film is based. ""It's complicated to take on a historic icon like Robert Oppenheimer and deal with the history faithfully and yet turn it into a cinematic experience,"" said Bird.
Martin asked, ""Did you have qualms about what Hollywood would do to all your research?""
""Of course I did, yes!"" Bird laughed.
Martin said to Nolan, ""For high stakes human drama, it's hard to improve on the historical facts.""
Nolan replied, ""I know of no other story as dramatic as Oppenheimer and his involvement in the Manhattan Project"" – the code name for the race to build the bomb.
Nolan filmed ""Oppenheimer"" using an Imax camera. ""Only Imax film would really be worthy of the Trinity project,"" he said. A 70mm Imax print of ""Oppenheimer,"" which runs three hours, is 11 miles long; on its platter it weighs 600 pounds. CBS News
Oppenheimer (played in the film by Cillian Murphy) was teaching graduate physics when he was recruited by a gruff Army general, Leslie Groves (played by Matt Damon). Bird said, ""Oppie was then, you know, 38 years old, never managed anything more than his graduate students, and yet Groves selected him.""
""What did other people think of Groves' choice?"" Martin asked.
""They thought it was outlandish.""

Besides his lack of experience, Oppenheimer had communist connections. ""It took him a long time to get a security clearance,"" said Bird. ""His own wife, Kitty, had been a member of the party for a long time.""
And what did Groves think of that? ""He thought Oppie was the one to lead this project, and it was a brilliant choice,"" said Bird. ""He could see in Oppie the smarts and the charisma to bring all these scientists together in this secret city and make it happen.""
At Los Alamos, New Mexico, where the bomb was designed and built, it was initially believed that it would only take about 130 people to get the job done. ""That number grew to 1,700,"" said Alan Carr, the historian at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
Thrown together in what was then the nowhereville of Los Alamos, the average age of the scientists was 29.
Martin asked, ""Boys and girls together – were there romances?""
""There were,"" Carr replied, ""and that became somewhat of a security problem here, because before the project essentially no one was born in this area. All of a sudden, you've got 8, 10, 12 children being born every month. How do you hide that?""
After shooting scenes in Oppenheimer's New Mexico home, Nolan donated the furnishings he had brought in to the Los Alamos Historical Society, but without the bugs placed by security officers suspicious of Oppenheimer's politics, who had him under surveillance, even in his own house.
""He was being watched for much of his employment in different ways,"" said Carr. ""For instance, his phone was tapped at various times. And when he would talk to Kitty, they would occasionally make reference to the fact that they were probably being listened in on.""
By the time Oppenheimer was ready to test what he called ""the gadget,"" Germany had already surrendered, but Japan fought on. Carr said, ""This was literally life-and-death because of every day that was going on in the war, thousands and thousands of more people were being killed.""
The ""gadget"" was hoisted to the top of a 100-foot tower, and the countdown began.
Oppenheimer was in a bunker 10,000 yards from Ground Zero where, before the test, he supposedly said, ""Lord, these affairs are difficult on the heart.""
""There is a tremendous burst of light,"" said Carr. ""He would have been watching it unfold in silence for dozens and dozens of seconds before the shock wave arrived. Imagine someone firing a pistol very close to you and somebody putting a leaf blower on high right in your face.""
Three weeks after the test, an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Then, a second one on Nagasaki.
The war was over, and Oppenheimer was the most famous scientist in the world.
But that is only half the story
Bird said, ""He shortly afterwards plunged into a deep depression, I think having read some of the news accounts of what had happened actually on the ground at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.""
Oppenheimer had built the weapon that won the war, but he also had created a monster, which he warned would one day cause the world to curse the names Los Alamos and Hiroshima. In 1947 he said, ""If there is another world war, this civilization may go under.""
""The national security establishment is appalled that the father of the atomic bomb is coming out in public giving speeches against these weapons,"" said Bird.
Lewis Strauss, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (played in the film by Robert Downey Jr.), was bent on building more and bigger bombs than the Russians – and Oppenheimer was in his way. ""Strauss managed to draw up an indictment that made it appear that Oppie's advice was politically motivated, that maybe he was a subversive, that maybe he was a secret communist, that maybe he was a spy,"" said Bird.

Meeting behind closed doors, an Atomic Energy Commission security panel heard evidence – some of it gathered from illegal wiretaps – of Oppenheimer's communist connections. The judges voted against him. Bird said, ""It's a terrible tragedy, because here's America's foremost scientist, a great public intellectual, put on trial and stripped of his security clearance and then humiliated.""
He retreated into academic exile at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, home of Albert Einstein, who had tried to talk Oppenheimer out of fighting a battle he couldn't win. Bird recalled: ""Oppenheimer walks away from Einstein, and Albert Einstein turns to his secretary and says, 'There goes a nar,' the Yiddish for 'fool.'""
It would take decades for the humiliation to be rectified. In December 2022, the Department of Energy formally vacated the entire clearance hearing. ""The message there is that this shouldn't have happened,"" said Carr.
By then, Oppenheimer had long since passed away. So he remains, as the title of his biography says, the American Prometheus who stole fire from the gods and was tortured ever after.
But it's not a myth.
Nolan said, ""Oppenheimer was at the center of a set of events that changed the world forever. Like it or not, we still live in his world, and we always will.""

NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - Acclaimed film director Christopher Nolan turns his attention to J. Robert Oppenheimer for his new blockbuster movie, taking audiences back to when the American theoretical physicist oversaw the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II.
Based on the 2005 biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, Nolan's biological thriller ""Oppenheimer"" features a stellar cast including Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt and Cillian Murphy in the titular role, portraying the man known as ""the father of the atomic bomb"".
""Oppenheimer's story is one of the most dramatic that I know of and there are many, many aspects to what makes it so compelling,"" Nolan told Reuters in a joint interview with Murphy.
""I just thought to take the audience there, to be there in that room with these people as they had to make these horrifying decisions that have defined the world we now live in... what a remarkable dramatic event to bring the audience to.”
Oppenheimer headed the secret Los Alamos Laboratory, established under President Franklin D. Roosevelt as part of the Manhattan Project to build the first atomic bomb.
He oversaw the first atomic bomb detonation in the New Mexico desert, code-named ""Trinity"", before the weapons were used in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
""There is so much information (about Oppenheimer)... My job as an actor is really to go after the humanity and the emotion, and the complexity and the morality of the character,"" Murphy, who has worked with Nolan previously, said.
""So I didn't really waste too much time on the physics, I did a little bit... but it was the man I was after.""
Nolan is known for conceptual narratives and visual style in films like ""Inception"" ""Tenet"" and an instalment of the Batman film franchise.
'Oppenheimer' is kind of the amalgam of every Chris Nolan movie ever, all of which have been leading to a statement as kind of profound as this but it's still edge of your seat entertainment,"" Downey Jr. said.
""It was crazy to be part of shooting it and even crazier to watch it.”

2023-07-23 18:08:57+00:00,Robert Downey Jr. Praises Cillian Murphy for His Role in ‘Oppenheimer’: “I Have Never Witnessed a Greater Sacrifice”,'Oppenheimer' stars Robert Downey Jr.,"Robert Downey Jr. sang Cillian Murphy’s praises for his take on J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, in Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer.
In a conversation with People magazine, the Iron Man actor, who plays former Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss in the film, explained he was impressed with Murphy’s “commitment” to the role.
“I have never witnessed a greater sacrifice by a lead actor in my career,” Downey told the publication. “He knew it was going to be a behemoth ask when Chris called him. But I think he also had the humility that is required to survive playing a role like this.”
The Sherlock Holmes star shared that the cast would go and do things together when they had a break in production, but Murphy often passed on joining so he could keep working.
“We’d be like, ‘Hey, we got a three-day weekend. Maybe we’ll go antiquing in Santa Fe. What are you going to do?’ ‘Oh, I have to learn 30,000 words of Dutch. Have a nice time,'” Downey recalled. “But that’s the nature of the ask.”
Florence Pugh, who plays one of Oppenheimer’s great loves, psychologist Jean Tatlock, also reflected on her time starring opposite the Peaky Blinders actor in the film.

“Chris had one of the most incredible leads in Cillian,” she told People. “He is an actor that I have been watching for quite some time and have been desperate to work with for ages. You’d have to be mad to say no. It was truly one of the best experiences that I’ve had.”
The Don’t Worry Darling actress shared that working with Murphy was “hugely impressive.”
“Every single day he shows up knowing every single possible way, intonation, inflection of how to bring this character to life,” she continued. “There’s a reason why he is one of the greats.”
In a previous conversation with The Hollywood Reporter, Nolan revealed he knew almost immediately that he wanted Murphy to portray the physicist in Oppenheimer, which is based on biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.
“I’ve been staring at the cover of the book American Prometheus for so many months, and there’s this photograph, black and white, a light blue-eyed stare, very intense, of this guy,” Nolan told THR. “And I thought, ‘Well, I know who could do that.'”
The Oscar-winning director called the actor while he was at home in Ireland and offered him the role of a lifetime.
“He’s just so understated and matter-of-fact and British,” Murphy said of Nolan. “It was like, ‘Cillian, look, I have a script, it’s Oppenheimer and I’d like you to play Oppenheimer.’ That was it.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItcm9iZXJ0LWRvd25leS1qci1mbG9yZW5jZS1wdWdoLXByYWlzZS1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi0xMjM1NTQyMDEwL9IBlgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItcm9iZXJ0LWRvd25leS1qci1mbG9yZW5jZS1wdWdoLXByYWlzZS1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi0xMjM1NTQyMDEwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The epic bowed to $4.3M, capturing 44% market share for the day in a highly competitive environment.
That marks the best Nolan opening day in the market, biggest Hollywood opening of the year there (No. 2 launch of 2023 for all titles), the No. 5 debut day of the pandemic and the No. 4 Universal opening day ever. Presales were outstanding, beating all previous Nolan movies.
Across 1,600 screens, this is the second-widest release for a Nolan title in Korea, only behind Tenet, which came out during the pandemic when there was no other competition.
On 20 Imax screens, Oppenheimer generated 9.4% of the total box office for the day. The CVG Egg score currently stands at a strong 92%. The Korea cume is $5.5M through today (not included in the totals above), dominating with a 42% market share on Wednesday.

In total on Tuesday, the Cillian Murphy-led historical drama added $9.6M in 80 markets. The international box office through Tuesday is $398.3M and $668M globally.
The offshore cume to date is above Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises and more than double Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception and Tenet at the same point of release.
This is now Nolan’s biggest film of all time in 50 markets including Germany, Brazil, the Netherlands, India and Poland. It’s his top non-superhero movie in 62 markets.
Over the weekend, the drama overtook Star Wars: The Last Jedi in the UK to become the third-biggest Imax release of all time. The overall cume there through Wednesday is $59.7M, which is in line with The Dark Knight Rises (-3%) and Dunkirk (+1%).
In Brazil, Oppenheimer topped the lifetime take of The Dark Knight Rises.
Other standouts include Germany at $36.4M, for the biggest Nolan movie ever in the market; France, with a running total of $29.4M through Tuesday, 23% above The Dark Knight Rises at the same point in release; and Australia, with $21.4M to date, 30% above Inception at the same point.

2023-07-24 18:41:56+00:00,"Every Christopher Nolan Movie Ranked From Worst to Best, Including ‘Oppenheimer’","All 12 Christopher Nolan movies ranked, including 'The Dark Knight,' 'The Prestige,' 'Tenet' and 'Inception.'","With the release of Oppenheimer, it’s time to rank all of director Christopher Nolan‘s movies from worst to best (BWAAAAAHM!). This wasn’t an easy task. Unlike ranking five Indiana Jones movies or seven Mission: Impossible films, Nolan offers 12 films that range from historical dramas (Dunkirk, Oppenheimer), to sci-fi thrillers (Interstellar, Tenet) to mysteries (The Prestige, Memento) to his Batman trilogy. Through it all, Nolan has risen to become one of the world’s finest filmmakers, one of the few who can dependably fill theater seats on an opening weekend, and is considered the last respite for grown-up cinema fans. Here are all of Nolan’s films, from the weakest to the strongest.
12. Insomnia (2002)
It says a lot about Nolan that the “worst” film he directed is still rather good and worth watching. Insomnia is a remake of the Norwegian title and is perhaps notable that it’s the only movie Nolan directed that he didn’t also write or co-write. Here, a veteran Los Angeles detective (Al Pacino) teams with a small-town investigator (Hilary Swank) to solve a murder in remote Alaska. It’s a nice, moody detective drama, but it lacks Nolan’s usual ambitious scope.
11. Following (1998)
Nolan’s debut feature, made for a reported $6,000, showed all the promise for the then-20-something director. Shot in black-and-white, it features some themes Nolan would continue to explore for decades to come. Its protagonist is a single-minded obsessive alienated from society who follows a code (sound familiar?), and it has a twisty third act and smart expositional dialogue that rings Nolan. The feature centers on a man who follows strangers around London and becomes embroiled in more than he expected after breaking his rule never to follow the same person twice. At just 70 minutes, some might argue it’s not a feature-length movie, but Nolan — who put three years of his life into scraping it together — has said it’s just as valid as anything he’s done.
10. Tenet (2020)
John David Washington is compelling as a secret agent trying to prevent World War III — a war between the present and future. Tenet feels like a collection of Nolan’s most frustrating habits — from an oppressive soundscape that eclipses dialogue, to stylish yet flat characters, to a narrative that’s twisty to the point of sometimes losing the audience. Still, Tenet earns some admittedly shallow points for looking cool and sounding cool and trying gamely to do something original with time travel. (THR’s review.)
9. The Dark Knight Rises (2012)
Tom Hardy is marvelous as the menacing terrorist Bane and there are some strong sequences in the climax to Nolan’s Batman trilogy (such as the plane hijacking opener, and Bruce’s trial in The Pit). Also, the film deserves credit for thinking big — criminals entirely taking over Gotham City is a storyline that really goes for it (so long as you don’t think too much about the believability of a police force being conveniently trapped in a sewer for months). (THR’s review.)
8. Memento (2000)
The one that got everybody’s attention: Nolan’s sophomore effort (co-written with his brother Jonathan) is a twisty noir thriller starring Guy Pearce as a man unable to make new memories trying to solve his wife’s murder. It’s a compelling puzzle that showed a filmmaker who can blend an accessible genre movie with a challenging narrative and pull it off, all leading to an ending that’s, well, unforgettable.
7. Dunkirk (2017)
Dunkirk is masterfully well made from its very first shot, which smash cuts into falling leaflets on a street amid a ticking clock as British World War II soldiers attempt to flee the Germans as they invade France. Nolan’s skill in staging action is on display in one gripping sequence after another. Yet several of the heroes feel unknowable and interchangeable, which keeps the audience at an emotional distance even as Nolan employs every sweeping cinematic technique to pull us close. (THR’s review.)
6. Interstellar (2014)
Nolan is often accused of being a cold filmmaker — and can be. But there’s nothing aloof about Matthew McConaughey’s powerful performance as an astronaut who leaves behind his daughter in a quest to save humanity by finding a new world to replace a dying Earth. While the story has some plot holes (OK, a lot), the resulting combination of 2001: A Space Odyssey-inspired cinematic wonder and its emotional heft make this one of Nolan’s most popular films (and currently his most successful non-superhero title at the box office). (THR’s review.)
5. Inception (2010)
From here on, Nolan is hitting home runs. Inception has Nolan putting together so many of his signature talents into one original blockbuster as it follows Leonardo DiCaprio as a man who implants false memories for his corporate clients. It’s visually spectacular, exceedingly clever and has the filmmaker’s coolest ending shot. While Hans Zimmer’s score became a meme for that iconic bwaaaahm, it’s also one of the composer’s greatest efforts (see “Time”). (THR’s review.)
4. Batman Begins (2005)
The first hour of Batman Begins is a fantastic launch to not only a grown-up Dark Knight trilogy but also a re-imagining of what superhero movies can be, if they’re treated like larger-than-life crime dramas with practical effects instead of quip-filled, save-the-world, CGI-fueled dramedies. Christian Bale quickly proved he’s a fine successor to the cowl and there’s never been a better Alfred than Michael Caine, even though the film’s final act staggers a bit.
3. The Prestige (2006)
The Prestige is a marvelous mystery based on Christopher Priest’s novel about dueling turn-of-the-century obsessive magicians with terrific performances by a dogmatic Bale, a searing Hugh Jackman (“You don’t know?!“), and an all-too-wise Caine. The Nolan brothers’ script uses voiceover and narrative in such a confident and propulsive way, and there’s an ending twist you’ll never see coming.
2. Oppenheimer (2023)
Oppenheimer is too long, overly chatty and its final act goes from fate-of-the-world stakes to men sitting around tables arguing over a security clearance (imagine if Batman defeated the Scarecrow in Batman Begins and then spent another 40 minutes discussing how to best fix Gotham City’s damaged monorail system). And yet, Nolan uses every well-honed instrument in his toolbox to create a dramatic masterpiece that has something that his other, more pulpy films largely lack: modern-day, real-world importance. In the film, based on the biography American Prometheus, Nolan successfully tells the story of a major historical figure, champions science and movingly reminds the world of the dangers of weapons of mass destruction. The score by Ludwig Göransson might be the best yet for a Nolan film. And Nolan’s hellish post-Trinity test pep rally scene is perhaps the most cleverly directed and emotionally powerful sequence of his career. (THR’s review and cover story.)
1. The Dark Knight (2008)
Because you’re never going to watch Oppenheimer as many times as you’ve probably already watched The Dark Knight — as the clown says, it’s “just too much fun.” It’s still the best superhero movie ever made, with Heath Ledger delivering a legendary (and posthumous Oscar-winning) performance as the Joker that looms over every frame, despite only appearing in 33 minutes of the 152-minute film. The script (by the Nolan brothers, along with David S. Goyer) is fantastic, with so many iconic lines (“You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain” … “It’s all part of the plan…”). Every supporting cast member pops, Zimmer’s score is ominously tense, and the action sequences are grounded and effective. So many of Nolan’s movies have lengthy run times, but this is one you don’t want to end. (THR’s review.)

Hollywood's writers have been striking for months outside the studios of streaming services such as Netflix and Disney over working conditions and pay.
Oppenheimer hits theatres on 21 July, the same day as the iconic Barbie movie.

2023-06-29 18:19:02+00:00,Will Christoper Nolan’s ‘Oppenheimer’ Get a Theatrical Release in Japan?,"Christopher Nolan's historical epic ""Oppenheimer"" hasn't finalized release plans in Japan.","Christopher Nolan‘s historical epic “Oppenheimer,” about the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II, is preparing for a massive global debut next month. As of now, though, the film’s distributor Universal has yet to announce when — or if — it will premiere in Japan.
A spokesperson for the studio says “plans have not been finalized in all markets.” Universal is releasing the $100 million-budgeted “Oppenheimer” in the U.S. and much of the rest of the world on July 21.
The situation in Japan is complicated given the film’s subject matter and the devastation the bombs wrought on the country. “Oppenheimer” centers on American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), who led the efforts to build the weapons of mass destruction that ended the war. Approximately 200,000 Japanese civilians died after two atomic bombs were dropped in 1945 over the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Though the movie’s focus may not be enough to prevent the country from playing “Oppenheimer” in its theaters, if it does secure a release date, it’s not clear that Japanese moviegoers will be interested in seeing a film about the topic.
Other American-backed movies set in the Pacific theater of World War II have played in Japanese cinemas — though to mixed results. Hugh Jackman’s 2013 “X-Men” movie “The Wolverine,” which had a sequence involving the bombing of Nagasaki, generated a muted $7.9 million. Meanwhile, the Japanese-language “Letters From Iwo Jima” ($42.9 million), the second of Clint Eastwood’s 2006 companion pieces, earned far more than “Flags of Our Fathers” ($13.1 million), which recounted the same battle from the American perspective. “Oppenheimer,” sources say, differs from those films in that it is a talky R-rated drama that is largely set in laboratories and the halls of American government, not the battlefield.
Whether “Oppenheimer” will play in Japan comes down to Toho-Towa, the country’s biggest distributor of Hollywood films. The company has yet to screen the movie but is expected to do so soon.
There are other factors that make Japan a unique moviegoing market. Unlike most territories, Hollywood studios have influence but not the final say in when its movies will open in Japan. It’s also often the last country to release Hollywood films, in part because marketing efforts are highly structured. It’s not unusual for American-made movies to debut in Japan months later than they do in North America. And those plans are usually late to come together.
That said, two other major tentpoles that are premiering domestically in July have already been given release dates in Japan. Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” is set for Aug. 11 and Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” lands on July 21.
Nolan’s films, including “The Dark Knight” trilogy, as well as “Inception,” “Interstellar,” “Dunkirk” and “Tenet,” tend to make a huge portion of their money at the international box office. That may not be the case with a firmly American story like “Oppenheimer,” which studio sources believe will be more popular with U.S. moviegoers than foreign crowds. Japan, one of the top moviegoing markets, has been a modest territory for Nolan’s prior efforts. His two most recent releases, “Tenet” and “Dunkirk,” grossed $25 million and $14.8 million respectively in the country’s cinemas.
Nolan, who shot the movie in 70mm with Imax cameras, has stressed the importance of “Oppenheimer,” arguing that the aftershocks of the technology reverberates to this day.
“Like it or not, J. Robert Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived,” Nolan said at CinemaCon, the annual convention for movie theater owners. “He made the world that we live in for better or for worse. His story has to be seen to be believed.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2Uvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tdGhlYXRyaWNhbC1yZWxlYXNlLWphcGFuLTEyMzU2NDU3NTIv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vYm94LW9mZmljZS9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi10aGVhdHJpY2FsLXJlbGVhc2UtamFwYW4tMTIzNTY0NTc1Mi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-05 19:57:04+00:00,"Who is Oppenheimer and why is Christopher Nolan, one of the biggest directors in Hollywood, making a movie about him?","Oppenheimer's life, work, and complicated legacy are dramatic enough for the big screen. But what can audiences learn from his story in 2023?","J. Robert Oppenheimer.
Even if that name doesn’t ring a bell, you almost certainly know who he is. Known as the father of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer is one of the most important figures of the 20th century––and now he’s the protagonist of one of the year’s biggest movies from Christopher Nolan, one of the biggest directors working today.
Considering Nolan’s filmography––dark superhero epics like “The Dark Knight,” cerebral, twist-filled blockbusters like “Inception”––it might seem odd that he’s tackling a film about Oppenheimer. But the life, work and legacy of the man are more than deserving of a jump to the big screen, says Gretchen Heefner, an associate professor of history at Northeastern University.
Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer is an IMAX®-shot epic thriller.
His leadership in the Manhattan Project, the top secret operation to develop the atomic bomb before the Nazis, that culminated in the creation of a world-altering weapon is notable enough. His post-World War II disgust in what he had created and fierce attempt to regulate nuclear weapons even more so. But according to Heefner, he was also just “an interesting character” who seems almost tailor-made for the movies.
“He was this really complicated, interesting figure,” Heefner says. “He flirted with communism for a while. He was known to be volatile, difficult to work with yet apparently a good manager when he was at [the Manhattan Project’s] Los Alamos [lab].”
Based on Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning biography “American Prometheus,” “Oppenheimer,” due to hit theaters on July 21, stars Cillian Murphy in the titular role and, based on trailers, appears to follow his early days, time on the Manhattan Project and the post-war period that destroyed his career.

Oppenheimer quickly acquired a reputation as a brilliant theoretical physicist who was pretty clumsy in a lab. He was also incredibly driven––sometimes to the point of obsession––and, as a result, prolific. Oppenheimer is mostly known for his contributions to theoretical astronomy, astrophysics, quantum field theory and, of course, nuclear physics
But Oppenheimer was also known as much for his personality as his publications.
Tall, lanky and constantly smoking a cigarette, Oppenheimer was in many ways a renaissance man. He could learn other languages incredibly fast and was often as knowledgeable and passionate about philosophy and art as he was physics.
He also was not afraid to show how knowledgeable he was. As a university student, he would dominate class discussions to the point that his classmates threatened to boycott their class, according to Bird and Sherwin. During his university years, Oppenheimer also struggled with depression that manifested in some violent behavior toward some of his closest friends.
Politically, Oppenheimer was a supporter of progressive causes and left-wing politics throughout his life. Although he never formally joined the Communist Party, in the 1930s he was an active supporter, financially and philosophically, of reforms and ideas that aligned with the party. During the Red Scare of the ’40s and ’50s, this would prove his undoing.
With a character like that at the center of his film, the focus of Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” is largely what has come to define the physicist’s legacy––the creation of the first atomic bomb––and his response to that legacy.

In October 1941, two months before the U.S. entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt officially signed off on the development of an atomic bomb. Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves (played by Matt Damon in the film) was eventually made director of the Manhattan Project, the name for the top secret project for developing the atomic bomb.
Groves chose Oppenheimer to lead the project’s secret weapons lab in New Mexico. Oppenheimer assembled a team of top tier physicists, some from the U.S. and others who had fled from Europe and Nazi Germany. For those involved in the project, there was a sense of urgency unlike anything else.
“They were like, ‘If Hitler gets it, it’s all over,’” Heefner says. “There was a sense of if your enemy has it, they’ll use it and then it’s over. Early on that was the preoccupation. It’s the ultimate weapon, so if you have it, you can threaten anything.”
In 1945, the hard work of countless Los Alamos Laboratory scientists culminated in the first nuclear explosion at a New Mexico site, codenamed “Trinity.” The Trinity nuclear test is one of the most important and iconic moments of the 20th century––so important that Nolan was adamant he needed to recreate the explosion practically, without computer generated imagery.
“We knew the world would not be the same,” Oppenheimer said of that moment in a 1965 televised interview.
He was right. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 helped end the war but also ushered in a nuclear arms race and Cold War.
He was capable of remorse and reflection. He understood that his actions had consequences and was working for a greater good more than ego. Gretchen Heefner, an associate professor of history at Northeastern University
In the same television interview, Oppenheimer says in the moment the Trinity test went off he was reminded of a quote from the Bhagavad Gita: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” It’s a quote that came to define his relationship with his creation for the rest of his life.
In response to the U.S. dropping its second bomb on Nagasaki, Oppenheimer hand-delivered a letter expressing his disgust to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson. For the rest of his life, the father of the atomic bomb would be one of the fiercest advocates for its regulation.
“Oppenheimer’s post-war life is that he was in part horrified by what he had done,” Heefner says. “He was still involved in the U.S. military and the Atomic Energy Commission, which was the organization set up to manage the bomb and manage nuclear materials. … But he also was an advocate for international control of atomic energy, which was not as pie in the sky as it sounds.”
Oppenheimer hoped an international arms regulation could avert what he saw as a potential arms race. He was right, in a sense. The Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb in 1949, prompting the U.S. to start developing the more powerful hydrogen bomb, or “super bomb,” against the recommendations of Oppenheimer and members of the AEC.
Against his wishes, Oppenheimer’s creation completely altered post-war life and politics. The ability for global powers to develop tools of mass destruction changed geopolitics forever and created a sense of paranoia and fear that pervaded culture for decades.
“It was clearly destabilizing in the fact that it creates a certain hierarchy of power,” Heefner says. “Who has it? Who has the umbrella that lets you stay secure? Who says, ‘We’ll share it with you?’ It created strange alliances.”
But Heefner says Oppenheimer’s post-war efforts were not totally in vain––nuclear weapons are “highly regulated”––but they did cost him almost everything.
“Oppenheimer was opposed to it, and because of that he became a political football,” Heefner says. “He also was a contentious personality, so he didn’t do any of this smoothly. He was charged with being disloyal, possibly being a communist or Soviet sympathizer, which in this time period was incredibly damaging.”
A brilliant mind on a meteoric rise, a scientific breakthrough with world-shattering implications and a fall from grace due to convictions that flew in the face of the political powers that be: Oppenheimer’s life is full of enough material for several movies. Heefner can only speculate about Nolan’s interest in this story, but she says even decades later Oppenheimer, flaws and all, is a reminder of what scientists and forward thinkers can do for––and to––the world.
“Oppenheimer was a scientist, a big thinker and deeply compassionate,” she adds. “He was capable of remorse and reflection. He understood that his actions had consequences and was working for a greater good more than ego.”

,Doomsday Scenario: In Post-Production On Oppenheimer With Christopher Nolan,Empire meets Nolan in LA to talk about going nuclear.,"With apocalyptic atomic-bomb thriller Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan brings one of his enduring obsession to the screen. We meet the director in LA to talk about going nuclear.

Read an extract of our exclusive Oppenheimer feature from our July 2023 issue below, or see the full piece here.

We see the lower fifth of Christopher Nolan. The shoes. A bit of trouser. A small section of Christopher Nolan on the move, glimpsed through the bottom of a windowed wall, the rest blocked out by frosted glass, obscuring him until he’s ready.

He stops to talk to someone, but even then, despite hearing his voice, we can’t make out the words. So here we sit, waiting for him in a small conference room, seeing and hearing bits of him, unable to piece it all together. It’s enigmatic. It’s cryptic. It’s — dare we say — cinematic. And very Christopher Nolan. He just can’t help himself.

Yes, for a man who likes his films to pose questions rather than provide answers, who constructs them like puzzles, this all makes sense. It’s early May in the Los Angeles post-production facility where his films are taken to the finish line. In rooms and offices there is evidence of an impressive career — framed newspaper cuttings about The Prestige, various awards, an Inception poster, a Batpod maquette, framed cells from the Dark Night trilogy, and film cans containing reels from his latest opus, Oppenheimer, a bit of which he’s just played for Empire in a screening room so loud it felt like an earthquake. As it should — this is a film about the man responsible for the development of the atomic bomb. The footage is, we tell Nolan as he finally appears, unnerving. “I think ‘unnerving’ is definitely a good word to describe it!” he laughs.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtcGlyZW9ubGluZS5jb20vbW92aWVzL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2Rvb21zZGF5LXNjZW5hcmlvLWluLXBvc3QtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1vbi1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci13aXRoLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-24 12:07:15+05:30,"How Cillian Murphy became Robert Oppenheimer in 6 months for Christopher Nolan: Strict diet, read the Gita, ate only almonds","When the interviewer mentioned that they wanted to give Cillian Murphy a sandwich throughout Oppenheimer because he looked 'sickly', the actor laughed and said, 'I would have taken it.'","Actor Cillian Murphy felt the fizz on the sets of Oppenheimer, thanks to its talented cast and filmmaker Christopher Nolan at the helm of it. In the filmmaker’s latest historical drama, Murphy stars as theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, regarded as the father of the atom bomb.

In a video shared by the Twitter handle of Rotten Tomatoes, Murphy detailed how he got into the headspace of Oppenheimer, a complicated, divisive figure in the US. The actor said his approach is to do as much research as possible and there was a lot on Oppenheimer to dig into. He earlier said that he read the Bhagavad Gita, from which Oppenheimer quoted after the Trinty test, “I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”.

“There’s so much archival footage out there, which you can access. Obviously, I’ve read the book but for me the most important resource was the script. That’s what I really worked on. I had six months from when Chris called me unexpectedly to when we started shooting.”

The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J Sherwin. Oppenheimer, led by Cillian Murphy, is powered by a strong supporting cast which includes Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Florence Pugh.

Murphy said, despite all the reading and research, once on sets, it all becomes about the “moment”. On Oppenheimer, Murphy said the energy of the actors was “electric”, which could be felt.

“I think when you get on the floor with actors like these guys and Chris, you kind of just put that aside and it all becomes about the moment and the truth and the emotions between the actors and everyday it was a gift. I can’t give you one specific point, but there were many scenes in the film, like with Robert, Emily and Matt that were just electric. You could feel it fizzing at that point of time. It isn’t intellectual, it is instinctual and emotional,” he added.

When the interviewer mentioned that Murphy had lost so much weight for the role that he looked “sickly” in the film and they wanted to give him a sandwich throughout the movie, the actor laughed and said, “I would have taken it.”

Blunt said in New Mexico, the team would eat quesadillas, but Murphy would be in his room, eating almonds. Damon said the actor “declined” every dinner invitation for the entire filming duration. “We invited him every night, he never came once,” Damon added.

,Emily Blunt gave Christopher Nolan Uggs as an Oppenheimer wrap gift,Christopher Nolan revealed that Emily Blunt gave him a pair of Uggs as an 'Oppenheimer' wrap gift after he criticized her for wearing them on set.,"Emily Blunt has successfully converted Christopher Nolan to the dark side of footwear.

The director revealed this week that, after mercilessly criticizing Blunt for sporting Ugg boots on the set of his new drama Oppenheimer instead of her period-appropriate heels, he now gets their appeal.

""She gave me a pair of Uggs boots — Ugg slippers, actually — as a wrap gift,"" Nolan said on Friday's episode of The View. ""For people who have been on a set, people know how it works — we're there, losing the light, 'Okay, we need the actors to come in,' and sometimes they'll come straight from wardrobe, but they'll have these big coats on top and they'll be wearing these big Ugg boots, because the shoes of the character are uncomfortable. You know, 1940s shoes.""

Nolan explained that seeing Blunt show up wearing her Uggs ""used to drive me crazy"" during shooting. ""I'd immediately say to her, 'Can you please just get rid of the boots, put the shoes on, and get ready to go?'"" he recalled, before joking, ""And she got so sick of me saying that time after time, she thought I should join the cult of Ugg boots.""

These days, Nolan added, he considers the boots to be ""pretty comfortable.""

Blunt previously shared her side of the story in a recent USA Today interview, jokingly declaring that Nolan ""hates Uggs more than anyone"" else in the entire world.

""I've never known anyone to detest a pair of Uggs more than Chris Nolan,"" she said, calling it a ""testament"" to the director's intense desire for verisimilitude while filming. ""I would sometimes put on some Uggs and I'd just get this withering look down to my feet – it was like being in The Devil Wears Prada again. Just the look down to the shoes. And I'd go, 'I know, I know. But I'm just sitting on an apple box in the background today!'""

Naturally, Blunt had to send a pair his way. Afterward, she explained, she received a note from Nolan's wife, Emma Thomas, who wrote her to say, ""Brilliant wrap gift. He's wearing them now.""

""I was so pleased!"" Blunt recalled.

Oppenheimer also stars Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr. Based on the true story of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Murphy), the scientist who led the effort to create an atomic bomb during World War II, the movie is playing in theaters now.

,'The danger never goes away': Christopher Nolan didn't intend for Oppenheimer movie to be so timely,"Known as the father of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer changed the course of history. Now, director Christopher Nolan takes his story to the screen - but does the three-hour epic pull it off? Critics think so.","The world's first nuclear explosion happened on 16 July 1945, when a plutonium implosion device was tested in New Mexico.

Now a new film about the so-called father of the atomic bomb, J Robert Oppenheimer, looks at how he came to create a weapon that would change the world and how it changed him.

Decades since its invention, as Russia's war rages in Ukraine, the weapon's threat to the world is back in people's minds.

Director Christopher Nolan, who also wrote the movie, basing it on the Pulitzer Prize winning book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin, told Sky News he never meant for his film to be so timely.

""I had a conversation with one of my teenage sons about what I was working on and he literally said to me - 'Does anybody really worry about nuclear weapons anymore? Is that really a thing in the world?'

""To which I said, 'Well, maybe that's a reason for making the film but beyond that, it's just a very, very dramatic story about how our world changed forever'.

""Two years later, he's not asking that question anymore and neither is anybody else for all the worst possible reasons, and that's symptomatic of our relationship with the threat of nuclear weapons and nuclear holocaust - it ebbs and flows with geopolitical shifts in a way that it shouldn't - I mean, the danger never goes away.""

To inhabit the role of Oppenheimer, Peaky Blinders star Cillian Murphy lost weight and perfected a new accent and also had to learn about quantum physics and grapple with Oppenheimer's morality.

""Actors love getting jobs and then they're dying to finish them, that seems to be the way,"" Murphy told Sky News.

""So, yeah, it was time for a holiday after that for sure, if you do anything for like 17, 18 hours a day and you're in that and you're on set all the time, naturally there will be a cost and then you feel at the end there's all this displaced energy and you're not quite sure what to do with it, and you start moving furniture around.""

Nolan interjects: ""And have a sandwich"".

For the director, known for movies including Intersteller, Inception and Dunkirk - and who has a reputation for shunning digital effects and greenscreen - it wasn't recreating a nuclear explosion that posed a challenge.

Instead, he says he found the casting process daunting.

""The ensemble - with Cillian at the heart of it as Oppenheimer - but then his interactions with this entire team of people coming together to pull off this, you know, impossible feat, that was a challenge for me.

""Doing these group discussions, these arguments, these interpersonal relationships and all of that, all of which came into such a kind of hothouse atmosphere with the Manhattan Project and everything they had to do in the years that they were there.

""That was something I'd never really taken on before.""

The extremely positive early reviews for Oppenheimer suggest Nolan rose to that challenge.

But now, with promotion for the film interrupted by the US actor's strike, it remains to be seen whether audiences will have the appetite for a three-hour epic about the creation of the atomic bomb - the end of the world perhaps too close for comfort to be considered entertainment.

Oppenheimer, which also stars Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh and Robert Downey Jr, is released worldwide on Friday 21 July.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL25ld3Muc2t5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90aGUtZGFuZ2VyLW5ldmVyLWdvZXMtYXdheS1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1zYXlzLWhlLWRpZG50LWludGVuZC1mb3Itb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbW92aWUtdG8tYmUtc28tdGltZWx5LTEyOTIwOTAw0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L2FtcC90aGUtZGFuZ2VyLW5ldmVyLWdvZXMtYXdheS1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1zYXlzLWhlLWRpZG50LWludGVuZC1mb3Itb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbW92aWUtdG8tYmUtc28tdGltZWx5LTEyOTIwOTAw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-29 09:00:00+00:00,Christopher Nolan Movies Ranked from Worst to Best (Including Oppenheimer),"From Memento to Oppenheimer, and all the Dark Knights in between, we rank the works of one of modern cinema’s loudest voices, Christopher Nolan.","Released when Nolan was only 28, the movie is in many ways an experiment in themes and ideas that would color the rest of the writer-director’s filmography. Like most of Nolan’s early output, it’s a neo-noir picture about the self-destructive obsession of a flawed protagonist, who in this case cannot help but pursue his desire to follow strangers home. In a narrative unspooled via nonlinear storytelling, and shot on black-and-white 16mm film stock, we are invited to likewise follow a nameless and unemployed young man (Jeremy Theobald) as he walks behind strangers for fun. The lad’s vaguely Hitchcockian voyeurism becomes his undoing, though, after he is spotted spying on the criminal underworld. Viewed today, it’s not entirely polished, and the narrative strands more knot and jumble than weave and coalesce. Still, the compelling hook of Nolan’s penchant for unconventional structure and unreliable narrators was already in place.

11. Tenet (2020)

Contentiously released during the fall of 2020 at Nolan’s insistence, Tenet positioned itself as a savior of movie houses during the pandemic. This was, in retrospect, a tall order for what is Nolan’s most ambitious action movie, as well as his most remote and exasperatingly opaque. Reappraisals have already begun, with some arguing Tenet was the director attempting to see how far he could lead audiences down the path of esoteric “vibes”—there is the famous line “don’t try to understand it, feel it”—but we’d contend Tenet remains a bridge too far.

With the conventions of modern action cinema intentionally sketched at their thinnest and most utilitarian (John David Washington’s character is simply called “The Protagonist”), Tenet nonetheless presents a dizzyingly complex world and challenging sci-fi idea in which the entropy of objects and even people can be inverted—allowing most things to travel backward in time. Yet the execution is so needlessly obtuse, and the sound design intentionally confounding, that it doesn’t matter if you understand it; the main thing you’re feeling is frustration and annoyance. There are some dazzling action set pieces, and Hoyte van Hoytema’s cinematography and Ludwig Göransson’s score are sumptuous, but even after figuring out just how many Robert Pattinsons are running around at various stages of inversion, the movie remains little more than a stylish puzzle box that’s far too pleased with its configuration.

10. Insomnia (2002)

Very few directors on this side of the millennium have gotten Al Pacino to deliver a restrained and sharp performance that understands some lines can actually be underplayed to marvelous effect. Christopher Nolan is one of them thanks to his icy remake of a Norwegian film of the same name. Another excursion into neo-noir, Insomnia follows in the footsteps of many post-Se7en and Silence of the Lambs Hollywood murder procedurals, casting one movie star as the cop (Pacino) and the other as the killer (Robin Williams).

The cold-blooded cunning of Insomnia comes from the revelation that the killer is no genius, but rather a somewhat pathetic loner with a reptilian brain who, through a grim twist of luck, is able to blackmail his pursuer into becoming his accomplice. In hindsight, the film’s fascination with the duality between hero and villain was a warm-up act for The Dark Knight, but the restrained Insomnia is often more unsettling due to how calmly both actors are asked to essay their characters, with Williams making for an exceptionally soft-spoken demon, and Pacino for a compelling corrupt cop circling the drain. If the film was allowed to better breakaway from the conventions of these types of early 2000s movies, it might’ve been an actual classic instead of an absorbing, if less memorable, star vehicle from an era when studios would let stars appear in such fare.

9. Batman Begins (2005)

The placement of the Batman films on this list will undoubtedly be the most contentious thing for readers, but please understand we all think Batman Begins is a great piece of entertainment, as well as the finest superhero origin story ever produced. Told with what was at the time a shocking amount of gravitas and charm, Batman Begins recognized superhero movies as material worthy of serious cinematic consideration. Such a feat arguably had not been seen since Superman: The Movie (1978). Yet therein lies Batman Begins’ limitations.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbm9mZ2Vlay5jb20vbW92aWVzL2NocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLW1vdmllcy1yYW5rZWQtZnJvbS13b3JzdC10by1iZXN0LWluY2x1ZGluZy1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-29 16:19:30+00:00,"Barbenheimer: ‘Barbie’ Tracking for Beatific $70M- $80M Opening, Christopher Nolan’s ‘Oppenheimer’ Targets $40M",The two tentpoles open in North America over the July 21-23 weekend.,"In one of the most intriguing showdowns in recent times, filmmaker Greta Gerwig’s Barbie is tracking to open well ahead of Christopher Nolan‘s atomic bomb drama Oppenheimer. But the biggest winner could be theatrical if the two movies work over the long run.

The two July tentpoles — dubbed “Barbenheimer” on social media — officially came on tracking Thursday, three weeks ahead of their detonation in theaters over the July 21-23 weekend.

From Warner Bros., Barbie could open to a beatific $70 million to $80 million, if not more, according to sources who have access to tracking data (and there’s plenty of upside). Warners is being more cautious, suggesting $60 million. The movie, based on the iconic Mattel toy line of dolls, stars Margot Robbie in the titular role and Ryan Gosling as Ken.

A Barbie movie had languished in development for years before moving from Sony to Warners. But in recent weeks, the film has turned into a social media and marketing phenomenon (not to mention merchandising). And buzzy female-skewing titles can transform into box office summer bonanzas, such as Warners’ Sex and the City or Universal’s Mamma Mia! franchises. Barbie is skewing almost entirely female at this point, and particularly to females 35 and under.

Universal and Nolan’s Oppenheimer is tracking for a domestic debut in the $40 million range. For Oppenheimer — an R-rated, three-hour drama targeting adults — having legs could prove far more important than its opening weekend haul. Still, $40 million would mark one of the acclaimed filmmaker’s lowest openings. And excluding Tenet, which opened to $20 million during the heart of the pandemic, it would mark Nolan’s lowest start since The Prestige ($14.8 million) in 2006.

Nolan has come in No. 2 before; in 2014, Interstellar opened behind Disney’s Big Hero 6 with $47.5 million on its way to enjoying a long ride in theaters and grossing $701.7 million globally.

Oppenheimer stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, considered the father of the atom bomb, alongside an ensemble cast of A-listers including Emily Blunt and Matt Damon.

Paramount and Skydance open Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One on July 12 domestically, and the event pic will still be a formidable force when Oppenheimer and Barbie unfurl. (There’s even a scenario where Oppenheimer comes in third in its opening weekend behind Barbie and Mission: Impossible.)

The three tentpoles, along with this weekend’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, need to succeed if summer revenue is to make gains over 2022. On Thursday, Cruise urged his fans to support the theatrical experience by seeing Indy, Barbie and Oppenheimer (in addition to Mission, of course).",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9iYXJiaWUtYm94LW9mZmljZS10cmFja2luZy1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci0xMjM1NTI2MTcyL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9iYXJiaWUtYm94LW9mZmljZS10cmFja2luZy1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci0xMjM1NTI2MTcyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The cast of ""Oppenheimer"" has been on a seriously gushy media tour.

The movie has made more than $209 million since it came out on July 21, per Box Office Mojo. The cast members, for their part, have been on a media tour de force full of effusive praise and affection for each other.

Here's a sampling of cast members gushing about Cillian Murphy:

""I have never witnessed a greater sacrifice by a lead actor in my career,"" Robert Downey Jr. said of his costar Cillian Murphy in a People Magazine story published Sunday.

Emily Blunt, who plays the wife of Murphy's character in the movie, said she was wowed by the extreme diet Murphy underwent to resemble J. Robert Oppenheimer.

""He had such a monumental undertaking. And he could only eat, like, an almond every day. He was so emaciated,"" Blunt told Extra in an interview that aired July 7.

Blunt and Matt Damon have also talked about losing themselves in Murphy's piercing blue eyes while shooting.

""It's a real problem when you're doing scene work with Cillian,"" Damon told People Magazine in a story published Friday. ""Sometimes you find yourself just swimming in his eyes.""

""It's like that 'Ocean Eyes' song by Billie Eilish. We just hum it all day,"" Blunt said in the same interview.

Here's Murphy on Downey Jr.:

""I mean, acting with him was just extraordinary,"" Murphy told GQ magazine in a story published Monday. ""He's just electrifying, the most available, engaged, present, unpredictably brilliant actor I've ever worked with.""

Murphy on Florence Pugh:

Pugh and Murphy share a sex scene in the movie, something the film's director, Christopher Nolan, had never done before in his filmography.

""And I think when you see it, it's so fucking powerful. And they're not gratuitous. They're perfect. And Florence is just amazing,"" Murphy said of Pugh in an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, published July 19.

""She has this presence as a person and on screen that is staggering. The impact she has for the size of the role, it's quite devastating,"" Murphy said.

A-list marketing

While gushy media tours aren't new — ""A Star is Born,"" anyone? — this one stands out first because of the sheer quantity of comments and the competition it's up against.

I'm talking, of course, about the marketing behemoth that is Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie."" ""Barbie"" has been widely promoted with everything from Barbie-themed Xbox controllers to burgers numbering among the movie's many wall-to-wall marketing plays.

In fact, ""Barbie"" had a $150 million marketing budget, per Variety. That's bigger than the estimated $100 million it cost to make ""Oppenheimer.""

With competition like that, ""Oppenheimer"" needed to muster every ounce of marketing magic it had. Having the very famous and talented cast publicly declare their admiration for one another is a low-cost but effective way to promote ""Oppenheimer.""

And it looks like it's working. According to Deadline, the movie clocked the highest global day and date opening weekend ever for a biopic. ""Oppenheimer"" also bested ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" by netting the biggest opening weekend for an R-rated film in 2023, per Screen Rant.

2023-07-18 07:57:19+05:30,"Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer: A look at the scientist’s fascination with Hinduism, and why he quoted the Bhagavad Gita after the bomb was tested",Christopher Nolan's upcoming film has reawakened interest in nuclear physicist J Robert Oppenheimer's fascination with the Hindu religion.,"As fans in India excitedly wait for the release of Christopher Nolan‘s new film, Oppenheimer, many have revisited the famed nuclear physicist’s iconic reference to the Bhagavad Gita. J Robert Oppenheimer has often quoted from the sacred text, making the words synonymous with his achievements.

Oppenheimer’s research resulted in the creation of the first nuclear bombs. He immediately understood the gravity of what he had helped create, and has often said that the first words that ran through his mind after the bomb was successfully tested in the New Mexico desert in 1945 were from the Gita: “If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the Mighty One… I am become death, the shatterer of worlds.”

According to Time Magazine, Oppenheimer read the Gita for his ‘personal delight’ in the evenings, and sometimes to entertain friends. A copy of the sacred text, bound in pink and held together by scotch tape, was placed in his Princeton study. He took lessons in Sanskrit, his eighth language, from Professor Arthur W Ryder at Berkeley, and was particularly fond of the couplet, “Scholarship is less than sense, therefore seek intelligence.” According to his colleague, the Nobel Prize winner Isidor Rabi, Oppenheimer was ‘overeducated’ in fields that ‘lie outside the scientific tradition’, such as his interest in the Hindu religion. Rabi said, “He saw physics clearly, looking toward what had already been done, but at the border he tended to feel there was much more of the mysterious and novel than there actually was… [he turned] away from the hard, crude methods of theoretical physics into a mystical realm of broad intuition.”

A Time Magazine report published in 1948 recounted his story, and quoted Brigadier General Thomas F Farrell as describing Oppenheimer’s demeanour on the fateful day. “He grew tenser as the last seconds ticked off. He scarcely breathed. He held on to a post to steady himself . . . When the announcer shouted ‘Now!’ and there came this tremendous burst of light, followed … by the deep-growling roar of the explosion, his face relaxed into an expression of tremendous relief.”

Years later, he would still be impacted by the ethical complexities of creating a bomb capable of such destruction. Deployment of two atom bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki effectively brought World War 2 to an end. But the destruction caused by something that he had helped create confirmed Oppenheimer’s fears. He told fellow physicists, according to the obituary that the New York Times published on his death in 1967, that the bomb “dramatised so mercilessly the inhumanity and evil of modern war.” He added, “In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no overstatements can quite extinguish,” he went on, “the physicists have known sin; and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.”

In a news interview following the bombings on Japan, Oppenheimer once again recalled the emotions that were felt in the control room on the day of the test. “We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, ‘Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.’ I suppose we all thought that one way or another.”

He made an effort to regulate atomic energy by heading the Atomic Energy Commission’s General Advisory Committee of top nuclear scientists. He also served on the atomic committee of the Research and Development Board to advise the military.

The 1945 test will be featured prominently in the film Oppenheimer, as the trailers have shown. One of the most haunting images of the trailer shows Oppenheimer’s face lit up by the light of the explosion. The film will be released in theatres across the world on July 21, and advance booking for it began three weeks prior to release date. Although recent reports suggest that advance bookings were temporarily halted because the film received an A certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification.

About Oppenheimer

Oppenheimer is based on Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin's biography American Prometheus, based on the life of American theoretical physicist known as the ‘father of the atomic bomb.’ It stars Cillian Murphy in the titular role and the ensemble cast includes Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon and Florence Pugh.

Opening day box office prediction

As per a report by 123Telugu.com, Oppenheimer is set for a box office collection in the range of ₹10-15 crore on the day of its release in India. Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One had collected around ₹12.50 crore on its opening day in India, so it will be interesting to see whether Oppenheimer can outdo that.

The early sales of Oppenheimer began a week ago in India as the film's advance booking started 10 days ago. It received a tremendous response within the first very few hours. As per the figures posted by a film trade analyst, the film has already amassed 90,000 tickets across all three multiple chains - PVR, INOX and Cinepolis - for the opening day itself. These include IMAX screens as well.

Christopher Nolan on Oppenheimer

Christopher Nolan recently opened up on making Oppenheimer. “I just thought to take the audience there, to be there in that room with these people as they had to make these horrifying decisions that have defined the world we now live in... what a remarkable dramatic event to bring the audience to,” Nolan told Reuters.

On the other hand, Barbie, which has also commenced its advance booking, has shown a good start and has sold around 16,000 tickets across the three multiple chains for the opening day.

About Barbie

Barbie stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, along with a cast that includes names like America Ferrera, Simu Liu, Dua Lipa, Emerald Fennell, Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera and Will Ferrell.

“Oppenheimer” is Nolan’s first feature at Universal and a company-wide priority. A Comcast NBCUniversal Symphony title, the company leveraged the unequalled breadth of its portfolio in support of the film. The movie’s historical foundation made for a perfect partnership with NBC’s world class news division.

On July 15, Universal and Syncopy commemorated the anniversary of The Trinity Test with a screening in New York featuring a post-event conversation with filmmaker Christopher Nolan and some of the greatest scientific minds of our time including Dr. Thom Mason, Director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, world-renowned theoretical physicist Dr. Carlo Rovelli, the event's honorary chairmen: Nobel Prize winning theoretical physicist Dr. Kip Thorne, who served as a consultant on the film, and Pulitzer Prize winner Kai Bird, co-author of the book “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” the basis for Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” screenplay. Chuck Todd, the Emmy-winning host of NBC's “Meet the Press,” moderated the conversation which also aired on NBC.

On MSNBC, “Morning Joe” co-host Joe Scarborough sat down for an exclusive interview with “Oppenheimer” writer/director Christopher Nolan and stars Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr. to discuss the making of the film, which Scarborough described as “breathtaking” and “unlike anything I've ever seen.” The cast opened up about bringing their complex characters to life, shooting on location, the magic of big screen, and more.

Here's the truth,"Speculation has arisen over a potential ban on Christopher Nolan's film ""Oppenheimer"" in Japan due to sensitivities surrounding nuclear warfare | Hollywood","As the highly anticipated release of Christopher Nolan's epic film, ""Oppenheimer,"" draws near, speculations have emerged about a potential ban on the movie in Japan. ""Oppenheimer"" delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist behind the creation of the first nuclear bomb during the Manhattan Project. This image released by Universal Pictures shows Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock, left, and Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer in a scene from ""Oppenheimer."" (AP)

The use of nuclear weaponry in the Pacific War resulted in devastating consequences for Japan, with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki causing the loss of approximately 200,000 lives, mostly civilians. However, recent reports debunk the ban rumors, indicating that the film's release plans are still in progress for various markets, including Japan.

Japanese Cinema's Savvy Approach

While ""Oppenheimer"" gears up for its global release, the Japanese market is known for its prudent approach to blockbuster films. Hollywood releases often arrive later in Japan than in other countries, giving the industry a chance to gauge the movie's performance and popularity worldwide before determining its local release strategy. If ""Oppenheimer"" proves successful elsewhere, Japan may opt for a widespread launch; otherwise, a limited release could be considered.

Unfounded Sensitivities

Speculation arose that ""Oppenheimer"" might be too sensitive for Japanese audiences due to the tragic events of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, a glance through Japan's cinematic history reveals a liberal approach to artistic expression. The industry has embraced various genres and styles, including horror, samurai, and high-school themed dramas. Moreover, since the 1950s, film censorship in Japan has largely focused on explicit imagery rather than political or militaristic issues.

A Gripping Tale Leaving Audiences Devastated

As the film premiered in several locations, viewers have been deeply moved by the intense story it portrays. Some even described it as akin to a horror movie. Kai Bird, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and co-author of the book that inspired the film, expressed being stunned and emotionally affected by “Oppenheimer.”

Christopher Nolan himself proclaimed J. Robert Oppenheimer as one of the most significant figures in history, shaping the world we live in today, both for better and worse.

Awaiting ""Oppenheimer's"" Unveiling in Japan

The delays are not uncommon, and the industry's pragmatic approach could lead to a decision based on the film's global success. Despite the historical sensitivities surrounding nuclear warfare, Japan's cinematic landscape has shown resilience and artistic freedom over the years, making it a compelling territory for ""Oppenheimer"" to explore.

Is Oppenheimer in Japan is same as Barbie in Vietnam?

Coincidentally, another film, Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie,"" has faced its own challenges in Vietnam, where it was banned over a scene depicting the contentious ""nine-dash line,"" representing China's territorial claims in the South China Sea. In response, Warner Bros clarified that the scene was intended to be a child-like crayon drawing within the context of “Barbie's make-believe journey from Barbie Land.”

2023-08-03 12:02:10.343000+00:00,Oppenheimer Fans Spot Disturbing Detail That Hints at a Horrifying Conspiracy,Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer features a horrifying detail that hints towards a decades-old conspiracy.,"Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer.

A disturbing detail in Oppenheimer seems to hint at a larger conspiracy... and it sees director Christopher Nolan in true ""horror mode.""

During a harrowing sequence of quick shots, the death of Jean Tatlock is shown as she seemingly drowns herself in the bath. However, a pair of black-gloved hands hints that all is not as it seems.

“One thing in Oppenheimer I haven't been able to get out of my head is that brief insert of black gloves in that one flashback with Florence Pugh,” said film fan Josh Lewis on Twitter. “Nolan was really in his horror mode.”

One thing in Oppenheimer I haven't been able to get out of my head is that brief insert of black gloves in that one flashback with Florence Pugh. Nolan was really in his horror mode. — Josh Lewis (@thejoshl) July 23, 2023

He’s not the first to notice the gloved hands, and the scene seems to suggest that Tatlock’s death wasn’t suicide at all. Tatlock is played by Florence Pugh and features throughout the movie as Oppenheimer’s lover who continued to have a relationship with the scientist while he was married to his wife, Kitty (played by Emily Blunt).

Not only frowned upon due to the illicit nature of their relationship, Tatlock was also a keen member of the Communist party and was seen by many to be a security risk. Tatlock’s fate is teased throughout the film, with a flashback eventually revealing she supposedly drowned herself in the bathtub.

Of course, the gloved hands suggest otherwise, and fans have since been debating its meaning. Some believe the scene is a manifestation of Oppenheimer’s guilt and the gloved hands are meant to represent Oppenheimer blaming himself for her death.

The horrifying blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment is the closest Nolan comes to horror in Oppenheimer. However, it also teases a decades-old conspiracy. Following her death, an autopsy determined her cause of death as death by drowning, however, a “faint trace” of chloral hydrate was found in her system, a substance capable of sedating a person.

According to the book American Prometheus, on which Oppenheimer is based, at least one physician had doubts about her cause of death, speculating she may have been drugged and forcibly drowned. “If you were clever and wanted to kill someone, this is the way to do it,” said one doctor.

This subsequently led to speculation by historians, as well as Tatlock’s own brother, that she may have been killed by U.S. Government officials due to her affiliation to the Communist party, coupled with her closeness to one of the Manhattan Project’s key players.

“I do not believe that her interests were really political,” Oppenheimer told The United States Atomic Energy Commission in 1954. “She was a person of deep religious feeling. She loved this country, its people, and its life.”

Nevertheless, it looks as though Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan may have been convinced enough to tease that her death wasn’t a suicide at all.

IGN’s Oppenheimer review gave it 10/10 and said: “A biopic in constant free fall, Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s most abstract yet most exacting work, with themes of guilt writ large through apocalyptic IMAX nightmares that grow both more enormous and more intimate as time ticks on. A disturbing, mesmerizing vision of what humanity is capable of bringing upon itself, both through its innovation, and through its capacity to justify any atrocity.”

2023-07-24 21:00:08+00:00,Will ‘Oppenheimer’ be the ticket to Christopher Nolan’s elusive first Oscar?,"The filmmaker has been nominated five times over the last 22 years, but he has yet to win.","It’s been more than two decades since filmmaker Christopher Nolan‘s first Oscar nomination, but he’s still waiting for his first victory. Will “Oppenheimer” be the film that finally nabs him the gold?

The first of Nolan’s five career nominations to date came 22 years ago. It was Best Original Screenplay for his and Jonathan Nolan‘s tricky, innovative script for “Memento,” a 2001 thriller about a man with short-term memory loss that was told in reverse order. That indie film led to bigger projects, including the “Batman” trilogy that marked his breakthrough in blockbuster filmmaking. The second of those, “The Dark Knight” (2008), was touted for potential Oscars and indeed received eight of them, but Nolan himself was snubbed entirely: no Best Picture, no Best Director, and no Best Adapted Screenplay.

He got his elusive first Best Picture nom for the sci-fi epic “Inception” (2010), for which he was also nominated for writing. But again, no Best Director bid. That would wait a few more years, finally coming for his 2017 war film “Dunkirk”; Nolan received Picture and Director bids for that one. Which brings us to “Oppenheimer.” On paper it’s Oscars catnip: a biopic (check) about an important historical figure (check) set during World War II (check) and featuring a highly pedigreed cast and crew (check). But will that translate to actual awards?

As of this writing the film ranks second in our odds for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, all of which would go to Nolan as producer, director, and writer of the film. If the odds hold true and he receives those nominations, it would be his first time contending in all three fields at the same time. Unfortunately for Nolan, though, for the moment he’s stuck behind Martin Scorsese‘s “Killers of the Flower Moon” in all three categories. “Flower Moon” has already screened at the Cannes Film Festival to rapturous reviews, so it might be tough for “Oppenheimer” to catch. But the story of Oscars is never fully written as early as July, so Nolan’s overdue narrative may yet boost him towards the winner’s circle.

2023-07-27 18:21:40+00:00,Matthew Modine On Working With Christopher Nolan: “He’s Like An Orchestra Conductor”,"Movie interview, Matthew Modine: The actor talks about filming Oppenheimer, Stranger Things, and his recent documentary on the atomic tests.","This interview was conducted before the current SAG-AFTRA strike. It has been edited for length and clarity.

Although Matthew Modine has been making his way through the Hollywood ranks since the early ‘80s, the actor has found himself in a new position of prominence thanks to Stranger Things. Since portraying the complicated and devious Dr. Brenner in the first season of the Netflix series in 2016, Modine has become even more of a household name. The role earned him a SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series and his character’s return last year made waves amongst fans. But Modine has a lot more on his plate. Recently he’s produced and filmed several movies, narrated a documentary (Accidental Truth, about UFOs), and performed onstage in London’s West End. He’s also part of the star-studded cast of Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s new blockbuster about the origin of the atomic bomb.

In Oppenheimer, Modine plays Vannevar Bush, a real-life historical figure who headed the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development during World War II. Bush was involved in many of the discussions about the atomic bomb, including which Japanese cities to target. Modine describes filming the scenes where some guys decide the fate of the world as almost absurd.

“The idea that there was this small group of men sitting in a room, old white men, who arbitrarily make a decision in that moment of going from one bomb to two bombs is incredible,” the actor tells Observer. “That a decision as powerful and as dangerous and as deadly as that could be made in a room—it’s beyond my comprehension and my belief that that’s how decisions are made. But it’s historically correct of what would happen in that room.”

Oppenheimer, which marks Modine’s second collaboration with Nolan, is one of two projects Modine is involved with which reflect on humanity’s obsession with nuclear weapons. His recent documentary Downwind, which Modine executive produced, examines the real-world impact of the nuclear tests in America. The actor made both films in between shooting the upcoming thriller Retribution with Liam Neeson and true life drama Hard Miles, as well as writing and directing a short film, I Am What You Imagine, which will premiere in film festivals this fall.

Here Modine speaks to Observer about making Oppenheimer, why humanity is in dire straits, and how Stranger Things has changed Hollywood.

What drew you to this project?

Film, for good and bad, is a powerful tool of influence. You can make films that glorify combat and war and make it romantic—what I call war pornography. Or you can make a film like All Quiet on the Western Front that shows you how ugly and horrible it is. That there’s nothing that’s sexy or romantic about it. It’s an ugly, horrible solution to people who hold different views. So with Oppenheimer I said yes right away. There’s a scene where [Vannevar] Bush is speaking during Oppenheimer’s trial and he says he’s expressed an opinion that was unpopular and that if we’re going to destroy people’s lives because they express an opinion that is unpopular, then you should start with me because I’ve expressed an unpopular opinion.

In the time we’re living in, especially with social media and the way that people are so quickly crucified for expressing an opinion that somebody might find contrary, that doesn’t bode well or speak well of humanity and civilization. We have to be able to discuss our differences and, more importantly, to hold a different opinion. That’s how we evolve. We’re living in a really, really volatile time with these really, really powerful weapons of war.

The massive cast was probably also a draw.

Just to get a sense of Christopher Nolan, when I asked him about participating, he said, “We’re casting a bunch of unknowns. The only person that you know is Cillian [Murphy], who’s playing Oppenheimer.” I knew Cillian and hadn’t worked with him, but we were in the same movie, The Dark Knight Rises. He’s a wonderful actor. And then you get closer to going to work and all of the unknowns are people that you’ve known or worked with or people you admire, from Kenneth Branagh to Robert Downey Jr. to Matt Damon. I mean, it was ridiculous. But that’s a testament to Emma [Thomas], Christopher’s wife, and Christopher. They’re such lovely people. They’re so kind and smart and obviously great filmmakers that these are folks people want to work with.

So were you cast because you had worked with Christopher previously?

I hope so! He’s like an orchestra conductor. Christopher is always on the set, he’s always standing beside the camera. He’s there in the scene with you when you’re doing it. What generally happens today is the director’s in another room watching on a television monitor, but because he’s in the room you can feel his encouragement. The same way that a conductor stands in front of an orchestra and raises his hand and opens his palm and says, “A little bit softer, a little bit louder.” Christopher conducts when on his set and it’s something that I really appreciate.

And as a cellist or a violin player or percussionist, it’s your responsibility to learn the song. You have to learn the role and show with all of your knowledge of how to play that piece because you’re part of a big orchestra. It’s not Christopher Nolan’s responsibility or job to teach you to do your part. That’s why he hires you. It’s why those actors come to work because they do all of their homework and their research. They show up and Christopher conducts them.

How long ago did you shoot Oppenheimer?

I’m very bad with dates. I saw a five-year calendar on someone’s wall once and it was just a bunch of boxes. And in the boxes, he had ticked off what he was going to do in six months time and a year and two years and three years. What was astonishing to me was how few boxes five years represented. What it looked like. From that point, I took my watch off and I tossed the calendar and I said, “I just don’t want to measure my life by a calendar or clock.” But I want to say it was about a year ago—it was pretty fast.

In general, why does it feel important for you to be part of the conversation about nuclear weapons?

Nuclear bombs and nuclear energy are a temporary solution to a permanent problem. As long as human beings use violence and war to solve our problems we are the stupidest primate. There are eight billion people on the planet consuming the Earth’s resources at an unsustainable pace. We are about to experience the largest migration of climate refugees in the history of the planet. I picked up a book in England, which I encourage you to read, called The Long View. The problem with the world is the political systems and the economic systems are all designed for the short view. To address the environmental problems that we have, it demands a long view. You can’t look at it in four year cycles, you can’t look at it in quarterly cycles. It demands that we look at the systems where the tree that you and I plant today, we will never enjoy the shade of that tree. You plant that tree for your grandchildren. And that’s what’s missing from the human race today is that ability to see the long view.

The film Downwind, which is also about nuclear bombs, reflects on that. I grew up in Utah. My family—my father, my uncle and my grandfather and my grandmother—they all lived out in the desert in a place called China Ranch in Death Valley. They all died with cancer. They were all downwind of the almost one thousand bombs that were tested in the Nevada desert. They were downwind of the radiation that was falling depending on which way the wind was blowing. I was watching the news once and I saw my brother Maury being arrested and he said what I consider one of most significant things about atomic bomb testing: We know they work, so why did we have to test almost one thousand bombs on American soil?

Did you film Retribution before or after Oppenheimer?

Right before. Liam Neeson and I have been friends for almost three decades and we’ve always wanted to work together. There’s been some plays that we were going to try to do on Broadway.

The director of Retribution, Nimród [Antal], was directing two episodes of Stranger Things. One day, he said, “Come on, they’re ready for us on the set. So we’re going to walk through it together.” I said, “I’ll walk with you if you give me a job in the Liam Neeson movie you’re directing.” He laughed and I laughed. About an hour later, he showed me his phone and had a text message from his producer saying, “We think it’s a great idea.”

It’s a good lesson in asking for what you want.

I would have never done it before because it sounds like such an ass-holic thing to do. That’s a word I learned from Christopher Nolan—I have to give credit where credit’s due.

How has Stranger Things impacted your career?

I think it’s changed the entire entertainment industry. When I began, one of the most famous films I was in was Full Metal Jacket, a very powerful anti-war film. If Full Metal Jacket was successful in 60 territories around the world that was an unbelievable success. Netflix is in over 190 territories around the world, bringing entertainment right into people’s homes. So the kind of success that you can experience today from a streaming service like Netflix or Hulu is something that’s never existed in the history of the entertainment industry.

Have we seen the last of Dr. Brenner?

I hope not! It has been announced now they’re doing the origin story on stage. The producer of a play that I did, To Kill a Mockingbird, in London, Sonia Friedman Productions, is doing an origin story of Stranger Things. I think the whole scenario is about the origin of Dr. Brenner and the children.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvbWF0dGhldy1tb2RpbmUtb24td29ya2luZy13aXRoLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLWhlcy1saWtlLWFuLW9yY2hlc3RyYS1jb25kdWN0b3Iv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

After five frames, the epic is expected to reach $718M with tomorrow’s numbers included. That will make it Nolan’s 4th highest-grossing film ever worldwide, overtaking Interstellar. It will also move into the No. 4 spot on the global chart for 2023 so far.

The international box office cume through tomorrow is projected at $432M after a $31.8M fifth session. Oppenheimer is the biggest Nolan film of all time at the international box office when restated to today’s dollars and excluding un-released markets.

For the year so far, the Cillian Murphy-starrer is the No. 3 movie overseas, excluding China where it releases on August 30. As previously noted, this is Nolan’s highest-grossing movie in 50 markets, and now his top non-superhero title in 63.

The Top 5 markets through Friday are the UK ($62.1M), Germany ($38.1M), France ($30.4M), Australia ($22.1M) and Spain ($17.8M). Also notable, Korea is seeing a big opening weekend with $10.4M through today.

We’ll have a full update on Sunday.

PREVIOUS UPDATE, August 10: With today’s business, Christopher Nolan’s epic Oppenheimer will hit yet another benchmark, crossing $600M at the global box office. The latest milestone comes just 23 days into release.

2023-07-12 17:00:00+00:00,What Cameras Did Christopher Nolan Use on 'Oppenheimer'?,"When Nolan makes a movie, we sit and watch in awe.","Christopher Nolan is a name that drives us to the theaters in droves. He's a filmmaker whose point of view is unlike anyone else working today. His comprehension of scope and scale is unparalleled and when he announced he would be tackling the story of Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb, I became very excited.

So how did Nolan turn an Oppenheimer movie of this scale into reality? What cameras did he use to capture this story?

This article delves into Nolan's innovative techniques, the use of IMAX film cameras, and his collaboration with Special Effects Supervisor Scott R. Fisher and Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema.

We'll take you through everything we know about the movie and Nolan's process.

Let's get started.

Oppenheimer | Shooting For IMAX youtu.be

Nolan's Groundbreaking Approach

In Oppenheimer, Nolan has once again chosen his favored approach of practical effects over computer-generated imagery (CGI). ""I think recreating the Trinity test [the first nuclear weapon detonation, in New Mexico] without the use of computer graphics, was a huge challenge to take on,"" explains Nolan to Total Film. ""Andrew Jackson–my visual effects supervisor, I got him on board early on–was looking at how we could do a lot of the visual elements of the film practically, from representing quantum dynamics and quantum physics to the Trinity test itself, to recreating, with my team, Los Alamos up on a mesa in New Mexico in extraordinary weather, a lot of which was needed for the film, in terms of the very harsh conditions out there–there were huge practical challenges.""

For a crucial scene depicting the detonation of an atomic bomb, Nolan's team managed to recreate the effect practically, without resorting to CGI. This commitment to realism was evident in his creation of the atomic bomb detonation scene.

""I find CG rarely is able to grab you,"" Nolan revealed in an interview with Empire. ""It tends to feel safe. Even if it's impressive and beautiful, it's difficult to make you feel danger. And we were presenting the ultimate danger. We needed it to feel threatening, nasty, and frightening to the audience.""

Special Effects: A Practical Approach

The special effects team, led by Scott R. Fisher, had their work cut out for them. One of the most significant challenges was recreating the Trinity Test, the world's first-ever atomic explosion. Fisher and his team used forced perspective, an age-old Hollywood trick, to achieve this.

""We don't call them miniatures; we call them 'big-atures,'"" Fisher explained. ""We do them as big as we possibly can, but we do reduce the scale so it's manageable. It's getting it closer to the camera, and doing it as big as you can in the environment.""

The pyrotechnic aspect was a combination of gasoline and propane, with aluminum powder and magnesium added to mimic the blinding flash of a nuclear blast. The goal was to replicate the brightness, causing an intense discussion about the flash.

How Do You Shoot This Stuff?

Our very own Alyssa Miller wrote a breakdown of the cameras Nolan used for these explosive shots. Cinematographers relied on two basic types of cameras for their high-speed work.

The pin-registered cameras, which are the most common of the two, have a superior image quality but have a limiting frame rate. The 16mm Photo-Sonics Actionmaster 500 is limited to a maximum frame rate of 500 fps, while the 35mm-4ER Photo-Sonics camera is limited to a max of 360 fps.

Rumor has it that one of the cameras Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema attempted to use was a Photo-Sonics 35mm 4C high-speed rotary prism camera, which is capable of 2,500 frames per second. If a shot requires a faster camera, then creatives must rely on a rotary prism camera. The Photo-Sonics 16mm E10 is one such camera that can capture up to 10,000 fps while still using film, making it a great solution for slowing down motion to a near standstill.

Unfortunately, the camera is unable to capture great footage at such a high rate for a feature film. Instead, sources tell NFS that the cameras used on Oppenheimer maxed out at 150 fps. The pyro work on the film was done at a substantial scale due to the limits of in-camera magic. There was some post-manipulation of some shots, but there seem to hardly be VFX effects done to emphasize the greatness and magnitude of the explosion. Then again, this could be another situation like the VFX shots in Top Gun: Maverick.

Harnessing the Power of IMAX

Oppenheimer is filmed in a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film photography including, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX black and white analogue photography. This decision was rooted in Nolan's love for the format. He believes that IMAX offers a level of immersion unmatched by other formats. This choice posed its unique challenges, given the bulkiness and heaviness of the IMAX MSM 9802 camera.

Still, these hurdles did not deter Hoyte Van Hoytema, the film's cinematographer, who was determined to use the IMAX cameras in all modes, even carrying them on his shoulders. He aimed to transform the IMAX from a format known for grand vistas to a more intimate medium, capturing the complex landscape of human faces.

Shooting faces with IMAX cameras presented a unique challenge. The large-format IMAX cameras capture a level of detail that makes it difficult to shoot faces without revealing every minor detail. However, Hoytema and Nolan were unafraid of this complication, instead using it to their advantage to capture a series of intimate, portrait-style shots.

One of the unique elements of Oppenheimer was its combination of color and black and white, an approach that required Nolan and his team to create their own 65mm black and white film. This new format was tested on a giant IMAX screen, and the results were Nolan approved.

Summing Up A Behind-The-Scenes Look at Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer

Oppenheimer is a testament to Nolan's innovative approach to filmmaking, pushing the boundaries of cinematic storytelling. With its immersive use of IMAX cameras and practical special effects, the film promises to offer audiences a unique movie-going experience.

Christopher Nolan's reputation as a visionary director continues as he pushes the boundaries of what we can expect from cinema.

Otherwise, Nolan's screenplay for Oppenheimer is also up for preorder at $16.16 (down from $17.99) and will release on August 1.

The dual-opening of Greta Gerwig's Barbie and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer on July 21 prompted people to buy tickets to both movies to watch as a double feature, smashing box office records and sparking a bumper weekend for cinema in the process.

Critically, both films are thriving. We called Barbie a ""masterful exploration of feminity and the pressures of perfection,"" in our 9/10 review, and Oppenheimer we dubbed ""Christopher Nolan's most abstract yet most exacting work"" with a 10/10 score. These Barbenheimer t-shirts also seem to be doing the rounds on social media as well, if you want to look the part when attending your double feature.

Cineplex Inc. says it saw its highest July box office of all time as Barbie and Oppenheimer sent droves to theatres last month.

The Toronto-based cinema chain says the record month surpassed $86 million in net box office revenues.

July also delivered the company its second-highest month on record, trailing December 2015, when Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens was released.

Cineplex attributed much of the month’s lift to “Barbie,” which generated the highest July attendance at its theatres, followed by Oppenheimer and Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.

Altogether the company says 6.8 million moviegoers visited its theatres last month and Cineplex also scored its second-highest monthly premium box office revenue of all time.

Com lançamento marcado para 20 de julho nos cinemas brasileiros, o longa do cineasta Christopher Nolan narra a vida e os feitos do físico Robert Oppenheimer, grande mente por trás da criação da bomba atômica.

No filme de Nolan, Murphy (47 anos) dá vida a Oppenheimer e Pugh (27 anos) interpreta a primeira noiva do cientista, a psiquiatra Jean Tatlock. Na entrevista ao diário inglês The Guardian na qual falou sobre suas cenas de nudez com a colega, o ator também disse que os dois passaram por um “teste de química”, tendo sua interação avaliada pelos produtores do filme.

Na entrevista ao The Guardian, Murphy disse que o aspecto romântico da história de ‘Oppenheimer’ “é um dos mais intensos"" já feitos por ele. Depois a reportagem do jornal fala em “cenas prolongadas de nudez frontal” do ator com Pugh, ""além de cenas de sexo e cenas complicadas com Emily Blunt, intérprete de sua esposa”.

Murphy classificou as cenas com Blunt como “muito pesadas”. No entanto ele disse que recebeu “instruções enfáticas para não entregar nada do filme”.

Sobre seus “testes de química” com suas colegas de elenco, o ator explicou: “Eles colocam dois atores em uma sala para ver se existe alguma química, com os produtores e o diretor em uma mesa nos assistindo. Não sei qual é a métrica deles e parece algo extremamente bobo, mas às vezes essa química acontece e ninguém consegue explicar”.

,TCL Q6 Review: Best Overall,"It's bright, affordable, looks great, and is easy to mount and use. What's not to like?","A good TV should never disappoint you. Whether you’re tuning in for a big game, racing losers online, or just streaming a show in the background, the picture should be clear and the content should be easy to access.

TCL’s latest mid-tier hero to accomplish this task is the Q6 (a replacement of sorts for last year’s 5-Series). It’s a solid TV in every way that matters, right down to its new Google operating system. Casting movies, photos, and apps from your phone to your screen is easier than ever, and you’ll still find nearly the same ease of use as you used to on the older Roku models.

As always, this is one of the best TVs for most people, especially if you don’t need the faster refresh rate of higher-end models for gaming. You can even choose between two positions for the TV’s included legs, which means it can fit on older, more svelte TV stands.

Same Old TCL

Besides a new remote that pairs with the new Google operating system (this one is more pill-shaped and longer), there isn’t much that tells you you’re looking at the latest era of TCL. The TV is still about 2 inches thick and thus easy to mount, and it still has super thin bezels on each side.

The biggest change is the aforementioned legs, which are nicer in the center position, though I’d still prefer a pedestal mount or to wall mount this TV if I bought it. It can be hard to fit a soundbar between the thinner leg sections (yes, you should have a soundbar).

Setup takes no time. Just sign in with Google and download every app that you’re interested in. There isn’t much that this doesn’t have. The one app I couldn’t find that I regularly use was F1 TV, but even that has Google Chromecast integration, so I was able to stream it from my computer or phone to the TV with ease.

The built-in Chromecast functionality finally puts TCL on par with fellow mid-tier TV brand Vizio with its Smartcast interface. It can’t be overstated how nice it is to quickly pull up stuff on a phone to watch it on TV, especially if you have friends and family over. All they need to do to cast to your TV is to connect to your Wi-Fi.

The downside of the new OS is that it can be a bit sluggish. I frequently found myself waiting for it to respond between app changes, occasionally making me a little confused whether I’d actually clicked on an app or was waiting for it to load.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9yZXZpZXcvdGNsLXE2LTIwMjMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Jetzt kommt der Blockbuster auf DVD und Blu-ray: Unsere Autorin findet, der Film sei zu männerdominiert.","Oppenheimer – ein Name, um den man in den letzten Wochen digital und analog nicht herumgekommen ist. Es ist der Name des Physikers Julius Robert Oppenheimer, besonders ist es aber der Titel des neuen Films des Starregisseurs Christopher Nolan. Ein hochkarätig besetzter Blockbuster.



Im Netz, auf der Straße und natürlich in den Kinos wurde der Film beworben. Als er dann endlich am 20. Juli in die Kinos kam, spielte auch noch das Wetter mit: der Regen spülte die Massen geradewegs in die Kinosäle.

So ging auch ich mit meiner Familie an einem düsteren Sonntagnachmittag ins Thalia in Potsdam. Es war das Versprechen, meine Geschwister, die sich sonst noch in den Schulferien gelangweilt hätten, ganze drei Stunden gut unterhalten zu lassen.



Wir wurden auch nicht enttäuscht. Der Sound fegte uns geradewegs von den Sesseln und unsere Augen konnten gar nicht weit genug geöffnet sein, um all die Farb-, Bild- und eben Bombenexplosionen sehen zu können. Und um Bomben geht es in dem Film ja schließlich.

Oppenheimer als „einzigartiges Genie“

Es ist die dramatisch erzählte Geschichte, wie der Physik-Nerd Oppenheimer zu einem politischen Akteur wurde. Er wurde während des Zweiten Weltkriegs Leiter des Manhattan-Projektes vom US-amerikanischen Militär, das an der Entwicklung einer Atombombe arbeitete. 1945 explodierte schließlich die erste Atombombe als Testversuch in der Wüste New Mexicos und kurz darauf in Hiroshima und Nagasaki. Ein einschneidendes historisches Ereignis in der Menschheitsgeschichte. Seine Erfindung hat eine neue Welt ermöglicht. So der Film.

Die Realität erzählt da noch etwas anderes. Während die Figur Oppenheimer mit stilistischen und narrativen Mitteln zum einzigartigen Genie stilisiert wird, das sich mit seinem „Mind-Palast“ (bekannt aus der Serie Sherlock) Dinge vorstellen kann, die Normalsterbliche nicht mal nach Erklärung verstehen, trat der reale Oppenheimer mit seinen physikalischen Erkenntnissen nur in eine Reihe von genialen Köpfen.



Manche davon finden auch in dem Film Erwähnung, wie beispielsweise Niels Bohr und Werner Heisenberg. Ein Name fällt in dem dreistündigen Spektakel an Emotion und physikalischen Ereignissen nicht. Es ist der Name einer gewissen Lise Meitner.

Wer war Lise Meitner?

Lise Meitner TT/imago

In einem hat der Film mit seiner Erzählung recht: Frauen hatten es in den 1940er-Jahren mit starrköpfigen Männern zu tun, die sich fragten, ob Menschen des weiblichen Geschlechts überhaupt in der Lage waren, logisch zu denken (so muss General Leslie Groves im Film direkt die Kompetenz einer Frau anzweifeln, die hinter der Schreibmaschine sitzt).

Doch tut der Film Lise Meitner Unrecht an, sie nicht einmal zu erwähnen. Sie war keine Geringere, als diejenige, die die erste wissenschaftliche Erklärung des Zerfalls von Uran-Atomkernen unter Neutronenbeschuss lieferte. Zusammen mit Otto Hahn hatte sie die Atomkernspaltung entdeckt. 1939 war sie diejenige, die die Kernspaltung richtig deutete.

Ohne ihre Forschungsergebnisse wäre Oppenheimers Forschung und das Manhattan-Projekt gar nicht möglich gewesen. Heute schätzt das Deutsche Patent- und Markenamt es als eins der größten Versäumnisse, dass Meitner keinen Nobelpreis erhalten hat. Die Möglichkeit dazu hätte bestanden – ganze 48-mal, denn so oft wurde sie von Kolleg:innen nominiert.



Diese Nominierungen sind Zeugnis dafür, dass sie und ihre Arbeit sehr wohl auch schon zu ihren Lebzeiten von Fachleuten gesehen, anerkannt und geschätzt wurde. Dass sie aber nie den Preis erhielt, ist Zeugnis für die politische Gesinnung ihrer Lebzeit.



Als Frau, als Jüdin und als Pazifistin musste sie schon 1938 aus Berlin fliehen, nachdem ihr die Arbeit an der Universität verboten wurde. Doch sie blieb im engen Kontakt mit ihren Kolleg:innen und forschte im Exil weiter.

Meitner bleibt unerwähnt

Es ist als eines der größten Versäumnisse des Films einzuschätzen, Lise Meitner keine Sekunde in den 180 Minuten Wissenschaftsgeschichte zu widmen. Es stellt sich die Frage, warum sich das Produktionsteam von Christopher Nolan dafür entschieden hat. Dass sie nicht auf Lise Meitner gestoßen sind, kann nicht sein. Dagegen spricht die sonst sorgsam recherchierten und dargestellten Ereignisse der Vergangenheit von Oppenheimer.

Zudem kann man sich nicht mit Kernenergie auseinandersetzen, ohne auf ihren Namen zu stoßen. Bekommt sie vielleicht keine Figur, weil sie mutiger als Oppenheimer war? Auch sie soll 1943 für das Manhattan-Projekt eingeladen worden sein, lehnte allerdings diese Einladung ab, da die Forschung an einer Massenvernichtungswaffe ihren moralischen und ethischen Vorstellungen widersprach. Würde sie mit dieser mutigen Entscheidung vielleicht der Figur des Genies Oppenheimer schaden?



Es ist aber vielmehr anzunehmen, dass der Hauptgrund darin liegt, wie sich die Menschheit die Vergangenheit seit Jahrhunderten erzählt: Als eine Zeit, die nur von Männern geprägt wurde.

Wenn wir heute an die vergangenen Jahrhunderte denken, stellen wir uns vor, dass Frauen unterdrückt und ausgebeutet waren. Dass ihre Handlungsorte die drei „Ks“ waren – Küche, Kinder, Kirche. Frauen, die aktiv das Leben aller beeinflussten, die Dinge erschufen und erdachten, die unsere Gegenwart heute formen, erscheinen unvorstellbar.

Es hinterfragt dabei keine:r, wie es eigentlich sein kann, dass wirklich die Hälfte der Menschheit gar keinen Beitrag zu der Entwicklung von Kultur, Wissenschaft und Politik geleistet haben soll. Kann es wirklich sein, dass 50 Prozent der Gesellschaft apathisch dahinlebte? Es ist zumindest das, was die Geschichtsbücher im Unterricht bis heute erzählen.

Frauen bleiben die Partnerin oder Affäre

Es ist auch das, was Filme wie „Oppenheimer“ meinen jüngeren Geschwistern in den Sommerferien erzählen, wenn sie Frauen nur die Rolle der Partnerin, Affäre oder Sekretärin zugestehen. Natürlich waren die 1940er-Jahre für Frauen eine harte Zeit, aber Frauen waren keineswegs inaktiv.

Lise Meitner ist das beste Beispiel dafür. Sie war nicht nur in der Physik eine Vordenkerin, sondern auch in ihrer Vorstellung davon, was eine Frau kann. Sie wurde 1878 in Wien geboren, hinein in eine Zeit, in der Frauen nicht die gleichen Rechte wie Männer zugestanden wurden.

So wie sich Meitner physikalisch Dinge vorstellen konnte, wie es ihre männlichen Kollegen nicht konnten, so dachte sie sich auch über die patriarchalen Vorstellungen ihrer Zeit hinweg und wurde geradewegs die erste Frau, die sich in Deutschland habilitierte, die in unserer Stadt Berlin die erste Professorin der Physik wurde.

Es ist Frauen wie ihr zu verdanken, dass wir heute in einer Gesellschaft leben, die Frauen die gleichen Rechte wie Männer einräumt und die ein Gesetz hat, das die Bürger:innen vor Diskriminierung aufgrund ihres Geschlechts schützen soll. Den Frauen wurden diese Rechte nicht geschenkt, sondern sie haben dafür gekämpft und von diesem Kampf muss erzählt werden.

Junge Mädchen von heute müssen von den Kämpferinnen von damals erfahren, müssen davon hören und sehen, dass Frauen mit ihren Gedanken und ihren Fähigkeiten auch in der Vergangenheit die Menschheit bereichert und geprägt haben. Dass es eben nie wirklich eine „reine Männerwelt“ war.



Und gerade deswegen bräuchte es eigentlich nicht den nächsten Blockbuster über einen vermeintlichen, männlichen Helden, sondern vielmehr über eine Frau, die heldenhaft für eine bessere Welt kämpfte. Lise Meitner wäre eine solche gewesen.

2023-08-08 17:12:31.899000+00:00,"With the Sexy Passages, Ira Sachs Reminds Why He’s an Essential Indie Voice",The acclaimed writer-director went outside the U.S. to make his latest movie—the latest example of an industry veteran determined to make his art his way.,"Even as the world of American independent film has contracted and consolidated, as the marketplace’s demand for originality has declined, Ira Sachs has carried on. He has made what he calls “personal cinema,” of a very personal (and very consistent) quality, for decades now, seemingly without interruption. The journey hasn’t actually been so smooth, of course—it’s required initiative, flexibility, a certain drive. His latest film, Passages—already an arthouse success out of its opening weekend, and a critical darling—reflects that nimbleness. It showcases a filmmaker unwilling to compromise creatively, if keenly aware of the forces around him needed to make it happen.

A heated and darkly funny love triangle, the Paris-set Passages concerns what happens when Tomas (Franz Rogowski) briefly abandons his longtime partner Martin (Ben Whishaw) to pursue an affair with a woman, Agathe (Adèle Exarchopoulos). Tomas navigates this new attraction with a selfishness that plays out as simultaneously mortifying, heartbreaking, and hilarious, a tough combination sold by Rogowski’s fearless performance. It’s very much in the Sachs oeuvre too—another biting relationship study from the mind behind such indie gems as Love Is Strange and Little Men.

How does he keep doing it—both creatively and logistically? It’s no secret that films of Sachs’s scope have become more difficult to fund and get off the ground, especially one like Passages, whose central queer sex scene ostensibly offended the MPAA enough to slap it with an NC-17 rating. (Distributor Mubi chose to release the film unrated.) “I wouldn’t say I’m at the end of my American career. I am American. I’m from Memphis, Tennessee. I’m born and bred here, so I have stories to tell here,” Sachs says on this week’s Little Gold Men (listen above). “Part of what I’m doing with this film is playing and being open to the impact of, particularly, French cinema on me as an artist, and allowing myself a kind of freedom of bringing that into the film.”

But making the movie outside the U.S. does reflect certain structural industry changes that Sachs has proven crafty enough to respond to. “I think the [2008] recession changed everything in American cinema and in particular in American independent cinema,” he says. Around that time, he had an all-star cast assembled for a film to be titled The Goodbye People, including Michael Shannon, Patricia Clarkson, Kirsten Dunst, and the late Anton Yelchin. “I couldn’t raise $1 over a multiple-year period and I really was, like, ‘Oh, this is not working. Something is not working,’” Sachs says. “From then, I looked at my job differently. I realized I was going to be the instigator, and in a way, I became my own producer. I became the person who raised money, and I raised it out of that system.”

This led to one of the more noted decades for a queer filmmaker in the 2010s, beginning with the steamy relationship study Keep the Lights On. From 2013–2017, Sachs received an impressive six Independent Spirit Award nominations, including two for best feature. But even as his profile grew, he still struggled to pull financing together. “When I finished Love Is Strange, which was a success in the independent marketplace and was well reviewed, I wrote Little Men thinking, ‘Okay, I’m coming off of something,’” Sachs says. “And no one would make the film. Not one company. Again, I had to raise the money for the film independently.”

Passages is Sachs’s second consecutive movie made in Europe, following 2019’s Isabelle Huppert vehicle Frankie, which brought the director less enthusiastic reviews than usual. The movie marked his Cannes debut. “I feel like in France it was received with a lot of love,” he says. “In the US, it’s an unusual film. It’s a film out of place with the concerns of American cinema, but I’m okay with that. That seems like a good thing.” Passages, with its frank approach to sexuality and richly messy depiction of human behavior, would seem an even better fit for the Croisette than the low-key Frankie, but instead, Sachs brought it back to Sundance, the place where his 2005 breakout Forty Shades of Blue won the Grand Jury Prize and where those 2010s hits all premiered to wide acclaim. Sachs seems pleased with the decision.

“Cannes is a festival that chose this year to open with a Johnny Depp movie—we’re talking about a film festival where the people in charge have a certain politic that’s really important to them,” Sachs says. “I can’t say whether Johnny Depp should or should not make movies, but when you’re deciding what that [opening film] is, you’re deciding which films you want to promote and which conversations you want to engage in…. On the other hand, Sundance is a festival that has always privileged voices that are marginalized in other festivals—that are put into the back of other festivals. Sundance says, ‘These are actually the films that mean the most to us.’”

There’s that independent spirit, shining through again. It’s served Sachs quite well.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbml0eWZhaXIuY29tL2hvbGx5d29vZC8yMDIzLzA4L2F3YXJkcy1pbnNpZGVyLWxpdHRsZS1nb2xkLW1lbi1pcmEtc2FjaHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-07-27 13:00:00+00:00,"Franz Rogowski’s Sexy, Lonely, Beautiful Worlds","Maybe the most exciting movie star on the global stage, Rogowski finds himself looking inward with each new project. His latest film, ‘Passages,’ led to especially profound reflection.","“You and me, if we would both sit here naked, it would change the energy.” That sounds like a safe bet, but Franz Rogowski is getting to a point here. “We wouldn’t have to do anything. We’d just take off our clothes.” He smiles at my nervous laugh, then gives an eyebrow raise that keeps his interviewer on his toes. This is the way Rogowski answers a question about the experience of filming a sex scene.

“You always depend on intimacy when you create scenes for a movie—it’s more obvious when you’re naked and you’re moaning,” he says. “But it’s not just having sex, you know? Having a conversation can be very intimate—as now, in this lovely Zoom conversation.”

Speaking with Rogowski, it seems, is not unlike watching him onscreen. The 37-year-old German actor has emerged as one of the most dynamic talents of his generation through a peculiar combination of wit, sexiness, vulnerability, and transparency. That last quality is key. His characters can behave cruelly, unbearably, or with bracing kindness and empathy; either way, Rogowski offers access into their vibrant, messy interior worlds. In his portrayals, they are funny and strange and deeply sad—the kinds of people we all recognize and who too rarely fill up the movies.

The honesty catches you off guard, and with that comes a thrilling unpredictability that explains his status as the art house man of the moment. The German auteur Christian Petzold cast Rogowski in 2018’s Transit; the next year, the actor took on a small but pivotal role in Terrence Malick’s World War II drama A Hidden Life. He’s now a global star primed to soar, completing ADR in three different languages on a given movie, acting around the world, and learning new ways of working along the way. He is in production on Andrea Arnold’s new movie, Bird, as we chat, shooting in the English town of Gravesend (Rogowski calls it “Brexitland”)—near where the director grew up—and giddy at the fact that he knows nothing more about his character or storyline than what’s on the pages Arnold gives him to act out for the day.

“We are dealing with all kinds of birdy issues here,” he says of the mystery project. Is he into that bird stuff? “Yes. I think I am an owl.” Okay, how so? After a pause, Rogowski hoots a few times in response. It is weirdly charming, and definitely confounding.

The superb film Passages (in US theaters August 4), which serves as the occasion for this interview, contains Rogowski’s most explosive and delicate performance yet. Not coincidentally, his character is highly chaotic. We meet Rogowski’s Tomas as a German filmmaker living in Paris, wrapping work on his latest movie. As he transitions back to regular life, he briefly loses interest in his long-term partner, the British Martin (Ben Whishaw), and finds himself intensely attracted to a French woman, Agathe (Adèle Exarchopoulos), who worked on the project. He begins an affair, swiftly moves in with her, and then starts pining for his old life—setting a fraught and heated love triangle in motion.

“He’s a fun character,” director Ira Sachs says, before qualifying with a laugh: “I mean, he’s a bad guy.” When it came to casting, Sachs thought about Jimmy Cagney. “Orson Welles once said [Cagney] was the greatest cinema actor ever—which I think is not far from true. [He] played people whose actions seemed despicable, and yet you loved him.” That model tracks here: Rogowski’s warm expressiveness barrels through even the most selfish of acts. He plays Tomas with delirious commitment. “He’s not really capable of putting a gloss over things or making something tidy when it’s not,” Whishaw tells me. “[Franz] is very frank. He’s very direct. At least, that’s how he seems to me.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbml0eWZhaXIuY29tL2hvbGx5d29vZC8yMDIzLzA3L2ZyYW56LXJvZ293c2tpLXByb2ZpbGUtYXdhcmRzLWluc2lkZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-22 14:00:14+00:00,Oppenheimer review – Christopher Nolan’s volatile biopic is a towering achievement,"As the ‘father of the atomic bomb’, Cillian Murphy is a 20th-century Frankenstein whose catastrophic creation unravels across a tangle of timelines in Nolan’s expansive drama","It’s billed as a biopic of theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, dubbed the “father of the atomic bomb”. But “biopic” seems too small a word to contain the ambition and scope of Christopher Nolan’s formidable if occasionally unwieldy latest. Oppenheimer is a dense and intricate period piece, playing out in a tangle of timelines. It weaves together courtroom drama, romantic liaisons, laboratory epiphanies and lecture hall personality cults. But perhaps more than all of this, Oppenheimer is the ultimate monster movie. Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer is an atomic-age Frankenstein, a man captivated by the boundless possibilities of science, realising too late that his creation has a limitless capacity for destruction. Ultimately, however, the monster in this story is not Oppenheimer’s invention but the appetite for annihilation that it unleashes in mankind. It’s a realisation that plays out, inexorably, in Oppenheimer’s hollow, haunted face as the film unfolds. Murphy’s far-seeing ice-chip eyes have never been put to better use.
In fact, Murphy’s physicality as a whole is one of the most potent weapons at the film’s disposal. He seems impossibly slight, a theoretical idea of a man in contrast to the robust certainties of the military figures he works alongside (Matt Damon’s Lt Gen Leslie Groves, for example, is bullish and solid, a clenched fist looking for something to punch). In one shot we see Oppenheimer hauling an armful of books into a new classroom, and it looks as though he’s buckling under the weight of his accumulated knowledge. At other times he’s calm and glassily composed, somehow removed from jostling egos and the fusion of ideas that will take shape into the ultimate weapon.
Given Nolan’s preference for shooting on Imax 70mm film, the picture has a depth of detail you could drown in
The version of Oppenheimer that we see on screen at any given time is a marker, an indication of which timeline we are currently inhabiting. Insights into his stellar early academic career are punctuated by glimpses of a later humiliating security clearance hearing that picked over every aspect of his life; the development of the bomb – the so-called Manhattan Project – is cut together with another hearing, this time in the Senate, to establish whether Oppenheimer’s former colleague Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr, excellent) should be appointed in a federal government role. It’s a knotty mesh of a structure. Time in Oppenheimer doesn’t feel entirely linear – there are moments, in particular a pivotal encounter with Albert Einstein, that seem unmoored from the rest of the film. Nolan’s films frequently require a couple of viewings to unravel fully, and while it lacks the baffle-factor of Tenet, Oppenheimer is no exception.

There are other problems: the cursory treatment of the female characters is one. Florence Pugh, as Oppenheimer’s mistress Jean Tatlock, gets short shrift. And Emily Blunt, as J Robert’s wife Kitty Oppenheimer, spends much of the first two hours mutinously clutching a martini on the edge of the frame. She does, however, claim a couple of terrific moments later on: a skin-flaying interrogation scene; a wordless glare that conveys the full nuclear winter of her animosity towards a disloyal colleague.
But, for the most part, the film is a towering achievement. Not surprisingly, given Nolan’s preference for shooting on Imax 70mm film, the picture has a depth of detail you could drown in. There’s no shortage of scenes of furious blackboard scribbling, the accepted cinematic signifier of scientific genius. But more interesting are the abstract moments; it’s as though we are venturing into the heart of the atom itself. Equally inventive is the way the sets seem to quake at moments of tension. Oppenheimer’s world is literally rocked by the shockwaves of the reaction that has been set in motion.
Most effective, however, is the use of sound and music. Like Jonathan Glazer’s upcoming The Zone of Interest, this is a film in which the horrors of war are not shown but conveyed inescapably through what we hear. Ludwig Göransson’s score is masterful and mercurial, surely one of the finest of the year. And there’s a recurring motif in the soundscape, a crescendo of thunderously stamping feet. It’s taken from a moment of triumph and glory, the high point of Oppenheimer’s career. But it takes on a mounting sense of threat with each use, as the catastrophic potential of the physicist’s work becomes clear.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZmlsbS8yMDIzL2p1bC8yMi9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1yZXZpZXctY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tdm9sYXRpbGUtYmlvcGljLWlzLWEtdG93ZXJpbmctYWNoaWV2ZW1lbnQtY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHnSAYoBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2ZpbG0vMjAyMy9qdWwvMjIvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItcmV2aWV3LWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLXZvbGF0aWxlLWJpb3BpYy1pcy1hLXRvd2VyaW5nLWFjaGlldmVtZW50LWNpbGxpYW4tbXVycGh5?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Oppenheimer: Cillian Murphy makes powerful impact in atomic epic,Critics impressed by director Christopher Nolan's thriller about the 'father of the atomic bomb'.,"Oppenheimer: Cillian Murphy makes powerful impact in atomic epic
By Paul Glynn Entertainment reporter
Universal Pictures
Oppenheimer stars Peaky Blinders' Cillian Murphy, who has appeared in five previous Christopher Nolan films
Critics have given positive reviews to Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan's sweeping new biographical thriller about the ""father of the atomic bomb"".
The film features an all-star ensemble cast led by Cillian Murphy as the US physicist, J Robert Oppenheimer.
The Independent called the ""clever, imaginative"" film Nolan ""at his best"", while the Telegraph said actor Murphy ""dazzles as the destroyer of worlds"".
The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw deemed the movie ""flawed, but extraordinary"".
Universal Pictures

Inspired by the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph And Tragedy Of J Robert Oppenheimer, the film tells the story of the enigmatic Manhattan Project scientist, who had a leading role in developing the atomic bomb, changing the course of World War II.
He ""gave us the power to destroy ourselves and that had never happened before"", director Nolan told BBC Culture editor Katie Razzall.
Commissioned by the US Government, who saw themselves in a nuclear race with the Nazis, in 1945 scientists in New Mexico detonated a test bomb, codenamed Trinity.
Their invention was later used, controversially, to end the war, when an atomic bomb was dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to devastating effect.
'Performance of his life'
The Telegraph's Robbie Collin awarded five stars, saying: ""Nolan's portrait of the father of the nuclear bomb is a triumph, like witnessing history itself being split open.""
""Oppenheimer is a film that works simultaneously on the most intimate and cosmic scales,"" he wrote.
""It's at once a speeding rollercoaster and a skin-tingling spiritual portrait; an often, classically-minded period piece that only Nolan could have made, and only now, after a quarter-century's run-up.""
He added: ""Playing Oppenheimer from his early 20s to late 50s, the 47-year-old Murphy gives the performance of his life, imbuing Oppenheimer's body with an enthralling nervous eroticism and his voice with a noirish musicality that reminds you of [Humphrey] Bogart.""
""A masterfully constructed character study from a great director operating on a whole new level. A film that you don't merely watch, but must reckon with.""

In a four-star review in the Guardian, Bradshaw said the film ""captures the most agonising of success stories"".
""This is the big bang, and no one could have made it bigger or more overwhelming than Nolan,"" he wrote.
""He does this without simply turning it into an action stunt - although this movie, for all its audacity and ambition, never quite solves the problem of its own obtuseness: filling the drama at such length with the torment of genius-functionary Oppenheimer at the expense of showing the Japanese experience and the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.""
He described Murphy as ""an eerily close lookalike for Oppenheimer... very good at capturing his sense of solitude and emotional imprisonment"".

Writing in the Times, critic Ed Potton, who also awarded the film four stars, hailed Murphy's performance as ""explosive in a breathtaking movie"".
The Evening Standard's Charlotte Sullivan agreed that the ""dark, immersive epic gives Cillian Murphy the role of his career"".
Speaking ahead of the film's release, the Irish star told journalists the role had taken ""a toll"" on him ""but in a brilliant way"".
""It was the biggest, most exhilarating challenge,"" he said.
Co-star Matt Damon revealed he had told his wife he would take a break from acting, unless ""Chris Nolan called"".
Nolan is best known for his Dark Knight trilogy, as well as films including Inception, Dunkirk and Tenet. He makes history with Oppenheimer - which also features Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Robert Downey Jr - as the first film with sequences shot on black and white IMAX film.

The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney called the movie a ""scorching depiction of America's ability to create and destroy its heroes.""
While the four-act structure ""asks a lot of the film's audience"", he commented ""our patience and concentration are amply rewarded"".
Handing the film four stars, the Independent's Clarisse Loughrey called Oppenheimer ""Nolan's best and most revealing work"".
""It's a profoundly unnerving story told with a traditionalist's eye towards craftsmanship and muscular, cinematic imagination.""
She praised its non-linear structure - a common feature of Nolan films - and its ""beautifully lensed"" cinematography, but added: ""It's a little too conscious of itself, and the ways cinema crafts its own reality.""

Rolling Stone reviewer David Fear said the movie is ""big, loud, and a must-see"", describing it as ""thrilling and wonky, brilliant and overstuffed, too much and not enough"".

,'Oppenheimer' True Story: All About the Real Events That Inspired the Christopher Nolan Film,Christopher Nolan's 2023 film 'Oppenheimer' centers around physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and the events that led to the creation of the atomic bomb. Here's the true story of 'Oppenheimer.',"Christoper Nolan's highly anticipated behemoth film Oppenheimer has finally hit theaters. The film stars Cillian Murphy as the title character, renowned and notorious physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer.
Oppenheimer is most remembered as the “father of the atomic bomb” and was the physicist in charge of the Manhattan Project, the name given to the top-secret project that developed the weapons the United States used to devastate the Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. His path toward the creation of the bomb was etched in his childhood when Oppenheimer proved to be scientifically gifted and advanced far beyond his years.
As a reticent and thoughtful man, Oppenheimer didn’t always share his inner workings freely. He spoke out about the gravity of the atomic bomb following the two detonations, and in later years openly opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb for use against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The latter choice meant he was investigated as a Communist sympathizer, a charge Oppenheimer denied.
Oppenheimer’s path toward the atomic bomb and his subsequent feelings about its use are both riveting and devastating. Here is what to know about the real events that inspired the Christopher Nolan film Oppenheimer, including his personal life, work with the Manhattan Project and Communist investigations.
Who was J. Robert Oppenheimer?
Alpha Historica / Alamy
Julius Robert Oppenheimer was brought into the Manhattan Project soon after it began in 1942. While President Roosevelt expressed some hesitation, the U.S. launched the project to explore building an atomic bomb during World War II.
As shared by the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History, Oppenheimer, already a renowned theoretical physicist at the time, served as the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory throughout the project. He was eventually nicknamed the “father of the atomic bomb” after being put in charge of both the research and design of the devastating weapon.
Oppenheimer was born on April 22, 1904, and gained a reputation for academic giftedness early in his life. By the time he was 10 years old, Oppenheimer was studying physics and chemistry. At 12 years old, the New York Mineralogical Club asked him to speak at the group’s meeting without realizing he was not yet a teen. He graduated from Harvard University at the age of 22 after finishing his degree in three years.
Oppenheimer eventually went to Europe to study at the University of Cambridge and later at the University of Göttingen's Institute for Theoretical Physics. Though a scene in Oppenheimer shows the young theoretical physicist poisoning an apple on his Cambridge professor's desk with potassium cyanide only to correct his mistake the following day, Oppenheimer's grandson Charles told TIME the incident is untrue. ""There's no record of him trying to kill somebody,"" Charles told the publication. ""That's a really serious accusation and it's historical revision. There's not a single enemy or friend of Robert Oppenheimer who heard that during his life and considered it to be true.""
Oppenheimer went on to receive a Ph.D. degree under Max Born, a physicist who helped develop the theory of quantum mechanics. He returned to the United States and began working as an advisor at the Atomic Energy Commission following World War I. He also taught at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1929 to 1943.
In October 1942, Oppenheimer was put in charge of what was then known as Project Y, a laboratory that focused on researching weapon physics. He served as director of the Los Alamos facility from 1943 to 1945 before resigning.
Did J. Robert Oppenheimer have a family?
PictureLux / The Hollywood Archive / Alamy
Oppenheimer married biologist Katharine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer (née Puening) in 1940. Kitty (portrayed by Emily Blunt) had been married three times prior: She annulled her first marriage in 1933; her second husband — who was a Communist Party member — died during the Spanish Civil War; and she was married to her third husband, Richard Harrison, when she met Oppenheimer.
Kitty and Oppenheimer welcomed two children together: son Peter in 1941 and daughter Katherine ""Toni"" in 1944.
According to the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History, Kitty also worked at the Los Alamos facility for a short period of time and was well-known for the dinner parties she threw for the other wives of scientists at the facility. She was Oppenheimer’s first and most important confidant in all matters of his life. Kitty also struggled with alcoholism and depression, especially following Oppenheimer's death in 1967. She died in 1972 in Panama City, Panama, after suffering a pulmonary embolism.
Prior to meeting Kitty, Oppenheimer was involved with psychiatrist and American Communist Party member Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). The two met in 1936, though Tatlock ended their relationship in 1939. However, Oppenheimer and Tatlock rekindled their romance during his marriage to Kitty, with the physicist even visiting Tatlock in San Francisco as late as 1943. Tatlock died in January 1944.
What did J. Robert Oppenheimer invent?

Oppenheimer primarily worked in theoretical physics and made a number of contributions to the field. While he is known for the development of the atomic bomb, the physicist was also responsible for the development of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which is a mathematical approximation in molecular dynamics
His work is also credited with predicting later findings by other scientists, such as the neutron, meson and neutron star, in addition to a number of theoretical contributions.
What was the Manhattan Project?
Science History Images / Alamy
In 1939, scientists around the world learned that Nazi Germany’s scientists had learned how to split a uranium atom. The process is known as nuclear fission and requires a neutron to collide with a uranium atom, which in turn releases an amount of energy that can have devastating consequences. As such, the news appropriately alarmed scientists around the world, especially if it meant the Nazis would develop their own atomic weapons.
Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), who fled Nazi Germany, and physicist Leo Slizard each took steps to speak to President Roosevelt about the gravity of the situation and to encourage Roosevelt to develop a program in the United States so that scientists could work toward developing their own project. The U.S. government launched the Manhattan Project in 1942, though Einstein was not involved in the military and scientific project. According to the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History, the project was originally headquartered in New York City, hence the name, and led by Lieutenant General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon).
From there, two secret nuclear facilities were constructed in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington, as well as a laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer was head of research. While 120,000 people worked at the Manhattan Project, only a handful knew the true goal of the work they were contributing to.
Known as the Trinity test, the first atomic bomb was tested on July 16, 1945, in the Jornada del Muerto desert — more than 200 miles south of Los Alamos. Oppenheimer chose the code name Trinity inspired by the poetry of John Donne. The results were a shock to everyone involved; homes 100 miles away could reportedly feel the explosion and a mushroom cloud ballooned about eight miles into the sky.
Following the Trinity test, Oppenheimer later recalled, ""A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent."" He also famously said that a line from the Hindu scripture Bhagavad-Gita came to mind: “Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”
What did J. Robert Oppenheimer think of the atomic bomb?
Prisma by Dukas Presseagentur GmbH / Alamy
It seems as though Oppenheimer believed in his work, including the work that led up to the ultimate detonation of atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. In the 2012 book Robert Oppenheimer: A Life Inside the Center, author Jay Monk wrote that on Aug. 6, 1945, (when the first bomb was dropped), Oppenheimer and his fellow scientists seemed victorious.
As the book describes, “To ecstatic cheering, Oppenheimer told the crowd that it was too early to say what the results of the bombing had been, but that ‘the Japanese didn’t like it.’ ” Monk added Oppenheimer's only regret was that ""we hadn't developed the bomb in time to use it against the Germans.""
The second bomb devastated Nagasaki, Japan, on Aug. 9, 1945. Monk also wrote that President Truman and Oppenheimer were not involved in the decision to deploy the weapon, as a previous directive issued on July 24 of the same year had already authorized General Spaatz to drop subsequent atomic bombs “as soon as made ready by the project staff.” The following day, President Truman issued an order to stop atomic bombings.
It does not seem that Oppenheimer was proud of or happy about the deployment of the second bomb. Monk wrote that an FBI report stated the physicist was a “nervous wreck” following the events of Aug. 9, and was also described as being “reluctant to promise that much real good could come out of continuing atomic-bomb work.”
What did J. Robert Oppenheimer say after the nuclear explosions in 1945?
Science History Images / Alamy
Oppenheimer left his post at the Los Alamos facility in November 1945. In his farewell speech, which the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History has since shared in full, Oppenheimer admitted that the initial reason the team built the bomb was that it was believed using a weapon of that nature might be the only way to win World War II. Once it became clear that the war could be won without using atomic weapons, he said, a different motivation kicked in.
As Oppenheimer put it, “Some people, I think, were motivated by curiosity, and rightly so; and some by a sense of adventure, and rightly so. Others had more political arguments and said, ‘Well, we know that atomic weapons are in principle possible, and it is not right that the threat of their unrealized possibility should hang over the world. It is right that the world should know what can be done in their field and deal with it.’ ”
Ultimately, Oppenheimer seemed resolute on a number of issues, including the fact that with the detonation of two atomic bombs, the world had to contend with a new problem. He said, “I think it is true to say that atomic weapons are a peril which affect everyone in the world, and in that sense a completely common problem, as common a problem as it was for the Allies to defeat the Nazis. I think that in order to handle this common problem there must be a complete sense of community responsibility. I do not think that one may expect that people will contribute to the solution of the problem until they are aware of their ability to take part in the solution.”
Was J. Robert Oppenheimer a Communist?

The years that followed the detonation of two atomic bombs were politically fraught in the United States. Oppenheimer was named Chairman of the General Advisory Committee for the Atomic Energy Commission, and in this capacity, argued against the development of a hydrogen bomb.
At the time, the United States was well into the Cold War with the Soviet Union, and Oppenheimer’s recommendation against creating a hydrogen bomb was seen as politically dubious. As the Institute for Advanced Study noted, the physicist was soon caught up in McCarthyism and investigated by the U.S. government.
In December 1953, then-Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (and foe of Oppenheimer) Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) informed the physicist that his security clearance had been suspended due to his alleged ties to the Communist Party and urged Oppenheimer to quit. (Oppenheimer's mistress Tatlock was a known member of the Communist Party, as well as his brother Frank Oppenheimer and sister-in-law Jackie. Oppenheimer had also been under investigation while teaching at Berkeley and during the Manhattan Project.)
Rather than step down, Oppenheimer requested a hearing into the matter, which began in April 1954 and lasted for four weeks. Several of Oppenheimer's former colleagues testified against him, including Edward Teller (Benny Safdie). Ultimately, Oppenheimer lost his security clearance and was eventually stripped of his title.
In 1962, President Kennedy asked Oppenheimer to come to the White House, where he received an apology for what happened. He received the Enrico Fermi Award for his scientific achievements one year later.
And in 2022, United States Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm nullified the AEC's decision, saying, “more evidence has come to light of the bias and unfairness of the process that Dr. Oppenheimer was subjected to while the evidence of his loyalty and love of country have only been further affirmed,"" per The New York Times.

2023-07-20 21:05:23+00:00,"Cillian Murphy Talks ‘Oppenheimer,’ Christopher Nolan & “Terrifying” Jobs – Deadline","Cillian Murphy discusses his sixth collaboration with Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer,an epic about the complicated man who led the Manhattan Project.","Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan are marking their sixth collaboration with Oppenheimer, the biographical epic about the titular complicated and brilliant physicist tasked with leading the Manhattan Project, the secret effort to create the atom bomb, and the moral and political struggles that followed. This is the first time Murphy, who plays Oppenheimer, is essaying a lead role for Nolan – “Finally!”, as he enthuses with a wink below.
The first reactions to the film have hailed it as a triumph for Nolan and Murphy; the latter having last year completed a decade-long arc as Tommy Shelby in lauded period gangster drama Peaky Blinders. In Oppenheimer, Murphy “captures all the contradictions of this brilliant, tortured, complicated man,” wrote Deadline’s Pete Hammond in his review which also called this “the most important motion picture of 2023, and maybe far beyond.”
Oppenheimer the man, as the film that’s based on American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin tells it, struggled with psychological issues in his youth and grew to become a peerless intellectual though not an entirely likeable presence – he womanized and could appear arrogant and aloof. After the war, he was a vocal opponent of nuclear armament and stripped of his security clearance during a 1954 hearing that focused on his maybe/maybe-not communist ties. The film presents the audience with philosophical quandaries aplenty. Murphy as Oppenheimer quotes the Bhagavad Gita after the Trinity test of the bomb: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”
I caught up with Murphy on two recent occasions to discuss the film, his role as the contradictory scientist and much more. The interviews, which took place before the SAG-AFTRA strike was called, have been combined, condensed and edited for clarity in the Q&A below.
Oppenheimer also features a large and starry cast that includes Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Jason Clarke, Kenneth Branagh and an unrecognizable Gary Oldman along with a host of others. Universal began overseas rollout on July 19 with North American previews beginning today.
DEADLINE: The last time you and I spoke was about a year ago when you were just a couple of weeks out of filming Oppenheimer…
CILLIAN MURPHY: (Laughs) I must have been in a heap.
DEADLINE: How long does it take to shed the figurative weight of this sort of character afterwards?
MURPHY: It’s like anything. If you do anything to a high standard and spend an awful lot of time at it, you’re working 16-, 17-, 18-hour days incredibly focused. So then when you stop, it’s very abrupt and you have an awful lot of displaced energy. It takes a while to figure that out. There is a little period where you’re neither one nor the other, you’re not a civilian, you’re still not the character, you’re floating around – but it’s not particularly dramatic it’s just trying to readjust to daily life.
DEADLINE: When Chris first talked to you about the project, did he offer any insight into what he was setting out to do? What did he say to you when he first proposed it to you?
MURPHY: In typical Chris fashion, there was no pre-amble or no sense that he might have been writing something. He just called me out of the blue and he said, in his very understated British way, that he’s making this film about Oppenheimer and he’d like me to play Oppenheimer. So that was a tremendous shock, a very pleasant one, but a shock nonetheless.
I didn’t know that much about Oppenheimer, I had kind of like Wikipedia-level knowledge about him at the time, and then Chris said it’s based off of this book.
He was in LA and I was in Dublin and it was still Covid times. I couldn’t get out of Ireland, so he came to Dublin and he gave me the script and I sat in his hotel room and read it and realized it was something special. It genuinely was one of the best screenplays I’d ever read, and it was written in the first person which is not something I’d ever experienced before, so that was terrifying.
DEADLINE: I don’t mean this in a pejorative sense, but the film was like a history lesson that only made me want to learn more. He’s not the most likeable person, but then it’s fascinating to watch the build-up and it’s like a left turn in the third act with the security hearing and the adversarial relationship with Robert Downey Jr’s character Lewis Strauss. I felt like it had echoes of a redemption story, but with so many contradictions. In terms of working on it with Chris, how important was it to shed light on, as the book is subtitled, Oppenheimer’s “triumph and tragedy”?
MURPHY: It’s interesting that you use the word redemption. The bit you mentioned, the hearing at the end, that to me feels like the most Promethean part of the movie, or the most Faustian – he made a pact and then he tried to renegotiate the pact. Did you feel it was redemptive in the end?
DEADLINE: To a degree – with regard to Strauss and with him receiving the Enrico Fermi Award that was conferred by John F Kennedy years later.
MURPHY: And also you know that the American government reinstated his security clearance, I think it was just a few months ago; it really didn’t get much headlines that story, but that was quite interesting that that happened within the year when the movie was coming out.
DEADLINE: I wonder if there’s any correlation to that…
MURPHY: Maybe they were getting ahead of it. I don’t know, but it’s good that it happened, but it was a little under the radar.
DEADLINE: Let’s talk more about the Promethean angle.
MURPHY: It’s brilliant for drama, isn’t it? Like I mentioned the Faust thing… When I was researching it and Chris and I were talking – cause he gave me the script in September of 21 and we didn’t shoot until February 22, so I had six months – it’s in the book that Oppenheimer was obsessed with this Henry James novella called Beast in the Jungle and this idea that there was something stalking him all his life and that eventually it would come after him and get him.
Maybe that’s the state of mind of all great human beings: that with all the success and fame and notoriety there will be something there that will take you down. It’s not a very good novel, it’s not one of James’ best, but it’s very interesting. All the time, Oppenheimer sensed that this was all gonna come crashing down and they were going to come for him. It’s really interesting to have that in your psychology all the while.
DEADLINE: You’ve had a long time collaboration with Chris and this is the first time that he put you in a leading role…
MURPHY: (Laughs) Finally!
DEADLINE: Are there particular challenges associated with that? Do you feel a lot of extra pressure?
MURPHY: Yeah, but I’ve always chased down roles that I feel pressure. I have no interest in doing something that is safe or easy where you can kind of cruise in. So the jobs that I love are the terrifying ones that do put you under a lot of pressure, that do give you a lot of responsibility – and this was a huge one.
I’d always secretly wanted to play a lead for Chris. I think any actor in the whole world would want to be in a Chris Nolan movie, not to mind play a lead for him, and we have such a long relationship. I mean, it’s 20 years.
It was 2003 that I first met him, so (laughs) it makes us old – it’s a long time.
He’s not the sort of person that would call me up and talk and shoot the shit. He’s just working and it just felt right this one – and maybe there was some sort of physical resemblance, I don’t know. People seem to think there was, but he just seemed to think that the time was right.
DEADLINE: Maybe this time was different because you were so deeply involved, but how do you work together?
MURPHY: My personal way of working is to do an awful lot of research and prep and then sort of abandon it when you come to actually acting in the scene with other actors because then it becomes about instinct. For me, acting is not intellectual, it’s instinctual. But it’s always really useful to have all of the research, it’s your kind of due diligence to do that.
With Chris, I think trust is the main thing. He expects excellence from everybody – from every single crew member, from every single actor – and so people know that and they come fully prepared and then in terms of the work he kind of lets you off.
He really loves actors and he lets you off to explore choices in the scene, and then maybe after a few takes he comes in and he gives these incredibly unbelievably precise and succinct and kind of laser-like notes which can completely flip your performance. But it is just about trust really. I feel very safe, you feel very cared for.
And also his sets, even though they’re huge blockbuster movies, it feels very private when you’re making them cause there’s only one camera, there’s the boom op and there’s Chris right next to the camera. There’s no video village, there’s none of that, so it does feel like this kind of laboratory that you’re making work in and you can make a fool of yourself and try something that mightn’t work. I think the reason that his films succeed on such a massive scale is that he puts performance first.
DEADLINE: I recall one of the times I visited the Peaky Blinders set and you were filming a scene which required several takes. I was standing like four feet from you between set-ups and you leaned over and whispered, “How are your donkey and sheep?” and then you went straight back into being Tommy. It was very kind of you, but I was surprised because it was so intense on set; are you able to dip in and dip out like that? Or was that just a weird day?
MURPHY: (Laughs) No, I always like to have a light atmosphere on set, you know particularly if we’re doing work where you have to go deep and into kind of darker places. I always like to have it easy because you need to feel relaxed to make great work, certainly I do.
But, you know, it affects you completely. If you do anything intensely for 17, 18 hours a day like we were working on Oppenheimer – it was an incredibly fast shoot, it was like 57 days we shot the whole thing – if you do anything that intensely for that length of time a day, it’s gonna affect you. And then also I had to get really skinny for it so I wasn’t really eating, so you get to this very sort of hysterically lucid state of mind, but it’s an amazing feeling – you feel completely immersed in it and completely focused in it.
Chris moves at a really fast pace, there’s no one standing around kind of shooting the shit or talking. When you come on the set at 7 and you wrap at whatever time, it’s constant work – there’s no waiting around cause Chris knows exactly what he wants and he moves at an incredibly fast pace so he expects everyone else to move at that pace, but you feel wonderfully exhausted at the end of it.
DEADLINE: What did the physical prep entail? Did you get hangry?
MURPHY: (Laughs) Probably, I don’t know. Like I said, I try to keep it light. It’s important to have a light atmosphere on set and to get on with people cause that’s where I think good work comes from. But, if you reduce your calorific intake after a while your body just gets used to it; you stop feeling hungry – I wouldn’t recommend it, but that’s what happens.
It’s not a big deal really, you just kind of eat less. I had a nutritionist and all that, but what was important was to get the silhouette. He had a very distinct silhouette, you know? And it was very self-conscious, self-mythologizing. So, in order for that silhouette to work, I had to be a certain physical shape, but that’s just another trick in your arsenal and a lot of it we could accentuate with costuming and the way the suits were tailored.
DEADLINE: On Peaky Blinders your mother, who’s a French teacher, helped you out with the French you needed for the final season. Here, Oppenheimer at one point surprises everyone by launching into what sounded like perfect Dutch. How did you work on that?
MURPHY: I remember saying to Chris, ‘So there’s this scene with a Dutch sequence in the script, how are we going to do that?’ And he said, ‘You mean how are you going to do that.’ And I went ‘Okay…’ I asked (DP) Hoyte van Hoytema, who’s Dutch, to record it, and he recorded it and then I slowed it down so I just learned it phonetically over three months – I can still remember it.
DEADLINE: Do you actually know what you said?
MURPHY: (Laughs) It was something about atoms… No, I do remember. I had a vague conceptual grasp on all the science of the movie, but there’s no point in wasting time on that stuff because you can’t in six months even begin to have a grasp on quantum mechanics. My job was to go after the humanity. So that stuff becomes mechanical.
It’s like writing all the equations, it becomes like hieroglyphics and there’s something very soothing about writing those equations. I was talking to Matt Damon about it as well, he did it in Good Will Hunting, and you just learn them and forget what they mean, but it’s very satisfying to write them.
DEADLINE: Talking about the humanity, what is it actors say about not having to like the character…
MURPHY: You have to have some empathy I think. What was pretty clear with Oppenheimer, there was no judgement. It was really interesting, for me one of the ways in was the intellect, and I firmly believe – a lot of his contemporaries would argue that he was the most brilliant of all of those men of that generation, those scientists — I believe it’s actually a burden not a gift to be that brilliant. So that was a way in for me, and then also it’s pretty clear that when he was a kid he struggled a lot emotionally, psychologically and you can see that in the movie, there’s a lot of that in all the texts about him.
I think he was forming himself in his 20s and 30s, self-consciously doing that. Then the relationship with Kitty (Oppenheimer’s wife played by Blunt) is very interesting. You know they say that you never really know what makes a relationship, but that relationship sustained. There was some interdependence there that was key to both of their lives, they needed each other; it was highly dysfunctional but it sustained.
DEADLINE: What do you think about the timeliness of the movie? There’s stuff in there that makes one think about climate change and then the whole warning that this will keep escalating… What parallels do you see?
MURPHY: I’m always very careful about giving messages with work because I don’t think that’s the job of the movie – the job of the movie is to ask the question not to give the answers. I think it’s clear for anyone who’s interested in geopolitics, what’s happening in the world today – the movie is scarily kind of relevant and just as we began shooting, Russia invaded Ukraine and there was all this nuclear sabre rattling which is still continuing.
But, yeah, I think it should provoke. I think it’s a very provocative film. What happened in ’45 changed history, changed the world. We’re all living in a nuclear age now. Whether you decide to think about it or not, it’s there and I think this film is very entertaining and very stimulating, but it should exercise people if they so wish to go out and read about it and to educate themselves and to actually know about that, the threat that we live under continuously.
DEADLINE: This cast is so jammed with incredible talent, can you talk about working with all these different actors?
MURPHY: It was ridiculous. Like I said, we work so fast and I was so in it and I was on every single day, just like this train that had left the station and there was no getting off and we were going at such a pace and I was so consumed by the whole thing. But you’d look at the call sheet and go ‘Oh fuck, tomorrow it’s a scene with Ken Branagh’ or ‘Tomorrow it’s a scene with Gary Oldman’ or ‘We’ve got a big huge scene with Downey’ and it was kind of every actor’s dream to be able to work… There’s no resting, you’re just pushing yourself all the time trying to match these incredible actors. What I love about Chris, I think he always casts movies immaculately.
Now on this you could say ‘Oh, there’s just a bunch of movie stars.’ But the fact is, they’re all playing people of consequence, like every single one of them is a very consequential person. So, to have a big movie star in there makes total total sense, but everybody mucked in.
On Chris’ sets there’s no individual trailers, there’s no individual make-up, everything is just very old school and it think everyone was delighted to be back, it felt like independent movie making on a huge scale.
But the day with Gary for example, that was just a gift; it was just a total gift and we tried it loads of different ways. We had a whole day to do it and obviously he knows Chris from before and I’d worked with him briefly on one of the Batman movies and I’m a huge fan, but when you get in a room with all of these big movie stars, ultimately it just comes down to people who are at work trying to do the best they can. Every single one of them was incredibly generous and focused and there for Chris. I think it also shows the amount of respect Chris has in the business, everyone wants to turn up to do the movie, whatever size the part – it was a blast.
DEADLINE: You’ve spoken a bit about Oppenheimer’s naiveté, can you elaborate on that?
MURPHY: I thought it was naive of him to think that you could create this genocidal weapon and think that it would end all wars or that governments and countries would work together to restrict nuclear armament or proliferation and I think we all see now that was incredibly naive, but that’s what makes him so fascinating – that he could be this brilliant and then feel that way about this creation. It’s just part of his personality in general – he was so complicated in his relationship with people, they were very, very tricky – he was so kind of contradictory, that’s the word that keeps coming up.
DEADLINE: The hearing scenes with Jason Clarke as the prosecutor were so intense – I’ve met Jason a number of times and like him, but I really kind of wanted to punch his character…
MURPHY: (Laughs) Well that was my favorite part of making the film cause that came right at the end and we shot that in like two or three weeks but it was very intense and we were in this tiny, tiny little room – it was not a set, it was this outrageously tiny bureaucratic shitty place somewhere in LA and you have this huge IMAX camera and all these brilliant actors and it felt a little bit to me like the old days, like making theater. There was this troupe of actors that would come in every day and we’d really just go at it. I remember those particular scenes with Jason – particularly the last sort of cross examination that he grills Oppenheimer with at the end – and Chris was just pushing us and pushing us and pushing us and that’s the stuff that I love – you know those big, meaty, meaty scenes.
DEADLINE: Emily and Matt recently mentioned that you didn’t join the cast for dinners when shooting the Los Alamos scenes. Was that an effort to just stay in the zone?
MURPHY: I’ve talked to all of those guys about this, when you get one of those huge roles of a lifetime – which this felt like it was one of those for me – you become consumed by it, it takes up all of your waking time and it’s all you think about. You’re just preparing all the time. I just didn’t really have room for it in my head, for having a crack and having fun. Yeah, I was trying to skip meals and reduce calorie intake, but it was just a decision. It’s not that I’m an unsociable person, I loved hanging out with these guys now on the tour, we’re great pals. It’s just focus – you just want to focus on the work. And sleep becomes vitally important cause you’re working every single day and you’re up before dawn, you just want to get as much sleep as possible.
DEADLINE: In the final scenes when Oppenheimer is older, did that make you wonder if that’s what you’ll look like?
MURPHY: I guess so, there’s a little preview for my wife. It’s amazing what it does to the actor because it’s like a mask and that’s what actors do, right? But when you actually put on the physical mask it’s incredible, and the work of those prosthetic artists is so detailed it’s staggering. I wouldn’t like to do a job every day which involved hours and hours in the chair – that was five or six hours for two days – but I salute their work because it’s extraordinary.
DEADLINE: The reactions have been great, and you’ve been racing about between Paris and London, what are you taking away from the response?
MURPHY: The response has been insanely good and we’re so proud of it. We were at the premiere in Paris and after the movie finished all the audience stayed there talking. It was amazing, they just stayed and were talking because it does that, it has that effect on people. That’s what I’m excited about cause it’s made for the audience and I think they really get something out of it.
My 15-year-old son saw it and I know a lot of kids want to see it which is great; I think there’s going to be a lot of discussion about this movie when the world can finally see it.
DEADLINE: You’re not super fond of promoting yourself; you don’t do that many interviews…
MURPHY: (Laughs) I’m getting better at it, Nancy, c’mon!
DEADLINE: I know, and I’m grateful that you always make time for me, but you haven’t been on this sort of tour before with you front and center. In an interview we did a little while back, you referred to yourself as a kind of ‘weirdo hermit’ so I wonder how the promotion has been for you and being out amongst so many people…
MURPHY: Here’s the thing, I like talking about work and promoting work that I’m really proud of. The distinction I make is that I’m not so comfortable being a personality or just talking about myself or being analyzed by people, that isn’t my favorite thing. But I adore talking about this film because I think it’s incredibly special and I really want to get people to go see it in the cinema cause I think they’ll have a really excellent experience.
DEADLINE: You physically live far away from the industry – what does that do for you in terms of your work and making choices?
MURPHY: We did live in London for 14 years, it was a big chunk of my life from my mid 20s to my late 30s. I really enjoyed it, it was really exciting, it’s a great city, but the move to Dublin wasn’t motivated by wanting to distance myself from the industry. I was purely motivated by wanting to come home to Ireland and raise our kids as Irish and be near our families.
I think the world we live in now, you’re proof of it as well, you can do your work remotely and the work will come to you. I don’t believe that you have to live in Los Angeles or New York or London to make good work; it means you have to travel a little more, but it hasn’t affected my work or professional life in any way. It just means that when I stop working, I’m not surrounded by it and that to me is healthy.
DEADLINE: I imagine at home people are just used to seeing you walking the dog or whatever, but when you get recognized by a fan, what do they talk about the most?
MURPHY: Oh, Peaky Blinders, inevitably. Which is great. The show is a kind of global phenomenon and we never expected it; I mean you know how it grew, you were there, you saw it. I feel really proud of it and that’s the thing about television, it’s continually growing an audience and people are rewatching it. I mean, it’s kind of staggering how popular the thing is still.
DEADLINE: What did you think about footage of you as Tommy being used in a video posted by the Ron De Santis campaign?
MURPHY: Well, Steve (Knight, Peaky Blinders creator) texted me and said, ‘We’ve got to put out a statement.’ I thought it was a very well written statement. We just don’t want to be associated with that sort of awful rhetoric.
DEADLINE: Conversely, there’s a scene in season three of Ted Lasso that uses the Peaky theme song “Red Right Hand” in what seems to be a complete hat tip to you guys.
MURPHY: That’s the weird thing, you know?, people have Peaky Blinders weddings, people have Peaky Blinders tattoos. I still haven’t figured it out – it’s still kind of bizarre to me, but it’s wonderful. It means that we did something good.
DEADLINE: Are there people you meet that make you geek out?
MURPHY: Musicians, yeah, I do, cause I’m a frustrated musician, you know, and I rarely get to meet them, but I’m still in awe of them and what they do.
DEADLINE: And you’re still never going to release any of the music you’ve done?
MURPHY: (Laughs), No, no way.
DEADLINE: What’s the status of the film you’re producing and starring in, Small Things Like These?
MURPHY: We wrapped that in March; we’re just cutting it, we’re in that post-production stage. I’m really happy with it, it was a great experience. It was kind of weirdly related to Oppenheimer because I met Matt on Oppenheimer and they were just setting up Artists Equity and I pitched him the story of the film. So that was the lovely kind of bit of serendipity on that movie. I really admire the philosophy of that company which is artists-led. I’m really proud of it, so hopefully it’ll be I guess next year at this stage.
DEADLINE: You’ve said in past you like to take maybe six months off between projects…
MURPHY: Yeah, that’s kind of ideal. I mean, I love not working, and I also feel that, you know, people talk about research, I think the best research is just being a normal human being and citizen – that’s how you learn about life. All actors are like emotional detectives, so it’s like, I just love looking at people and observing people and just being in the world and I think that’s how you properly research.
DEADLINE: I imagine you’ll work with Chris again, but now that you’ve done a lead for him, would you go back to playing ‘shivering solider’?
MURPHY: Sure, like I’ve said it from the beginning, I’ll always turn up for Chris. I’m such a fan of his movies, I was a fan of his movies before I ever met him – they’re the sort of movies that I love watching – so it’s been a privilege to get to work with him six times. I’ll turn up for anything Chris wants me to do, I’m there.
DEADLINE: You’ve told me before that it’s the writing that attracts you to a project. Oppenheimer is in part about a legacy left behind – and a devastating one at that. Do you ever think about your own legacy in terms of the choices you make?
MURPHY: I think it’s a little dangerous to start thinking about legacies. My career has always been incredibly haphazard and incredibly arbitrary, incredibly unplanned. The one constant that you mentioned is the writing. I think since I was a kid I’ve loved story, and I’m still a big reader and I love watching movies, and good stories are my kind of North Star. That’s what I follow. The budget or the medium is secondary to the story always.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktaW50ZXJ2aWV3LW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLTEyMzU0NDMyMzUv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy9jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1pbnRlcnZpZXctb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tMTIzNTQ0MzIzNS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"Who is Cillian Murphy, the magnetic star of Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer'?","Irish actor Cillian Murphy has been hiding in plain sight, having done around 50 movies and a dozen TV shows including Netflix's ""Peaky Blinders.""","Christopher Nolan’s hit film “Oppenheimer” rides on the slight but sturdy shoulders of Irish actor Cillian Murphy.
And that’s Cillian with a hard K – get to know it.
Murphy’s performance as physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led development of the atomic bomb that ended World War II, is one that may explode his fame, going from “I know I’ve seen him somewhere” status to Oscar-contending familiar face.
Not that Murphy, 47, is eager for the spotlight to grow hotter.
“Honestly, this may sound predictable, but I don’t think about that sort of stuff,” Murphy told USA TODAY in an interview before the start of the Screen Actors Guild strike. “It’s not going to do you any good. I just think about the work.”
Here’s a primer on one of this summer’s acting supernovas:
Who is Cillian Murphy?
Murphy grew up in a suburb of Cork, Ireland, and was active in plays as a teen. He first appeared on the big screen in 2001 in the film adaptation of an Irish play he starred in called “Disco Pigs.”
That was followed a year later by a haunting performance in Danny Boyle’s zombie thriller “28 Days Later.” Murphy has appeared in about 50 movies and half a dozen television shows.
In 2004, Murphy married his longtime girlfriend, Yvonne McGuinness; the couple have two teenage sons. Murphy and his family live in Dublin, deliberately far from Hollywood. He is notoriously shy of the red carpet and prefers the relative anonymity of his native Ireland.
What is Cillian Murphy’s biggest role to date?
If there’s a hint of recognition from movie and TV fans when they see Murphy’s face, that’s probably because of his star turn in the Netflix series “Peaky Blinders,” a drama based on the exploits of a British crime gang that operated after World War I. Murphy played Thomas Shelby, leader of the Birmingham flat cap brigade, in the series, which was among Netflix's most popular at the time.
Have Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan collaborated before?
Many times. In fact, Murphy has been a go-to pick for Nolan in six movies, but this latest, “Oppenheimer,” is the first time Murphy has taken the lead role.
Their collaborations include Murphy’s performance as the Scarecrow in three Batman movies, “Batman Begins” (2005), “The Dark Knight” (2008) and “The Dark Knight Rises” (2012).
In 2010, Murphy played the role of a business tycoon’s heir in “Inception,” and in 2017 he played a shell-shocked solider in the World War II historical epic “Dunkirk.”
Why did Christopher Nolan pick Cillian Murphy for the role of Oppenheimer?
Nolan says he never writes a movie script with specific actors in mind. But when he was staring at the cover of the book “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin, from which “Oppenheimer” is adapted, he knew who his leading man would be.
“I saw that photo (of Robert Oppenheimer) on the cover of the book, with that intense blue-eyed stare, and I thought, 'I know who can do this,' ” Nolan says. “I called him and said: ‘This is the one. You’ll take center stage and carry the audience with you.’ ”
Murphy at first was terrified, Nolan says. In a good way. “He was frightened to just the right degree. He knew he had to do a lot of work, and you’re looking for that in an artist. I didn’t want an imitation. I was looking for our interpretation of this man.”
What was Cillian Murphy’s reaction to seeing 'Oppenheimer' for the first time?
Murphy says he was “emotionally winded” after screening the completed three-hour film, which was shot in 70mm IMAX.
“I was knocked out really. It’s hard to take it all in,” he says. “It was a movie that I felt grabbed me by the throat and didn’t let go for three hours. I believe it’s Chris’s magnum opus.”
Will Murphy see 'Barbie,' the other part of the 'Barbenheimer' blockbuster movie weekend?
“For sure, 100%,” Murphy says. “I’m a fan of (“Barbie” director) Greta Gerwig, of (lead actress Margot) Robbie and Ryan (Gosling, who plays Ken).”
Murphy says his teenage sons “keep showing me these things on social media where people are saying they’re going to go to one movie and then straight into the other, and I think that’s just great for our industry.”
The 'Barbenheimer’ phenomenon:How a movie meme inspired the 'crazy, weird' double feature
What’s next for Cillian Murphy?
Murphy has produced and acts in an upcoming movie called “Small Things Like These,” based on the award-winning historical novel by Irish writer Claire Keegan.
The movie follows a small-town Irish coal merchant, Bill Furlong (Murphy), who on a delivery to a convent discovers a haunting secret that forces him to confront his own and his town’s past.
With that wrapped up, might a relaxing break be next for the exacting actor, whose on-set intensity echoes that of British-born and Ireland-homesteading acting giant, three-time Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis?
“I’m not great at taking vacations, man,” Murphy says. “But maybe that’s why I only do a film a year. It takes too much out of me.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L21vdmllcy8yMDIzLzA3LzIxL2NpbGxpYW4tbXVycGh5LW1vdmllcy1hbmQtdHYtc2hvd3Mtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc3Rhci83MDQyNzU0NDAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Stars including Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt have walked the red carpet in London for the eagerly-awaited UK premiere of Oppenheimer.
Christopher Nolan's much-hyped movie tells the story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer, known for developing the atomic bomb.
Rami Malek, Florence Pugh and Robert Downey Jr are also among its big names.
But several stars left the premiere early, because of strike action called on Thursday evening.
Director Nolan told the audience before the screening of the film that ""unfortunately they've left to write their picket signs"".
Hollywood actors began their strike after talks between their union and major studios and streaming giants broke down. Writers in Hollywood are already taking industrial action - and a ""double strike"" such as this has not been seen since the 1960s and could bring the industry to a halt, as well as disrupting Oppenheimer's New York premiere on Monday.
Crowds gathered to watch the movie's makers and stars walk the red carpet, joined by celebrities including actor Jefferson Hall, acting husband-and-wife Josh Hartnett and Tamsin Egerton, and singer Sam Ryder.

Speaking on the red carpet, Murphy told BBC News there was a ""great atmosphere"" in London, and ""the response to the movie has been extraordinary"".
Many of the stars told the BBC they were drawn to the film because of director Nolan. ""There's a reason we all say that, it's just he's making the best movies right now,"" said Damon. ""It's a thrill to get a call from him.""
The premiere at the Odeon in Leicester Square comes ahead of the movie's release in the UK next Friday.
It comes the day after Wednesday night's premiere of Barbie, which is also out on 21 July. Because of the contrast between the two films and the same release date, many fans are planning to watch both, in what has been dubbed Barbenheimer.

2023-07-26 13:49:09+00:00,"Cillian Murphy Says Losing Batman Role Was ‘For the Best,’ Was on a List to Play Oppenheimer 9 Years Before Christopher Nolan’s Film","Cillian Murphy says losing the role of Batman to Christian Bale was ""for the best.""","Before Christian Bale landed the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne in Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight” trilogy, the filmmaker screen-tested his “Oppenheimer” star Cillian Murphy. Both men have since admitted that Murphy was never a real threat to steal the part from Bale, and Murphy told GQ Magazine UK in a recent interview that it “was for the best” that Bale won the coveted role over him anyway.
“Yes, I think it was for the best because we got Christian Bale’s performance, which is a stunning interpretation of that role,” Murphy said. “I never considered myself as the right physical specimen for Batman. To me, it was always going to be Christian Bale.”
Nolan didn’t think Murphy was right for the part either, but he still screen-tested him for Batman so that executives at Warner Bros. could see what an amazing actor he was. The director wanted Murphy to play the film’s villain, Scarecrow, but Murphy wasn’t exactly a huge movie star. The previous formula for Batman movies was that a big star played the hero’s villain, but Nolan wanted to shake things up.
“Everybody was so excited by watching [Cillian] perform that when I then said to them, ‘Okay, Christian Bale is Batman, but what about Cillian to play Scarecrow?’ There was no dissent,” Nolan recently told Entertainment Weekly. “All the previous Batman villains had been played by huge movie stars: Jack Nicholson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Carrey, that kind of thing. That was a big leap for them and it really was purely on the basis of that test. So that’s how you got to play Scarecrow.”
“Batman Begins” would be the first of six collaborations between Nolan and Murphy. He reprised Scarecrow in two more Batman movies and then had supporting roles in “Inception” and “Dunkirk” before landing his first Nolan lead role in “Oppenheimer.” It turns out Murphy was eyed to play the theoretical physicist almost a decade before Nolan’s biographical drama.
In a recent Vanity Fair story, television creator Sam Shaw looked back at the making of his WGN America series “Manhattan.” The period drama covered the same ground as Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” in telling the story of the Manhattan Project’s efforts to build the first atomic bomb in Los Alamos, N.M. The acclaimed series ran for two seasons in 2014 and 2016. Oppenheimer was a recurring character on the show played by Daniel London, but series writer Lila Byock said Murphy was on the team’s wish list.
“When we were casting Oppenheimer, we went through a whole series of different ideas,” Byock said, before adding, “A thousand percent, Cillian Murphy was on that list.”
“We wanted Oppenheimer to feel both like he possessed a certain undeniable charisma, a presence onstage, but also that he was playing a different instrument,” Shaw said. “He needed to feel alien — or other — in some ways. He stood out.”
Nearly 10 years later, Murphy is finally Oppenehimer and earning the best reviews of his career.

2023-07-14 20:45:34+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’ First Reactions Praise Cillian Murphy’s ‘Mesmerizing’ Performance in Christopher Nolan’s ‘Spectacular’ Epic,"The first reactions to Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" are already calling Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr. Oscar nominees.","The explosive first reactions to Christopher Nolan‘s WWII epic “Oppenheimer” have lit the internet ablaze.
The film hosted its world premiere in Paris, shortly before the cast walked out of the U.K. premiere amid the SAG-AFTRA strike being announced July 14. “Oppenheimer” is set to debut in theaters July 20 and stars Cillian Murphy as the titular father of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer. Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr. are among the star-studded ensemble cast.
Writer-director Nolan used real explosions in lieu of CGI to mimic the first detonation of the atomic bomb during the Trinity Test. The entire film was shot in IMAX. “Oppenheimer” is inspired by 2005 book “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin and centers on Manhattan Project leader J. Robert Oppenheimer (Murphy) as he grapples with the moral repercussions of creating the bomb.
Murphy’s co-star Damon called his performance a “marathon” of sorts to balance the genius physicist’s academic and personal lives. And critics agree: Empire magazine editor Nick de Semlyen tweeted, “‘Oppenheimer’ is a roaring beast of a film, largely set in research labs but feeling like an odyssey into hell. Cillian Murphy is mesmerizing, and Nolan is at full power; it feels like the film itself becomes radiation-poisoned as it goes on. A bleak triumph.”
Criterion writer Christina Newland added, “Cillian Murphy is genuinely so incredible here. Just operating at such a level of fragility and haunted knowingness and arrogant bravado; a performance as complex as the subject deserves.”
New York Magazine critic Bilge Ebiri called the film “incredible” and cited its “fearsome” approach to the weighty subject matter. “A relentlessly paced, insanely detailed, intricate historical drama that builds and builds and builds until Nolan brings the hammer down in the most astonishing, shattering way,” Ebiri tweeted.
The Playlist journalist Gregory Ellwood especially cited Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr.’s respective performances, saying Downey especially gave a career-best. AP film writer Lindsey Bahr wrote that she was “lucky” to have seen “Oppenheimer” in 70mm IMAX, which was a “once in a lifetime experience.”

Totally absorbed in OPPENHEIMER, a dense, talkie, tense film partly about the bomb, mostly about how doomed we are. Happy summer!

I was skeptical, but Oppenheimer has stuck with me since seeing it last week. Yes, it's 3 hours, but in a dense-Scorsese way and the last 20 minutes (why Emily Blunt clearly took the role) bring its three narrative threads to a moving conclusion.

,Cillian Murphy admits he was a mess after watching Interstellar,"'Oppenheimer' stars Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt reveal their favorite Christopher Nolan movies.","Ask four random people to name their favorite Christopher Nolan film and you might get four different answers. Ask the four main stars of Nolan's new movie Oppenheimer (out July 21) that question and that's definitely the case, as EW discovers when Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr. share their take on his filmography (even Nolan himself offers a suggestion) during our latest Around the Table conversation.
""I love Dunkirk,"" says Blunt. ""I've seen that, like, 20 times.""
""My wife and I watched The Prestige, I think, four days in a row when it came out,"" says Damon. ""But I love Inception as well. That's kind of an impossible question. It's like saying, what's your favorite Hitchcock movie?""

""You're in all of them,"" Blunt says to Murphy, whose professional relationship with Nolan dates back to 2005's Batman Begins in which the actor played the role of Dr. Jonathan Crane.
""No, I'm not,"" the actor politely corrects. ""I remember seeing Interstellar in IMAX, on my own. I just remember coming out in a terrible state. It was so emotional.""
""Did no one else want to watch it with you?"" jokes Blunt.
""I love escaping from the house,"" says Murphy. ""My kids were little. But it's so emotional, that movie, that always gets me every time.""
Cillian Murphy in 'Dunkirk'. Everett Collection
""I can't answer the question but I want to make the case for Dunkirk,"" says Nolan, who cast Murphy in the film as the survivor of a U-boat attack named in the credits as ""Shivering soldier."" ""When I sent Cillian the script, he wasn't entirely enthusiastic about playing the character. You actually called me up and went like, 'Sure, I'll do it because I want to work with you, but couldn't I be a Spitfire pilot instead?' And I said 'No, I need you out on that boat.' So I convinced you, and then you're out on the boat, and you're diving in the water off the wreck, and feeling more and more miserable about it all. The character doesn't have a name, all that. But cut to a couple years later, I went to buy the box set of Peaky Blinders and on the back it said: Cillian 'Dunkirk' Murphy. I was like, job done!""
It's a good answer. But Downey has an arguably better one.
""Many people will say this is your greatest film and a culmination of aspects of every film you've ever done,"" says the actor to Nolan. ""So it's almost like Good Will Hunting: You've made this equation where you're now at the end of the chalkboard, and what the heck would you do next? But we believe in you, sir. So my favorite film of yours is whatever the heck you do after this, because you'd better come up with something amazing.""
Oppenheimer stars Murphy as theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called ""father of the atomic bomb."" Blunt plays Oppenheimer's wife Kitty; Damon portrays General Leslie Groves, the man responsible for putting Oppenheimer in charge of the Manhattan Project; and Downey is Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss.

2023-07-27 00:50:29+00:00,Movie review: Christopher Nolan ventures out of his element in 'Oppenheimer',"Christopher Nolan is a legendary director, with his filmography — including renowned movies such as “Inception,” “The Dark Knight” and “Interstellar” — having gained distinction because of his passion for developing visually and auditorily stunning films. The consequence of his painstaking commitment to his style is a lack of substance at times — a heavy criticism of “Tenet,” Nolan’s most recently released film prior to “Oppenheimer.” While “Oppenheimer” fits right in with his best work at times, it occasionally falls into the exact same pitfalls that hold his other movies back from being full-on masterpieces.","Christopher Nolan is a legendary director, with his filmography — including renowned movies such as “Inception,” “The Dark Knight” and “Interstellar” — having gained distinction because of his passion for developing visually and auditorily stunning films. The consequence of his painstaking commitment to his style is a lack of substance at times — a heavy criticism of “Tenet,” Nolan’s most recently released film prior to “Oppenheimer.”
While “Oppenheimer” fits right in with his best work at times, it occasionally falls into the exact same pitfalls that hold his other movies back from being full-on masterpieces.
“Oppenheimer,” starring Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, details the life of the “father of the atomic bomb” as he races to assemble a team of scientists and develop the infamous weapon before rival scientists in enemy countries. Amid this already monumental challenge, he struggles with accusations of being a communist ally and an increasingly complicated personal life.
The story can’t reasonably be criticized, as it is a cinematic retelling of Oppenheimer’s real life, but the way Nolan chooses to tell the story is somewhat questionable.
Nolan is known for directing blockbusters like superhero movies, and “Oppenheimer” can sometimes feel like a superhero origin story rather than a true biopic. Cameos and name drops of famous scientists are shot like easter eggs viewers might expect to see in a Marvel film; moreover, the dialogue features quips and one-liners that seem thoroughly out of place.
“Oppenheimer” is at its best when it focuses on Murphy’s brilliant performance and the deep dive into Oppenheimer’s psychology, more akin to the individualistic character study expected of a biopic.
An issue Nolan runs into even in his most successful movies is the repeated use of female characters’ suffering to bring emotional depth to his main characters — a martyrized manic pixie dream girl of sorts.
“Oppenheimer” is based on a true story, so Nolan didn’t write these characters from scratch, but he did purposefully select what parts of their real-life story to show. While Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) is developed well, the treatment of Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), his first love and on-and-off-again relationship, is shockingly disappointing for someone so important to Oppenheimer’s story.
She has very limited scenes — a shame in and of itself because of Pugh’s stage presence — and when she does appear, she acts more as a hardship for Oppenheimer to overcome rather than her own distinct person. Nolan neglects not only to pay much attention to Tatlock’s own accomplishments as a brilliant scientist but also her struggles with her sexuality, a defining characteristic of her own life as well as of her relationship with Oppenheimer.
In doing so, he takes a complex real-world person and makes her one-dimensional. In fact, it’s almost implied Tatlock’s struggles with mental health weren’t due to the pressure of being a non-heteronormative person in the 1940s, but rather because of her failing relationship with Oppenheimer.
While the movie is ultimately an Oppenheimer biopic and not a Jean Tatlock biopic, you’d think that a person arguably more consequential to Oppenheimer’s life than his own wife would be treated with the care she deserves, especially when failing to do so sacrifices historical accuracy.
Another common struggle of Nolan’s that is seen again in “Oppenheimer” is his approach to pacing. The movie actually moves through Oppenheimer’s life fairly quickly; however, Nolan chooses to show so much of the story that the plot still seems slow at times, especially due to the immense number of time jumps back and forth through Oppenheimer’s career.
For instance, if the ignition of the Trinity test — the first atomic bomb ever dropped and the culmination of Oppenheimer’s life’s work — was the peak of action and build-up in the movie, “Oppenheimer” might have one of the longest third acts in all of cinema.
The second half of the movie deals with a series of trials faced by Oppenheimer and adjacent scientists, soldiers and politicians. While it is extremely tense and enjoyable in a manner reminiscent of political dramas, what audiences came to see had already exploded by then, and the film’s remainder may drag for those less interested in the politics of it all.
Nolan urged the film community to see “Oppenheimer” in specific formats leading up to its release, saying that IMAX 70mm is the way he intended it to be seen. However, only 19 theaters with the capacity to show IMAX 70mm exist in the entire United States, so the option to see it as Nolan intended isn’t viable for most people.
While Nolan and other experts said audiences would still enjoy it in other theaters, a question must be asked when the needle is pushed from a movie being an engaging narrative to a sensory spectacle. The best movies should be able to be enjoyed anywhere, simply accentuated by the magic of a theater.
While “Oppenheimer” is without a doubt entertaining, it does feel as though the correlation between the size of the screen it is viewed on and the overall audience experience is far too intertwined.
“Oppenheimer” is simultaneously emblematic of Nolan’s greatest strengths and weaknesses, but it can never be faulted for a lack of spectacle. It should be criticized out of respect for its ambition; great works of art intrinsically invite criticism due to the boundaries they have to push. “Oppenheimer” grips the audience with its unique blend of psychological despair and American patriotism, and despite its faults, is still a spectacle worth seeing on the big screen.

,"Cillian Murphy, Playing Oppenheimer, Finally Gets to Lead a Christopher Nolan Film","The day Christopher Nolan called Cillian Murphy about his new film, “Oppenheimer,” Murphy hung up the phone in disbelief.","The day Christopher Nolan called Cillian Murphy about his new film, “Oppenheimer,” Murphy hung up the phone in disbelief.
The Irish actor, though a regular presence in Nolan films going back almost two decades, had always been a supporting player. This time, Nolan wanted him to lead.
“He’s so understated and self-deprecating and, in his very English manner, just said, ‘Listen, I’ve written this script, it’s about Oppenheimer. I’d like you to be my Oppenheimer,’” Murphy, 47, told The Associated Press earlier this year. “It was a great day.”
For Murphy, it is never not exciting to get a call from Nolan. It’s just hard to predict if he’s going to. He knows there are some movies he’s right for and some movies he isn’t.
“I have always said publicly and privately, to Chris, that if I’m available and you want me to be in a movie, I’m there. I don’t really care about the size of the part,” he said. “But deep down, secretly, I was desperate to play a lead for him.”

Murphy first met Nolan in 2003. He was brought in to screen test for Batman — not just the movie, the character. Murphy knew he wasn’t right for the Dark Knight, but he wanted to meet the man who’d directed “Insomnia” and “Memento.” They hit it off and Murphy got to tap into a sinister intensity to play the corrupt psychiatrist Dr. Crane/Scarecrow, who would go on to appear in all three films. Nolan would also call on Murphy to be the conflicted heir to a business empire in “Inception” and a traumatized soldier in “Dunkirk.”
“We have this long-standing understanding and trust and shorthand and respect,” Murphy said. “It felt like the right time to take on a bigger responsibility. And it just so happened that it was a f---ing huge one.”
Soon after the phone call, Nolan flew to Dublin to meet Murphy and hand him a physical copy of the script, which he devoured right there in Nolan’s hotel room. It was, he said, the best he’d ever read.
Then the scale of it started to sink in.
This would be a film about the charismatic and controversial theoretical physicist who helped create the atomic bomb. Oppenheimer and his peers at Los Alamos would test it on July 16, 1945, not knowing what was going to happen. There was a non-zero chance that the heat from the explosion could set off a chain reaction that would ignite the atmosphere and literally set the world on fire.
It didn’t, but several weeks later the United States would drop those bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing tens of thousands of people and leaving many with lifelong injuries. Soon, the United States was at work to strengthen its nuclear arsenal, developing plans to work on an even more catastrophic weapon: the hydrogen bomb.
As Nolan has said, “Like it or not J. Robert Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived.”
“Oppenheimer,” which opens in theaters on July 21, features a starry cast including Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty, Matt Damon as the man who hired Oppenheimer for the job at Los Alamos, Robert Downey Jr. as a founder of the Atomic Energy Commission and many more rounding out the pivotal players in and around this tense moment in history.
“You realize this is a huge responsibility. He was complicated and contradictory and so iconic,” Murphy said. “But you know you’re with one of the great directors of all time. I felt confident going into it with Chris. He’s had a profound impact on my life, creatively and professionally. He’s offered me very interesting roles over and I’ve found all of them really challenging. And I just love being on his sets.”
Murphy continued: “Any actor would want to be on a Chris Nolan set, just to see how it works and to witness his command of the language of film and the mechanics of film and how he’s able to use that broad canvas within the mainstream studio system to make these very challenging human stories.”
Over the years, Murphy has come to appreciate that with Nolan there’s always something deeper to discover than what’s literally on the page. “Dunkirk,” he recalled, was only 70 pages and there wasn’t much to his character, not even a name.
“He said, ‘Look, let’s figure it out together and you and me can find an emotional journey for the character.’ And we did it. We did it out in the water on that boat. That comes from trust and respect,” Murphy said. “I’m really proud of that performance.”
As with all Nolan endeavors, secrecy around “Oppenheimer” is vitally important. Murphy loves the “old-fashioned approach” that builds interest and anticipation.
“There’s an awful lot to talk about when we can talk freely,” Murphy said with a smile.
The difference from other Nolan originals, even “Dunkirk,” is that “Oppenheimer” is rooted in historical fact and actual transcripts. You can read the book it’s based on, Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.” You can watch the 1981 documentary “The Day After Trinity” on The Criterion Channel.
And you can try to parse Nolan’s words for clues. He’s talked about recreating the Trinity test, the fascinating paradoxes, the twists, turns and ethical dilemmas; for him, the story is cinematic and both dream and nightmare. But ultimately, it’s something that just needs to be seen.
“The question will be how Chris presents it,” Murphy said. “I think people will be very surprised and wowed by what he does. Anything I say will just seem a bit lame as compared to seeing this in an IMAX theater.”
The time for discussions will be after the movie comes out. But Murphy did offer up that they worked hard to get Oppenheimer’s look right, from the narrow silhouette to the pipe and the porkpie hat. Oppenheimer, he said, “seemed aware of his own potential mythology.” But, again, those conversations will have to wait.
“I’m really proud of the movie and I’m really proud of what Chris has achieved. This was, for sure, a special one, certainly because of the history with me and Chris. We were not walking around the set high-fiving, but it did feel special.” Murphy said. “It’s an event every time he releases a film, and rightly so. Whether I’m in them or not, I always go to see his movies.”

2023-07-11 15:07:17.008000+00:00,Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy are Embracing Barbenheimer,"Christopher Nolan tells IGN the Oppenheimer-Barbie cultural phenomenon 'Barbenheimer' is going to do great things for the moviegoing experience in a recent interview, and Cillian Murphy agrees.","The time is quickly coming upon us. What time, might you ask? The time of Barbenheimer, of course — and it looks as though the Oppenheimer cast and director Christopher Nolan are pretty excited about this head-to-head film event of the summer.
""Summer, in a healthy marketplace, is always crowded, and we've been doing this a long time,” the filmmaker told IGN when asked about sharing a release date with Barbie in a recent interview. “I think for those of us who care about movies, we've been really waiting to have a crowded marketplace again, and now it's here and that's terrific.""
""I'll be going to see Barbie 100%. I can't wait to see it!"" -Cillian Murphy pic.twitter.com/0pXqikGoJQ — IGN (@IGN) July 11, 2023
As for the film’s leading man, Cillian Murphy, he’s in agreement that the Oppenheimer-Barbie double header can only be a positive thing.
""I think it's great. I mean, I'll be going to see Barbie. I can't wait to see it,” the actor gushed to IGN during the same interview. “I think it's just great for the industry and for audiences that we have two amazing films by amazing filmmakers coming out the same day. Could spend a whole day in the cinema, what's better than that?""
To be fair, Barbenheimer, when made into a mashed-up word like that, seems way more complicated than it is. But at the end of the day, it’s simply just the hybrid term given to the fact that Greta Gerwig’s highly-anticipated film Barbie and Nolan’s equally-as-anticipated atomic bomb drama Oppenheimer both release in theaters on July 21 in the United States.
""I love the fact that people are talking about going to two movies in a weekend,” Matt Damon, who also stars in Oppenheimer, explained to IGN. “Ben [Affleck] and I used to go to two movies every weekend, and I think people should do that.""
“ I think it's great. I mean, I'll be going to see Barbie. I can't wait to see it
""And also the interest in the variety of what's available is so awesome,” Emily Blunt, another famous face who is part of the star-studded Oppenheimer cast, noted to IGN during the interview. “It's awesome.""
Notably, the Barbenheimer concept has totally blown up in the zeitgeist, taking it from a quippy descriptor for a double feature at the cinema to a phenomenon spawning memes, merch, and an overall connection to the moviegoing experience that has been largely absent since the onset of COVID.
That said, which goes first in the unmissable double feature?
""Maybe Oppenheimer on the Saturday? Friday night? I don't know,"" Blunt mused before Damon asserted: ""I'd knock out Oppenheimer.""
But in Murphy’s opinion, fate is the best approach to setting up your Barbenheimer viewing plans. He smartly told IGN: ""Just flip a coin.""

2023-08-04 19:18:53+00:00,Cillian Murphy Says ‘Oppenheimer’ Deleted Scenes Don’t Exist: Christopher Nolan Doesn’t ‘Fiddle Around Trying to Change the Story’,"Don't get excited for an ""Oppenheimer"" director's cut.","“Oppenheimer” is Christopher Nolan’s longest movie at 180 minutes, but don’t expect it to get even longer whenever it arrives on home video. Neither a director’s cut of the atomic bomb epic nor deleted scenes from the movie exist, Cillian Murphy recently told Collider.
“There’s no deleted scenes in Chris Nolan movies,” Murphy added. “That’s why there are no DVD extras on his movies because the script is the movie. He knows exactly what’s going to end up – he’s not fiddling around with it trying to change the story. That is the movie.”
Nolan’s movies are often big-budget productions (“Oppenheimer” carried a $100 million price tag), and his decision to shoot on film doesn’t make things cheaper. Nolan goes into his film shoots knowing exactly what he needs to capture, nothing more and nothing less.
“I tend to try and weed things out on paper because it’s crazy expensive to shoot things that aren’t going to be in the film,” the director previously told MTV.com. “It also takes up a lot of time and energy. Pretty much with all my films, there are very few deleted scenes, which always disappoints the DVD crowd.”
At three hours, “Oppenheimer” has an Imax film print that weighs some 600 pounds and runs 11 miles long. He shot the movie using large format film cameras. Nolan told AP before the movie opened in theaters that the “best possible experience” for viewing “Oppenheimer” is the Imax 70mm film format. However, that format only exists in 25 theaters across North America.
“The sharpness and the clarity and the depth of the image is unparalleled,” Nolan said. “The headline, for me, is by shooting on Imax 70mm film, you’re really letting the screen disappear. You’re getting a feeling of 3D without the glasses. You’ve got a huge screen and you’re filling the peripheral vision of the audience. You’re immersing them in the world of the film.”
“Oppenheimer” has crossed the $400 million mark at the worldwide box office. The film is now playing nationwide from Universal Pictures.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItZGVsZXRlZC1zY2VuZXMtZG9udC1leGlzdC1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS0xMjM1Njg4MDIwL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItZGVsZXRlZC1zY2VuZXMtZG9udC1leGlzdC1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS0xMjM1Njg4MDIwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 14:30:00+00:00,We Need to Talk About Those ‘Oppenheimer’ Sex Scenes,"Perhaps the most surprising element of ‘Oppenheimer’ is its sex scenes, the first ones filmed by director Christopher Nolan.","The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry, and two films explore that abiding Robert Burns proverb this week: Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s IMAX-sized three-hour biopic of the “father of the atomic bomb,” and Barbie, a Mattel-sanctioned deconstruction of the patriarchy from the fertile mind of Greta Gerwig. Only one of these summer blockbusters, however, boasts a number of sex scenes, and it isn’t the one starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.
Oppenheimer explores the life and times of renowned theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (embodied by an admirably committed Cillian Murphy) through the twin prisms of his time as de facto leader of the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico, as the U.S. and its team of scientific avengers raced to create the first atomic bomb before the Nazis; and his 1954 security clearance hearings, where Congress sought to paint their erstwhile savior as a commie governed by anti-American hostilities and wanton sexual desire (ugly stereotypes all-too-commonly foisted on American Jews like Oppenheimer). There is also a black-and-white 1959 congressional hearing on the cabinet nomination of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr., never better), chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and a supposed friend of Oppenheimer’s, though the less said about this prolonged deviation the better.
We are treated to glimpses of Oppenheimer’s years teaching in the physics department at UC Berkeley, where he and his students made a number of valuable advances in the realms of quantum chemistry and molecular physics, and nuclear reactions in particular. This is where Oppenheimer, an attractive, slender man with piercing blue eyes, met Jean Tatlock (played by Florence Pugh), a young Stanford Medical School student and Communist Party member who wrote and reported for the Western Worker, a communist newspaper. Tatlock helped fuel Oppenheimer’s — or Oppie, as she would call him — interest in the field of psychology, as well as radical left-wing politics, and their passionate romance would eventually attract the interest of the FBI.

Early on in Oppenheimer, Professor Oppenheimer is introduced to Tatlock during a Communist Party get-together, and the two immediately click. Cut to a scene of a nude Pugh-as-Tatlock riding Murphy’s Oppie like the end of Dr. Strangelove, only to pause in the action when her eye catches a book on his shelf: the Bhagavad Gita, a Hindu scripture that was a favorite of Oppenheimer’s. She turns to a section and, as she is on top of him, has him read it to her: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds” — a line famously uttered by Oppenheimer about him and his terrifying creation during a 1965 TV broadcast. In lieu of capturing the intensity of Oppenheimer and Tatlock’s affair, it comes off as clumsy and unintentionally funny. Why is Tatlock making Oppenheimer read one of his most famous quotes back to her while fucking him?
Now, it is the first sex scene that Nolan has ever filmed, after all — Oppenheimer is the first Nolan flick to attract an R rating since 2002’s Insomnia due to its sex scenes — so perhaps we should cut him a bit of slack. I mean, who can forget Spielberg’s supercharged sex scene in 2006’s Munich, a baffling mélange of sweat, thrashing, terror, and climax-as-exorcism, set to a religious hymn and intercut with scenes of Israelis being gunned down during the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics by Palestinian militants. Shooting a good sex scene is a gift that can escape even some of our greatest filmmakers. Not everyone can be Nicolas Roeg. And Nolan appears well-aware of this.
“Any time you’re challenging yourself to work in areas you haven’t worked in before, you should be appropriately nervous and appropriately careful and planned and prepared,” Nolan told Insider about filming his first sex scenes.
He added, “When you look at Oppenheimer’s life and you look at his story, that aspect of his life, the aspect of his sexuality, his way with women, the charm that he exuded, it’s an essential part of his story… It felt very important to try to understand their relationship and to really see inside it and understand what made it tick without being coy or allusive about it — but to try to be intimate, to try and be in there with him and fully understand the relationship that was so important to him.” Related

Indeed, Oppenheimer was quite the ladies’ man. In addition to his romance with Tatlock, which is said to have lasted well into his marriage to Kitty (Emily Blunt), the film implies that he’d conducted an affair with Ruth Sherman Tolman (Louise Lombard), the wife of Oppenheimer’s pal Richard Tolman, a physicist who served as scientific advisor to Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) in the Manhattan Project. Their alleged affair is explored more in-depth in the 2013 book An Atomic Love Story: The Extraordinary Women in Robert Oppenheimer’s Life.
“Robert was seen dating a number of ‘mostly very attractive youngish girls,’” during his time at Berkeley, according to the Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, upon which Nolan’s film is based. “Among others, he had relationships with Haakon Chevalier’s sister-in-law, Ann Hoffman, and Estelle Caen, the sister of the San Francisco Chronicle’s columnist Herbert Caen. Bob Serber recalled a half-dozen girlfriends, including a British emigré named Sandra Dyer-Bennett. He broke several hearts. Still, whenever Tatlock phoned him in a low mood, he came to her and talked her out of her depression. They remained the closest of friends, and occasional lovers.”
After Tatlock broke things off with Oppenheimer, who’d proposed marriage to her at least twice, he met Kitty Harrison (née Peuning), who was married at the time to Stewart Harrison, a doctor. He rekindled his romance with Tatlock while married to Kitty, though refused to say goodbye to Tatlock before departing for Los Alamos.
In 1943, on a visit to Berkeley in the midst of the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer reunited with Tatlock – even though she was seeing his friend, a psychologist named Dr. Siegfried Bernfeld. He was monitored by agents of the military during their entire rendezvous, who later reported their findings to the FBI. According to American Prometheus, those findings were that: “‘On June 14, 1943, Oppenheimer traveled via Key Railway from Berkeley to San Francisco… where he was met by Jean Tatlock who kissed him.’” The two went out for dinner and drinks, and then to Tatlock’s apartment, where Oppenheimer wouldn’t emerge until 8:30 a.m. the next morning, and the FBI report noted that “the relationship of Oppenheimer and Tatlock appears to be very affectionate and intimate.”
As far as we know, he never saw her again after San Francisco.

Aside from this clandestine rendezvous, Pugh’s Tatlock disappears for much of Oppenheimer — save a scene during Oppenheimer’s 1954 security clearance hearings that has to be seen to be believed. Oppenheimer is being grilled by seedy congressmen over his allegiances, with the blowhards repeatedly claiming that Oppenheimer’s affair with the communist Tatlock during his marriage to Kitty, and his association with her communist friends, confirmed that his loyalty to America was precarious at best.
Blunt’s Kitty is in the room as Murphy’s Oppenheimer is being interrogated by these congressmen over Tatlock and we switch to her perspective, as she envisions Oppenheimer and Tatlock — naked — having sex right in front of her, in that very room, with Pugh’s nude Tatlock grinding on Oppie’s lap. Tatlock locks eyes with Kitty in this fantasy scenario, taunting her. You get what Nolan is attempting here — to convey Kitty’s jealousy over her husband’s extramarital tryst — but the scene is so wildly over-the-top that your eyes will roll back into your head.

There is much to admire in Nolan’s Oppenheimer. It is a staggering technical achievement, its score by Ludwig Göransson is dizzyingly alive, the compositions by Hoyte van Hoytema deserve to be taken in on the biggest screen possible, and its performances are stellar across the board (save Josh Hartnett and Benny Safdie’s distracting turns). The film is brimming with ambition, but its sex scenes — and the portrait of Oppenheimer and Tatlock’s relationship as a whole — could have used some work.
Tatlock, by then a doctor whose star was on the rise, took her own life in 1944. She had battled crippling bouts of depression. The name of the first nuclear test, “Trinity,” was reportedly made in tribute to her. It is a reference to a poem by the poet John Donne, whose work Tatlock had introduced to Oppie.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yb2xsaW5nc3RvbmUuY29tL3R2LW1vdmllcy90di1tb3ZpZS1mZWF0dXJlcy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1zZXgtc2NlbmVzLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLWNpbGxpYW4tbXVycGh5LWZsb3JlbmNlLXB1Z2gtamVhbi10YXRsb2NrLTEyMzQ3OTAxMTMv0gGbAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vdHYtbW92aWVzL3R2LW1vdmllLWZlYXR1cmVzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXNleC1zY2VuZXMtY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktZmxvcmVuY2UtcHVnaC1qZWFuLXRhdGxvY2stMTIzNDc5MDExMy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-24 19:10:00+00:00,"‘Barbie’ An Even Bigger Knockout With $356M+ Global Bow, ‘Oppenheimer’ Increases Genius To $180M+ WW Launch – International Box Office Actuals Update","Warner Bros’ Barbie and Universal’s Oppenheimer have delivered massive global box office debuts of $356M and $180M, respectively.","MONDAY UPDATE, with actuals: Actuals are in for the weekend’s behemoth double-bill with both movies seeing significant upticks now that Sunday is tallied. Warner Bros Barbie has come in with a $356.3M global launch through yesterday, versus the estimated $337M – talk about being in the pink. Meanwhile, Universal’s Oppenheimer charged to a $180.4M worldwide launch versus the $174.2M Sunday estimate.
While domestic factors here, there were significant international box office increases for both films on Sunday.
Greta Gerwig’s Barbie logged a more than beachy keen international box office total of $194.3M in 69 offshore markets through Sunday, waves ahead of the $182M from yesterday’s projections (see Sunday update below for original Sunday reporting on both Barbie and Oppenheimer).
Globally and internationally Barbie is the biggest start ever for a non-franchise WB movie and the third-best of all time for a WB film worldwide, as well as the 5th best start overseas for a WB title.
The Margot Robbie/Ryan Gosling-starrer was No. 1 in 58 offshore markets and is the best 2023 start for a Hollywood movie in 24 markets including Australia, Brazil, and the UK. Also up from yesterday’s estimates, Barbie is the top WB opening of all time for WB in 26 markets (Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico among them).
In one session, Barbie has already surpassed the lifetimes of Ocean’s 8, Cruella and Birds of Prey. Also increasing against yesterday’s estimates, the international take has Barbie tracking 60% above Wonder Woman, 178% over Cinderella and 195% above The Little Mermaid as well as 259% above Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again in like-for-likes and at today’s rates. In Europe, as a region, Barbie has overtaken The Super Mario Bros Movie as the biggest launch weekend of the year.
Individual market increases in the actuals include leader the UK with $24.2M versus the $22.9M reported yesterday. This is the he 2nd best three-day start for a WB film ever behind only the final installment of Harry Potter.
Brazil also jumped, to $17.6M in the actuals versus the $15.9M Sunday estimate. France is confirmed at $10.2M for the top WB opening since the pandemic and the studio’s biggest since Joker in 2019. Italy rode the wave to $8.8M, dominating with an 83% share of the Top 5 Films in the market. This is 3% above Beauty and the Beast, 14% over Fast X and 4% ahead of Super Mario. China, where we really were not expecting much, actually increased screens throughout the weekend resulting in an $8.1M three-day; 23% ahead of The Greatest Showman and 231% over The Little Mermaid.
On Oppenheimer, offshore markets raised their running cume to $98M, up from yesterday’s $93.7M estimate (again, see Sunday update below for more on initial reports on both films).
The $98M overseas makes Oppenheimer the No. 2 opening weekend ever for a film directed by Christopher Nolan behind only The Dark Knight Rises ($131M) and ahead of The Dark Knight ($94.2M) in non-restated figures. At current exchange rates and excluding previews, the weekend result is narrowly below The Dark Knight Rises (-2%), achieves the 2nd biggest international opening for a Nolan film, more than double all other comps. It is also 49% above last week’s openings for Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One.
Meanwhile, at current exchange rates and including previews, the offshore cume of $98M through Sunday is in line with The Dark Knight Rises (-6%).
The Cillian Murphy-led biographical epic was No. 1 in 17 markets including India, Netherlands, UAE, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia and Denmark. In 42 markets (up from 36 in the estimates), this is Nolan’s best opening weekend ever. Across the Europe/Middle East/Africa region, Oppenheimer is the biggest debut for Nolan, topping The Dark Knight Rises.
Notable markets that saw increases in the actuals include the UK with $14M for the second biggest opening for Nolan, behind The Dark Knight Rises, more than double Interstellar and Tenet and the 8th best Universal three-day weekend ever.
India was up to $7.2M versus the $7M estimate; France scored $7M, up from the $6.4M estimate and landing the second-biggest start for a Nolan movie; Germany trued up to $6.6M (while Barbie was No. 1 for the frame, there was just a slight difference between the two with Oppenheimer on top Thursday and Saturday).
Other markets to see slight upwards shifts for Oppenheimer versus Sunday’s estimates include Saudi Arabia ($4M), Spain ($3.8M), UAE ($3M), Brazil ($2.7M); Netherlands ($2.6M), Hong Kong ($1.9M) and Belgium ($1.5M).
PREVIOUS, SUNDAY: It’s a Barbenheimer world as Warner Bros’ Barbie and Universal’s Oppenheimer have delivered massive global debuts of $337M and $174.2M, respectively.
At the international box office, Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, surfed a wave to an incredible $182M from 69 markets, the biggest WB offshore opening ever for a non-franchise film. At the same time, Christopher Nolan’s Cillian Murphy-led Oppenheimer in 78 markets landed a staggering $93.7M overseas.
For both titles, the performances are beyond expectations, buoyed by great critical and audience response as well as the organic worldwide Barbenheimer phenomenon which created fusion at the box office as double bills became the order of the weekend for many moviegoers around the globe.
Studio insiders across town have been agog over the past several days at the momentum – which also had a knock-on effect of expanding the marketplace. This is terrific for the industry, and welcome news before we hit what could be a somewhat fallow period if the Hollywood strikes stretch out.
Says Andrew Cripps, Warner Bros President of International Theatrical Distribution, “The incredible worldwide results we’ve seen are a testament to the filmmakers’ singular vision to provide a fun and engaging experience that audiences of all ages are responding to in a fun and powerful way.”
And for Veronika Kwan Vandenberg, President of Distribution for Universal Pictures International, “We couldn’t be happier for Chris Nolan and Emma Thomas, the phenomenal cast and crew, and our partners at IMAX and exhibition around the world.”
This is indeed a sunshine moment with two movies that couldn’t be more different dialing into a communal experience for the world. Adds Kwan Vandenberg, “This weekend has been a huge win for our industry. The market expanded and it is great to see audiences of all ages and demographics appreciating both films.”
Echoes Cripps, “It’s great to see people coming out to see both films. It’s well-deserved and well-needed news.”
Indeed, this is one of those weekends that we haven’t had for a long time where there is an awful lot to parse. It’s not just the amazing newcomers, but also the holds.
Barbie scored the 2nd biggest industry opening of 2023 internationally behind Universal’s Fast X and was No. 1 in 55 markets. This also marks the top overseas start for Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling and Greta Gerwig and the biggest industry opening of the year in 18 markets including Australia, Brazil and the UK.
Further milestones include biggest WB bow ever in 16 markets including Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico.
In like-for-like markets and using today’s exchange rates, the film is tracking 50% ahead of Wonder Woman, 161% above Cinderella, 177% over The Little Mermaid and 236% over Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.
Running down the Top 5 markets, the UK’s gigantic $22.9M ranked a clear No. 1 with records including the biggest opening for a WB film since the pandemic and the top start of 2023, ahead of Super Mario. It’s followed by a stunning Mexico debut with $22.3M, repping 73% market share and the biggest opening ever for a WB title and the 2nd best of the year.
Brazil’s $15.9M is WB’s best ever (even ahead of the DC-loving market’s number for Justice League and Batman V Superman), best of 2023 and 3rd best ever.
Australia’s $14.6M start is the best ever for a WB movie in the market and tops of 2023. And, Spain, which doesn’t always factor at the top of the lists, is next with $9.9M, the 2nd best bow of the year, just behind Super Mario (which debuted on a Wednesday discount day). Barbie in the market came in 23% above Beauty and the Beast, 39% above Fast X and 56% above Joker.
Barbie was also positively on fire in Latin America with the biggest opening of a WB movie ever, and tops for 2023 (ahead of Super Mario and Fast X). In Europe, it’s the best non-franchise start for WB ever, and in Asia overperformed as the top WB start in Malaysia and Philippines, while conferring best launches for Robbie and Gosling in multiple plays.
Meanwhile, epic biographical thriller Oppenheimer is Nolan’s biggest opening weekend globally behind only the final two films in the Dark Knight trilogy. It’s also the biggest global day-and-date opening weekend ever for a biographical film surpassing Bohemian Rhapsody ($124M), and the top worldwide launch for a drama since 2019 ahead of Creed III ($100.2M).
In like-for-like markets at historic rates it’s the 3rd highest grossing opening weekend ever for a film directed by Nolan behind only The Dark Knight Rises ($131M) and in line with The Dark Knight ($94.2M) – note that it could catch the latter in non-restated numbers.
In 36 overseas markets, this is Nolan’s best start including India, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Netherlands. In 55, it’s his best non-Batman launch including the UK/Ireland, France, Germany, Australia, Mexico, Spain and Brazil. And, it scored the biggest opened day for a Nolan title in 33 markets.
In IMAX, the film bowed to $35M globally, with 20% of the gross coming from only 740 screens. Shot with IMAX film cameras, specifically designed to be seen on IMAX screens, and playing in IMAX 15/70 film, Laser and Xenon, the film is Nolan’s top IMAX opening ever, the biggest for IMAX in July and the biggest of 2023 as well as the 2nd best ever for Universal.
International markets contributed $13.9M in IMAX, 14.8% of the offshore gross from only 329 screens. This is also tops for Nolan and tops for IMAX in July, while it’s the biggest IMAX opening weekend ever in Mexico, India, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, New Zealand and Czech Republic.
Among individual territories, the UK leads at an estimated $13.3M three-day start. That would fall in line with Dunkirk (+3%), above Inception (+76%) and Interstellar (+94%) and more than 3x Tenet.
India is on track to deliver the biggest 3-day IMAX opening ever for a Hollywood title. Estimated to reach a full $7M this weekend, it is Nolan’s tops ever, best of 2023 and Universal’s best start since the pandemic began. Note that it already beat those benchmarks on opening day, and scored the biggest non-franchise Hollywood opening weekend and 7th biggest Hollywood opening weekend in history. (Also note that censor edits were made per usual business practice in order to secure a release in certain markets; we understand that in India, nudity in a particular scene was covered up for the release there with the movie carrying a UA rating meaning it’s classified for viewers with parental guidance for children under 12.)
France gave Nolan the biggest opening Wednesday since The Dark Knight Rises with the weekend estimate at $6.4M, which would make it the biggest non-superhero Nolan opening weekend, and come in above Inception (+6%), Tenet (+30%), Interstellar (+43%) and Dunkirk (+29%).
Germany isn also estimated to reach $6.4M this session, similarly the biggest non-superhero start for Nolan and above Inception (+14%), Interstellar (+63%), Tenet (+82%) and more than 3x Dunkirk excluding previews.
Australia, with stiff competition from Barbie, is estimated to have an opening weekend total of $6.3M, ahead of Dunkirk (+54%), Inception (+24%) and more than double Interstellar and Tenet. Thanks to the astounding performance of both Oppenheimer and Barbie, total market box office on Saturday and Sunday was the highest ever recorded.
Mexico is eyeing $4.5M in the frame this weekend, the biggest non-superhero Nolan opening there, 84% above Interstellar and more than double Tenet, Dunkirk and Inception excluding previews.
Saudi Arabia is looking to reach $3.9M for the frame, the 2nd biggest weekend ever (only behind Spider-Man: No Way Home) and easily the top start of 2023.
Brazil is on track to open with $2.5M this session, which would be the biggest opening weekend for a non-superhero Nolan film.
Netherlands on Saturday overtook Barbie for No.1, delivering the biggest opening Saturday for a Nolan film and the 2nd biggest Saturday of 2023 (behind Super Mario). Through today, the estimate is $2.4M, Nolan’s best ever opening weekend.
Other market cume estimates through Sunday include Indonesia ($1.8M), Hong Kong ($1.8M) and Belgium ($1.3M).
Further of note, this weekend’s business is propelling Universal across $3B global for the year, the second studio to achieve the box office milestone in 2023. This marks the ninth time the studio has reached the threshold and only the fourth time any studio has reached $3 billion worldwide since 2019.
Of the top 10 highest grossing opening weekends at the 2023 global, domestic and international box office, Universal has released three including Illumination’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Oppenheimer and Fast X.
Along with the Barbenheimer effect and exhibition leaning into the phenomenon, kudos also go to the individual studios. Warner Bros gave Barbie a vast neon pink international campaign. Talent traveled to Australia, Korea, Mexico and London (only missing Berlin because of the strike). Universal kicked off an Oppenheimer tour in Paris in mid-July with talent walking the red carpet at the capital’s landmark cinema the Grand Rex, along with a junket before heading to London for simultaneous screenings in Leicester Square and at BFI IMAX. The actors ended up leaving early from the former, in solidarity as the SAG-AFTRA strike was called.
Looking at the holds, Paramount/Skydance’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One may have lost some momentum amid the Barbenheimer double-bill, but let’s recall that Tom Cruise himself encouraged moviegoers to see both this weekend’s movies, in effect launching a star-endorsed love-in for the expanded marketplace. M:I7 in its second frame grossed $55M from 71 markets for an overseas cume of $252.1M. Global is $371M. Significantly, the film debuted in Japan this weekend at No. 1 with $7.9M – that’s 23% above Mission: Impossible – Fallout.
China is the top offshore market at $40.6M, followed by Korea ($23.5M and No. 1 this frame), the UK ($21.1M), India ($13.2M) and France ($12.9M).
Also showing continued strength, Disney/Pixar’s Elemental is now eyeing at least a $430M global gross. It sat behind M:I7 this weekend in Korea, but is still on fire there with $38.4M to date in the market. Overall, an $18.3M international weekend from 51 markets (-37% versus last session) has brought it to a $219.4M running cume overseas and $356.6M global. Korea really is a standout where it has passed Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 to become the highest grossing studio movie released during 2023 to date as well as Pixar’s all-time highest grossing movie there (surpassing Inside Out). Japan is still to come in August. Mexico is the next best play at $18.2M, followed by China ($15.8M), France ($14M) and Brazil ($12.2M).
Screen Gems/Stage 6 Films/Blumhouse’s Insidious: The Red Door made $12M this weekend for an international cume of $84.8M to push its worldwide total to $155.8M. The Top 5 are Mexico ($12.3M), the UK ($8.4M), Philippines ($6.7M), Indonesia ($5.4M) and France ($4.1M).
Disney/Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny for its part is now at $335M global, with $176M coming from overseas. The current frame was worth $8.2M from 52 material markets. The offshore hold was -54%; there’s some uptick here (as with other movies in release) given the expanded marketplace that had folks turning up to cinemas in droves. Top 5 here are UK ($23M), France ($18.2M), Japan ($15.2M), Germany ($11.5M) and Spain ($10.6M).
Local Chinese pic Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms was new this session, debuting to an estimated $53M.

PREVIOUS, SATURDAY: Audiences at the domestic, global and international box office this weekend are going bonkers for Barbenheimer. Warner Bros’ Barbie is now poised for an estimated $300M+ worldwide start through tomorrow (eyeing $150M+ each, from North America and a combined 69 overseas markets). Meanwhile, Universal’s Oppenheimer is now pegged for a $165.9M worldwide bow through Sunday, including $88.9M internationally.
These figures are, for both titles, beyond expectations, confirming that there’s room and a desire for a diverse quality offering at global turnstiles.
Looking at Barbie’s trajectory, the Friday on the Greta Gerwig-directed film was its best day so far internationally with $43M on 25,451 screens from 69 markets. The overseas cume through Friday is $88.4M.
Yesterday’s newcomers included the UK which grossed $8.3M from 1,703 screens. This was a No. 1 launch with a 60% share of the Top 5 films. The Margot Robbie- and Ryan Gosling-starrer logged the best opening day since the pandemic and the 3rd biggest Friday for a WB film ever behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 and Batman V Superman.
Along with the massive start in the UK, Latin America continues to overperform with Mexico leading all play through Friday at $11.2M.
In new records, Barbie debuted to the best score ever for a Warner Bros movie in Poland.
In China, where we really didn’t expect anything significant, Barbie opened amid a slew of local titles with $1.2M and (not included in the total above) is at $4M through Saturday. It has a 9.4 from audiences on Maoyan (note that this strangely appears to be the same score for a number of recent Hollywood titles that haven’t converted to big box office).
Also of note, family-leaning Brazil, which has grossed $8.9M through Friday, is seeing unprecedented and unusual showtimes added by exhibition. We also hear that Australia on Saturday positively skyrocketed.
As for Christopher Nolan’s Cillian Murphy-led Oppenheimer, the estimated overseas launch of $88.9M would mark the filmmaker’s 3rd highest grossing opening weekend ever, behind only The Dark Knight Rises ($131M) and The Dark Knight ($94M).
What’s more, the $166M worldwide projection through Sunday would mark the biggest global day-and-date debut for a biographical film, overtaking Bohemian Rhapsody ($124M) and the top worldwide start for a drama since 2019.
In other milestones for Nolan, he’s also seeing his biggest launch day of all time in 33 markets including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, India, Netherlands, Argentina and Belgium; as well as the 2nd biggest opening day in six markets including Germany, Brazil and UK/Ireland; and the top day-one start for a non-Nolan Batman title in 46 markets including Australia, France and Mexico.
Market highlights include the UK where Oppenheimer opened to $4.2M on Friday. That’s 14% higher than Dunkirk, which we thought might have had an edge given its UK-centric story. The start was the 2nd biggest Friday ever for a Nolan film and the biggest opening Friday for a non-superhero Nolan film as well as the 10th biggest Universal opening day of all time.
Fifty-two IMAX and 70mm IMAX screens took 19% share of the Friday total in the UK with top site BFI IMAX’s Friday gross the biggest ever result for that cinema.
In France, Oppenheimer is at a running total of $3.5M through Friday, performing above most Nolan comps. Germany has reached a running total of $2.8M through yesterday; Saudi Arabia is at $2.6M and Mexico has reached a running total of $1.9M. In the latter, this is the biggest Nolan opening in IMAX with performance in the format 15% ahead of Spider-Man: No Way Home and just 13% below Avengers: Infinity War.
We will have a full rundown on Sunday.
PREVIOUS, FRIDAY: Barbenheimer has begun. With Warner Bros’ Barbie and Universal’s Oppenheimer rolling out globally this weekend, we’ve got the first numbers for both from their various international box office markets through the first two days of release.
As expected, the Greta Gerwig-directed Barbie is coming out on top with $41.4M through Thursday in 51 markets. Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is also thriving with $15.9M across its first 57 markets through Thursday. Both are breaking various records.
It’s important to remember that these movies are not direct comps to one another, with runtimes and demos differing. Still, we’re in what is hoped to be an expanded marketplace situation that encourages moviegoing and benefits from the Barbenheimer phenom (although Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One may end up taking a breath this frame, it was still tops in Korea today).
So let’s take a closer look at the Barbie and Oppenheimer numbers across their first two days internationally.
Barbie, through Thursday, is in release in 51 offshore markets, and has shattered a number of records. Thursday alone was worth $31.8M on 15,700 screens – that is simply a hugely impressive number. An additional 18 markets are opening today, including the UK and China (in the latter, and not included in the totals above, the movie did approximately $1.2M on Friday).
The top-grossing market to date is Mexico with $6.4M, logging the biggest opening day for a Warner Bros film ever. It is also the 2nd biggest opening day of 2023, and the 3rd biggest opening day post-pandemic (wow!).
Brazil dominated Thursday at No.1 with $4.9M and an 84% market share of Top 5 films, and is the biggest opening day ever for a WB title, the biggest opening day post-pandemic ahead of Spider-Man: No Way Home, the biggest opening day of 2023 ahead of both Fast X and The Super Mario Bros Movie, and the 2nd biggest opening day of all time, only behind Avengers: Endgame.
France, which unboxed the doll very strongly on Wednesday, has grossed $4.5M while Australia (also a Wednesday opener) amassed $3.4M through Thursday. The latter gave it a dominant No. 1 with a 60% share of the Top 10 films. Results in Oz are tracking well ahead of all comps, and even came in 5% above Avatar: The Way of Water (another wow!). It scored the biggest opening day of 2023 at more than double Super Mario.
Italy and Germany round out the Top 5 grossers to date with $2.4M apiece.
Looking at regions, Barbie had the biggest opening day of all time for a WB film in 13 Latin America markets, and was the biggest industry opening day ever in Argentina ($1.2M) and Colombia ($1.5M). It was also the biggest industry opening day of 2023 regionally and in eight markets. The doll further scored the 4th biggest opening day ever regionally behind Avengers: Endgame, Avengers: Infinity War and Spider-Man: No Way Home.
Elsewhere, Barbie saw the biggest opening day of all time for a WB title in Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia. And in Denmark, it clocked the biggest opening day for a WB film in 13 years while Portugal had the 2nd biggest opening ever for a WB title behind only Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.
As regards Christopher Nolan’s epic Oppenheimer, yesterday added 47 offshore markets. The Cillian Murphy-starrer will be out in a total 78 through today.
Nolan started racking up milestones on Wednesday with Oppenheimer (see below), and has now logged his biggest opening day in 23 markets including Saudi Arabia and the UAE as well as the Middle East as a whole, Netherlands and Colombia. Thursday was further the No. 2 biggest Nolan opening day in Germany, Brazil, Peru and Ecuador and his best non-Batman start in 30 markets including Germany, Australia, France, Mexico and Brazil.
Also, Oppenheimer, which was filmed with IMAX cameras, captured the best opening day ever for the format in Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Bahrain, Oman, Argentina, Mexico and Chile.
Breaking down the Thursday openers, Saudi Arabia launched to No. 1 with $1.5M for the 2nd biggest opening day of all time (behind Spider-Man: No Way Home) and the biggest opening day of 2023 (85% above Fast X), also more than double the opening Thursday of MI:7.
Australia, where Oppenheimer opened as the widest ever release for a Nolan film in 296 locations, scored $1.1M on Thursday – for Nolan, only topped by The Dark Knight Rises.
Germany debuted to No. 1 with $1.3M, more than double Dunkirk, Interstellar and Tenet.
Mexico bowed with $900K on Thursday, more than double the Friday openings of Dunkirk, Interstellar and Tenet, and well above the first Thursday for MI:7. It is the widest IMAX footprint for a Nolan title and achieved the 3rd biggest IMAX opening day of all time (behind Avengers: Endgame and Infinity War) and the biggest IMAX opening day for a Nolan film, far outperforming Tenet, Interstellar and Dunkirk.
Spain opened with $700K on Thursday and is the biggest IMAX opening day of 2023. Reactions are strong, with a very high 8 audience score on FilmAffinity, placing it within the Top 10 films of this century (yeah, again, wow!).
Brazil opened with $488K on Thursday, followed by Netherlands with an estimated $485K at No. 1 and delivering the biggest opening Thursday ever for a Nolan film. Oppenheimer also achieved the biggest IMAX opening Thursday for a Nolan film, also beating Top Gun Maverick (+23%), Avengers: Infinity War (+18%), Avatar 2 (+114%) and MI:7 (+232%).
Hong Kong too launched at No.1, with $340K on Thursday. This is the 2nd biggest IMAX opening day ever (only behind Endgame).
Other impressive Thursday starts include Denmark ($328K – biggest opening day ever for a Nolan film) and Colombia ($236K – biggest opening day for a Nolan film and biggest Thursday total box office of all time).
After debuting on Wednesday, France added $1M on Thursday for a running total of $2.4M. Indonesia added $209K on Thursday for a running total of $661K. Thursday’s result makes it the biggest Thursday gross ever for a Nolan film and the 3rd biggest Thursday of all time in the market. Belgium added $211k on Thursday for a running total of $462K. Philippines added $107K on Thursday for a running total of $232K.
We’ll have much more throughout the weekend…
PREVIOUS, THURSDAY: Christopher Nolan’s highly-anticipated and highly-reviewed Oppenheimer has begun overseas rollout with strong results versus some of the director’s previous titles. On Wednesday, the Universal film opened in 10 offshore markets, grossing $2.4M and led by France and Indonesia. These are early days as the critically-lauded Cillian Murphy-led biographical drama/political thriller will be playing a total 78 markets through Friday, across over 9,600 locations, 13,000 screens, and more than 320 IMAX screens.
While we wait for the full onslaught of the much-anticipated “Barbenheimer” double-bill this weekend, and will have a fuller picture including Warner Bros’ Barbie tomorrow, we already have initial international box office numbers for Oppenheimer, the story of the building of the atomic bomb, and the resultant aftermath.
In France, Oppenheimer debuted to $1.4M o Wednesday from 725 screens including 18 IMAX and two 70mm screens, as well as 11 Dolby Vision and six ultra-laser Kinepolis screens. The launch day is the biggest opening Wednesday for a Nolan film since The Dark Knight Rises. Excluding previews, the Wednesday admissions are above MI:7 (+23%), Dunkirk (+14%), Tenet (+28%) and Interstellar (+76%). Audience reactions are highly positive with mainstream audiences rating it 4.4/5 and cinephile audiences rating it 7.3/10, one of the top ratings for the market.
Indonesia bowed Wednesday with an estimated $451K to mark the biggest opening day ever for a Nolan film (38% ahead of The Dark Knight Rises). IMAX delivered the biggest opening day ever in the format and the biggest single day gross in IMAX, beating Avatar 2 (+11%). Oppenheimer is playing across 10 IMAX screens and a total of 495 screens in the market. Wednesday was a public holiday in Indonesia for Islamic New Year.
Belgium opened with $251K on Wednesday, the biggest start ever for a Nolan film in the market, beating The Dark Knight Rises (+13%), Inception (+23%) and The Dark Knight (+31%) as well as all other key comps.
Philippines launched with $125K on Wednesday, the top opening day ever for a non-superhero Nolan film. Oppenheimer played across nine IMAX screens and in a total of 198 screens.
Egypt had a terrific start at $74K on Wednesday with Oppenheimer delivering the 2nd biggest opening day for any studio movie since the pandemic hit, only behind Spider-Man: No Way Home. It also easily achieved the biggest Hollywood opening day of the year, more than double Fast X and the 7th biggest MPA opening day of all time in admissions, +18% above Avengers: Infinity War.
Switzerland (French-speaking) grossed $70K on opening Wednesday, more than double the launch days of Tenet and Batman Begins, above Dunkirk (+29%), Interstellar (+46%) and recent opener MI:7 (+8%).
The film also had a strong start in Iceland ($31K) for the top Nolan start outside the Batman series.
Among majors, today the film opens in Australia, Germany, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Brazil with the UK, Spain and India following on Friday.
In terms of presales, UK/Ireland is seeing strong uptake with PLFs repping a significant portion and sell-out shows across opening weekend; Germany’s IMAX presales are above Universal’s own Fast X, Jurassic World Dominion and Fast & Furious 9. In Saudi Arabia, presales are wild, currently tracking an estimated 32x greater than Fast X at the same point in time and setting a new record.
We will have much more to come throughout the weekend…",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3L2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1iYXJiZW5oZWltZXItY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktbWFyZ290LXJvYmJpZS1yeWFuLWdvc2xpbmctZ2xvYWJsLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYm94LW9mZmljZS0xMjM1NDQzMTgwL9IBqAFodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3L2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1iYXJiZW5oZWltZXItY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktbWFyZ290LXJvYmJpZS1yeWFuLWdvc2xpbmctZ2xvYWJsLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYm94LW9mZmljZS0xMjM1NDQzMTgwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-23 15:24:46+00:00,The ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ Double Feature Left Me Questioning Reality Itself,"‘Barbenheimer,’ the ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ double feature, is an exhausting spiritual journey that left me questioning reality itself.","The double feature is something of a bygone pleasure. Sure, repertory theaters will curate stacked showings of classic fare or art house favorites for the cultured cinephile in us, but the first-run double — one you might randomly drop into knowing little about either movie — seems the relic of a time when we had more hours to kill, and fewer screens to distract us from that magical silver one.
It is perhaps not entirely a coincidence that this era, the middle of the 20th century, also transformed the United States into the global superpower it has been ever since, through military and material triumph: we ended World War II, and economic prosperity followed in suburbs, superhighways, and space-age appliances. These, of course, are the broad strokes that connect Christopher Nolan’s harrowing biopic Oppenheimer, focused on the “father of the atomic bomb,” and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, which tackles similar questions of identity, legacy, and complicity with equal vigor. Released together on July 21, they probably looked like ideal counterprogramming for their respective distributors, Universal and Warner Bros. Would anyone interested in a three-hour epic about the scientific race to develop weapons of mass destruction want to see a famous doll brought to life in a candy-colored fantasy, or vice versa?
Now, of course, we know the answer: the “Barbenheimer” bill, far from remaining a speculative meme, became a viable dare that many people embraced. The National Association of Theater Owners, who amazingly go by NATO, reported that some 200,000 customers had already booked tickets to watch these films consecutively on the same day — a significant core of committed lunatics who trusted in the potential for a dialogue between disparate subjects and styles. I say “lunatic” because not even Hollywood’s most extreme theater evangelist, Tom Cruise, was in for the potential whiplash, announcing that he instead planned to see Oppenheimer on Friday, then wait until Saturday for Barbie. When a guy who drives motorcycles off cliffs for your entertainment isn’t up for a stunt, it must be serious. Editor’s picks
So I did feel somewhat braver than Tom when I strapped in for a rather full 10:30 am Friday showing of Oppenheimer in IMAX at Los Angeles’ Westfield Century City mall. As if to confirm a stereotype about Nolan’s fanbase, I was seated between two other gangly white dudes also there alone, but after AMC’s requisite 25 minutes of trailers, Nicole Kidman’s iconic ad for the chain got a reception much warmer than I expected, given the muted crowd — an indication, I think, that no one expected to laugh or smile much during the saga to come.
The structure of Oppenheimer is wildly ambitious, skipping around (and splicing different moments of) time in a purposefully disorienting fashion that has become one of Nolan’s calling cards. Here, the fractured chronology reflects the menacing, uncanny genius of its main character, a theoretical physicist who can intuit the quantum paradoxes undergirding what we incorrectly regard as stable, solid truths. As J. Robert Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy is given to haunted stares that carry the curse of prophetic power — he is taking in the full range of possible futures. Meanwhile, Nolan gives us frenetic breaks into abstract geometry, swirling atoms, a universe coming apart at the invisible seams. Nature is almost scarier than the bomb.
The effect this has when your ass is gradually going numb and your bladder is steadily filling up over the course of a 180-minute runtime should not be discounted as part of the Oppenheimer vibe. Our protagonist drifts through memories and misunderstandings of himself, desperate to preserve a semblance of humanity that allows him to survive; we in the theater struggle to maintain mental and bodily autonomy in the face of apocalyptic power. It’s fascinating that Nolan, who has often destabilized viewers’ grasp on reality with impossible action set pieces (Inception, Tenet), here accomplishes the same with scenes where people sit around and argue. Whatever your quibbles with the film — which I would rank among his very best — you can’t argue with the staggering suspense that leads toward detonation. You will be holding your breath along with the scientists at Los Alamos. Related
Duly shaken by this story, and the recognition that I was born into its aftermath, I had trouble coming back to my senses. A bustling mall did not make for the easiest reentry into linear consciousness, either. Thankfully, a quick lunch at Panda Express proved suitably mundane to bring me down to earth, and afterward, I met up at a bar with my friend Anna, who would join me for that afternoon’s screening of Barbie and, like dozens milling around the area, was wearing pink for the occasion. Over beers, I gave her a poor synopsis of what had transpired that morning, lingering on the hyped sex scenes — was Oppenheimer really such a fuckboy? — and we headed over to the multiplex, where I hoped I would not have to endure the shame of showing my next ticket to the same employee who scanned me in before.
I didn’t, but in the concessions area, I noticed that the combined force of these summer blockbusters was already taking its toll: more popcorn on the ground, and several soda fountains were out of ice. It was as if the place were subject to its own kind of fission, one that could release intense energy if not brought under control. On Reddit, theater employees have braced for this weekend like you would a hurricane, expecting huge business to result in punishing work shifts. Saturday, a fire alarm at the AMC Burbank 16 caused an evacuation and cascading entropy.
Audiences, for their part, were always bound to approach the alignment of Oppenheimer and Barbie as a battle royale event, dispensing with the usual etiquette if it meant optimizing your experience. I was dismayed to find that a family had shamelessly claimed my well-chosen seat for the latter, and, not wanting to eject a child from it, went away in search of an unoccupied chair, mumbling about the collapse of civilized order. Of course, when I had to settle for a place in the wheelchair-accessible row, I felt like part of the problem.
Barbie at first held out the potential for sheer escapism, and make no mistake: hot actors goofing around is a decent salve after sitting through the Manhattan Project. I hardly noticed how cheap Chinese food, Twizzlers, and Coca-Cola were churning together in my gut. Alas, narrative requires conflict, and after we are introduced to Barbieland in its idealized form, our flawless heroine (Margot Robbie) blurts out an intrusive thought that brings her latest blowout dance party to a screeching halt: “Do you guys ever think about dying?”
It’s a hilariously-pitched non-sequitur in the context of Gerwig’s feminist fable, but, having indeed spent the first half of my day mulling death, “the destroyer of worlds,” I had the eerie sense that Barbie could read my mind, and knew I was having trouble moving from the inferno of Oppenheimer into the utopian post-war dreamscape she is supposed to inhabit. From there, Barbie continues to pull the rug out, next invoking a Möbius strip-like continuum that bridges the realm of the dolls and our own existence. Here, the cinematic parallels are even stronger, as Barbie’s script winkingly encourages us not to overanalyze the concept, which is exactly how Nolan has managed to vanquish our disbelief in things like dream-hacking and time inversion. (Although the idea of a portal that allows Barbie and Ken to travel to the grimy Venice Beach boardwalk, and the exact area of L.A. where I was watching the movie, is more in the vein of Interstellar‘s cosmic hall of mirrors.)
Barbie is ultimately on a journey as profound as Oppenheimer’s. While he becomes a reluctant god of annihilation, she meets her own creator and has to choose whether to remain an immortal creation or accept both the pain and bliss of embodiment. And, like Oppenheimer’s chalkboards, womanhood as discussed in Barbie is a nest of contradictions — the other Barbies, brainwashed by Ken when he brings toxic masculinity back to their neighborhood from our patriarchal society, can only be reawakened when they are reminded of this. The process of self-discovery has everything to do with acknowledging the unsolvable problem of being alive.
Beyond these films’ pointed critique of men and their best-laid plans, in tandem they produce a philosophical text that distorts and subverts the ways we interpret all that surrounds us, and all that is within us. It’s no wonder that on Friday evening, out with friends, I kept finding myself lapsing into silence, unsure of how to talk, questioning the validity of whatever floated into my head, like Barbie trying to apprehend her image, or Oppenheimer wrestling with his conscience. The gauntlet had lasted only six hours plus intermission, yet I was spiritually exhausted. And still couldn’t quite believe that Barbie included a throwaway Stephen Malkmus reference. Something genuinely strange had happened to me.
Knowing what I do now, would I have nonetheless subjected myself to this accidental double feature? Absolutely. We shall never see its like again, and you have to seize that opportunity. I’m willing to admit, however, that Tom Cruise’s schedule was a bit more reasonable. Either movie by itself is enough. The fusion is straight-up nuclear.

2023-08-01 19:48:18+00:00,"Oliver Stone Turned Down an Oppenheimer Movie, Calls Christopher Nolan’s Film a ‘Classic’ He ‘Never Believed Could Be Made in This Climate’",Oliver Stone reveals he once turned down making a film about Oppenheimer because he couldn't crack the narrative like Christopher Nolan now has.,"Many reviews for Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer” noted that the film felt like the director’s own version of Oliver Stone‘s sprawling historical epic “JFK,” and now Stone himself has weighed in on Nolan’s latest achievement. The “Platoon” Oscar winner took to social media to deem Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” a new film classic, while also revealing he flirted with making his own film in the past about theoretical physicist and “father of the atomic bomb” J. Robert Oppenheimer.
“I sat through 3 hours of ‘Oppenheimer,’ gripped by Chris Nolan’s narrative,” Stone wrote. “His screenplay is layered and fascinating. Familiar with the book by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, I once turned the project down because I couldn’t find my way to its essence. Nolan has found it.”
“His direction is mind-boggling and eye-popping as he takes reams of incident and cycles it into an exciting torrent of action inside all the talk,” Stone continued. “Each actor is a surprise to me, especially Cillian Murphy, whose exaggerated eyes here feel normal playing a genius like Oppenheimer.”
“‘Oppenheimer’ is a classic, which I never believed could be made in this climate,” Stone concluded. “Bravo.”
Stone is far from the only prolific director to publicly praise Nolan’s epic. Before “Oppenheimer” released in theaters, Paul Schrader posted a rave reaction on social media. The “Taxi Driver” writer called Nolan’s film “the best, most important film of this century.”
“If you see one film in cinemas this year it should be ‘Oppenheimer,’” Schrader added. “I’m not a Nolan groupie but this one blows the door off the hinges.”
“Oppenheimer” has since become a box office blockbuster despite its three-hour runtime and R rating. The film has already surpassed $400 million at the worldwide box office in under two weeks of release. It’s now playing nationwide courtesy of Universal Pictures.

About Oppenheimer
Oppenheimer, which follows physicist J Robert Oppenheimer's work and life, is a biopic set during the Second World War. Robert Oppenheimer helped invent nuclear weapons during that time. He was known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb. The film is set during a period in history when he understood that testing the atomic bomb would destroy the world but that didn't stop him from pushing the button.
Oppenheimer India box office collection
According to a Sacnilk.com report, Oppenheimer earned ₹17.25 crore nett in India on the third day of its release for all languages as per early estimates. The film minted ₹14.50 crore on day one of its release and ₹17.25 crore on the second day of its release. Currently, the total earnings of Oppenheimer stand at ₹49 crore. Oppenheimer released on the same day in theatres as Barbie in the biggest clash of Hollywood summer blockbusters.
Cast of Oppenheimer
In Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy essayed the lead role, Emily Blunt was seen as his wife, Katherine Oppenheimer. Matt Damon played the role of General Leslie Groves, the head of the Manhattan Project. Robert Downey Jr played Lewis Strauss, a senior member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Florence Pugh, Casey Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kenneth Branagh and Rami Malek also feature in the film.
Oppenheimer earnings in US
According to an AFP report, Oppenheimer earned $80.5 million in revenue in North American box offices while Barbie raked in $155 million. The coincidental same-day release of the two starkly different but highly anticipated films created a bottom-up pop-culture phenomenon that transcended the individual marketing for either. Together, they also provided a shot in the arm for theatres hit hard by the pandemic as well as the rise of streaming services.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9ob2xseXdvb2Qvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItYm94LW9mZmljZS1kYXktMy1jb2xsZWN0aW9uLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLWZpbG0tY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktMTAxNjkwMTY0MzE1NjU3Lmh0bWzSAZ0BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvaG9sbHl3b29kL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtZGF5LTMtY29sbGVjdGlvbi1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1maWxtLWNpbGxpYW4tbXVycGh5LTEwMTY5MDE2NDMxNTY1Ny1hbXAuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Christopher Nolan has described the visceral reactions of some people who have seen his latest film, Oppenheimer.
The biographical movie stars Cillian Murphy as the eponymous J Robert Oppenheimer, known as the “father of the atomic bomb”, and is due to be released on 21 July.
“Some people leave the movie absolutely devastated,” Nolan said about early screenings in a new interview with Wired magazine.
“They can’t speak. I mean, there’s an element of fear that’s there in the history and there in the underpinnings. But the love of the characters, the love of the relationships, is as strong as I’ve ever done.”
The 52-year-old British-American director added: “It is an intense experience because it’s an intense story. I showed it to a filmmaker recently who said it’s kind of a horror movie. I don’t disagree.”
Nolan even admitted that he was “relieved to be finished” with the project due to the emotional toll it took.
“As I started to finish the film, I started to feel this colour that’s not in my other films, just darkness. It’s there. The film fights against that,” he said.

Earlier this week, the historian who wrote the 2005 biography on which Oppenheimer is based said he was still “emotionally recovering” from watching the film.
The biographer, Kai Bird, who co-authored American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, said: “I think it is going to be a stunning artistic achievement, and I have hopes it will actually stimulate a national, even global conversation about the issues that Oppenheimer was desperate to speak out about – about how to live in the atomic age, how to live with the bomb and about McCarthyism – what it means to be a patriot, and what is the role for a scientist in a society drenched with technology and science, to speak out about public issues.”

Oppenheimer will be led by Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robery Downey Jr and Florence Pugh.
The film’s cast also includes Matthew Modine, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, Dane DeHaan, Benny Safdie, David Krumholtz, Jack Quaid, and Alden Ehrenreich.

,Will Cillian Murphy win the Oscar? Predicting Oppenheimer awards chances,"'Oppenheimer' will dominate awards season, as Christopher Nolan's new movie could become his first film with multiple acting nominations in the Oscars acting categories for Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt.","Oppenheimer is big, it's loud, it takes place during World War II, it's about powerful white men blowing stuff up and then feeling a little sad about it — and, to top it off, it's three hours long. While it might put some moviegoers' patience (and bladders) to the test, Christopher Nolan's new movie is everything the traditional, old-school sector of the Academy wants in a big-budget spectacle, and their hearts are about to explode in favor of the historical drama across the awards season ahead.
While the film's runtime might be a dealbreaker for casual audience members, especially given its bleak subject matter, even the most disinterested viewer will appreciate the prowess of the film's central performances.
'Oppenheimer' Oscars predictions. Universal Pictures
Oppenheimer is likely to become Nolan's first-ever film to garner multiple acting nods, 15 years after the late Dark Knight star Heath Ledger scored the sole acting nod (and subsequent win) among the director's multi-year filmography. Led by Cillian Murphy's performance as the titular physicist, the film follows Oppenheimer as he wrestles personal ambitions with an internal moral dilemma over fathering the atomic bombs that the United States would eventually use to kill tens of thousands in two Japanese cities at the end of World War II. Murphy masterfully scales Oppenheimer's mental acrobatics en route to what will go down as the performance of his career.
Emily Blunt lights ablaze the role of the dutiful wife, which could've fallen flat if she stuck to what was written on the page. Blunt, who's shockingly never been nominated for an Oscar, makes the most of Kitty Oppenheimer's scenes, which mostly see her guzzling liquor from a flask, standing behind her husband's pursuits, and reluctantly raising their children on her own. It all culminates, though, in a searing close-up scene toward the end of the film that drew applause from the audience at a preview screening in New York City, as Blunt vents all of Kitty's pent-up rage.

As for Florence Pugh, who plays Oppenheimer's former lover, Jean Tatlock, she ferociously sinks her teeth into the minimal material she has to work with, but her blink-and-you'll-miss-it screentime could work against her this season, especially in the context of a three-hour production.
And then there's Robert Downey Jr. Yes, Iron Man is in Oppenheimer, and it might take you a moment to recognize him as the controversial Lewis Strauss, a member of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission who had a hand in revoking Oppenheimer's security clearance after his time with the Manhattan Project ended. Downey's performance is the kind of supporting turn Hollywood goes nuts for: a beloved, blockbuster staple chewing scenery, showboating, and transforming (he's bald, aged, and bespectacled here) right before our very eyes. If SAG-AFTRA ends its strike and holds a ceremony this year, expect his fellow actors to gobble this performance right up.

While it feels like three of the film's performances could easily coast through the race, there's a case to be made for Matt Damon's turn as Manhattan Project director Lieutenant General Leslie Richard Groves Jr., whose mustachioed, gruff-with-a-heart-of-gold gusto provides some levity, and don't be surprised if Josh Hartnett — whose mini renaissance this year also included a role in Netflix's Black Mirror — creeps into the conversation, too.
While multiple acting nominations are a possibility, more assured category placements for Oppenheimer are in the technical categories. You'd be smart to bet on the film winning the Oscar for Best Sound, a race that it has locked up seven months before the 2024 Academy Awards ceremony for the orchestration of the atomic bomb testing sequence alone. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema (who worked with Nolan on Interstellar, Dunkirk, and Tenet) also facilitates our immersion into Oppenheimer's psyche in stunning fashion, adding a profound layer to the story that won't be ignored by his fellow DPs on the circuit.
Tying it all together, Oppenheimer will probably be this year's most obviously ""stacked"" Oscar player, with projected support from all of the Academy's individual branches, from technical artisans to the actors and directors, all aligning when it comes time to rank Best Picture votes on the preferential ballot. In pieces, the film represents top-tier filmmaking from its lensing to its on-camera performers, and cinematic chemistry like that points to a scorching ignition of support in the hunt for Oscars.
Oppenheimer is now playing in theaters nationwide.

,'The danger never goes away': Christopher Nolan didn't intend for Oppenheimer movie to be so timely,"Known as the father of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer changed the course of history. Now, director Christopher Nolan takes his story to the screen - but does the three-hour epic pull it off? Critics think so.","The world's first nuclear explosion happened on 16 July 1945, when a plutonium implosion device was tested in New Mexico.
Now a new film about the so-called father of the atomic bomb, J Robert Oppenheimer, looks at how he came to create a weapon that would change the world and how it changed him.

Decades since its invention, as Russia's war rages in Ukraine, the weapon's threat to the world is back in people's minds.
Director Christopher Nolan, who also wrote the movie, basing it on the Pulitzer Prize winning book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin, told Sky News he never meant for his film to be so timely.
""I had a conversation with one of my teenage sons about what I was working on and he literally said to me - 'Does anybody really worry about nuclear weapons anymore? Is that really a thing in the world?'
""To which I said, 'Well, maybe that's a reason for making the film but beyond that, it's just a very, very dramatic story about how our world changed forever'.

""Two years later, he's not asking that question anymore and neither is anybody else for all the worst possible reasons, and that's symptomatic of our relationship with the threat of nuclear weapons and nuclear holocaust - it ebbs and flows with geopolitical shifts in a way that it shouldn't - I mean, the danger never goes away.""
To inhabit the role of Oppenheimer, Peaky Blinders star Cillian Murphy lost weight and perfected a new accent and also had to learn about quantum physics and grapple with Oppenheimer's morality.
""Actors love getting jobs and then they're dying to finish them, that seems to be the way,"" Murphy told Sky News.

""So, yeah, it was time for a holiday after that for sure, if you do anything for like 17, 18 hours a day and you're in that and you're on set all the time, naturally there will be a cost and then you feel at the end there's all this displaced energy and you're not quite sure what to do with it, and you start moving furniture around.""
Nolan interjects: ""And have a sandwich"".
For the director, known for movies including Intersteller, Inception and Dunkirk - and who has a reputation for shunning digital effects and greenscreen - it wasn't recreating a nuclear explosion that posed a challenge.
Instead, he says he found the casting process daunting.

""The ensemble - with Cillian at the heart of it as Oppenheimer - but then his interactions with this entire team of people coming together to pull off this, you know, impossible feat, that was a challenge for me.
""Doing these group discussions, these arguments, these interpersonal relationships and all of that, all of which came into such a kind of hothouse atmosphere with the Manhattan Project and everything they had to do in the years that they were there.
""That was something I'd never really taken on before.""

The extremely positive early reviews for Oppenheimer suggest Nolan rose to that challenge.
But now, with promotion for the film interrupted by the US actor's strike, it remains to be seen whether audiences will have the appetite for a three-hour epic about the creation of the atomic bomb - the end of the world perhaps too close for comfort to be considered entertainment.

,July 28 panel to discuss Robert Oppenheimer's Berkeley years,Add description here,"UPDATE (8/7/23): The panel discussion is now online on YouTube.
The story behind the summer blockbuster movie Oppenheimer, which opens across the nation on Friday, July 21, began at the University of California, Berkeley.
A 25-year-old J. Robert Oppenheimer arrived at UC Berkeley in fall 1929 as an assistant professor, and over the next dozen years established one of the greatest schools of theoretical physics in the U.S. — one that continues to this day. He made UC Berkeley’s physics department the center of American thought about the new field of quantum mechanics and how to apply it to atoms, nuclei and even neutron stars.He and Ernest O. Lawrence, who made the campus the go-to place for experimental particle physics with his work on the atom-smashing cyclotron, were instrumental in raising the alarm that the Germans could be trying to develop an atomic bomb, and that the U.S. should do the same.The three-hour movie, directed by Christopher Nolan and partly filmed at UC Berkeley, follows Oppenheimer through his leadership of the Manhattan Project to develop the first nuclear weapons and his subsequent humiliation when the Atomic Energy Commission stripped him of his security clearance in 1954 because of claims that he was a Communist sympathizer and an unreliable adviser.To provide a different perspective on that history, four UC Berkeley faculty members and a nuclear physicist from Los Alamos National Laboratory will assemble for a panel discussion at 11:30 a.m. on Friday, July 28, to discuss Oppenheimer's pre-war UC Berkeley years and his scientific and human legacy.
The public can register here for the in-person-only event in Chevron Auditorium at International House in Berkeley.
Christopher Nolan brought his film crew to UC Berkeley in May 2022 to film scenes for the movie Oppenheimer, opening July 21, 2023, across the U.S. Along Campanile Way, cast members seen in 1930s attire include Josh Hartnett (gray suit) playing Berkeley professor E. O. Lawrence, and Cillian Murphy (brown suit, seen from rear), playing J. Robert Oppenheimer, the Berkeley theoretical physicist who led the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb. Brittany Hosea-Small
The discussion will be moderated by Cathryn Carson , UC Berkeley professor of history and a specialist in the history of 20th century physics, including its cultural, social and political contexts. She co-edited a volume of papers about Oppenheimer, Reappraising Oppenheimer: Centennial Studies and Reflections, that was presented during a 2004 conference celebrating the 100th anniversary of his birth.
Carson will be joined by Jon Else, UC Berkeley professor emeritus of journalism and longtime director of the documentary program at UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism. Else directed the 1981 documentary, The Day After Trinity: J. Robert Oppenheimer and the Atomic Bomb, which was the first documentary about Oppenheimer's role in the Manhattan Project. Trinity was Oppenheimer's name for the first-ever test of an atom bomb, which lit up the night sky in the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945.
The participants in the July 28 panel are Cathryn Carson, Mark Chadwick, Jon Else, Yasunori Nomura and Karl van Bibber.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iZXJrZWxleS5lZHUvMjAyMy8wNy8yMC9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1qdWx5LTI4LXBhbmVsLWRpc2N1c3Npb24tZm9jdXNlcy1vbi10aGUtbWFuLWJlaGluZC10aGUtbW92aWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Herbal cigarettes may not be full of poison, but they're not exactly health boosters either.
Cillian Murphy won't be quitting the world of acting anytime soon. But what he has decided to quit — at least for a while — is the act of fake smoking.
Recently catching up with The Guardian, Murphy confessed that his time playing Birmingham gang leader Thomas Shelby (Peaky Blinders) and Manhattan Project physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer) gave him enough faux tobacco for a lifetime. While prop cigarettes don't contain the harmful and known carcinogenic ingredients found in the real thing, they're not exactly health boosters either, per the National Library of Medicine.

Why Cillian Murphy is done playing smokers for a while
""My next character will not be a smoker,"" the actor declared. ""They can’t be good for you. Even herbal cigarettes have health warnings now.""
Nevertheless, feigning the existence of a lifelong nicotine addict was absolutely essential to playing Doctor Oppenheimer, who was almost aways seen with a cigarette or pipe in his hand. ""He would alternate between the two. That’s what did for him in the end,” Murphy explained, alluding to the fact that the real Oppenheimer died of throat cancer at the age of 62 in early 1967.
Written, directed, and produced by Nolan, the atomic bomb thriller tracks the development, creation, and aftermath of America's race to split the atom ahead of the Nazis and bring a swift end to the Second World War.
Oppenheimer proved instrumental in the project's success, though he ultimately came to regret his involvement and was blacklisted as a result. His famous quote upon witnessing the first atomic blast — ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"" — denoted the existential horror he felt at placing such an awesome power into the hands of a species known for waging one conflict after another. And he was correct to give voice to such dread as the threat of nuclear annihilation came to define the entire second half of the 20th century.

""He was dancing between the raindrops morally,"" Murphy added. ""He was complex, contradictory, polymathic; incredibly attractive intellectually and charismatic, but ultimately unknowable.""

2023-06-29 16:19:30+00:00,"Barbenheimer: ‘Barbie’ Tracking for Beatific $70M- $80M Opening, Christopher Nolan’s ‘Oppenheimer’ Targets $40M",The two tentpoles open in North America over the July 21-23 weekend.,"In one of the most intriguing showdowns in recent times, filmmaker Greta Gerwig’s Barbie is tracking to open well ahead of Christopher Nolan‘s atomic bomb drama Oppenheimer. But the biggest winner could be theatrical if the two movies work over the long run.
The two July tentpoles — dubbed “Barbenheimer” on social media — officially came on tracking Thursday, three weeks ahead of their detonation in theaters over the July 21-23 weekend.
From Warner Bros., Barbie could open to a beatific $70 million to $80 million, if not more, according to sources who have access to tracking data (and there’s plenty of upside). Warners is being more cautious, suggesting $60 million. The movie, based on the iconic Mattel toy line of dolls, stars Margot Robbie in the titular role and Ryan Gosling as Ken.
A Barbie movie had languished in development for years before moving from Sony to Warners. But in recent weeks, the film has turned into a social media and marketing phenomenon (not to mention merchandising). And buzzy female-skewing titles can transform into box office summer bonanzas, such as Warners’ Sex and the City or Universal’s Mamma Mia! franchises. Barbie is skewing almost entirely female at this point, and particularly to females 35 and under.
Universal and Nolan’s Oppenheimer is tracking for a domestic debut in the $40 million range. For Oppenheimer — an R-rated, three-hour drama targeting adults — having legs could prove far more important than its opening weekend haul. Still, $40 million would mark one of the acclaimed filmmaker’s lowest openings. And excluding Tenet, which opened to $20 million during the heart of the pandemic, it would mark Nolan’s lowest start since The Prestige ($14.8 million) in 2006.
Nolan has come in No. 2 before; in 2014, Interstellar opened behind Disney’s Big Hero 6 with $47.5 million on its way to enjoying a long ride in theaters and grossing $701.7 million globally.
Oppenheimer stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, considered the father of the atom bomb, alongside an ensemble cast of A-listers including Emily Blunt and Matt Damon.
Paramount and Skydance open Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One on July 12 domestically, and the event pic will still be a formidable force when Oppenheimer and Barbie unfurl. (There’s even a scenario where Oppenheimer comes in third in its opening weekend behind Barbie and Mission: Impossible.)
The three tentpoles, along with this weekend’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, need to succeed if summer revenue is to make gains over 2022. On Thursday, Cruise urged his fans to support the theatrical experience by seeing Indy, Barbie and Oppenheimer (in addition to Mission, of course).",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9iYXJiaWUtYm94LW9mZmljZS10cmFja2luZy1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci0xMjM1NTI2MTcyL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9iYXJiaWUtYm94LW9mZmljZS10cmFja2luZy1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci0xMjM1NTI2MTcyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-17 15:19:46+00:00,REVIEW: Murphy and Nolan go big in “Oppenheimer”,,"When I think of Christopher Nolan I think of four things: Giant scale, loud music, Michael Caine showing up for at least a little bit and dense plots that sometimes border on the needlessly complicated.
Until now the highly respected director has stuck to fiction, be it of the superhero, science or cerebral thriller varieties, but it was only a matter of time before he applied at least a couple of these four calling cards to nonfiction.
And while it is oddly lacking in Michael Caine, the other three are all there in Oppenheimer, a sprawling look at the father of the atomic bomb that is dense and exhausting but also thoroughly impressive from a filmmaking standpoint, not to mention engaging and entertaining.
Clocking in at exactly three hours, Oppenheimer is sometimes a lot to take in. It is chock full of science talk and political maneuvering, a relentless and headache-inducing combination that often made me feel as if I was just barely understanding the bare basics of what was going on.
Compounding this is a massive and somewhat bloated roster of characters played by what must have been half of the people currently working in Hollywood, as well as a non-linear style of storytelling that covered several different time periods simultaneously, because heaven forbid Christopher Nolan do anything simply.
Sometimes I got bored. Once or twice I even got frustrated. But the fact of the matter remains: Oppenheimer is still a darn good movie, and it owes a lot of that success to its sheer ambition and scope.
Cillian Murphy is exceptional as J. Robert Oppenheimer, and I appreciate that neither he nor the scriptwriters pretend that the famous scientist was a shining hero that one must aspire to, instead presenting a flawed individual who may have done some good and certainly did a whole lot of bad.
This nuance extends to all of the characters, all of which are portrayed equally as well as “Oppie” himself.
Ludwig Göransson’s soundtrack is both bombastic and creative, underlining even the most mundane events with gravitas and meaning (I particularly enjoyed a track that utilized the clicking of a Geiger counter in its tune).
Nolan’s habit of exclusively using IMAX cameras to film pays off handsomely in Oppenheimer as well, as the film looks breathtaking from start to finish.
It is a challenging film, but the challenge is integral to its success.
The cast may be huge and it may be hard to keep everyone straight, but this just reinforces how monumental and important the creation of the first atomic bomb really was.
It may be full of complicated science and intrigue, but this speaks to the fact that history and the people who make it are messy.
All of this would be meaningless if Oppenheimer wasn’t an engaging and entertaining film, and thankfully it is that as well thanks to its compelling character work, elegant script, and everything else that makes a film worth watching. And if I were to use any phrase to describe Oppenheimer it would be exactly that: Worth watching.
Oppenheimer is now in theaters.

When doing the promotional rounds to talk about their upcoming Christopher Nolan movie, Oppenheimer, the Iron Man actor seemingly made a blunder about the celebrity status of fellow actor Cillian Murphy.

Tweeted by user Slytherinus, they garnered over 10 million views by sharing this baffling moment for all to see and interpret.
They captioned the interview moment: “Does he think Cillian’s some kind of C tier niche Irish actor?""

He explained to the interviewer: “I think we can feel that about the way that your life changing now as you’re gonna be in front of this huge film and we always have two sets of feelings.
""One is that’s great and maybe I’ll have even more opportunities, and the other is ‘what about my privacy’.”
Having already featured in five previous Nolan hits such as The Dark Knight Trilogy, Dunkirk and Inception, this will mark Murphy's sixth film with the director to date, which might be the reason why fans of Murphy are left scratching their heads.
The video also reached Instagram where other commenters tried to rationalise RDJ’s comments towards the Peaky Blinders star.

A user wrote that 'it’s his first lead in a Nolan movie that’s what he is referring to,' which is quite a sensible assumption compared to the rest, as it’s true.
Other comments across Twitter also echoed the same sentiments, confirming that maybe the Sherlock Holmes actor was talking more so about how big this feature was compared to other works his co-star had been in.
Though, others preferred to bicker in the comments section.

One person wrote that: “This is a milestone in Cillian’s career, he’s never played lead in a film of such calibre.
""He’ll get so much more recognition and love than he already has. Downey has nothing but praise for him, don’t act smart and try to twist his words.”
This comment was quickly met with a differing opinion.
They countered: “I would agree with you if he wasn’t explicitly speaking about him as if he’s literally an undiscovered actor and not a significant actor in the industry that has been in countless Nolan films and the lead of a major TV series.”

Murphy is widely known as Nolan’s favourite supporting actor, having met each other in 2003 when doing the casting calls for the Batman Begins (2005) movie in which Murphy landed the role of tormented psychologist Jonathan Crane or The Scarecrow.
But now it seems as though the Irish actor has been bumped up to the lead at long last, as he explained in an interview with The Associated Press.
Murphy first received the phone call from Nolan where the director told him that he wanted him to be his Oppenheimer, which left the actor in disbelief.
He said that he had 'always said publicly and privately, to Chris, that if I’m available and you want me to be in a movie, I’m there'.
""I don’t really care about the size of the part,” he explained. “But deep down, secretly, I was desperate to play a lead for him.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaWxhZC5jb20vY2VsZWJyaXR5L3JvYmVydC1kb3duZXktanItY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tMTIxMTM5LTIwMjMwNzA50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-01 15:44:16+00:00,BBC ‘Oppenheimer’ Series Returns To IPlayer 40 Years After Launch,The BBC 'Oppenheimer' series is on iPlayer after the success of Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy film.,"Christopher Nolan‘s Oppenheimer has been grabbing plenty of headlines and dollars this week but the BBC has turned the clocks back to a different retelling, making its classic series available on iPlayer.
The BAFTA-winning series aired on the BBC more than 40 years ago and is available from today as a boxset on the VoD player.
Sam Waterston was the Cillian Murphy of the series, starring as the titular scientist as he led the weapons laboratory of the Manhattan Project, all the while under constant surveillance by the FBI because of his left wing politics and association with communists. As with Nolan’s movie, the show followed his role in developing the world’s first nuclear weapons and his rivalry with Edward Teller, through to being stripped of his security clearance by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in the 1950s. David Suchet, Kate Harper, John Carson, Christopher Munke and Jana Shelden also starred.
The show catapulted Waterston to fame, as he went on to land roles in Law and Order, The Newsroom, and Grace & Frankie. It aired in the U.S. on PBS’ American Playhouse and won three BAFTAs including Best Drama Series, while being nominated for seven.
The BBC’s move comes as Oppenheimer tears up the global box office alongside Barbie. Deadline’s latest box office report had Universal‘s opus at $405.6M global and more is expected this weekend during the second ‘Barbenheimer’ holdover.

,Emily Blunt gave Christopher Nolan Uggs as an Oppenheimer wrap gift,Christopher Nolan revealed that Emily Blunt gave him a pair of Uggs as an 'Oppenheimer' wrap gift after he criticized her for wearing them on set.,"Emily Blunt has successfully converted Christopher Nolan to the dark side of footwear.
The director revealed this week that, after mercilessly criticizing Blunt for sporting Ugg boots on the set of his new drama Oppenheimer instead of her period-appropriate heels, he now gets their appeal.
""She gave me a pair of Uggs boots — Ugg slippers, actually — as a wrap gift,"" Nolan said on Friday's episode of The View. ""For people who have been on a set, people know how it works — we're there, losing the light, 'Okay, we need the actors to come in,' and sometimes they'll come straight from wardrobe, but they'll have these big coats on top and they'll be wearing these big Ugg boots, because the shoes of the character are uncomfortable. You know, 1940s shoes.""
Nolan explained that seeing Blunt show up wearing her Uggs ""used to drive me crazy"" during shooting. ""I'd immediately say to her, 'Can you please just get rid of the boots, put the shoes on, and get ready to go?'"" he recalled, before joking, ""And she got so sick of me saying that time after time, she thought I should join the cult of Ugg boots.""
These days, Nolan added, he considers the boots to be ""pretty comfortable.""

Blunt previously shared her side of the story in a recent USA Today interview, jokingly declaring that Nolan ""hates Uggs more than anyone"" else in the entire world.
""I've never known anyone to detest a pair of Uggs more than Chris Nolan,"" she said, calling it a ""testament"" to the director's intense desire for verisimilitude while filming. ""I would sometimes put on some Uggs and I'd just get this withering look down to my feet – it was like being in The Devil Wears Prada again. Just the look down to the shoes. And I'd go, 'I know, I know. But I'm just sitting on an apple box in the background today!'""
Naturally, Blunt had to send a pair his way. Afterward, she explained, she received a note from Nolan's wife, Emma Thomas, who wrote her to say, ""Brilliant wrap gift. He's wearing them now.""
""I was so pleased!"" Blunt recalled.
Oppenheimer also stars Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr. Based on the true story of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Murphy), the scientist who led the effort to create an atomic bomb during World War II, the movie is playing in theaters now.

2023-07-20 14:36:43.753000-04:00,Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan Wage War (Against Wigs),"Christopher Nolan avoids using wigs at all costs, and it affected his shooting schedule for ‘Oppenheimer.’ But that’s okay — Cillian Murphy hates them too.","Does Cillian Murphy wear wigs? No. Has Cillian Murphy worn wigs? No. Will Cillian Murphy wear wigs? No. When will Cillian Murphy wear wigs? Never. At least, if Christopher Nolan has anything to do with it. The two have collaborated on six movies together now (counting two cameos in the later Batman films), and there’s a bit of a mind meld happening … or is it a hair meld? The two of them abhor wigs. Christopher Nolan even dictated his shooting schedule around hair, he told the New Time Times. “I did insist on scheduling it around Cillian’s haircut,” Nolan told the Times. “Because I’m very allergic to wigs in movies. I really wanted the film to not have any obvious artifice when it came to the way characters presented themselves.” Of course, an empathetic person might wonder to themselves: What if Cillian Murphy wants to wear wigs? Is his relationship with Christopher Nolan depriving him of synthetic hair? Never fear — Murphy is in lockstep with his director. “I don’t generally do wigs,” he told Vulture in 2019. Then he took it a step further: “I think they look phony. If I see that a character has to wear a wig, I generally won’t do the part.” The lesson here? Cillian Murphy will never be cast on RuPaul’s Drag Race, no matter how much he looks like Admira Thunderpussy.

2023-07-18 17:47:00+00:00,All About Cillian Murphy's Wife Yvonne McGuinness,"Cillian Murphy is married Yvonne McGuinness, an Irish artist known for her performance installations. Get to know their love story.","With the release of Oppenheimer, the already very successful Cillian Murphy has been put in a brighter spotlight. The Christopher Nolan film about the lead scientist of the Manhattan Project was probably going to receive a lot of press to begin with, but the surprise connection the movie has made to Greta Gerwig’s Barbie film has made it part of a hotly-anticipated double feature—they’re both coming out on the same day, and fans are going wild for the box office competition.
Murphy appears to be taking it all in stride. The Irish actor seems like a pretty down-to-earth guy, and that may be partly because of his devotion to his family. Murphy is married Yvonne McGuinness, an Irish artist known for her performance installations. The couple share two sons, Malachy and Aran, with whom they live in Dublin. Murphy made the decision to be at home as much as possible despite having a Hollywood job.
“I don't need to live in Los Angeles,” he told People in 2005. “I'd be tremendously far away from my family—I'd never see them.”
Here’s everything to know about Cillian Murphy’s wife Yvonne McGuinness.
What does Yvonne McGuinness do?
McGuinness has a career in the visual arts and holds a master's degree from the Royal College of Art in London. She says on her website that her installations incorporate “film, performance, sculptural and textile elements, sound, and writing.”
Many of them include performing, so she and Murphy have that practice in common.
She has also been in charge of the household while Murphy is traveling for work, which he has praised her for repeatedly.
For his hit show Peaky Blinders, Murphy has to move to Liverpool, where he lived “zero” life, per his interview with The Guardian.
“It's cancelled life,” he explained. “You go home to your tiny apartment at the end of the day, and you feed yourself for sustenance and you learn the lines for the next day and you try to get as much sleep as you possibly can. Which isn't much. And then you get up and do it again.”
Meanwhile, McGuinness was home waiting to welcome him back after filming and support him as he decompressed from the demanding schedule.
He told GQ in an interview, “That work-life balance thing is hard. I have an amazing wife and I couldn't do this without her and her understanding. But it is a struggle…I think it is for any dad whose work takes him away, which it generally does, and which consumes him, which my work does.”
He also acknowledged McGuinness for keeping him grounded, even as he becomes a more high-profile actor.
“The fame thing was never a goal. I just want to improve,” Murphy told People. “If I can leave one film behind that's something that affects somebody, that's absolutely fine…it’s very important to have somebody like that [McGuinness]. My life hasn't changed in any way, really. I still have the same friends, and we go to the same places.”
How did Murphy and McGuinness meet?
In the late 1990s, Murphy was cast in a play called Disco Pigs, which was first put up in Cork, Ireland. It ended up being a bit hit and went on to tour, first Dublin and London and then around the world for about 18 months. Murphy told The Guardian in 2016 that McGuinness was on tour with the group.
“That time, making Disco Pigs, was kind of the most important period of my life,” he explained. “The people I met there remain my closest friends … They shaped me in terms of my tastes, in terms of what I wanted to do with my life. And it was around the same time I met my wife. She came on tour with us. It was so exciting, 20 years ago or whatever it was—we were all just kids, trying to find our way—but such a special, special time.”
How long have Murphy and McGuinness been together?
The couple met in the late '90s, but didn’t marry until 2004. They have two sons. Malachy was born in 2005, and Aran was born in 2007. He told the Guardian that he and McGuinness were able to be close to each other during her first pregnancy because he was filming The Wind that Shakes the Barley near his parent’s home in Cork.
“I was living at home with my folks, my wife was pregnant with our son, and we were running around the hills of west Cork shooting up Black and Tans. Fantastic!” he described.
At first, they raised the kids in London but decided to go back to Ireland in 2015 to be closer to family again.
“We wanted them to be Irish, I suppose,” he said. “It's amazing how quickly their accents have adapted. Even within a year of moving back, they are fading into this rakish west Brit kind of thing. Which I think, hopefully, will get them lots of girls when they're 15.”
He said in 2016 that he thinks his sons seem more confident than when he was a teen.
“I had bravado. But, deep down … I don't know, they seem better adjusted than I was,” he explained. “More sure of themselves. I'm happy about that. For me, it was something that took a long time to figure out: that it's all right to be you, that it's all right to be an individual.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvY2VsZWJyaXRpZXMvYTQ0NTc5MzI0L3doby1pcy1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS13aWZlLXl2b25uZS1tY2d1aW5uZXNzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

A number of audiences have seen the film ahead of its scheduled release on July 21, prompting Nolan to speak about how the film affected them.
""Some people leave the movie absolutely devastated. They can't speak,"" Nolan recently told WIRED.
""I mean, there's an element of fear that's there in the history and there in the underpinnings.
""But the love of the characters, the love of the relationships, is as strong as I've ever done.""
Nolan went on to say that his new film is ""an intense experience, because it's an intense story.
""I showed it to a filmmaker recently who said it's kind of a horror movie. I don't disagree.""
He added: ""But as I started to finish the film, I started to feel this color that's not in my other films, just darkness. It's there. The film fights against that.""
When asked what he thought was going on in the real Oppenheimer's head, Nolan said: ""I wrote this script in the first person. It's what I told Cillian [Murphy, who plays Oppenheimer]: You are the eyes of the audience. And he takes us there.
""The bulk of the storytelling, we don't go outside his experience. It's my best attempt to convey the answer to that question.""
In ""Oppenheimer,"" Murphy joins a star-studded cast, including Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife Katherine, Florence Pugh as psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, and Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project.
It also features Robert Downey Jr. and Rami Malek.
Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer"" by Kai Bird, the film centers on the life of Oppenheimer as he works to develop the atomic bombs that would eventually be dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.

2023-07-24 21:00:08+00:00,Will ‘Oppenheimer’ be the ticket to Christopher Nolan’s elusive first Oscar?,"The filmmaker has been nominated five times over the last 22 years, but he has yet to win.","It’s been more than two decades since filmmaker Christopher Nolan‘s first Oscar nomination, but he’s still waiting for his first victory. Will “Oppenheimer” be the film that finally nabs him the gold?
The first of Nolan’s five career nominations to date came 22 years ago. It was Best Original Screenplay for his and Jonathan Nolan‘s tricky, innovative script for “Memento,” a 2001 thriller about a man with short-term memory loss that was told in reverse order. That indie film led to bigger projects, including the “Batman” trilogy that marked his breakthrough in blockbuster filmmaking. The second of those, “The Dark Knight” (2008), was touted for potential Oscars and indeed received eight of them, but Nolan himself was snubbed entirely: no Best Picture, no Best Director, and no Best Adapted Screenplay.
He got his elusive first Best Picture nom for the sci-fi epic “Inception” (2010), for which he was also nominated for writing. But again, no Best Director bid. That would wait a few more years, finally coming for his 2017 war film “Dunkirk”; Nolan received Picture and Director bids for that one. Which brings us to “Oppenheimer.” On paper it’s Oscars catnip: a biopic (check) about an important historical figure (check) set during World War II (check) and featuring a highly pedigreed cast and crew (check). But will that translate to actual awards?
As of this writing the film ranks second in our odds for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, all of which would go to Nolan as producer, director, and writer of the film. If the odds hold true and he receives those nominations, it would be his first time contending in all three fields at the same time. Unfortunately for Nolan, though, for the moment he’s stuck behind Martin Scorsese‘s “Killers of the Flower Moon” in all three categories. “Flower Moon” has already screened at the Cannes Film Festival to rapturous reviews, so it might be tough for “Oppenheimer” to catch. But the story of Oscars is never fully written as early as July, so Nolan’s overdue narrative may yet boost him towards the winner’s circle.

It will also move into the No. 4 spot on the global chart for 2023 so far.
The international box office cume through tomorrow is projected at $432M after a $31.8M fifth session. Oppenheimer is the biggest Nolan film of all time at the international box office when restated to today’s dollars and excluding un-released markets.
For the year so far, the Cillian Murphy-starrer is the No. 3 movie overseas, excluding China where it releases on August 30. As previously noted, this is Nolan’s highest-grossing movie in 50 markets, and now his top non-superhero title in 63.
The Top 5 markets through Friday are the UK ($62.1M), Germany ($38.1M), France ($30.4M), Australia ($22.1M) and Spain ($17.8M). Also notable, Korea is seeing a big opening weekend with $10.4M through today.
We’ll have a full update on Sunday.
PREVIOUS UPDATE, August 10: With today’s business, Christopher Nolan’s epic Oppenheimer will hit yet another benchmark, crossing $600M at the global box office. The latest milestone comes just 23 days into release.
Adding $7.7M on Wednesday from 78 overseas markets, the Universal title’s international box office cume through yesterday is $350.7M. The worldwide total is $593.5M. Markets still to release include Vietnam (today) and Italy, Korea and China through the rest of August.
Already having surpassed Dunkirk as Nolan’s fifth-highest grossing film of all time globally this past weekend and becoming the biggest WWII movie ever worldwide (see previous post below), Oppenheimer is now the filmmaker’s top movie ever in 47 markets, including Germany, Netherlands, India, Belgium, Norway, the UAE, Poland and more. It’s also the best for Nolan outside the Batman franchise in 61 markets, including Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, Central America and the Philippines.
The Cillian Murphy-starrer has been seeing solid midweek play and, through Wednesday, is led by the UK with $53.4M, in line with Dunkirk (+1%) and The Dark Knight Rises (-7%) at the same point, having already surpassed the lifetimes of Inception, Interstellar and Tenet in the market.
Germany has also advanced since Sunday, now at $31.5M through Wednesday when it surpassed the lifetime of The Dark Knight Rises to become the biggest Nolan film ever in the market.
France has grossed $26.1M to date, running 20% above The Dark Knight Rises at the same point in time. Australia is at $19.1M through Wednesday, which is 16% above Inception, having already surpassed the lifetimes of Dunkirk, Interstellar and Tenet. And, India is now at $16.7M.

PREVIOUS, August 5: Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer has reached the $500M global milestone, on its way to an estimated $551M through Sunday. This would make it the filmmaker’s fifth-highest-grossing film of all time, ahead of Dunkirk.

Overseas, the Universal title is expected to see an impressive 33% drop in the third frame, adding $51M and reaching an estimated international box office cume through Sunday of $323M, which is 129% above Dunkirk, 169% above Interstellar, 212% above Tenet, and 25% above The Dark Knight Rises at the same point in like-for-like markets.
The Cillian Murphy-starrer is the biggest Nolan film of all-time in 41 markets including the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, India, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. It is Nolan’s top non-Batman pic in 55, including Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Austria, Poland and Malaysia.
The epic story of the titular complicated and brilliant physicist tasked with leading the Manhattan Project, the secret effort to create the atom bomb, and the moral and political struggles that followed is now one of four biographical films to cross $500M global box office ever, including Bohemian Rhapsody, The Passion of the Christ and American Sniper.
Through Sunday, Oppenheimer will rank as the highest-grossing WWII movie of all time worldwide in reported historic grosses, ie also ahead of Saving Private Ryan ($482M) and Pearl Harbor ($449M).
The Top 5 markets through Friday are the UK/Ireland with $45M followed by Germany with $24.6M, France ($21.8M), Australia ($16M) and India ($15M).

Director Christopher Nolan has opened up about leading stars Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Florence Pugh leaving the London premiere of Oppenheimer to support the SAG-AFTRA strike.
The director said he supported the actors joining the writers who are seeking 'better pay, streaming royalties and restrictions on the implementation of artificial intelligence'.
The 52-year-old appeared on the USA's Today show and said: ""It was a bittersweet moment. We were all there. We were very fortunate.
""We had the opportunity to somewhat celebrate the film and the actors were all there to support, but then when the time came had to down tools and go off in support of all of their fellow actors and then support the writers as well.""

The Oscar-nominated filmmaker said that 'the business models have been rewritten by the companies we work for, and it's time to rewrite the deals' and the strikes marked 'an important moment in the industry'.
""Hopefully, with everybody unified, that can happen quickly as possible,"" he said.
Nolan told the cinema's audience at the London premiere last week, where Murphy, Pugh, Damon, Blunt and Rami Malek left early: ""
""You've seen them here earlier on the red carpet. Unfortunately, they're off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by SAG, joining one of my guilds, the Writers Guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of the unions, and we support them.""
Credit: NBC
He told the audience: ""They are here in spirit, and you'll get to see their incredible work and the reason we value these talented people so much and need to care for them and make sure they're looked after.
""Thanks so much for being here and we hope you enjoy the film,' he added as the audience applauded his supportive words.""
Speaking to Deadline on the red carpet, Emily said: ""I hope everyone makes a fair deal and we are here to celebrate this movie.
""And if they call [a strike], we'll be leaving together as cast in unity with everyone. We are going to have to. We will see what happens. Right now it's a joy to be together.""
The movie lands in cinemas on Friday.

Christopher Nolan’s long-awaited new blockbuster Oppenheimer is out in cinemas this week.
The film starring Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the titular role promises to tell the story of American scientist J Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic bomb.
It is partially based on the Pulitzer-Prize-winning 2005 biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer written by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin over a period of 25 years.
“Celebrated in 1945 as the ‘father of the atomic bomb,’ nine years later he would become the chief celebrity victim of the McCarthyite maelstrom,” Bird wrote in a recent opinion piece for The New York Times.
Oppenheimer is the first film to properly tackle the scientist and his legacy, which was marred by a controversial 1954 hearing that resulted in his security clearance being revoked.
Who was J Robert Oppenheimer?
Oppenheimer was born into an affluent German-Jewish family in New York City. His family’s art collection included original works by Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh.
Dr J Robert Oppenheimer (AP)
It became apparent at an early age that Oppenheimer’s academic ability outstripped those of his peers and he entered Harvard University aged 18 where he graduated after just three years summa cum laude (with highest praise).
However, he struggled with his mental health. During his time at college, he expressed suicidal thoughts and, while pursuing a graduate degree at Cambridge University, deliberately left an apple, poisoned with laboratory chemicals, on his tutor’s desk.
By the outbreak of World War II, though, Oppenheimer had transformed himself into a respected professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and had already made numerous, significant contributions to science.
During his time at Berkeley, he fell in love with Jean Tatlock (played by Florence Pugh in Oppenheimer), the daughter of a Berkeley literature professor and a student at Stanford University School of Medicine. She was a member of the Communist Party, which later became an issue in his security clearance hearings.

It’s been confirmed Murphy and Pugh have scenes of “prolonged nudity” together – a first in Nolan’s filmography.
They broke up in 1939 and, a year later, he married Katherine (”Kitty”) Puening with whom he had two children.
During their marriage, Oppenheimer rekindled his relationship with Tatlock and the two had an affair. She later committed suicide in 1944.

The Manhattan Project
In 1941, two months before the United States entered World War II, President Franklin D Roosevelt approved a programme to develop an atomic bomb.
A year later, Oppenheimer was recruited by the National Defense Research Committee to research the building of an atomic bomb.
That September, General Leslie Groves (played by Matt Damon in the film) took over as head of the Manhattan Project (named after its inaugural offices in lower Manhattan) and selected Oppenheimer to head the project’s secret weapons laboratory.
For three years, Oppenheimer and a huge team of scientists worked towards the creation of an atomic bomb out of a military laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico.
Their work culminated in the first nuclear detonation in history, known as the Trinity test, on 16 July 1945. In an interview conducted years later, Oppenheimer claimed that a line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita, had come into his mind during the detonation: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”
A month later two of the bombs developed by the Manhattan Project were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, killing approximately 200,000 people, the majority of whom were civilians.
On August 15, Emperor Hirohito announced Japan’s surrender.

The security hearing
After the project’s success, Oppenheimer continued to act as a nuclear weapons consultant for the US government; however, he warned against their devastating capabilities.
In a 1953, speech he likened the nuclear capabilities of the United States and the Soviet Union to “two scorpions in a bottle, each capable of killing the other, but only at the risk of his own life”.
In December of that year, during the Second Red Scare in the US, Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Chairman Lewis Strauss (played by Robert Downey Jr in Nolan’s film) told Oppenheimer that his top-secret security clearance had been revoked and insisted on his resignation.
However, the scientist refused and insisted on defending himself at a highly-publicised security hearing, which he lost amid public humiliation.
Numerous sources have suggested that Oppenheimer never recovered from the incident.
The New York Times wrote in his obituary: “This bafflingly complex man nonetheless never fully succeeded in dispelling doubts about his conduct.”
Attempts were later made to repair Oppenheimer’s image – in 1963, President Lyndon B Johnson presented Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award, the AEC’s highest honour.
A chainsmoker, Oppenheimer died of throat cancer in his home in Princeton in February 1967.
In his piece for The NYT, Bird wrote: “It is my hope that Christopher Nolan’s stunning new film on Oppenheimer’s complicated legacy will initiate a national conversation not only about our existential relationship to weapons of mass destruction, but also the need in our society for scientists as public intellectuals.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL2FydHMtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9maWxtcy9uZXdzL3doby13YXMtai1yb2JlcnQtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItYjIzODA0MDUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-28 22:00:00+00:00,The True Story of Lewis Strauss' Rivalry With J. Robert Oppenheimer,Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' features Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss  Here's what to know about Strauss' career and feud with J. Robert Oppenheimer.,"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, the three-hour epic chronicling the invention of the nuclear bomb and its aftermath, features a virtuosic performance from Cillian Murphy and focuses largely on his titular scientist as he grapples with the ramifications of his own hubris. Supporting Murphy is an all-star cast of actors portraying real-life figures from that time period, including Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife Kitty, Florence Pugh as his lover Jean Tatlock, and Gary Oldman as U.S. President Harry Truman.
Especially pivotal to the film's third act is former MCU star Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, a member of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and an increasingly antagonistic party in the security hearings that ultimately result in Oppenheimer's clearance being revoked.
As the film tells it, Strauss is initially driven by professional jealousy and resentment towards Oppenheimer, as well as a degree of perceived humiliation: he believes Oppenheimer ""badmouthed"" him to renowned physicist Albert Einstein (Tom Conti).
And while some of the enmity between the two men may be narrativized and played for dramatic effect, the details of Strauss' vendetta against Oppenheimer are based in well-documented facts.

Who was Lewis Strauss?
As a founding member of the AEC, Strauss played an instrumental role in the development of nuclear weapons and energy in the United States during the Cold War. However, while Strauss was a supporter of research into the creation of the hydrogen bomb, which J. Robert Oppenheimer vehemently opposed due to his own guilt following the destruction at Hiroshima.
Strauss' grudge against J. Robert Oppenheimer is believed to have worsened in 1947, when the physicist was offered a job as director at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study—a position for which Strauss had momentarily been considered. He also disliked Oppenheimer on personal and political grounds: Oppenheimer was a liberal who associated with Communists and spoke seldom of his Jewish heritage, while Strauss was a Republican, sat on the American Jewish Committee, and had attempted (unsuccessfully) to influence U.S. policy to increase the number of refugees allowed into the country during the Holocaust.
These resentments culminated in Strauss arranging for Oppenheimer to be stripped of his security clearance following the 1954 hearings—just one day before they had been due to expire, seemingly confirming that his primary intention had been to humiliate and discredit Oppenheimer.
In an interview with Vulture prior to the release of Oppenheimer, Downey shared his thoughts on Strauss and offered an alternative take on the man, who is presented in stark antagonism to Murphy's Oppenheimer.
""I had a previous fair understanding of Strauss because I was fascinated with the mechanics of warfare, particularly in the Pacific theater in World War II,"" he said. ""I challenged a little bit the Mozart-Salieri of it all. I said, I’m not sure in some ways that Strauss isn’t a bit the hero here, which kind of raised an eyebrow on Chris [Nolan]. I half-jokingly challenged him on whether Admiral Strauss hadn’t done everything that any patriotic American would’ve done. And he said, Well, this will be a wonderful ongoing dialogue.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNoZWFsdGguY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYTQ0NjYxODU3L2xld2lzLXN0cmF1c3Mtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItcml2YWxyeS10cnVlLXN0b3J5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-18 07:57:19+05:30,"Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer: A look at the scientist’s fascination with Hinduism, and why he quoted the Bhagavad Gita after the bomb was tested",Christopher Nolan's upcoming film has reawakened interest in nuclear physicist J Robert Oppenheimer's fascination with the Hindu religion.,"As fans in India excitedly wait for the release of Christopher Nolan‘s new film, Oppenheimer, many have revisited the famed nuclear physicist’s iconic reference to the Bhagavad Gita. J Robert Oppenheimer has often quoted from the sacred text, making the words synonymous with his achievements.
Oppenheimer’s research resulted in the creation of the first nuclear bombs. He immediately understood the gravity of what he had helped create, and has often said that the first words that ran through his mind after the bomb was successfully tested in the New Mexico desert in 1945 were from the Gita: “If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the Mighty One… I am become death, the shatterer of worlds.”
According to Time Magazine, Oppenheimer read the Gita for his ‘personal delight’ in the evenings, and sometimes to entertain friends. A copy of the sacred text, bound in pink and held together by scotch tape, was placed in his Princeton study. He took lessons in Sanskrit, his eighth language, from Professor Arthur W Ryder at Berkeley, and was particularly fond of the couplet, “Scholarship is less than sense, therefore seek intelligence.” According to his colleague, the Nobel Prize winner Isidor Rabi, Oppenheimer was ‘overeducated’ in fields that ‘lie outside the scientific tradition’, such as his interest in the Hindu religion. Rabi said, “He saw physics clearly, looking toward what had already been done, but at the border he tended to feel there was much more of the mysterious and novel than there actually was… [he turned] away from the hard, crude methods of theoretical physics into a mystical realm of broad intuition.”

A Time Magazine report published in 1948 recounted his story, and quoted Brigadier General Thomas F Farrell as describing Oppenheimer’s demeanour on the fateful day. “He grew tenser as the last seconds ticked off. He scarcely breathed. He held on to a post to steady himself . . . When the announcer shouted ‘Now!’ and there came this tremendous burst of light, followed … by the deep-growling roar of the explosion, his face relaxed into an expression of tremendous relief.”
Years later, he would still be impacted by the ethical complexities of creating a bomb capable of such destruction. Deployment of two atom bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki effectively brought World War 2 to an end. But the destruction caused by something that he had helped create confirmed Oppenheimer’s fears. He told fellow physicists, according to the obituary that the New York Times published on his death in 1967, that the bomb “dramatised so mercilessly the inhumanity and evil of modern war.” He added, “In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no overstatements can quite extinguish,” he went on, “the physicists have known sin; and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.”
In a news interview following the bombings on Japan, Oppenheimer once again recalled the emotions that were felt in the control room on the day of the test. “We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, ‘Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.’ I suppose we all thought that one way or another.”
He made an effort to regulate atomic energy by heading the Atomic Energy Commission’s General Advisory Committee of top nuclear scientists. He also served on the atomic committee of the Research and Development Board to advise the military.

The 1945 test will be featured prominently in the film Oppenheimer, as the trailers have shown. One of the most haunting images of the trailer shows Oppenheimer’s face lit up by the light of the explosion. The film will be released in theatres across the world on July 21, and advance booking for it began three weeks prior to release date. Although recent reports suggest that advance bookings were temporarily halted because the film received an A certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification.

2023-07-05 19:57:04+00:00,"Who is Oppenheimer and why is Christopher Nolan, one of the biggest directors in Hollywood, making a movie about him?","Oppenheimer's life, work, and complicated legacy are dramatic enough for the big screen. But what can audiences learn from his story in 2023?","J. Robert Oppenheimer.
Even if that name doesn’t ring a bell, you almost certainly know who he is. Known as the father of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer is one of the most important figures of the 20th century––and now he’s the protagonist of one of the year’s biggest movies from Christopher Nolan, one of the biggest directors working today.
Considering Nolan’s filmography––dark superhero epics like “The Dark Knight,” cerebral, twist-filled blockbusters like “Inception”––it might seem odd that he’s tackling a film about Oppenheimer. But the life, work and legacy of the man are more than deserving of a jump to the big screen, says Gretchen Heefner, an associate professor of history at Northeastern University.
Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer is an IMAX®-shot epic thriller.
His leadership in the Manhattan Project, the top secret operation to develop the atomic bomb before the Nazis, that culminated in the creation of a world-altering weapon is notable enough. His post-World War II disgust in what he had created and fierce attempt to regulate nuclear weapons even more so. But according to Heefner, he was also just “an interesting character” who seems almost tailor-made for the movies.
“He was this really complicated, interesting figure,” Heefner says. “He flirted with communism for a while. He was known to be volatile, difficult to work with yet apparently a good manager when he was at [the Manhattan Project’s] Los Alamos [lab].”
Based on Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning biography “American Prometheus,” “Oppenheimer,” due to hit theaters on July 21, stars Cillian Murphy in the titular role and, based on trailers, appears to follow his early days, time on the Manhattan Project and the post-war period that destroyed his career.

Oppenheimer quickly acquired a reputation as a brilliant theoretical physicist who was pretty clumsy in a lab. He was also incredibly driven––sometimes to the point of obsession––and, as a result, prolific. Oppenheimer is mostly known for his contributions to theoretical astronomy, astrophysics, quantum field theory and, of course, nuclear physics
But Oppenheimer was also known as much for his personality as his publications.
Tall, lanky and constantly smoking a cigarette, Oppenheimer was in many ways a renaissance man. He could learn other languages incredibly fast and was often as knowledgeable and passionate about philosophy and art as he was physics.
He also was not afraid to show how knowledgeable he was. As a university student, he would dominate class discussions to the point that his classmates threatened to boycott their class, according to Bird and Sherwin. During his university years, Oppenheimer also struggled with depression that manifested in some violent behavior toward some of his closest friends.
Politically, Oppenheimer was a supporter of progressive causes and left-wing politics throughout his life. Although he never formally joined the Communist Party, in the 1930s he was an active supporter, financially and philosophically, of reforms and ideas that aligned with the party. During the Red Scare of the ’40s and ’50s, this would prove his undoing.
With a character like that at the center of his film, the focus of Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” is largely what has come to define the physicist’s legacy––the creation of the first atomic bomb––and his response to that legacy.

In October 1941, two months before the U.S. entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt officially signed off on the development of an atomic bomb. Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves (played by Matt Damon in the film) was eventually made director of the Manhattan Project, the name for the top secret project for developing the atomic bomb.
Groves chose Oppenheimer to lead the project’s secret weapons lab in New Mexico. Oppenheimer assembled a team of top tier physicists, some from the U.S. and others who had fled from Europe and Nazi Germany. For those involved in the project, there was a sense of urgency unlike anything else.
“They were like, ‘If Hitler gets it, it’s all over,’” Heefner says. “There was a sense of if your enemy has it, they’ll use it and then it’s over. Early on that was the preoccupation. It’s the ultimate weapon, so if you have it, you can threaten anything.”
In 1945, the hard work of countless Los Alamos Laboratory scientists culminated in the first nuclear explosion at a New Mexico site, codenamed “Trinity.” The Trinity nuclear test is one of the most important and iconic moments of the 20th century––so important that Nolan was adamant he needed to recreate the explosion practically, without computer generated imagery.
“We knew the world would not be the same,” Oppenheimer said of that moment in a 1965 televised interview.
He was right. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 helped end the war but also ushered in a nuclear arms race and Cold War.
He was capable of remorse and reflection. He understood that his actions had consequences and was working for a greater good more than ego. Gretchen Heefner, an associate professor of history at Northeastern University
In the same television interview, Oppenheimer says in the moment the Trinity test went off he was reminded of a quote from the Bhagavad Gita: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” It’s a quote that came to define his relationship with his creation for the rest of his life.
In response to the U.S. dropping its second bomb on Nagasaki, Oppenheimer hand-delivered a letter expressing his disgust to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson. For the rest of his life, the father of the atomic bomb would be one of the fiercest advocates for its regulation.
“Oppenheimer’s post-war life is that he was in part horrified by what he had done,” Heefner says. “He was still involved in the U.S. military and the Atomic Energy Commission, which was the organization set up to manage the bomb and manage nuclear materials. … But he also was an advocate for international control of atomic energy, which was not as pie in the sky as it sounds.”
Oppenheimer hoped an international arms regulation could avert what he saw as a potential arms race. He was right, in a sense. The Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb in 1949, prompting the U.S. to start developing the more powerful hydrogen bomb, or “super bomb,” against the recommendations of Oppenheimer and members of the AEC.
Against his wishes, Oppenheimer’s creation completely altered post-war life and politics. The ability for global powers to develop tools of mass destruction changed geopolitics forever and created a sense of paranoia and fear that pervaded culture for decades.
“It was clearly destabilizing in the fact that it creates a certain hierarchy of power,” Heefner says. “Who has it? Who has the umbrella that lets you stay secure? Who says, ‘We’ll share it with you?’ It created strange alliances.”
But Heefner says Oppenheimer’s post-war efforts were not totally in vain––nuclear weapons are “highly regulated”––but they did cost him almost everything.
“Oppenheimer was opposed to it, and because of that he became a political football,” Heefner says. “He also was a contentious personality, so he didn’t do any of this smoothly. He was charged with being disloyal, possibly being a communist or Soviet sympathizer, which in this time period was incredibly damaging.”
A brilliant mind on a meteoric rise, a scientific breakthrough with world-shattering implications and a fall from grace due to convictions that flew in the face of the political powers that be: Oppenheimer’s life is full of enough material for several movies. Heefner can only speculate about Nolan’s interest in this story, but she says even decades later Oppenheimer, flaws and all, is a reminder of what scientists and forward thinkers can do for––and to––the world.
“Oppenheimer was a scientist, a big thinker and deeply compassionate,” she adds. “He was capable of remorse and reflection. He understood that his actions had consequences and was working for a greater good more than ego.”

""It is the Biggest Story of the Last 100 Years:"" Matt Damon and Emily Blunt Talk Oppenheimer
The duo behind Oppenheimer got candid about the real-life people who inspired their characters in Christopher Nolan's new film.
When your lives are dedicated to something as potentially world-altering as the creation of the atomic bomb, things are bound to get complicated. J. Robert Oppenheimer and his wife Katherine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer, portrayed by Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt, respectively, in Christopher Nolan's latest project, Oppenheimer, were proof of that.
When NBC Insider spoke with Blunt at a press junket before the start of the SAG-AFTRA strike about her perception of Kitty’s life — which was often marred by isolation and addiction after her husband moved their family to a remote town in New Mexico in order to complete his work on the Manhattan Project — she didn’t hold back in describing how difficult it seemed.
RELATED: Oppenheimer Stars Explain Why Working with Christopher Nolan Is an ""Instant Yes""
“I think that she deteriorated as everybody sees,” Blunt said of Kitty’s mental and physical state throughout her life and, subsequently, the film. “She's sort of like decayed over the course of the film and of a lifetime because she was fostering [her husband’s] future, his plans, his pursuit.”
But, she clarified, that wasn’t all too different from other wives in the mid-20th century.
“A lot of women contorted themselves to facilitate a husband's needs,” she said. “But this was on like a world-changing scale.”
Kitty’s mental and emotional state, while not too unusual, as Blunt said, was only exacerbated by the reality she lived in. The families attached to the Manhattan Project — who were moved to the remote desert location to create and test a potentially world-ending weapon as yet witnessed by humanity — were all isolated and kept in a sort of insular community. A story like that naturally lends itself to a haunting kind of environment.

And thus, Oppenheimer is as much a thrilling horror film at times as it is a biopic about the man who created the world’s first atomic weapon.
“I feel like it is a historical film, it is a kind of a biopic, but it's not in many ways because [Nolan’s] managed to kind of smuggle in all these other genres,” Murphy said at the same junket. “Like it's a thriller, it's a love story, it's kind of got very, very strong horror elements in it I think sometimes and I think it's incredibly entertaining — but also it's provocative.”
Ultimately, Murphy concludes, Oppenheimer is a film that “asks questions of the audience,” questions we can try and answer when it premieres exclusively in theaters on July 21.

On Monday, Spielberg, 76, and McCartney, 81, were spotted outside a movie theater in New York's summer vacation hotspot the Hamptons as they attended a showing of Christopher Nolan's new movie Oppenheimer.

Spielberg wore a white hat with a matching jacket, jeans, sneakers and a blue-and-white shirt to the theater, while McCartney wore a blue sweatshirt, dark pants and sunglasses.



The Beatles alum referenced knowing director Spielberg as far back as 1986, when he told Rolling Stone he sought out Spielberg's advice on the possibility of making a movie about the Beatles' career.

Back in December, Spielberg noted that one of McCartney’s famed Beatles song — “Michelle” from 1965’s Rubber Soul — helped grant him an opportunity to share a first kiss with a girlfriend in college.

Oppenheimer stars Cillian Murphy as physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and features performances from Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr. and a large ensemble cast.



The film follows Oppenheimer's life and participation in the United States' atomic weapons program during World War II and beyond. Its opening weekend box office success has been tied to its simultaneous release with the blockbuster Barbie movie. One study found that Oppenheimer made nearly $5 million of its ticket sales from moviegoers who originally planned to see Barbie but made a backup plan when the comedy was sold out.

Several stars shared that they would be in line to see Barbie and Oppenheimer, including Tom Cruise, whose latest Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is also in theaters now.

""This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters. Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indy and one of the most iconic characters in history,"" Cruise wrote on Twitter in June, adding, ""I love a double feature, and it doesn't get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Oppenheimer and Barbie.""

,Oppenheimer star Cillian Murphy reacts to Danny Boyle’s 28 Days Later sequel update,"‘I didnt know that,’ the ‘Oppenheimer’ star said","Cillian Murphy has reacted to the news that 28 Years Later finally seems to be happening.

Last week, the film’s director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland discussed plans to make a second follow-up to their hit 2000 horror film 28 Days Later.

Garland recently said that “an idea” for a potential new film “materialised a few years ago”, adding: “Danny always liked the idea.”

Boyle told Inverse that the pair are currently “talking about it quite seriously, quite diligently”, stating that if Garland didn’t want to direct the film, he himself would “be well up for it”.

Soon after these quotes surfaced, The Independent spoke with Cillian Murphy during the promotional trail for his new film, Christopher Nolan’s drama Oppenheimer.

Murphy played the lead role of Jim in 28 Days Later, which follows survivors of an incurable virus that ravages the world.

The sequel 28 Weeks Later (2007) focused on a different set of characters, led by Robert Carlyle, and while it’s unknown whether Garland and Boyle’s idea would include Murphy, the actor is enthusiastic about the idea of returning.

“That’s great to hear. I didn’t know that – I would be there in a flash,” Murphy said.

“I made two movies with both of those guys, and I would love to work with them again. Of course, I’m there.”

28 Days Later co-starred Brendan Gleeson and Christopher Eccleston. It grossed $84.6m (£64.2m) from a budget of just $8m (£6.1m). Murphy worked with both Boyle and Garland on the 2007 film Sunshine.

The film launched Murphy’s career, and just five years later, he collaborated with Nolan for the first time in Batman Begins. Oppenheimer marks his sixth time working with the filmmaker – but this time, he takes on the lead role, playing Robert J Oppenheimer, the man who created the atomic bomb.

Oppenheimer co-stars Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh. It’s released in cinemas on 21 July.

Christopher Nolan’s new film, Oppenheimer, is a breathtaking biopic that tells the story of the titular J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the man primarily responsible for the creation of the atomic bomb. While the majority of the three-hour film focuses on the invention of the bomb in the deserts of New Mexico and the (metaphorical) fallout from the Trinity Test, Oppenheimer’s personal life is depicted, too, including his marriage with his wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt). And, their marriage had all the drama in real life as it did on the silver screen.

Inside the Real Life Marriage Between Robert and Kitty Oppenheimer

Kitty Puening, Before She Met Robert

Katherine ""Kitty"" Vissering Puening was born in Germany on August 8, 1910. When she was nearly 3, her family emigrated to the United States where they settled outside of Pittsburg. She grew up speaking German and English, eventually going to college and traveling to Germany to study in 1930. That’s where she met the first of her four husbands, an American music student named Frank Ramseyer. This marriage was annulled in 1933.

At a New Year’s Eve party in 1933, Kitty met her second husband, Joseph Dallet, Jr., the Dartmouth-educated son of a prominent businessman. Four years prior, Dallet had joined the Communist Party of the United States, and after they got a common-law marriage, Kitty joined as well. They separated in 1936, but upon learning that her mother had been hiding Dallet’s letters to her, Kitty set out to follow him to Spain, where Dallet was volunteering to fight against fascists in the Spanish Civil War. They met up in France, but before Kitty could join him on the front lines in Spain, Dallet was killed.

Upon returning to the United States, Kitty enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania to continue her studies, eventually meeting Richard Stewart Harrison, a medical doctor. They were wed in 1938 and moved to Pasadena, California. That’s where she met J. Robert Oppenheimer.

How Did the Oppenheimer's Marriage Begin?

As seen in Oppenheimer, the pair met at a party and soon began having an affair. This was after Oppenheimer had broken up with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), and he was dating around. Oppenheimer invited Kitty and her husband to join him for the summer at his New Mexico ranch, Perro Caliente, but Harrison declined. In 1940, Kitty became pregnant, and she and Harrison amicably divorced. She married Oppenheimer on November 2, 1940, and their son Peter was born the next year on May 12.

The Oppenheimers did indeed leave their baby son with their friends, the Chevaliers, though they retook custody of the boy before heading to New Mexico for the Manhattan Project. Kitty became pregnant again and had the couple’s second child, a girl named Katherine, on December 7, 1944. Though not depicted in the movie, Kitty left Los Alamos with Peter in April of 1945 and stayed with her parents, citing depression. She left her daughter in the care of another couple at Los Alamos who had recently lost their own son, though Kitty and Peter returned in July of 1945 before the Trinity Test.

What Happened to Kitty After Robert Died?

After the end of World War II, Kitty remained with Oppenheimer, moving to New Jersey when he accepted Lewis Strauss’ offer to be director of the Institute for Advanced Study. An alcoholic, Kitty somewhat frequently injured herself or drank and took pills to the point where she was unwell.

They remained together until the end (and Kitty held grudges her husband seemingly could not, as she didn’t shake Edward Teller’s hand as depicted in the film). Oppenheimer died of cancer in February of 1967. After his death, Kitty began seeing Robert Serber, the recently widowed friend of the Oppenheimers since their days in Pasadena and through the Manhattan Project. In 1972, they bought a yacht and intended to sail to Japan via the Panama Canal, but Kitty became ill during the voyage and died of an embolism in Panama City on October 27, 1972. Serber and her daughter scattered her ashes near where they’d scattered Oppenheimer’s ashes.

Oppenheimer: Welcome back to ""Science For Everyone"", ABP Live's weekly science column. Last week, we discussed the science behind yawning, and the fact that it does not indicate a need for sleep. Since Christopher Nolan's latest film Oppenheimer released in India on July 21, 2023, we discuss this week the Manhattan Project and the science behind the atomic bomb. The nuclear weapons developed by American theoretical physicist Julius Robert Oppenheimer through the Manhattan Project, a US government research programme, helped end World War II. The atomic bomb was designed at the Manhattan Project's laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Since Oppenheimer was the director of the laboratory, and played the central role in the development of this powerful weapon, he is known as the 'Father of the Atomic Bomb'. World War II was the first and only time such destructive weapons were used in conflict.

In Nolan's Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy plays the titular character; Emily Blunt stars as Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty Oppenheimer; Robert Downey Jr appears as Lewis Strauss, former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) who denied Oppenheimer's security clearance; and Matt Damon portrays the character of Leslie Groves, who was in charge of all Army activities relating to the Manhattan Project.

Why the Manhattan Project was a huge scientific breakthrough

The Manhattan Project was one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century. Leaders and scientists from all scientific fields and engineering disciplines had come together during the Manhattan Project to build the first atomic bombs. They explored the fields of nuclear physics and chemistry, and used the concepts of practical engineering to process radioactive materials uranium-235 and plutonium-239, and develop atomic bombs. In order to produce the nuclear weapons, the scientists leveraged nuclear fission of uranium-235 and plutonium-239, and the chain reactions that can liberate colossal amounts of destructive heat energy.

Fission is a form of chemical interaction between subatomic particles, and nuclear fission is the process in which an atom is split by bombarding the nucleus with neutrons, a type of subatomic particle carrying no charge. The other subatomic particles in an atom are protons and electrons, which are positively- and negatively-charged particles respectively. An atomic nucleus has both protons and neutrons, but no electrons, because of which the core of an atom is positively-charged. The electrons revolve around the nucleus in shells. It is the collision of atomic particles that leads to different chemical reactions.

The Manhattan Project was a success due to several factors, including scientific intellect, and communication between scientific minds.

Before delving into the chemistry and engineering aspects of the Manhattan Project, let us try to understand the events that led to this groundbreaking research programme.

In the early 20th century, fission was a newly recognised process, and in order to make the most of it, American scientists, many of whom were refugees from fascist regimes in Europe, took steps in 1939 to organise a project.

In 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland, following which GB Pegram of Columbia University arranged a conference between Enrico Fermi and the Navy Department in March that year. After this, in the summer of 1939, physicists Albert Einstein, Leo Szilard, and Eugene Wigner warned the then President Franklin D Roosevelt of the jeopardy entire humanity would be subject to if the Nazis were the first to make a nuclear bomb. They urged Roosevelt to establish a programme to study the potential military use of fission, and find ways to perform an uncontrolled fission chain reaction. In Nolan's Oppenheimer, Danny Deferrari portrays the role of Fermi, Tom Conti plays Einstein, and Máté Haumann appears as Szilard.

Roosevelt agreed, and appropriated $6,000 for the task in February 1940. A committee, headed by Lieutenant General Briggs, director of the National Bureau of Standards, which later became the National Institute of Standards and Technology, was formed to supervise the research.

On December 6, 1941, the project came under the direction of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, led by Vannevar Bush. Matthew Modine plays Bush in Oppenheimer.

After Japan attacked Pearl Harbour on December 7, 1941, the US declared war on Japan. The US became fully involved in World War II when Germany and Italy declared war on the US three days after the country declared war on Japan.

After this, the War Department was given joint responsibility for the project. In May 1942, a decision was made to proceed simultaneously on all methods that would help obtain fissionable materials, including the electromagnetic process developed at the University of California, Berkeley, under Lawrence, and the diffusion process developed under Harold Urey at Columbia University. The US Army Corps of Engineers started the construction of pilot plants, laboratories and manufacturing facilities for the scientists.

Since a significant portion of the early research had been performed at Columbia University in Manhattan, the Manhattan Engineer District, an office of engineers in New York City, was assigned management of the construction work. In September 1942, Army Officer Groves was given the responsibility of supervising all Army activities relating to the project. The research work went on to be known by its code name ""Manhattan Project"".

He chose three key sites for the Manhattan Project: Oak Ridge in Tennessee, Los Alamos in New Mexico, and Hanford in Washington.

Groves recognised Oppenheimer's exceptional scientific brilliance, and selected him to direct weapons development.

On December 2, 1942, Fermi and Szilard created the first controlled nuclear reactor, marking the beginning of the Atomic Age, an era of unearthing of atomic and subatomic marvels. Fermi and Szilard's model went on to be reconstructed into five different reactor prototypes.

In 1943, Oppenheimer chose the plateaus of Los Alamos, near Santa Fe, New Mexico, for the construction of the Los Alamos Laboratory.

Oppenheimer was searching for a way to separate uranium-235 from natural uranium, and to determine the critical mass of uranium required to make a nuclear bomb. Critical mass refers to the minimum amount of a fissile material required to initiate a self-sustaining fission reaction. The laboratory was tasked with the responsibility of developing methods to reduce fissionable products to pure metal and fabricate the metal to required shapes.

By August 1943, several scientists from Great Britain and Canada had moved to the US to join the Manhattan Project.

Plutonium-239 was the other radioactive material of interest, because the metal is highly fissionable.

The science behind the Manhattan Project

When neutrons collide with the nucleus of another atom, a tremendous amount of energy is released. Since protons as well as the nucleus of an atom are positively-charged, they will repel each other, and hence, protons cannot be used in nuclear bombardment.

Therefore, in nuclear fission, neutrons are used, and are fired towards an atom with the aim of making the neutrons fuse with the nucleus. After this, a less-stable isotope is produced. Since the isotope is less stable than the original element, it is chemically volatile, splits into two stable atoms, releases neutrons, and generates energy in the form of Gamma radiation.

However, this is not the end of the reaction. The newly released neutrons fuse with the nuclei of other atoms, causing them as well to release neutrons. In this way, a chain reaction begins, and not only are neutrons released, but also large amounts of heat radiation. The chain reaction, if left unchecked, can create an atomic bomb.

However, not every atom is fissionable, because if that were the case, there would have been no stability to matter, and chaotic energy transformations would have ensued in the world.

The isotopes of only a few elements can undergo a fissile chain reaction.

German scientists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman conducted an experiment in 1939, as part of which they added non-radioactive barium to uranium, and fired neutrons at the latter. At the conclusion of the experiment, they observed some barium atoms had radioactivity. This was surprising because they had used non-radioactive barium in the reaction.

Austrian-Swedish physicist Lise Meitner said that when uranium was bombarded with neutrons, each atom was split into two, forming two elements, one of which was barium. The barium atoms formed as a result of the splitting of uranium were radioactive.

After learning about the theory that uranium is a fissionable element, Danish physicist Neils Bohr told the entire world about the important discovery at an international conference in Washington. In Oppenheimer, Kenneth Branagh plays Neils Bohr.

Uranium occurs in three forms: uranium-234, uranium-235, and uranium-238. Uranium-238 is the most abundant isotope, and is stable compared to the other two forms. However, uranium-235, which easily undergoes nuclear fission, and can sustain a chain reaction, is rare.

Uranium-235 can cause a chain reaction if it is bombarded with neutrons travelling at adequate velocity and at an appropriate angle. The unstable nucleus of uranium-235 absorbs the neutron, becomes uranium-236, which is extremely unstable, and instantly splits into two atoms of different elements, emits two neutrons, and results in a chain reaction, which liberates gargantuan amounts of gamma radiation.

In 1931, John Dunning and Eugene Booth successfully separated uranium-235 from uranium-238, and this is how the element became the most preferred fissionable material. Only a small amount of uranium-235 had massive destructive potential.

The need to create nuclear weapons before the enemy nations created such devastating bombs themselves, and the newfound knowledge of nuclear fission culminated in the Manhattan Project in 1942.

However, two major challenges remained: obtaining sufficient fissionable material, and designing a nuclear bomb that would maintain and maximise a fissile chain reaction. Before the Manhattan Project started, Dunning and Booth had found a method to separate uranium-235 from uranium-238, but their purpose was purely scientific, and would not have served any purpose to a project that was tasked with finding a solution to ending the Second World War.

Also, none of the scientists involved in the project had the experience of developing a huge nuclear reactor that would allow a bomb to be deployed.

The biggest problem was that uranium-235 constitutes only one per cent of natural uranium, which also contains uranium-238.

Lawrence, at the University of California, Berkeley, developed the first technique to isolate a practical amount of uranium-235. Leveraging the electromagnetic properties of atoms, and integrating chemistry and physics, he separated uranium-235 from uranium-238 using a mass spectrometer.

Since Uranium-235 and Uranium-238 had different masses, and according to Newton's law, if the same force is applied on two different masses, the lighter one will be affected more compared to the heavier one, the uranium-235 atoms travelled closer to the electromagnetic arch exerting an electromagnetic force, compared to uranium-238, which is heavier.

It was important to mobilise the uranium atoms into gaseous particles. This was performed by circulating fluorine gas over a solid uranium core, in order to produce uranium tetrafluoride gas. This gas was made to pass through the arch in order to obtain a purified uranium tetrafluoride.

However, this technique proved to be largely inefficient because the maintenance costs were high, and the process was time-consuming. Millions of dollars were invested in production and repair, but only one gram of uranium-235 was retrieved.

This was when Groves purchased land in Oak Ridge and commissioned scientists to find a new technique of uranium separation. Using the theory of gaseous diffusion of uranium hexafluoride as the basis of the technique, scientists made gaseous particles of uranium pass through a porous membrane, so that according to the laws of thermodynamics, the gaseous particles of uranium-235, which are lighter than uranium-238, pass through the porous member faster than the latter, in a process known as effusion.

Since uranium 235 hexafluoride diffuses faster than uranium 238 hexafluoride, Groves concluded that the technique could be used to obtain uranium-235, according to the University of Pittsburgh.

It was important to carry out the diffusion in completely airtight conditions because the masses of the two isotopes of uranium are similar. Since grease is an organic compound, and uranium hexafluoride reacts quickly with such substances, it could not be used to seal the tubes. Therefore, scientists started fabricating new plastics, and this was how Teflon was invented.

Thousands of consecutive members were used, and diffusion tanks were sealed with Teflon tubing. Due to financial constraints, the plant at Oak Ridge carried out the process only to the point of producing a mixture of the two isotopes. Uranium-235 was subsequently isolated by subjecting the mixture to other separation techniques.

After the discovery of fissionable uranium, Glen Seaborg discovered plutonium, the 94th element in the Periodic Table. In 1942, researchers found that plutonium-239 can also sustain a chain reaction.

Scientists also discovered that if uranium-235 is exposed to alpha particles, or Helium nuclei in a reactor for extended periods of time, the atomic number of uranium-235 increases and plutonium-239 is obtained.

Thus, the scientists working under the Manhattan Project were able to use two fissile materials for developing the atomic bombs.

How the Manhattan Project helped develop the atomic bomb

By the summer of 1945, large-scale production reactors in Hanford Engineer Works produced amounts of plutonium-239 sufficient to generate a nuclear explosion.

A field test was also scheduled to check if the nuclear explosion would be a success or failure. By this time, the budget of the Manhattan Project had risen to $2 billion.

As part of the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer’s research team bombarded neutrons with plutonium or uranium-23 to initiate a nuclear fission reaction, during which the heavy plutonium or uranium nucleus split into smaller nuclei, and released huge amounts of of energy and other neutrons. These neutrons, in turn, hit other nuclei and caused them to split, releasing more energy and neutrons in the process. This is a chain reaction, which, if left unchecked, can create an atomic bomb.

On May 7, 1945, Nazi Germany surrendered.

On July 16, 1945, the first atomic bomb was exploded at the Alamogordo air base, which Oppenheimer called ""Trinity"" in reference to one of John Donne's Holy Sonnets. As part of the field test called the ""Trinity Test"", a plutonium implosion device known as ""Gadget"" was used.

On August 6, 1945, the untested uranium-235 gun assembly bomb, known as the Little Boy, was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. This was the first atomic bomb used in war. The bomb instantly killed 70,000 people, and due to the effects of radiation, over 100,000 people subsequently died.

On August 9, 1945, a replica of the plutonium-239 implosion device tested in Trinity, was dropped on Nagasaki. This bomb was called Fat Man.

This bomb instantly killed about 40,000 people, and at least 30,000 more died due to injuries and radiation poisoning by the end of the year.

The next day, the Japanese initiated surrender negotiations. Meanwhile, Groves had informed US President Harry S Truman that another bomb would be ready for delivery within a week. In Oppenheimer, Gary Oldman plays President Truman.

On September 2, 1945, Japan formally announced its surrender on board the USS Missouri.

After the hostilities came to an end, Manhattan Project physicist Philip Morrison travelled to Hiroshima to study the aftermath of the nuclear explosion, but he was so devastated by what he witnessed, that he spent the rest of his life campaigning against nuclear weapons.

The Manhattan Project was followed by Operation Crossroads, as part of which two peacetime atomic weapons tests were performed.

After this, the Manhattan Project came under the jurisdiction of the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC).

The Manhattan Project marked the true beginning of the Atomic Age. As part of the three-year project, scientists made several important discoveries associated with bomb mechanics, atomic particles, nuclear fission, and also obtained insights into nuclear fusion. Most importantly, it brought together a large number of scientists and leaders together, who put their heart and soul into making the Manhattan Project a quintessence of scientific triumph.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hYnBsaXZlLmNvbS9zY2llbmNlL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLW1hbmhhdHRhbi1wcm9qZWN0LWF0b21pYy1ib21iLXNjaWVuY2UtY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktMTYxNzU4ONIBf2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hYnBsaXZlLmNvbS9zY2llbmNlL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLW1hbmhhdHRhbi1wcm9qZWN0LWF0b21pYy1ib21iLXNjaWVuY2UtY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktMTYxNzU4OC9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 15:34:47+00:00,The Real TIME Magazine Covers Featured in Oppenheimer,The stories behind the two TIME Magazine covers featured in the movie Oppenheimer.,"This post contains spoilers for Oppenheimer.

TIME makes a cameo in the summer blockbuster Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s movie about brainiac theoretical physicist and atomic bomb architect J. Robert Oppenheimer.

Two TIME magazine covers show up in the movie: one featuring Oppenheimer, and the other depicting his nemesis Lewis Strauss, head of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. While based on real issues of the magazine, the cover photos in the film are altered to look like the actors Cillian Murphy (Oppenheimer) and Robert Downey Jr. (Strauss).

November 8, 1948 TIME cover June 15, 1959 TIME cover

The first TIME magazine that appears in the movie is the Nov. 8, 1948, issue, featuring a portrait of Oppenheimer by the artist Ernest Hamlin Baker. The cover story details the scientist’s rise to fame, and includes details about Oppenheimer’s—or “Oppie’s”—eccentricities:

Oppie would corral a handful of his favorite students, take them in his big, fast car for a leisurely feast at such San Francisco restaurants as Amelio’s and Jack’s. Good conversation was cheap, but dinner was always expensive; it was Oppie who picked up the checks. A more fluent conversationalist than in the old, shy days, the handsome and unattached Oppie was much sought after as a guest at cocktail and dinner parties. He gave bachelor dinners, serving his own expertly cooked hot Mexican dishes, and mixed a mean Martini with laboratory precision. After a late party, he would frequently sit up most of the night working on some involved problem (“How much sleep do I need? This is like what Mrs. Lenin said about the meat: ‘When we are hungry, we cook it five minutes; when we are not hungry, two hours'”). Once, on a date with a coed in the Berkeley hills, he felt the urge to solve a problem in physics, got out of the car to pace up & down, wandered off into the night. On another occasion, emboldened by his own Martinis, Oppenheimer decided to telephone a girl he “knew,” found that he could not remember her name; all he recalled was that her address was a power of seven.

The second issue of TIME in the movie appears at a key plot point, during the feud between Oppenheimer and Strauss, who stripped Oppenheimer of his security clearance. During his confirmation hearings for Commerce Secretary in 1959, Strauss is depicted in the movie as bandying about TIME’s June 15, 1959, issue, bragging to an aide that he knows TIME publisher Henry Luce and got the story placed as part of his campaign for the Commerce position. The real TIME cover story explains Strauss’ complicated personality that Nolan also explores in the movie:

For it is the personality, and not the competence, of Lewis Strauss that is clearly at issue as he nears the crisis of his career. Strauss, by the extraordinary ingredients of his makeup, is one to arouse superlatives of praise and blame, admiration and dislike. In the eyes of friends, he is brilliant, devoted, courageous and, in his more relaxed moments, exceedingly charming. His enemies regard him as arrogant, evasive, suspicious-minded, pride-ridden, and an excessively rough battler. (“He has more elbows than an octopus.”) …A vital key to Lewis Strauss’s character is a perfectionism that still seems to nag him at an age when he might have become more mellowed. It shows in the studied elegance of his tailoring, in a precision of speech that comes natural to him from long habit but seems a bit affected to unfriendly ears, and above all in a fierce reluctance to admit his mistakes, no matter how human and understandable they may have been. Some of his perfectionism traces back to a sense of being an outsider. As a Jew, he has sometimes felt the wounding edges of anti-Semitism (and again last week, that ugly term popped up). For all his wealth (he is a millionaire) and intellect (even his enemies admit that he is brainy), Strauss seems unable to live down in his own mind an awareness that he never went to college and that he started out as a traveling shoe salesman.

Strauss’s hopes that a TIME story would boost his chances of confirmation didn’t work; the Senate did not confirm him to be Commerce Secretary.

2023-08-20 21:19:59+05:30,Oppenheimer Box Office: Cillian Murphy starrer storms past USD 700 million; set to overtake Christopher Nolan's Interstellar,Cillian Murphy starrer Oppenheimer was one of the most anticipated movies not only of this summer but also of the year. The Christopher Nolan directorial continues to impress on the box office.,"Oppenheimer is on a monster run in theaters, even almost one month after the movie's release, it has continued to impress at the box office. The Christopher Nolan directorial was one of the biggest releases of the year, and it has not only met the expectations set by the director's previous movies but surpassed them with flying colors. The biopic is now entering its fifth week in the cinemas, and it is all set to take over Nolan's Interstellar.

Oppenheimer crosses USD 700 million at the global box-office

Christopher Nolan's directorial Oppenheimer continues to make big strides, inching closer to yet another remarkable achievement by overtaking the USD 700 million mark in global earnings up to this point. As it completes its fifth week of release, the grand-scale epic is anticipated to reach a total of USD 718 million, including tomorrow's figures. This feat will propel it to become Nolan's fourth highest-grossing film globally, effectively surpassing Interstellar. Moreover, the biopic will rise to no. 4 on the global box office chart for this year. In short, Universal's film is on track to add another impressive milestone to its record. In 2023, Cillian Murphy starrer holds the position of the 3rd highest-grossing movie internationally, excluding China, where its release is scheduled for August 30.

Oppenheimer became highest grossing WWII movie

Oppenheimer is still very much popular among people going to the cinema, and it should be noted that it's nowhere near the end of its box-office run. The Cillian Murphy starrer overtook another title, the highest-grossing WWII movie of all time. It overtook Dunkirk, a 2017 film that recounted the events of the Dunkirk Evacuation during the Battle of France, amassing a global sum of USD 527 million. Interestingly enough that movie was also directed by Nolan and included Cillian Murphy. This also means the classic 1998 Steven Spielberg-directed masterpiece, Saving Private Ryan, which features Oppenheimer actor, Matt Damon, now assumes the 3rd position with USD 482 million. However, this particular figure remains unadjusted for inflation. Intriguingly, if inflation were taken into account, Saving Private Ryan would actually secure the top spot in this category.

Meanwhile, since the release of the film Murphy has revealed many small tidbits of what it was like getting cast for the movie, where he admitted that the Inception director called him out of the blue and gave him the role.

2023-07-19 14:00:00+00:00,Christopher Nolan Is for the Girlies,These are serious movies. Until the internet gets a hold of them.,"Filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, and Christopher Nolan are known for being beloved by film bros around the world. If Hollywood makes “chick flicks” for women, these directors win prizes for providing what everyone believes to be the opposite thing—a type of film that, interestingly, doesn’t have a catchy, degrading name. (Gloria Steinem once wrote an entire op-ed dubbing them “prick flicks.”) This egregious misconception needs to be corrected, at least on one such filmmaker’s behalf. Despite what you might have heard, Christopher Nolan’s films are, in fact, for the girlies.

Nolan, who famously is one of the least accessible mainstream directors—I don’t mean least accessible in terms of a viewer’s ability to see or understand his movies, though that is sort of true; I mean least accessible in that this man doesn’t even have a damn smartphone—has, for years, managed to cast some of the absolute hottest men in Hollywood to talk about time travel or multiple dimensions or whatever. Considering that Nolan uses much the same roster of actors across his films, it’s almost impressive the different variations of sexiness that he can elicit out of one man. It’s so effective one would think his hiring tactic is whispering the lyrics of Mulan’s “I’ll Make a Man out of You” into the ear of Hollywood’s hunkiest specimens.

Netizens on the lookout for their next internet boyfriend have noticed. The best example this summer is, of course, Cillian Murphy, whose every appearance in promotional photos or clips related to Nolan’s upcoming film Oppenheimer—in which Murphy plays the titular physicist, who spearheaded the creation of the atomic bomb—has dominated the thirstiest corners of Al Gore’s internet. The blue-eyed Irish beauty first won the heart of Online as very hot, very tortured 1920s gangster Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders in 2013. Since then, Murphy has appeared as a side character in many Nolan films. Now he’s finally taking the main stage in a Christopher Nolan production.

Fancams (fan-edited video odes) and photos of Murphy dominated social media algorithms as press for Oppenheimer reached its peak, just before the announcement of the SAG strike, and the end of actors’ ability to do press for current projects, last week. Some have even made the tongue-in-cheek argument that a handful of photos of Murphy, who famously doesn’t do much press and is apathetic toward the idea of being “online,” have had the same effect as the incredibly deep promotional budget of Oppenheimer’s sister film Barbie. He’s been called unreal, compared with your lesbian best friend for trying out a see-through shirt, and dubbed a “summa cum laude” graduate in the art of smizing. Murphy’s Oppenheimer castmate Emily Blunt got a secondhand hit of virality for doing what any reasonable person would do when standing next to Murphy on the red carpet: grabbing on, and not letting go.

Of course, I wouldn’t be writing this if I had only one point of evidence. Nolan’s history of casting hotties who, despite the somber nature of the films they’re in, become Internet Darlings—a history that includes Murphy in Batman Begins and Murphy in Inception and Murphy in Dunkirk—starts with his second film, Memento (2000), which, thankfully, features tons of shots of a young, shirtless Guy Pearce. Let this Tumblr GIF set serve as proof of the absolute serve Pearce is exhibiting in this actually emotionally devastating film. (Get you a guy who can do both, as they say.) Next is the first film in the Batman trilogy, Batman Begins (2005), which adds Christian Bale to the pantheon. Throughout the trilogy, Bale is effortlessly beautiful as the suave but tortured billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. But he’s also rough and gruff when dressed as the titular masked vigilante. This movie also has a young Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow, who, mind you, looked like this at the time.

Nolan’s Batman trilogy offered us a visual feast: the cleft-chin wonder Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, and, of course, Heath Ledger’s iconic performance as the Joker, which is the stuff of nightmares but manifested a charisma that reminded us how hot Ledger was outside the clown makeup (the answer is very, folks). The trilogy also gave us Tom Hardy’s Bane. Hardy had his face covered here, but given the lingering memory of his glorious visage in Nolan’s Inception a couple of years prior, the role still catered to the beefcake fans among us. Zero complaints. If you’re more of the cute-quirky type of thirster, the trilogy also puts Joseph Gordon-Levitt to great use toward the end.

The pinnacle of Nolan’s secret side project (that is, quenching the thirst of the world’s man-enjoyers) has to be his 2010 film Inception, which comes after the second Batman film, The Dark Knight (2008), but before the final one, The Dark Knight Rises (2012). Though the general online consensus on Leonardo DiCaprio has soured a bit since 2010, as it’s become ever more clear he dates only women under 25 (Gigi Hadid, 27, excepted), it is undeniable that he is putting his miraculous genes to good use in this film. The cinematic achievement of Inception is not the continuously debated ending or the incredible visual effects, but DiCaprio’s face. Inception also marks the establishment of Hardy and Nolan’s working relationship (hallelujah); Murphy dazzles here as well, and Gordon-Levitt plays a deliciously handsome role too.

Nolan’s filmography is so stuffed with attractive actors that I’m running out of time to mention them all. There’s Matthew McConaughey, at peak McConaissance, looking like THIS for most of Interstellar (2014)—which does the world a disservice, but honors reality by having his face partially covered by an astronaut’s helmet for large parts of the film. Even Interstellar’s memed-to-death scene in which McConaughey’s character ugly cries might not be hot, but it is relatable! There’s also a baby Timothée Chalamet in this film, which arrived too early for Chalamet thirst per se (his character is 15 years old) but offers a good indicator of what is to come. Harry Styles, fresh from cutting his signature long hair, will make you swoon while also making you fear for his life in Dunkirk (2017), in which he appears along with personal favorite Barry Keoghan, Hardy, and Murphy. Tenet (2020) offers Robert Pattinson, the world’s boyfriend since as early as his Harry Potter or Twilight days, who is just as enticing here as he ever was.

Duh, you might say, actors are handsome! But Nolan is able to depict these men as some of the most delectable treats in cinema. I haven’t figured out the exact recipe of Nolan’s secret sexy sauce, but it has something to do with the confidence and ambition of his leading men, who are usually either incredibly smart or brooding or both. Plus, Nolan, like us all, loves a man in uniform or a suit. What’s more, you can barely hear what these guys are saying, an increasingly apparent feature of Nolan’s signature sound design. But this is all for the better: Pretty boys who barely talk?! Yeah, that’s definitely for the girlies.

If you’re a girlie who loves girls, rest assured because Nolan has you covered. There’s Hilary Swank in Insomnia (2002), Katie Holmes in Batman Begins, Scarlett Johansson in The Prestige (2006), Elizabeth Debicki in Tenet, and more. If you’re a girlie who enjoys thirsting after non-white people, well … there’s … John David Washington in Tenet? And the occasional Ken Watanabe cameo where he looks like this. But … that’s about it. And if you’re a girlie who loves swooning over emotionally and mentally healthy men, maybe solicit those in the waiting room of your therapist’s office?",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy8wNy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1tb3ZpZS1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1jYXN0Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-30 18:29:20+00:00,The Sex Scenes In ‘Oppenheimer’ Really Were Sex as Only Nolan Can Do It,'Oppenheimer' brought Christopher Nolan into the sex scene conversation and it really was sex as only Nolan can do it.,"Christopher Nolan’s work isn’t really known for the love affairs at the center of them. Nolan’s movies often feel loveless, with a few exceptions like The Prestige or even Inception with Mal and Cobb. Sex, though, isn’t really a part of his storytelling approach at all. Except, that is, when it comes to Oppenheimer.

Nolan’s latest movie focuses on the life and work of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) as he recounts his work on the Manhattan Project during his security clearance hearing in 1954. While he is questioned over “communist” connections, his romantic relationship with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) was of the utmost “importance” to the security council.

While Oppy tells his story of meeting Jean prior to his relationship with his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), we see their first sexual encounter. It’s a fascinating angle because the audio of Murphy’s Oppenheimer saying the famous Bhagavad Gita line, “Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds,” comes from this sex scene. Jean finds Sanskrit writing in Oppenheimer’s room and brings it to him to read, which he does as the two have sex. The same audio is used later in the movie during the Trinity test sequence so knowing that it was said during sex is a bit out there (and has actually received harsh criticism from Hindu audiences) but that’s not why I can’t stop thinking about the labeling of “Sex as only Nolan could stage it.”

https://twitter.com/robbiereviews/status/1678890091761090560?s=20

Kitty’s version of the sex scene was very Nolan-esque

(Universal Pictures)

Kitty is present in the hearing when Oppenheimer is asked to describe his affair with Jean. As he discusses it, we the audience see their conversation in the past, both Jean and Oppy sitting naked on chairs together after they’ve had sex. But when we get Kitty’s perspective on the situation, she’s listening to them talk about the affair (which continued well into her marriage to Oppenheimer) and imagines Jean there in the hearing room, having sex with her husband in front of her, making prolonged eye contact with her. It is trippy, odd, and gives us a rare insight into Kitty’s thoughts and feelings on the situation but is very Nolan in its approach.

A lot of people often complain that sex scenes don’t have a purpose. I disagree and think that more often than not, filmmakers have a way of using the physical act of sex to tell us about the characters’ emotional state in the midst of it. With Oppenheimer, we really get to see where Oppenheimer’s head is, as well as Kitty’s.

It is really fascinating how Nolan connected Oppenheimer’s relationship with Jean with his marriage to Kitty and seeing those two worlds collide together—all while foreshadowing the Trinity test and subsequent destruction—really brought out the “Nolan-esque” mood that made this such a unique sex scene. I’ve not stopped thinking about it since.

This really was sex as only Nolan could stage it but it really does work to drive home how explosive Jean and Robert were together.

This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, the work being covered here wouldn’t exist.

Teller, the theoretical physicist known as “the father of the hydrogen bomb”, joined J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) in working on the atomic bomb at the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico.

Speaking about playing the part, the actor and Uncut Gems co-director explained how Nolan wanted him to commit to every detail, including growing some thick, bushy eyebrows.

“I am proud to say that it’s all my eyebrows,” Safdie told Vulture. “Teller had the best eyebrows.

“Every once in a while I have a straggler that I’ll just pluck out, cause it looks a little too crazy. But Chris said, ‘Don’t do that. Let’s just let it go crazy.’ I had the most insane eyebrows for months and months, and you just had to brush them out and then they shined in all their glory.”

Aside from the eyebrows, Safdie said tackling an Austro-Hungarian accent was the biggest challenge in playing Teller. “The accent was something I was so nervous about,” he said. “I remember Chris asking me, ‘How’s the accent coming?’ And I’m just like, ‘Oh my God, how am I going to accomplish this?’

“I didn’t know if he was going to want me to do it. But he sent me all of these interviews and we talked about how Teller speaks and who he is. It was a long process of working together to really nail it down.”

He added: “I remember finally I was like, ‘You know what? I could sound crazy, but I don’t care. This is what Teller sounds like and I’m just going to do it.’ I sent a voice memo where I just narrated what my breakfast was and how Teller really liked pineapple.”

Safdie’s previous acting credits include roles in Licorice Pizza, Stars At Noon and Pieces Of A Woman. He also starred opposite Robert Pattinson in Good Time, which he co-directed with his brother Joshua Safdie.

In a five-star review of Oppenheimer, NME wrote: “Not just the definitive account of the man behind the atom bomb, Oppenheimer is a monumental achievement in grown-up filmmaking. For years, Nolan has been perfecting the art of the serious blockbuster – crafting smart, finely-tuned multiplex epics that demand attention; that can’t be watched anywhere other than in a cinema, uninterrupted, without distractions. But this, somehow, feels bigger.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5tZS5jb20vbmV3cy9maWxtL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLXRvbGQtYmVubnktc2FmZGllLW5vdC10by1wbHVjay1leWVicm93cy0zNDc0ODg10gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The internet phenomenon that was ‘Barbenheimer’ definitely gave Nolan’s Oppenheimer a successful run at the box office.

While the Cillian Murphy starrer was not as successful as its competitor Barbie, which raked in a whopping $775 million, it still earned quite a bit of money. However, the R-rated biopic is close to beating a particular record that was till now in the hands of legendary actor-director Clint Eastwood.

Christopher Nolan V/S Warner Brothers

Ace director Christopher Nolan’s last film was the sci-fi mind-bender, Tenet. The film was released at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, with a lukewarm response. Nolan, who is a huge proponent of the theatrical experience, was disappointed with his usual collaborator Warner Brothers with the way they handled the release. Adding to that, WB took the controversial decision in 2021 to simultaneously release their slate of films on both cinemas and the streaming platform HBO Max. The films included Wonder Woman 1984, Dune Part 1, and more.

Post this fiasco, Christopher Nolan started shopping around his script to other studios. The filmmaker had collaborated with WB on all his films starting from Insomnia. The filmmaker had given the studio many blockbusters such as The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, Interstellar, and more. He had deals such as final-cut privileges, first-dollar gross, and exclusive theatrical windows with the studio. These perks would have to be met by the next studio that Nolan would choose.

In September 2021, Christopher Nolan announced that his next film would be a biopic on J Robert Oppenheimer and that it would be produced and distributed by NBCUniversal. The filmmaker had demanded a $100 million budget and an equal budget for marketing.

Barbenheimer: The Meme Of The Century

Christopher Nolan announced that his film Oppenheimer will be released on July 21, 2023, a favored summer release date of the filmmaker. His previous collaborator Warner Brothers Studios also announced that their adaptation of the Mattel toy Barbie starring Margot Robbie and directed by Greta Gerwig will be released on the same day. Due to its polar opposite nature, with Nolan’s film being a dark exploration of the psyche of the man who created the atomic bomb while Gerwig’s film would be exploring themes of feminism in context to the playing doll, the internet did what it does best. It turned these films into a meme.

Memes hyping up the release along with people planning a double feature event in the cinemas quickly gained traction. People planned outfits that catered to each film and decided to watch both films on the same day. The trend was also exemplified by the cast and crew of both films as they appreciated each others’ works publicly and watched the films.

‘Barbenheimer’ was a huge success as many flocked to the theatres to catch the double feature. AMC Theatres released data saying that the Barbenheimer weekend was the highest-grossing weekend in AMC history. Vue International, a cinema chain said that one-fifth of the audience came for both films.

Oppenheimer Beats The Record

While both films were extremely successful at the box office, Barbie was the clear winner with a $775 million global box office. This was an expected outcome as Barbie was a typical summer blockbuster that featured stars such as Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. Oppenheimer however, was not left behind.

Nolan’s biopic on J Robert Oppenheimer has had a great run at the box office, with the drama grossing over $400 million. This exceeded expectations as the film was rated R and was not an event blockbuster film that is usually released in the summer. Christopher Nolan’s notoriety as well as the presence of stars such as Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Florence Pugh has brought the numbers in.

The film is also on the road to overthrowing veteran actor-director’s film American Sniper as the highest-grossing R-rated biopic. Eastwood’s war movie which starred Bradley Cooper explored the life of a sniper in post-9/11 Iraq. The film grossed a record $550 million at the global box office. Oppenheimer has already beaten the record set by Martin Scorsese with The Wolf of Wall Street. With Christopher Nolan’s biopic grossing $400 million in the second week, it is sufficient to say that the film will soon beat Eastwood’s coveted record.

Some actors are apparently so subtle in their precision that their performances are invisible to the naked eye. ""Oppenheimer"" director Christopher Nolan learned this fact on the set of his 2002 film ""Insomnia,"" in which Al Pacino plays a morally embattled Los Angeles homicide detective sent to investigate a murder in the rural town of Nightmute, Alaska, during midnight sun. Pacino's character required the careful execution of a wide range of emotions, oscillating constantly between avoiding accountability for his crimes and trying to bring a killer to justice — two goals in direct conflict with one another — while suffering from severe sleep deprivation.

As Nolan recalled in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Pacino made acting choices that Nolan couldn't perceive without seeing them on-screen. In response to an adjustment, Pacino had told him, ""I've already done that. You can't see it to the eye, but I've done it on the dailies."" The five-time Academy Award nominee is averse to using monitors on set and thus had to wait to review the footage at the end of the day (referred to as ""dailies"").

""I looked for it and I was like, 'Oh, my God,' because there it was,"" Nolan marveled. ""Great film actors can do that, and that's what I had with Cillian [Murphy]."" During post-production on ""Oppenheimer,"" the director was stunned by the totality of his longtime collaborator's work, sharing, ""The performance became all-enveloping, when I realized Cillian had so much more going on than I saw on set.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvb3Blci5jb20vMTM0MzMzMS9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1jb21wYXJlcy1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1hY3RpbmctYWwtcGFjaW5vLWluc29tbmlhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Cillian Murphy:

Being at the forefront of the 3-hour-long biopic, Cillian Murphy arguably delivers one of his best performances to date on the big screen, bringing Nolan’s vision to life. But one of the more impressive feats was the transformation he had undergone for the role, losing a substantial amount of weight in order to replicate J. Robert Oppenheimer’s physique. Although the exact number isn’t known, according to his costars, Cillian Murphy refused dinner invitations every night during the entire production, following his commitment to the job.

Robert Downey Jr:

Witnessing Robert Downey Jr. as something different other than Tony Stark was a breath of fresh air for the fans, and like Cillian Murphy, the Iron Man Star doesn’t pull punches and delivers his absolute best. Playing the role of Lewis Strauss in the film, the actor has delivered one of his best performances since playing Kirk Lazarus in Tropic Thunder. And fans are assured like his role in Tropic Thunder, his work in Oppenheimer too might land him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

Matt Damon:

Although reports claimed Damon was reportedly taking a break from acting after Air as a negotiation with his wife during a couples therapy session, the chance of working with Nolan was too much to resist. Playing the Manhattan Project director, General Leslie Groves, the actor too doesn’t disappoint in bringing his charm to the character, and his chemistry with Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer was enticing to watch.

Florence Pugh:

As her first partnership with Christopher Nolan, Florence Pugh plays the role of Jean Tatlock in the movie, who is essential to the emotional core of the film. And like her co-stars, Pugh does an exceptional job with the material she is given, making every single scene she is involved in memorable.

Emily Blunt:

it didn’t take a lot of convincing on Christopher Nolan’s part to bring Emily Blunt on board, as reports claimed, after meeting the director in Los Angeles, she instantly accepted the role. In the movie, Blunt plays the role of Katherine Puening, who ties the knot with Oppenheimer, and she also delivers one of the most impactful scenes in the movie.

Tom Conti:

Throughout his brief scenes portraying the theoretical physicist Albert Einstein, Tom Conti partakes in some of the most gut-wrenching scenes in the movie. And the ending scene, involving the duo of him and Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer, it’s not a hot take to say that it will go down as one of the most iconic endings to a Christopher Nolan movie.

Rami Malek:

Following the long list of celebrity brief appearances in the movie, unlike many big-budget Hollywood flicks, every brief moment from these actors have a purpose, including Rami Malek’s David Hill. Although in total, the actor appears for less than 10 minutes in the movie, it doesn’t stop him from delivering his best, as his final scene ultimately decides Lewis Strauss’ fate.

Benny Safdie:

After doing a reference check with director Paul Thomas Anderson, Christopher Nolan picked Benny Safdie to play the father of the hydrogen bomb, Edward Teller. But besides doing a great job bringing the controversial figure to life, the actor was also asked by Nolan to not pluck his eyebrows for months for the movie. “I am proud to say that it’s all my eyebrows,” Safdie stated.

Kenneth Branagh:

It appears Kenneth Branagh is becoming the next constant in Christopher Nolan-led projects, as Oppenheimer marked the third collaboration between the two. Despite having a substantially lesser presence in the film, the actor shines as Niels Bohr in the movie.

Apart from these prominent stars, there are a plethora of other A-listers from the heavily star-studded cast, who doesn’t disappoint. But apart from everyone’s brilliance, Nolan deserves the utmost praise for his direction, as he succeeded in bringing the Cillian Murphy-led 3-hour period drama into the mainstream spotlight, which might not have been possible by any other filmmaker.

Oppenheimer is currently in theatres.

2023-07-31 22:04:29+01:00,Every Christopher Nolan Movie Ranked Worst To Best,How does Oppenheimer compare to Nolan's other cinematic gems?,"For over 20 years, Christopher Nolan has been one of our greatest filmmakers, an innovative pioneer whose compelling tales of flawed men and speculative futures are matched only by the stunning visuals that bring them to life.

Notable for his stunning production design, preferring natural setting over more artificial studio work and CGI, and booming scores, Nolan is never one to be stuck in place, directing everything from trailblazing superhero flicks to intimate biographies, and breakneck thrillers to contemplative sci-fi mind-benders.

Often found working with the same collaborators (including actors Michael Caine - his ""good luck charm"" - Cillian Murphy, Christian Bale and Tom Hardy, as well as cinematographers Wally Pfister and Hoyt van Hoytema), Nolan is a director whose films are recognisable from the first frame, and become more rewarding with time.

His quirks may sometimes get in the way of his lofty intentions - his grand themes, inventive sound mixing and mind-meltingly complex stories occasionally hard to grasp - but he's never been a filmmaker to truly drop the ball, or produce anything less than a deeply personal, impassioned feast for the senses.

With that in mind, in celebration of his latest hit Oppenheimer, here are all 12 of Christopher Nolan's films ranked from worst to best. This list will surely divide, but such is the joy of Christopher Nolan's films: a case could be made for almost any one of them being his one true masterpiece...",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd2hhdGN1bHR1cmUuY29tL2ZpbG0vZXZlcnktY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tbW92aWUtcmFua2VkLXdvcnN0LXRvLWJlc3TSAVNodHRwczovL3doYXRjdWx0dXJlLmNvbS9hbXAvZmlsbS9ldmVyeS1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1tb3ZpZS1yYW5rZWQtd29yc3QtdG8tYmVzdA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
