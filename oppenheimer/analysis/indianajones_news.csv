2023-07-02 15:12:00+00:00,‘Indiana Jones’ & The Box Office Of Doom: Why ‘Dial Of Destiny’ At $60M Opening Isn’t Setting Records For Franchise Finale – Updated Box Office,'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' is looking at a box office opening weekend of $60 million to $65 million in the U.S.,"SUNDAY AM Writethru Final after Saturday AM Update: Even though Disney/Lucasfilm‘s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is looking to hit the bottom rung of its tracking projection of $60M Sunday morning, there’s no question this is a disastrous result for the finale to a historically beloved franchise film. C’mon, Indiana Jones is one of the reasons Disney shelled out $4 billion for Lucasfilm. Global start here at $130M, is $10M less than what we were seeing; Nancy will have more. The fan-loathed Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had a $272.1M global start, unadjusted for inflation/currency swings back in 2008.
A few things to stomach: Not only did 2018’s Star Wars spinoff bomb Solo open higher than Dial of Destiny, with $84.4M 3-day/$103M 4-day, but so did Paramount’s seventhquel Transformers: Rise of the Beasts ($61M) in May.
How could Disney and Lucasfilm mess this up?
On Saturday, I learned from a key source that Indiana Jones and the Dial Destiny, before $100M in estimated P&A, cost a mindboggling $300M-plus. Much higher than the $250M-$295M that’s been leaked out there. Disney doesn’t comment on budgets, and I’m getting some pushback. But the high price tag here is due to the start and stops of production during Covid; Harrison Ford‘s $20M fee; Steven Spielberg reaping a huge producing fee, which is standard; and I’m told director James Mangold got a pretty penny. All that said, it stands to reason that Disney would invest greatly here to revive a franchise; its spent $259M on The Force Awakens in 2015. The point is, for what the studio spent, it’s not getting anywhere near Star Wars box office results.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has been destined to live in a Temple of Box Office Doom since world premiering at Cannes to lackluster reviews. This resulted in landing like a wet towel on tracking three weeks ago, with projections not budgeting. This despite the fact that Dial of Destiny had a marketing and publicity global campaign louder than The Flash, with$90M in promotional partners and the cast doing several interviews.
It’s baffling that a storied franchise can end on a downer note at the box office in its finale. I found the movie out of Cannes to be too plug-and-play, laden in tropes of the franchise, from the kid sidekick to videogame-like action to it’s his goddaughter (not his dad) as his other sidekick. It completely lacked the breadth and nuance that Spielberg provided in action scenes of the older films. And I’m a James Mangold fan! He knows how to make a styled and dramatically charged movie just like Spielberg, whether it’s Ford v. Ferrari, Logan or Walk the Line.
I’m not too far off in my take on the film: CinemaScore audiences gave Dial of Destiny a B+, which isn’t that far from the previous unloved 2008 installment, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which landed a B.
So what the hell went wrong here with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny?
Lucasfilm is so precious and fastidious when it comes to developing Star Wars properties, and the legend with Indiana Jones is that these movies could never be made unless George Lucas and Spielberg (and Harrison Ford) saw eye-to-eye on the script. Remember all the TLC that J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kadsan took in hatching Force Awakens? There were stories of them walking down NYC streets, going back and forth on storylines. Given the black eye that Lucasfilm took from fans on The Last Jedi, The Rise of Skywalker and Solo, it is careful not to just rush and dump sequels nowadays (thus, the safety of building out the franchise on Disney+), which is why it’s taken them so long to bake the next Star Wars sequels. All of this makes the misfire with Dial of Destiny so concerning.

The biggest problem with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is that there were no efforts here to cast-it-up and make it appealing to an under-40, diverse crowd, like Paramount did with Top Gun: Maverick. Dial of Destiny was conceived for the hardcore Indy fans, which are dudes over 50. This is evident in the B- that Dial of Destiny received from 18-24 moviegoers. Disney reports that 42% of the audience was under 35 for Dial of Destiny.
I’m told from a few insiders that this movie did not have the behind-the-scenes calamity melodrama of such Lucasfilm titles as Rogue One (which had Tony Gilroy doing reshoots and rewrites on the Gareth Edwards-directed film) and Solo: A Star Wars Story (which had the ungracious firing of Lord & Miller and Ron Howard rescue), installments that required major surgery during production. No melodrama meaning everyone got along, with Mangold calling the production and Lucasfilm boss/Indy producer Kathleen Kennedy and producer Frank Marshall “family” at Cannes. Spielberg loved and signed off on the script by Mangold and his Ford v. Ferrari scribes, Jez and John Henry Butterworth, and that’s a challenging bar to clear.
On Saturday I heard that several editors were brought in to get this one right. It’s unfortunately apparent here that the sublime which Mangold delivered to the X-Men franchise with the R-rated Logan did not translate to Indiana Jones.
To date, Indy co-franchise architect Lucas has remained silent about his thoughts on Dial of Destiny.
I’ve gotten clarity on the whole thing about inflated test scores. While Disney typically uses a “friends and family” testing system so that no spoilers are leaked in advance, I’m now told Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny never tested. Take what you will from that.
Still, it’s so not like Disney to stick its head out there on a chopping block by launching so-so movies on a global stage when they’re not ready. The studio plots the marketing campaigns for their tentpoles like D-Day. Both of these planned tentpoles’ commercial potential went out the window the minute Disney took them to Cannes. Why did Elemental and Dial of Destiny go to the Croisette? To eventize them to overseas audiences, who aren’t as cynical as U.S. auds when it comes to sizing up a blockbuster. Plus, after Pixar was imprisoned on Disney+ during Covid, Disney had to show the world that family toon brand was truly back on the big screen. True, had both titles skipped Cannes, the Band-Aid would have been ripped off at some point in time. However, perhaps keeping the lid longer on these lukewarm movies and away from the press would have increased some box office revenue here on this crazy-expensive sequel.
But here’s the consistent problem Indiana Jones has had at the box office and with critics, and that is, he’s always been in competition with himself. Raiders of the Lost Ark really blew audiences away back in 1981, bringing new life to the old adventure serial movies. The pic grossed more than $212M in its initial release and had multiple reissues making its way to $248.1M. That’s been the gold standard against which all Indy sequels have been compared, and well, he generally comes up short. Read on.

I think to this day that Part 2, 1984’s Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, remains the best sequel; it’s as edgy as hell. C’mon, it has a villain who pulls hearts of people and makes human sacrifices! It’s a PG movie that prompted the MPA to create a PG-13 rating because it scared the heck out of kids. However, I’ll never forget back then in the whip-and-buggy days before Rotten Tomatoes that critics loathed the movie. Variety’s then-critic — and Deadline’s current — Todd McCarthy, slammed Temple of Doom, writing, “The pic comes on like a sledgehammer, and there’s even a taste of vulgarity and senseless excess not apparent in Raiders.” That sentiment played out at the box office, where Temple of Doom saw its final domestic gross of $179.1M off 15% from Raiders of the Lost Ark‘s first-run gross. Temple of Doom didn’t receive the rereleases at the box office like Raiders did, as it has its fans and nonfans. Spielberg and Lucas were able to please fans with the Sean Connery-fueled Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which landed an A CinemaScore in 1989 (during the exit-poll firm’s early days) and boost domestic box office by 10% to $197.1M.
‘Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull’ Paramount
So why did the critically not-loved Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (77% on RT, just like Temple of Doom), wind up being the franchise’s highest-grossing film, with a massive $100M-plus opening, and 3x leg-out to $317M stateside? Because it was coming off of Last Crusade, which was quite beloved, and there was an appetite from moviegoers to see the sequel because there hadn’t been an Indiana Jones film in close to two decades. But despite its blockbuster success in a vibrant, stadium-seating exhibition era, not many people liked Crystal Skull — hello, B CinemaScore. And that sequel, too, also doted and joked around about Indy going gray. Unlike 007, the same actor has always played Indiana Jones. The franchise’s legacy with Ford has prevented it from being rebooted with a new leading actor.
Which leads us to Dial of Destiny‘s blah results. Why so low? Because it’s coming off of a sequel not many loved, and it’s playing the same game of Indiana Jones getting older. Couple that with sour reviews coming out of Cannes, plus the finale’s older skewing audience (42% over 45) who are slow to come to cinemas, and here we are with a less-than-stellar box office result.
While Comscore/Screen Engine’s PostTrak exits show a 93% recommending Dial of Destiny (combined from the yes or probably recommend category) and 8% not recommending, dig further in morning’s report and you’ll find a more-telling stat about how no one is rushing to Dial of Destiny: Only 9% heard it was good from friends and family.
Paramount’s ‘Transformers: Rise of the Beasts’ (Everett Collection) Paramount
Here’s the box office surprise no one was expecting this summer: At an opening of $61M, Paramount’s long-in-the-tooth franchise sequel Transformers: Rise of the Beasts opened higher than high-gloss pics including Dial of Destiny and The Flash. The latter DC film counts a running total at end of Weekend 3 of $99.2M; that’s 19% behind the running total of Rise of the Beasts at the same point in time. OMG. Rise of the Beasts currently a running total of $136.1M at end of Weekend 4. Can Dial of Destiny even outgross Rise of the Beasts by the end of the summer? Who the hell knew we’d be having this conversation??
Dial of Destiny‘s problems, to a certain degree, aren’t that different from The Flash‘s: More than Ezra Miller’s lack of publicity on that DC film and tabloid dilemmas, that DC movie at the end of the day was a B CinemaScore film and way too long at 2 hours and 24 minutes. Dial of Destiny has a similar grade and is also too long at 2 hours and 34 minutes.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Harrison Ford were hoping to discover big bucks this weekend Disney
More diagnostics on Dial of Destiny:
PostTrak’s audience is 79% and four stars. The leading guy 25+ ticket buyers at 43% are giving it a 77% grade. That’s not good. Overall, men are giving a 74% grade on a 58% turnout.
Here’s what’s interesting: Even though just 10% came to see Phoebe Waller-Bridge as the female lead in the movie, women like Dial of Destiny better than men with a 85% grade. Women over 25, who showed up at 35%, give it an 86%.
The older Dial of Destiny‘s audience gets, the better the grades with the 45-55 sect (19% turnout) giving it 83% and the over-55 people (at 23%) giving it 89%.
Diversity demos weren’t that diverse with 54% Caucasian (79% grade), 18% Latino and Hispanic (80%), Black at 10% (73%) and Asian 13% (80%).
Dial of Destiny played best in the West, Mountain and Midwest, with PLF, Imax, Screen Box, D box driving 35% of the weekend. Broken down that’s 21% from PLF, 11% from Imax, 3% from combined 4D, D-box and Screen X. Disney’s El Capitan in Los Angeles is the top-grossing theater with $114K running cume through end of Friday.
All tickets sales for movies are at $125M off 34% from a year ago, per Comscore, which was led by Universal/Illumination’s Minions: The Rise of Gru with $140.6M over its holiday Friday-Tuesday (July 4th fell on a Monday). Indiana Jones is expected to be around $82M over its five days, around -40% less Minions take last year — who’da thunk?

Yikes, this movie is opened lower than Paws of Fury last summer. The results here make Strange World‘s 3-day of $12M look like a blockbuster. Just kidding. But seriously, we can’t take potshots at Pixar and ignore the fact here that a DreamWorks movie which cost $70M before P&A tanked. What’s the lesson here? Don’t make animated movies that have unknown protags in the title, and animation that looks like Strange World. Ruby Gillman‘s few moviegoers gave it a surprising A- CinemaScore, the same as last summer’s Paws of Fury. For the record, it’s higher than the B which Strange World got. PostTrak exits, which are always harder than CinemaScore, at 68% positive, however, kids under 12 said 91%. Moms leading, of course at 52% females, 64% between 18-34, biggest demo being 18-24 at 42%. The mix of audience was 39% White, 33% Latino and Hispanic, 11% Black, & 17% Asian/other. Kraken played strongest in the South, South Central & West.

FRIDAY AFTERNOON UPDATE: Harrison Ford’s swan song as the man in the hat, the guy with the whip, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (read the review), is looking very similar to a pair of other older-leaning franchise pics aimed at guys, 2021’s No Time to Die and 2018’s Mission: Impossible – Fallout, with a Friday of $24M. That’s around the neighborhood of the first Friday of those two movies.
That means last night’s previews repped 30% of today’s gross. The $250M installment directed by James Mangold and produced by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas still is on track for a $60M-$65M 3-day and, rolling in Monday and July 4th Tuesday, should see around $85M for the 5-day. The Disney/Lucasfilm finale sequel is booked at 4,600 theaters.
Universal/DreamWorks Animation’s Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken (read the review) isn’t wowing as expected with a $2.5M Friday (including Thursday previews of $725K) and $6M Friday-Sunday take outside the top five.
We’ll have more as it comes. Here’s the chart:
1.) Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (Dis) 4,600 theaters, Fri $24M, 3-day $60M-$65M/Wk 1
2.) Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Sony) 3,405 theaters, Fri $3.6M (-37%), 3-day $12.4M (-35%)/Total $340.7M /Wk 5

UPDATED after EXCLUSIVE: Disney/Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny came in at $7.2 million in previews Thursday, per Disney. We heard last night that the pic was heading for $6 million-$7.5 million. That’s where previous older-skewing action-guy comps live.

We’re specifically referencing the Thursday night starts of No Time to Die, which grossed $6.3M (started at 4 p.m.) before its $55.2M opening weekend in October 2021, and Mission: Impossible – Fallout, which made $6M before its $61.2M weekend start in 2018. Dial of Destiny, which started previews at 3 p.m. Thursday, is expected to gross between $60M-$65M at 4,500 theaters, making is the second-highest stateside opening for the Steven Spielberg-George Lucas franchise after 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which posted a five-day opening of $151.9M, after a 3-day of $100.1M.
Crystal Skull didn’t have previews but opened fully on the Thursday before Memorial Day weekend with $25M at 4,260 theaters.
Dial of Destiny‘s Thursday night is below recent dude movies John Wick 4 ($8.9M, $74M 3-day) and Fast X ($7.5M, $67M).

Also previewing last night was Universal/DreamWorks Animation’s Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, with $725,000 from 2,700 theaters that started at 2 p.m. yesterday. No one is expecting this movie, which looks like it used the same animation style as Disney’s bomb Strange World, to do well, with an outlook in the single digits. Yes, original animation is hard to launch, but parents will see that 65% Rotten Tomatoes critics score and not waste their time. The pic’s Thursday is higher than the previews for Paramount’s toon misfire last July Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank, which did $505K from previews that started at 3 p.m.; that pic opened to $6.3M and finaled at $17.8M.

Why aren’t weekend projections for Dial of Destiny up to the same level as the previous chapter? It’s twofold: Part of that has to do with this Indy getting the worst reviews ever at 66% coming out of its Cannes Film Festival world premiere, but also, its audience is graying and on par with 007 franchise. You can’t say that Mission: Impossible is getting older just yet because a franchise-best start is expected for Dead Reckoning, with more than $100M over five days starting July 12. That sixth sequel should nab a Top Gun: Maverick halo effect.

Hopefully audiences are better on Dial of Destiny. Crystal Skull was slammed with a B CinemaScore after 1989’s Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with Sean Connery landed an A. Dial of Destiny is OK so far: 88% with Rotten Tomatoes audiences. Screen Engine/Comscore’s PostTrak shows 78% with general audiences and 3½ stars and a 59% definite recommend, while parents and kids under 12 are slightly better at 4 stars apiece and 82%. Turnout on Thursday night was 59% guys to 41% women.

What’s social media saying about Dial of Destiny? RelishMix reports: “Chatter on Indy 5 runs mixed-leaning-positive with fans who think ‘this will be a masterpiece, filled with heart-pounding action’ and that Ford as Indy will be missed as one the best heroes ever — along with adoration for John Williams’ historic contribution and career. Plus, there’s excitement for James Mangold at the helm as fans talk about their lives over the 39 years [of the] franchise and wish there had been more episodes. Hecklers are taking pot shots at everything from the story, throwback elements and cliché comments about sequels, but are nowhere as loud as lovers of the franchise.”

Social media universe for Dial of Destiny counts 296.4M across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube views “predominately on Lucas channels and cross-promoted on several Disney movie channels with brand tie-in spots which are also well integrated into the push,” says RelishMix. That figure is above Fallout‘s SMU of 234M but well below that of No Time to Die (692.5M), Top Gun: Maverick (401M) and Hobbs and Shaw (961.4M).
No Time to Die‘s Thursday previews repped 27% of its $23.3M first Friday, while Fallout‘s previews repped 26% of its $22.8M Friday. Indy here will, of course, have the extra legroom of the Monday and Tuesday in the extended holiday, though July 4th is always a downer day for moviegoing. No Time to Die, released in October 2021, drew 64% guys, 57% over 35, and Fallout pulled in 58% men, 41% of that demo over 25, and 17% under 25. Crystal Skull skewed 66% over 25 and with a third of its audience comprised of kids under 12 and parents.

Dial of Destiny will have the exhibition treasures of 400 Imax auditoriums, 900 PLF screens, 280 D-Box theaters and 85 Screen X hubs in its theater swath.
Logan filmmaker Mangold took over directing the finale from longtime franchise architect Spielberg. In this latest installment, Indy teams with his goddaughter (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) and is on the search for a device which, as Cher has always sung, “can turn back time.” If you thought Indy was old in Crystal Skull, he’s even older here, with the action taking place in 1969. That said, he’s still dealing with Nazis, one of them played by Mads Mikkelsen.
The rest of Thursday and this week:
Sony Animation’s Spider-Man: Across the Universe (read the review) wins the week with an estimated $30.6M at 3,785 in Week 4 after a Thursday of $2.38M, -16% from Wednesday and a running total of $328.3M.
Disney/Pixar’s Elemental (read the review) is second with a Week 2 of $30.4M, a Thursday of $2.4M and running total of $77.4M, 22% behind last summer’s Lightyear at the same point in time. The pic is booked at 4,035 theaters.
Sony’s No Hard Feelings (read the review) at 3,028 theaters ends Week 1 with a hearty $21.8M. While The Flash‘s second weekend edged out No Hard Feelings, $15.1M to $15M, Flash‘s second week ends with $21.8M as well after a $1.1M Thursday, -29% from Wednesday at 4,256 theaters. No Hard Feelings‘ Thursday was $1.37M, -13%.
Paramount’s Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (read the review) at 3,523 theaters did $1.2M Thursday, -12%, for a third week of $17.7M and a running total of $129.1M.

2023-06-28 19:15:42+00:00,‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Review: Turning Back the Clock,"The gruff appeal of Harrison Ford, both de-aged and properly weathered, is the main draw in this generally silly entry in the long-running franchise.","What makes Indy run? For years, the obvious answer was Steven Spielberg, who, starting in 1981 with “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” guided Harrison Ford’s hunky archaeologist, Dr. Henry Walton Jones Jr., in and out of gnarly escapades and ripped shirts in four box-office behemoths. By the time Spielberg directed Ford in their last outing, “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” (2008), Indy was in his late 50s and fans were speculating that the character was immortal, even if the franchise itself had begun running on fumes.
As a longtime big Hollywood star and hitmaker, Ford had already achieved an immortality of a kind. Indy-ologists, though, were more focused on the eternal life that Indy might have been granted by the Holy Grail when he takes a healthy swig from it in his third outing, “The Last Crusade” (1989). It’s pretty clear from his newest venture, the overstuffed if not entirely charmless “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” that while Indy may not in fact be immortal, the brain trust overseeing this installment wishes he were. They haven’t simply brought the character back for another go, they have also given him a digital face-lift.
The face-lift is as weird and distracting as this kind of digital plastic surgery tends to be, though your mileage will vary as will your philosophical objections to the idea that Ford needed to be de-aged to draw an audience, even for a 42-year-old franchise that’s now older than most North American moviegoers. The results don’t have the spooky emptiness of uncanny-valley faces. That said, the altered Indy is cognitively dissonant; I kept wondering what they’d done to — or perhaps with — Ford. It turns out that when he wasn’t getting body doubled, he was on set hitting his marks before his face was sent out to be digitally refreshed.
The guy you’re familiar with eventually appears — with wrinkles and gray hair, though without a shirt or pants, huzzah — but first you need to get past the prolonged opener, which plays like a franchise highlight reel. These nods to the past are unsurprising for a series steeped in nostalgia. “Raiders” was created by Spielberg’s pal, George Lucas, who saw it as a homage to the serials that he’d loved as a kid. Lucas envisioned a hero along the lines of Humphrey Bogart in “Treasure of the Sierra Madre,” but with morals (more or less), while Spielberg was interested in making a Bond-style film without the hardware and gimmicks.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvMjgvbW92aWVzL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnktcmV2aWV3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-02 07:00:35+00:00,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny review – Harrison Ford does the heavy lifting in lightweight sequel,The octogenarian star gives it his all in James Mangold’s fun but formulaic action adventure co-starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge and a scenery-sucking Mads Mikkelsen,"After scoring box-office bullseyes with Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Steven Spielberg blotted his Hollywood wunderkind copybook with 1941 (1979). A “comedy spectacular” set in the wake of the Pearl Harbor bombing (yes, really), 1941 cost nearly twice as much as Spielberg’s previous outing yet took less than a third of its box office. Chastised, the director teamed up with George Lucas on a project inspired by the serial cheapies of the 1930s and 40s. The result was the moderately priced Raiders of the Lost Ark, which promptly became the highest-grossing film of 1981, and which Spielberg later told me helped him get back to his crowd-pleasing roots.
Four decades and as many sequels/prequels later, the Indiana Jones franchise is still a money-spinner, although exponentially soaring budgets (this latest instalment cost close to $300m) have put paid to the original’s comparatively cheap and cheerful ethos. In its place we have a strange combination of cutting-edge, computer-enhanced nostalgia (Harrison Ford is digitally de-aged for flashbacks to second world war-era Europe) mixed with a string of old-but-new action set pieces involving big trains, small cars and nippy bikes – sequences that weirdly mirror this summer’s other massively expensive action franchise release, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. The difference is that while MI7 looks machine-tooled to keep you on the edge of your seat, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny just wants you to sit back and wallow in it.
With Spielberg no longer directing, it’s left to safe pair of hands James Mangold to crack the whip, with the help of his Le Mans 66 (AKA Ferrari v Ford) co-writers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth. Thankfully, Shia LaBeouf’s insufferable Mutt Williams, whom Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) had clumsily attempted to lineup as a successor to Dr Jones, is gone, his absence handily explaining why Indy finds himself alone again, naturally.
It’s the late 1960s, and the good doctor has become a bone-aching grouch, a live-action cinematic cousin of the old guy from Up. While Indy growls at retirement, the US co-opts former Nazi Jürgen Voller (a scenery-sucking Mads Mikkelsen) to aid Nasa’s moon landing efforts. But Voller has his sights on a bigger prize – the titular magical MacGuffin, which he last laid hands on back in 1944. Here, young(er) Indy and the oddball Prof Basil Shaw (Toby Jones, stealing every scene) do knockabout battle with Voller’s Nazi henchman for possession of Archimedes’s Antikythera mechanism; a two-piece contraption (crucially, you need both pieces) that can not only predict but perhaps control temporal anomalies… or something. Think Ark of the Covenant meets the Tardis. But smaller. And in two bits.
You’re invited to marvel at the scenic vistas and passably unremarkable popcorn adventures
Meanwhile, back in the 60s, Basil’s daughter Helena (a clearly delighted Phoebe Waller-Bridge) has her own monetary designs on the dial. Helena is Indy’s goddaughter, setting the stage for much lively quasi-familial bickering as everyone hotfoots it around the globe, racing to find the ancient artefact with mysterious powers that will change the course of blah, blah, blah…
According to the British Board of Film Classification’s splendidly straight-faced consumer advice, “those familiar with the series will not be surprised by the violence and the threat”, to which it might well have added: “Or indeed anything else.” There’s literally nothing here to frighten the horses or upset any applecarts, save for those knocked over during the crowded-street chase scenes. Even the preposterousness of the final act (not so much WTF? as OFFS!) seems par for the course in a series that started with Nazi faces being melted by scary angels and most recently had Dr Jones and co communing with space aliens through a multidimensional portal in the mythical city of Akator.
Instead, you’re invited to feel warm and fuzzy about reuniting with old friends (even those whose reappearance has proved divisive) and to marvel at the scenic vistas and passably unremarkable popcorn adventures, all played out to sturdy John Williams themes. Hats off to Ford, who continues a winning streak of later-life role reprisals (Han Solo, Rick Deckard), proving that whatever gruff genre appeal he possessed in his heyday has aged better than Indy’s knees. He may be 80, but Ford carries the weight of the film, which, for all its gargantuan expense, feels a bit like those throwaway serials that first inspired Lucas – fun while it lasts, but wholly forgettable on exit.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZmlsbS8yMDIzL2p1bC8wMi9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LXJldmlldy1oYXJyaXNvbi1mb3JkLXBob2ViZS13YWxsZXItYnJpZGdlLW1hZHMtbWlra2Vsc2VuLXRvYnktam9uZXPSAZYBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2ZpbG0vMjAyMy9qdWwvMDIvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1hbmQtdGhlLWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS1yZXZpZXctaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC1waG9lYmUtd2FsbGVyLWJyaWRnZS1tYWRzLW1pa2tlbHNlbi10b2J5LWpvbmVz?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
7/2/2023 16:51,Indiana Jones’ box office destiny? A lukewarm $60 million debut in North America,Moviegoers were only moderately interested in going to the theater to say goodbye to Harrison Ford’s archaeologist character in “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.”,"Indiana Jones, and executives at the Walt Disney Co. and Lucasfilm, made a somewhat dispiriting discovery this weekend. Moviegoers didn’t rush to the theater in significant numbers to see “ Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” and say goodbye to Harrison Ford as the iconic archaeologist.
The film, reportedly budgeted north of $250 million, came in on the lower end of projections with $60 million in ticket sales from 4,600 North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.
Including $70 million from international showings in 52 markets, “Dial of Destiny” celebrated a $130 million global opening. It easily earned the No. 1 title but was not the high-rolling sendoff for one of modern cinema’s most iconic actor/character pairings that anyone hoped. Disney is projecting that it will make $82 million domestically through the fourth of July holiday and $152 million globally.
“Dial of Destiny” is the long-delayed fifth installment in the Steven Spielberg/George Lucas-created adventure series that began in 1981, and the first Spielberg himself hasn’t directed. Veteran James Mangold stepped in to take the reins overseeing the Spielberg-approved script, which finds an older Dr. Jones retiring from his university job and swept up on a new adventure with his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge).
“It’s impressive that a franchise that’s over 40 years old is No. 1 at the box office. But there’s no question there were higher hopes for the debut of this movie,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “This is Indiana Jones. This is a summer movie icon.”
The film made its splashy premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May, with a fitting celebration of Ford, who has said this was his last time playing the character.
But then it was hit with lukewarm reviews. This was an unexpected and unwelcome hurdle, considering it was coming after the maligned fourth film, 2008’s “Indiana Jones and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.” Another contributing snag was that a significant portion of the target audience, older viewers, don’t tend to buy many tickets on opening weekend for big blockbusters. But even “Crystal Skull,” budgeted at a reported $185 million, managed to gross over $790 million.
“Sometimes reviews don’t matter, but the sentiment coming out of Cannes was very powerful,” Dergarabedian said. “It set off a narrative where people were already feeling disappointed and they hadn’t even seen it.”
Second place went to “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” with $11.5 million, bringing its domestic total to around $340 million. “Elemental” landed in third place with $11.3 million.
Aside from “Dial of Destiny,” the weekend’s other main new opener was the animated “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken,” which debuted in sixth place with $5.2 million.
“Dial of Destiny’s” underwhelming debut comes just a few weeks after both Warner Bros.’ “The Flash” and Disney/Pixar’s “Elemental” had lackluster openings in North America. “Elemental,” like Indy 5, also premiered at Cannes to middling reception.
And yet, “Elemental” in its three weeks in theaters has held on much better than “The Flash,” which plummeted again to $5 million, bringing its domestic total to $99.3 million. Disney also saw similarly promising holds with “The Little Mermaid,” now at over $280 million domestically and “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" which has grossed over $345 million. After the holiday, Disney will be responsible for nearly half of the summer box office earnings.
“The entire story isn’t told on the opening weekend,” Dergarabedian said.
Disney has a “clear weekend” ahead with no competing blockbusters, when studio heads can reasonably hope for more families and older audiences to buy tickets. But things will only get more challenging for “Dial of Destiny” in the coming weeks with a crowded July. “Mission: Impossible-Dead Reckoning Part I” opens on July 12, followed by “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie” on July 21.
“The ups and downs at the box office are giving us whiplash,” Dergarabedian said. “And we’re still on the cusp of some of the biggest movies of the summer.”
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.
1. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” $60 million.
2. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” $11.5 million.
3. “Elemental,” $11.3 million.
4. “No Hard Feelings,” $7.5 million.
5. “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” $7 million.
6. “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken,” $5.2 million.
7. “The Little Mermaid,” $5.2 million.
8. “The Flash,” $5 million.
9. “Asteroid City,” $3.8 million.
10. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” $1.8 million.

Harrison Ford brought the legendary titular character Indiana Jones back to the big screen this weekend with “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” but its opening box office showing was lower than advance estimates.
The movie grossed $60 million in the United States and $70 million internationally, bringing the fifth and final installment of the storied franchise’s global box office to $130 million on its 3-day opening.
“Dial of Destiny” reportedly cost nearly $300 million to make, which makes the open weekend box office numbers underwhelming and a tall hurdle for the movie to clear in order to profit.
The movie did open at number one despite mediocre reviews for Indy’s final chapter, and is projected to earn $82 million in its 5-day opening through the July 4 holiday weekend.
“Dial of Destiny” also appears to have been better received by fans than the franchise’s fourth installment, “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” although that film still grossed $100 million during its 2008 opening weekend.

Ford, who first portrayed Jones in 1981’s “Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark,” told CNN’s Chris Wallace in a June interview that he wanted to give fans, and the character, an ending that felt conclusive.
“I wanted it to be character driven and I wanted it to confront the question of age straight on – not to hide my age, but to take advantage of it in the telling of the story,” Ford said, adding he felt “very strongly” that they achieved that goal.
As for saying goodbye to the character that he’s played for over 40 years? “It’s time for me to grow up,” he joked.
The opening is one of several disappointing showings for big-budget movies at the box office this summer, with Warner Bros.’ “The Flash” and Pixar’s animated “Elemental” both falling well short of expectations. (Warner Bros., like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.)

'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' is Harrison Ford's farewell to his iconic character
CHICAGO (WLS) -- Harrison Ford is bidding farewell to his iconic character after ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"" and sat down with ABC7 Chicago to talk about the grand finale of his epic journey with the character.
Ford was born on the North Side of Chicago at Swedish Covenant Hospital and grew up in Park Ridge, graduating from Maine East High School. While he's still a Chicago guy, he's also Indiana Jones to many, and it felt good to pick up that fedora and whip again.
""Feels right, feels right because we've got a good story to attend to,"" Ford said. ""He's no longer a young man, but there's still a story to be told and I wanted to tell that final chapter.""

Professor Jones is a little different in this particular story.
""I think he's slipping a bit, and he's become a bit disillusioned, there's been a lot of difficulty lately but we're here to sort it all out,"" he said.
And he didn't slide on any of those action scenes.
""Well there's a lot of action in it, but there's a lot of heart in it too,"" Ford said. ""There's a lot about relationships and responsibility. I'm making it sound a little dull but it isn't.""

And while there may be more stories to tell in the Indiana Jones universe, Ford is quite sure this film is the conclusion of Indy's story.
""It's the end of the story for me. It's the last time I'm going to play Indiana Jones, and I'm very grateful to have the opportunity to do it, but theta's it.""

2023-07-07 11:00:00+00:00,How Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny De-Aged Harrison Ford,Industrial Light & Magic developed a new suite of tools to reincarnate the Indy of the 80s. The effect is haunting—and raises more questions about the use of AI in Hollywood.,"Near the end of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Nazis attempt to pull off one of the oldest tropes in entertainment: using the movie’s titular dial, the Antikythera, to travel back to 1939 and assassinate Adolf Hitler. As their aircraft bears down on a time warp, the scientist Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), tells Indy of his plan to install himself as the führer and win the war. In his mind, history’s “greatest moment” is “it’s end.”
To enter the past, then, is to end history. It’s Voller’s motto, but also the movie’s—a nod to the de-aging technology that has made it possible. Thanks to several tools—machine learning, CGI, other tech—80-year-old Harrison Ford spends roughly 25 minutes of the film looking like the Indiana Jones of the early 1980s. He personifies the end of history brought about by technology’s endeavor to pull people out of time, to return Ford or Bruce Willis or Robert De Niro to their younger selves. Ford’s is also a face many fear: a visual representation of a future for Hollywood in which aging or deceased actors can be resuscitated via artificial intelligence. That’s the promise. But the message that comes through in Dial of Destiny, a film that seems intensely preoccupied with how it was made, is that there is something hauntingly sad about this vision.
The tech-reincarnated Indy of the 1980s makes a poignant contrast to the Indy we see for most of the film: a retired academic, stuck in a crusty apartment and estranged from Marion Ravenwood. Dial’s story, like the Jones movies before it, focuses on an ancient MacGuffin (the Antikythera) sought by both Indy and Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). She seeks to sell it for a pretty penny on the black market; he, of course, thinks it belongs in an American museum. Naturally, they form an uneasy alliance to stop Voller.
So how does de-aged Ford look? An odd mix of impressive and unreal, his face unhumanly smooth as if slathered with magic grease, glowing from within like a Stable Diffusion portrait that moves. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, who worked with Steven Spielberg on all of his Indy movies in the ’80s, recently told Empire that she hoped fans would see the movie and think someone had found footage from 40 years ago. This will probably not be the case—and not just because director James Mangold shot the film in 4K. Ford looks too perfect, his surroundings too clean. It looks like trickery, but of course you are looking for trickery.
The current discourse around AI and Hollywood would have you believe that a Disney executive fed Ford’s face into a copier and pressed a big “De-Age” button. New tech always provokes this reaction, explains Andrew Whitehurst, one of the VFX supervisors at Industrial Light & Magic who worked on Dial’s de-aging. “People assumed that we all sat down in front of a Silicon Graphics workstation in 1993, pressed D for ‘dinosaur,’ and Jurassic Park fell out of the back of the computer,” he says.
“From my perspective, there’s nothing that we can’t do. Given enough time and resources, we can accomplish anything.” ILM VFX supervisor Robert Weaver
Instead, ILM used a set of tools it calls FaceSwap. Like the the purpose-built tech ILM developed to let Martin Scorsese de-age actors for The Irishman, Dial of Destiny utilized a proprietary system called Flux that used two infrared cameras perched on either side of the one filming Ford to gather information from his performance. Unlike The Irishman, it also involved what the actor called “dots on my face” that captured even more data. All of that info was then combined to create a “CG mask” that could be placed on Indy in every frame.
To ensure Ford looked like his younger self, the ILM team used machine learning tools to scour years of footage of the actor that Lucasfilm had in its archives. The team also worked with VFX tools from Disney Research and a “smattering” of other sources to fine-tune the de-aged shots. “Each of these things is a pencil; now we have another pencil,” says Whitehurst. “So it’s just enabling us to make better choices.”
Most of the de-aged scenes take place on a train hurtling through the Bavarian countryside. Keeping the suitable “physical configuration of the face,” as ILM VFX supervisor Robert Weaver puts it, is a fiendish process involving a blue screen and hundreds of artists. Because the sequence begins at night and ends at dawn, Indy’s smirk might require a dash less shadow from one moment to the next, but that tweak could introduce a sheen that highlights new creases and makes the smirk read as a frown.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LWRlLWFnaW5nLXRlY2gv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-19 12:00:00+00:00,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Is a Fitting End for Indy,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a fitting end, and a couple more hours with a Hollywood icon. Nostalgia ﻿doesn't always work, but it does here.","It's been 15 years since we last saw Indiana Jones on screen, and just over 40 years since the Nazi-punching archeologist discovered that the Ark of the Covenant was real. That's a lot of time—enough to possibly forget that Indy has, over the course of four films before returning for Dial of Destiny, also proved the existence of Jesus Christ, the Holy Grail, mind-controlling blood magic, and ancient aliens. It's the perfect combination of James Bond and crackpot History Channel shows, with each new entry into the franchise sending the college professor barreling into another adventure as if he didn't just learn the secrets of the universe.
But Indy's complete indifference to these mind-altering revelations is also part of his everlasting charm. Though he possesses knowledge of every religious object and international fable throughout history, Indy is still someone who won't believe anything is real until he has it in his hands. He's the kind of guy who screams ""That belongs in a museum!"" way before he ever stops to consider just how a holy chalice brought his father back to life in The Last Crusade. Chalk it up to movie magic, but the success of such a lovable, unmoved rogue also rests largely on the shoulders of Harrison Ford.
Related Story Harrison Ford Has Stories to Tell
The 80-year-old actor has made a career of playing tough, smart-mouthed heroes. Han Solo stuck it to the Stormtroopers, Rick Deckard stuck it to the replicants, and Indiana Jones stuck it to the Nazis. So, as it was time to say goodbye in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Blade Runner 2049, it was only natural that the Hollywood great also received an official sendoff in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
Luckily for audiences, a grand farewell is all Dial of Destiny had in mind. While other franchises attempt to spend over two hours straddling the line between thanking the old guard while also ushering in the new, the fifth Indiana Jones film plays it straight. No multiverses, no teasing spinoffs, no one last last ride. This is it, and it's a fitting end. Back in The Crusade, Indiana Jones uttered one of the greatest lines in American action films: ""Nazis, I hate those guys."" That spirit lives on. The villains in Dial of Destiny? Nazis. The Nazi? Mads Mikkelsen. The punching? Right in his face.
Ford is right—it's the most impressive use of de-aging technology I've seen yet.
Director James Mangold (Logan) does his best to take over from the great Steven Spielberg, but it's a tough act to follow. Admittedly, some of that charm is lost in sequel exposition and familiar action sequences. Mangold is still forced to explain why certain characters aren't here anymore, why Indy is all alone, and why an 80-year-old man may have trouble performing the same unbelievable feats of his past. Thankfully, that's where digital de-aging comes into play, and it's surprisingly convincing. Ford is right—it's the most impressive use of de-aging technology I've seen yet.
But past the exciting train-fight flashback that opens the film, we spend most of Dial of Destiny dealing with the same problem that now threatens Indiana Jones: time. The ancient dial is said to hold the power to send someone back into the past—something the Nazis would naturally jump at the chance to acquire. As Mikkelsen's Dr. Vuller tells us, ""You didn't win the war, Hitler lost.""
But Indy can't do it himself—not as this age. So, we're introduced to Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Helena Shaw. Much like Shia LaBeouf in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, she's a next-gen adventurer related to another one of Indy's rolodex of archaeologist buddies who has gone crazy in pursuit of an ancient artifact. She wants the dial for her own personal purposes, but Indy just wants what he's always wanted. The dial belongs out of Nazi hands, and in a museum. So, he's forced into yet another international adventure to save the world. The two have great chemistry together, and Indy's lack of an I'm too old for this shit attitude once he gets moving is actually refreshingly on brand for his character.
The journey sends them on a mission to discover a life lesson that's quite simple. While other summer blockbusters such as The Flash shove so much content in your face that it makes the reward feel meaningless, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny does it right. Especially for a character who has studied history all their life, the message of this final Indy outing hits home with purpose. You can't erase your problems by changing the past, but you can always reminisce about the good.
That's called nostalgia, and it's dominated reboots and sequels in Hollywood for the past decade. It doesn't always work, but it's employed most fittingly in a film like Indiana Jones 5. We're saying goodbye to Indy, but it's no funeral. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny gives audiences the chance to spend a couple more hours having fun with Indiana Jones again. There's only a legacy to celebrate when the film his theaters on June 30, right alongside the Indiana Jones we know and love.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcXVpcmUuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbW92aWVzL2E0NDIyMjU2Mi9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LWlzLWEtZml0dGluZy1lbmQtZm9yLWluZHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Inside the VFX of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Andrew Whitehurst of ILM discusses the techniques used to create the memorable effects of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.,"Spoiler warning: This article discusses story details and plot points of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
“I’ve been looking for this all my life,” says our adventuring archaeologist in the trailer for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. But that sentiment could have also come from Industrial Light & Magic’s Andrew Whitehurst, longtime visual effects supervisor, about what the opportunity to work on the film represented.
“I have the joy-of-going-to-the movies side of loving Indiana Jones, which was that it was this ultra-exciting adventure serial,” he tells Lucasfilm.com. “Everything seemed plausible and tangible and real-world, but then with this supernatural edge to it. The characters were so engaging and there never seemed to be anything cynical about it. The peril is absolutely in earnest and the jokes are absolutely in earnest. Even as a kid, I loved that. And from the visual effects side of it, in the ‘80s there was a BBC science series called Horizon. Every week they would do an episode on a different subject, and one week they did visual effects, which I knew nothing about. I was nine years old, and it was mainly focused around the making of Temple of Doom. And so I had my mind blown for an hour where I learned that you could make movies with models and paintings and animation. That was my literal introduction to what visual effects is. To see that and, you know, 40 years later I’m supervising the fifth one, it’s kind of crazy. So, the visual effects of Indiana Jones is a really key component in me doing what I do for a living now.”
The adventure begins
As production visual effects supervisor on Dial of Destiny, Whitehurst would oversee the work of ILM and all vendors for a time and world-jumping adventure, which follows Indy from WWII-era Europe to 1969 New York and Morocco to ancient Sicily. Even for someone with Skyfall, Ex Machina, and Annihilation on his resume, it was a lot. “The trickiest thing about a movie like this is that it’s an odyssey,” he says. “Almost every single scene is in a different location or has a different component to it. So you have to break up the project into all of the various places that we are and things that happen within those places.” Whitehurst worked closely with production designer Adam Stockhausen in figuring out the look of the various effects sequences in the movie, with input from director James Mangold throughout the process.
Over time, Whitehurst has developed his own method for realizing sequences in a way that welcomes in his collaborators. “My background is in fine arts, so I tend to draw and paint a lot for two reasons. One, for me to start to get my own head around how things might look or the things that are going to be tricky. And also, then, to communicate ‘How about doing things this way?’ to Jim or Adam or, Phedon Papamichael the DP, or Mike McCusker the editor, and so that they’ve got something concrete in front of them as a drawing or as a really rough, sketchy animatic or a painting or something.

,"Harrison Ford Talks 'Indiana Jones,' Life at 80, Legendary Career: 'Never Thought I'd Be a Leading Man' (Exclusive)","'I never thought that I would be a leading man,' Harrison Ford tells PEOPLE in this week's cover story, as he prepares for the release of 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,' his final turn as Indiana Jones","When Harrison Ford picks up the fedora and whip for the last time in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, out June 30, he returns to a role that helped make him a legend.
But truth be told, Ford didn’t set out to be a Hollywood superstar. Or famous at all.
“I never thought that I would be a leading man,” he tells PEOPLE in this week’s cover story. “I really was just hoping I could make a living as an actor and not have to supplement my income with some other side hustle… I thought I would be lucky to have a character part on a regular TV show.”
Fate—and fans—had other plans, of course. Over an unparalleled five-decade career, the dry-witted Chicago native has carried films, including the epic Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises, that have grossed nearly $10 billion worldwide.
And Ford, who turns 81 in July, has lost none of his love of the game. “I probably enjoy making movies more now than I ever did,” he says.
He acknowledges age takes its toll—he’s still recovering from tearing a shoulder muscle on the second day of shooting Indiana Jones—but he has no interest in turning back the clock. “I don’t want to be young again,” says Ford, who has been married to actress Calista Flockhart, 58, since 2010 and is a father of five. “I was young, and now I enjoy being old.”

He adds: “You are certainly physically diminished by age but there are wonderful things about age—richness of experience, the full weight of all the time you’ve been spending getting to being old— and there’s a certain ease in it for me.”
Not one to be nostalgic or flashy, Ford has long preferred to keep his head down, and just get to work. “No one ever believes this, but I never wanted to be rich and famous,” he says. “I just wanted to be an actor.”

These days Ford is busier than ever. He leapt into TV this year with two hit shows: Shrinking, on Apple TV+, and the Yellowstone prequel 1923 on Paramount+. He recently wrapped his first entry into the Marvel universe, Captain America: Brave New World: “I saw a lot of great actors having fun,” he says, “so I thought, ‘Hey, I want some of this!’”
But perhaps his most sentimental turn—at least for fans—is the reprisal of the swashbuckling Indiana Jones. “I wanted to see him rally for one last adventure,” he says.
At the film’s world premiere at Cannes, where Ford was honored with a Palme d’Or for lifetime achievement and received a rapturous reception, he did pause to take in the affection.
“I was just trying to keep myself composed,” he says. “There was very generous applause from the crowd [and] it was positive and humbling and nice.”
For that moment, and for all the support he’s received from fans over his still-thriving career, Ford is thankful. He says: “I am very gratified that I still have the opportunities that I have to work, and I owe that to the audience.”

2023-07-10 10:00:41+00:00,“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” VFX Artists on De-Aging Indy,"Here's how VFX wizards turned an 80-year-old Harrison Ford into a 37-year-old version of his iconic action hero in ""Dial of Destiny.""","“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” VFX Artists on De-Aging Indy
Brad Pitt did it. Robert DeNiro did it. Samuel Jackson, Jeff Bridges, and Will Smith did it, too. Now, 80-year-old Harrison Ford has embraced digital de-aging in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (in theaters now) so he can fight Nazis looking like a 37-year-old version of his iconic action hero. Ford’s cinematic rejuvenation owes a considerable debt to ILM’s VFX artist lead Robert Weaver (Star Trek Into Darkness, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince) and Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Andrew Whitehurst (Skyfall, Ex Machina). Working with director James Mangold, they shaped the film’s 25-minute “prologue” featuring Harrison’s whip-wielding archaeologist as he appeared in the 1981-1989 Indiana Jones trilogy.
Speaking from separate offices, Weaver and Whitehurst pulled back the curtain on “Face Finder,” machine learning, and the “ground truth” that inspired Dial of Destiny‘s VFX achievement.
Most of the movie takes place in 1969, but the first twenty-five minutes of this movie happen during World War II with Harrison Ford as a much younger man. How the heck did you do that?
Andrew Whitehurst: We used every trick at our disposal. The two key components were one, having Harrison Ford drive the performance. And the other is having artists who were furnished with the [right] tools.
How do you organize these tools?
Whitehurst: We have an overall system, which is Face Off. It’s a variety of technologies that allow the artist to pick components from each of them to combine for a single unified result.
What visual assets were available to the Face Off system?
Whitehurst: We had the first three Indy movies from Lucasfilm that we leaned into very heavily. It was high res, high-quality material, so we scanned all of that and pulled from it. Lucasfilm also has some amazing eight-by-ten still portraits done for Raiders that enabled us to get accurate references for pore-level detail. From 80s movies, you just don’t get [that detail] from cinematography because it just ain’t there. We used that for reference as much as we could because any time we can refer back to a “ground truth,” that’s always useful.
Ground truth?
Whitehurst: Yes. Material of what Harrison Ford actually looked like at the age he’s supposed to be in the film — that’s what we refer to as our ground truth.
Robert Weaver: We have a tool we call Face Finder, which takes every frame of the current shot and pulls from a repository the best likeness and performance for that individual frame.
How does Face Finder do that?
Weaver: It finds similar angles and lighting and, most importantly, the facial performance that matches most closely to the shot. The artists then have this perfect palette so they can say, “Okay, I think this [reference] works best for when Indiana Jones has a wry smile, with the way the muscles are moving.” It’s incredibly helpful.
Whitehurst: It’s also incredibly useful to have this reference material when you’re talking to Jim [Mangold] or Robert about the shot because rather than trying to describe Indy’s nose or the way that this part of his cheek has a little bit more of a crease in it, we can actually [see it and] know that we’re literally talking about the same thing. Honestly, half the battle in doing visual effects is the communications side of it. You want everybody to understand what they’re looking at.
So you have this “ground truth” of stills and scanned film imagery from the old Indiana Jones movies on one side of the equation. The other side would be current footage of 80-year Harrison Ford. Where did they film the de-aged chapter of the story?
Whitehurst: They shot on location at the [Bamburgh] Castle [in northern England] and filmed on blue screen and sound stages at Pinewood [Studios.]
And how did that footage get processed?
Whitehurst: We had additional cameras attached to the main camera, which gave us extra angles on the face. That [footage] was very useful for constructing 3D models of Harrison’s face. We also did lighting reference photography after every setup and scanned every set, so we had a 3D representation of every single take and every single environment. That was passed to ILM so they could then start working up the shots.
SPOILER ALERT: Young Indiana Jones jumps onto a train, kills a Nazi officer, changes into his uniform, and walks into the car full of German soldiers, his youthful face front and center the whole time. Just to be clear, Harrison Ford is the foundation for all that?
Whitehurst: Well, he’s the foundation for absolutely everything. The physicality is Harrison. He’s in amazing shape. He can just do it. The facial performance is entirely his. We are basically figuring out how to take what Harrison has done and then make that into something that is 1944-era Indiana Jones.
When the film leaps ahead to 1969, Harrison Ford’s tromping around in his boxers, looking closer to his actual age. It’s quite a contrast to his earlier “self.”
Weaver: I think that’s a credit to Harrison’s acting ability. He was able to change performance and spruce himself up for the younger version. We were very fortunate in that regard.
Circling back to Indiana Jones’ de-aged face, can you elaborate on some of the tools you used to shave 40 years off Harrison Ford’s appearance?
Weaver: Well, it starts with building a CG asset and capturing his facial performance as it goes through extreme emotions. Artists then do in-between blend-shapes to transition from one [raw footage shot] to the other [CG asset]. That’s the present day. Then we attempt to make a younger version of that.
Whitehurst: What goes along with building that CG asset is heaps and heaps of very talented artists who inject textural qualities and figure out how the face moves in ways that are very idiosyncratic to Indy. Additionally, we have advances in machine learning that help drive the performance level.
Weaver: We got into keyframe animation as well.
Can you give an example of how machine learning aided the process?
Whitehurst: Machine learning enabled us to do a first pass low-resolution face swap on the dailies so that when [editor] Mike McCusker could cut that [low-res sequence] rather than having to start off the raw photography. Using face-swapped footage, albeit in a rudimentary way, allowed us to get great notes from Jim and Mike.
So the machine learning enabled a sort of rough draft that saves you time?
Whitehurst: I’m not sure if it saves you time. It enables you to make better decisions about the direction you want to go in. The amount of labor involved is enormous, so being able to have conversations during the early edit about performance with something concrete is much better than having to rely on imagination until they see a first pass later on down the line. So machine learning is not a time-saving tool. It’s a helping-us-make-better-choices tool.
You guys spent three years creating visual effects for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. What did you feel when you saw the finished cut?
Weaver: A tremendous sense of pride
Whitehurst: I would second that. It was a privilege to work with such talented people in the service of a film featuring a character we’ve loved for decades, a character who’s inspired such deep passion and fondness. When you say “Indiana Jones,” people’s faces light up — my face lights up — so to be involved in this was an absolute treat.

,Phoebe Waller-Bridge Shares Harrison Ford’s Advice For Taking a Punch On Screen,"Phoebe Waller-Bridge tells Lucasfilm.com about Harrison Ford's advice on set of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, in theaters June 30.","“I’m excited for people to meet Helena,” Waller-Bridge tells Lucasfilm.com. “She’s a slippery fish, I’ll tell you. But she’s a lot of fun.”
Behind the scenes, Waller-Bridge was nervous stepping into the role opposite Harrison Ford. On her first day on set, Ford was busy filming a flashback sequence that would explore Indy’s capture by Nazi soldiers during the fall of Berlin in 1945. When that sequence wrapped, their first scene together leaped ahead nearly 25 years to reunite their two characters after nearly two decades apart — inside a New York City bar on the afternoon of Dr. Jones’ retirement from teaching. “It was actually our first scene [working] together. And it was quite a quiet scene,” she recalls during an interview alongside Ford. “And I said [to Harrison], ‘I feel a little nervous. If I ever do anything a bit rubbish, please tell me and I’ll do it again.’”
At one point, Ford rolled up his script and gave Waller-Bridge a playful smack in the head. “And then you went, ‘Did that help?’” she reminds her co-star. But as Ford got up to leave, he squeezed her shoulder and gave her some words of encouragement. “‘You’re doing good, kid,’” he said. “And I died.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1Y2FzZmlsbS5jb20vbmV3cy9waG9lYmUtd2FsbGVyLWJyaWRnZS1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWludGVydmlldy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"Caves, Castles, and Tuna Factories: Inside the Locations of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny",Supervising location manager Duncan Broadfoot talks with Lucasfilm.com about filming locations in Europe and Africa.,"In the initial phase of his role as supervising location manager, Broadfoot oversaw a team of scouts in multiples countries, each helping to identify potential filming sites based on descriptions in the screenplay and on briefs from director James Mangold and production designer Adam Stockhausen. Where a typical Indy adventure already demands a large global search for distinct locales, Dial of Destiny faced additional challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Any travels in foreign countries resulted in weeks lost to quarantine,” explains Broadfoot. “Sometimes it’d be 10 days quarantine in the country and then ten days upon their return. So we tried a new remote scouting technology for the first time. Essentially, we had a team on the ground with an iPhone camera. The footage they captured went through an app and was beamed back to our control room in the UK, kind of like a broadcast scenario. Then that was fed into a Zoom call. The director in Los Angeles, the designer in New York, and the producers in London could be on the same call with a high-definition link to real-time footage of the location. They could speak to us and direct the camera around the location. We could even move between different countries and teams on the same call. We were limiting the traveling of the team so there was less exposure to COVID and less time in quarantine.”
Having narrowed down their selections, a small team would then visit the locations in person. “There is definitely value in being there in person to settle on what the final location is going to be,” says Broadfoot. “In every scenario, we established that we were in the right place and it was worth visiting. When we traveled there, we quite often wandered elsewhere and found other options as well.”
But there were other unique challenges. The film’s memorable tuk-tuk chase was initially slated for India. But when Broadfoot and others traveled to the cities Jaisalmer and Jaipur, “there was a terrible outbreak of Covid, and we had to leave the country and reevaluate,” as he explains. “Katmandu in Nepal was considered next, but then a similar Covid outbreak happened. Morocco came together very quickly after that.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1Y2FzZmlsbS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWR1bmNhbi1icm9hZGZvb3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,They Belong in a Museum: Prop Master Ben Wilkinson on the Treasures and Artifacts of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny • Lucasfilm,"Ben Wilkinson, prop master of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, discusses creating the dial, the Lance of Longinus, and more.","The dial takes real-world inspiration from the Antikythera mechanism, a circular device retrieved from ship wreckage near the Greek island Antikythera in 1901. Believed to date back to second century BC and originating from ancient Greece, it was most likely a computing device that aided in tracking stars and planetary movements; an inscription was also discovered on its eroded surface. As the real-world Antikythera mechanism was discovered in pieces, the Dial of Destiny, as created for the film, is divided into two fragments featuring different cogs and wheels. Astonishingly, among its many layers, the movie dial also includes rings with the ancient Corinthian calendar, a lunar ring with the days of the month, and instructions for its operation — all in actual ancient Greek.
In the film, the dial does a lot. It splits apart, gets handed off, thrown around, manipulated. So (at the risk of spoiling movie magic), Wilkinson’s crew built multiple versions. “You had the complete version — the version that goes together,” Wilkinson says. “One that they could chuck, one that they could kind of stunt with, one with a bit of size so when they’d done the closeup, we could get all the mechanisms inside to get the dial spinning.” And even during filming, the dial makers continued to tinker with their device. “We’d seen it a couple of times and then Jim called us over and was like, ‘Oh, what could we do on the back of it? It just needs a little bit more.’ So then we added to it while it was even shooting.”
Wilkinson finally saw the finished film on the big screen for the first time the day before speaking with Lucasfilm.com. It sounds like something of a surreal experience for the longtime prop maker and movie buff. “You’ve got the dial and that was blowing me away, because I was seeing it on posters, like behind the characters. As I’m watching it — and I gotta watch it again, because I was just distracted going, ‘Oh my God, there’s this!’ When he opens a drawer and the dynamite’s there and it’s like, ‘Oh, that was us!’ Even the real little things, everything’s exciting.”

Photo: Lucasfilm
Not everything about the new Indiana Jones film, Dial of Destiny, is elegant. Its opening sequence takes place in 1945, which means that rather than looking at Harrison Ford’s actual face, we must instead gaze at his digitally de-aged visage for 20 minutes. The action scenes are choppier than they were when Steven Spielberg was behind the camera, and there’s an unfortunate overabundance of CGI imagery. Give me back the days when Hollywood melted Nazi skulls the way God intended — with alginate and red gelatin.
However, there’s no denying the elegance with which the film ties up one of the franchise’s most uncomfortable loose ends. In the run-up to Dial of Destiny, I wondered how the film would deal with the problem of Shia LaBeouf’s Mutt Williams, the long-lost son of Indy introduced in 2008’s Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Intended as a 1950s rebel in the Brando mold, Mutt was derided by fans and critics alike; The Village Voice’s Robert Wilonsky dubbed him “The Mild One.” If that weren’t enough, allegations of domestic violence have since made LaBeouf more or less uncastable in major studio movies. (He is next set to appear in Francis Ford Coppola’s self-financed Megalopolis.) And yet, Indiana Jones isn’t a franchise to rewrite canon willy-nilly. If Indy had a son in the fourth movie, that son will still exist in the fifth one. What’s a self-respecting tentpole to do?
Turns out, the way Dial of Destiny handles the issue is so perfect I couldn’t help but chuckle when the movie got around to revealing what happened to Mutt. Read no farther if you don’t want to be spoiled …
Mutt dies off-screen in Vietnam!
Yes, that’s right: Mutt Williams receives the ultimate write-off from ’60s-set period pieces, the hand-wave-iest hand-wave in postwar fiction. The only way Dial of Destiny could have given him a more ignoble fate would have been to reveal that, like Neidermeyer in Animal House, Mutt was killed by his troops. (Since we’re told Mutt was an enlisted man, and his death apparently took place before 1969, the year “fragging” really got going, he was probably spared that embarrassment. Place your bets on whether he died at Khe Sanh or Ia Drang.)
It’s a killer punch line for a joke of a character, but against all odds, the film finds a way to make Mutt’s absence something more than a clever bit of behind-the-scenes problem-solving. You see, it was Mutt’s death that caused the breakdown of Indy’s marriage and threw him into the depressive slump we meet him in at the start of the film. Credit must go to Harrison Ford, who delivers the news of Mutt’s demise with genuine sorrow: Even if Mutt didn’t mean much to Indiana Jones fans, the emotions of Ford’s face insist he still meant something to Indiana Jones. No CGI necessary.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LXdoYXQtaGFwcGVuZWQtdG8tc2hpYS1sYWJlb3Vmcy1tdXR0Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

A famous work of classical music makes an unexpected appearance in the fifth instalment of the Indiana Jones film series. We explain why...
Listen to this article Loading audio...
Harrison Ford returns to our screens as the intrepid explorer Indiana Jones for the fifth and final time in ‘The Dial of Destiny’, accompanied by the momentous musical musings of legendary composer, John Williams.
The 91-year-old film music great has composed over two hours of new music for the film. However, he is not the only composer to be featured during the movie’s runtime.
In an unexpected twist, the music of Beethoven joins the soundtrack of the fifth Indiana Jones film two-thirds of the way through the film – but perhaps not in the way you might think.
To learn why, grab your hat and your whip, because it’s time to dive into the history of classical music to decipher the meaning behind the appearance of Beethoven in Dr Jones’ final adventure. Warning, there are spoilers ahead.

Watch the trailer for Indiana Jones 5 and the Dial of Destiny
What piece of classical music features in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny?
The fifth instalment of the Indiana Jones series is (mostly) set in 1969, 33 years after the events of the first film ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’. Dr Jones is now 70 years old and has seemingly left his days of adventuring across the world, looking for ancient treasures, behind him.
But of course, for the film to happen, this doesn’t last long. Thanks to his chaotic goddaughter, Helena Shaw, he is plunged (figuratively and literally) into an adventure that takes him around the world in search of Archimedes’ dial.
At the beginning of the final chapter of the film, our protagonists, Dr Jones and Shaw enter the cave in search of the final resting place of Archimedes.
As they are talking, they notice an echo, and Indy encourages Shaw to sing in order to find where the echo is strongest, as this will determine where to go next. Out of all the pieces of music Shaw could have chosen to sing, she sings the opening notes of Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5 in C minor.

Why is Beethoven’s Symphony No.5 sung in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny?
Written over 160 years before the events of the fifth Indiana Jones movie, Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5 has become a mainstay within pop culture.
But its use in this recent Indiana Jones film could be to do with its musical phrasing.
Just like many of the artefacts featured in the storylines of Dr Jones’ adventures, the history of the fifth symphony has inspired a host of theories about what could have inspired Beethoven to write the orchestral work.
Beethoven is said to have described the ominous four-note opening motif of his Fifth Symphony (which is sung by Dr Jones and Shaw in the film) as ‘Fate Knocking at the Door’, or at least that is what critics have attested.
And fate – another word for ‘destiny’ – is certainly what was awaiting Dr Jones and Shaw when they successfully used the Fifth Symphony to guide their way through the cave.

Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony as a body percussion epic played by hundreds of schoolchildren
Another possibility as to why the Fifth Symphony was chosen for the fifth Indiana Jones film is to drive home the significance of numerical values within the movie’s plot.
The mathematician Archimedes is a central figure in the film, and a numerical code plays an important part in the plot’s development.
So it’s not implausible that the writers behind the adventure romp wanted to double down on the ‘five’ imagery hidden within the fifth film.
Regardless of why the work was chosen, its numerical significance and ties to the discovery of our protagonist’s fate cement Beethoven’s legacy as one of Indiana Jones’ favourites composers, and unofficial companion in his final adventure.

2023-06-30 19:09:58+00:00,Shaunette Renée Wilson on the Thrilling Ride of ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’,"Shaunette Renée Wilson talks Cannes, ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"" and future projects.","A few days before the theatrical release of “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” — the franchise’s final film entry — Shaunette Renée Wilson was in the lobby of a hotel in Williamsburg reflecting on her journey with the film. “I don’t think I’ve really been able to cognitively adjust yet to what this film is and how much it means to a lot of people,” Wilson says.
Indiana Jones might be hanging up his hat, but Wilson is just getting started.
Most recently, the film’s press tour took her to a photo shoot at a quiet Brooklyn playground. Back at the hotel, her temporary home, the actress has since changed out of the editorial look, a theatrical cutout dress by Nigerian-British designer Mowalola. The dress was originally a red carpet option for the film’s premiere; Wilson ended up wearing a red sequined Rodarte halter dress and cape. And for the film’s splashy debut at the Cannes Film Festival in May, she wore a beaded vintage Armani gown for the red carpet and Chopard jewelry.

“I had a security detail follow me everywhere, which was kind of intense, but also kind of felt like a very VIP situation,” says Wilson, who’s styled by Solange Franklin. The Chopard jewels accompanied Wilson to the Cannes party, where she was honored with Variety’s breakthrough artist award. She wore a custom hooded Harbison look for the occasion. “I’m trying to delve more into fashion and to be more of a ‘look queen,’ as they say. So I think [Cannes] was a good stage for that.”
Wilson was presented the breakthrough award by fellow MFA Yale School of Drama grad Jeremy O. Harris. The pair only overlapped for one year (Wilson graduated in 2016), but the program’s alumni tend to cross paths sooner than later.
“What I loved about Yale is that it was very interdisciplinary,” says Wilson, who had a supporting role in “Black Panther,” which notably starred several Yalies. “You can literally build your own theater company with the people you go to school with.”
Shaunette Renée Wilson Lexie Moreland/WWD
Wilson, who was born in Guyana and moved to New York with her family when she was two years old, encountered the Indiana Jones franchise by way of her dad and brother.
“It was a nice introduction to American culture,” she says. “The interesting thing about ‘Indiana Jones’ is that it has that international appeal, because it literally goes all over the world and encounters so many different people. It’s also something in our zeitgeist; everyone knows what it is. Telling my family that I’m in ‘Indiana Jones,’ it’s an immediate recognition,” she adds. “They immediately are like, ‘oh, I know what that is,’ and that’s a big deal.”
Wilson wasn’t immediately sold on the project when the audition came through, although she recognized it as a big opportunity.
“I read [the script] and initially had some concerns with my character and the way she was portrayed, or the way she exited the film. I was like, ‘I don’t think this is something I would want to inhabit and embody, and I find this problematic,’” says Wilson, who was encouraged to bring up her concerns when talking with director James Mangold. “He was really receptive and said it was something that he was gonna change and work on.” Shortly after, Wilson’s team called her and started playing the Indiana Jones theme song; she had the part.

Although the film’s final edit meant that parts of her character arc — a CIA agent searching for Indiana Jones in the late ’60s — ended up getting cut from the film, Wilson is proud of the bigger picture.
“It’s quite a fun ride. It is a thrilling ride,” she says. “It is a good sendoff for this character [Indiana Jones] that’s been around for decades. And there was also a moment of pride to be a part of that in history, and seeing the only Black woman to be in this franchise on the screen is still pretty momentous to me.”
Wilson will next be seen in the Hulu series “Washington Black,” produced by Sterling K. Brown. The actress describes the project, based on the acclaimed novel by Esi Edugyan, as “probably the most physically, emotionally and mentally demanding part I’ve ever played.”
“But I think because of that, I want to do something with levity, lighter, comedy,” she says, adding that she’s working on writing a pilot with a friend that reflects “a little bit more about me, my queerness and queer community, but not associating any of that with a lot of trauma.”
The industrywide strikes mean that Wilson will likely have more time than usual to dedicate to developing her own projects this summer.
“I just can’t sit around and wait for someone to hand me a job and hand me the opportunity,” she says. “I think we’re getting to a point where we start to have to create our own way forward.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9leWUvcGVvcGxlL3NoYXVuZXR0ZS1yZW5lZS13aWxzb24taW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnktMTIzNTcxOTQ4My_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Film Review: 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' is an ordinary closure for an extraordinary hero,This article is a film review written by Jude Hannahs for James Mangold’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” (2023).,"“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” (2023) opens with an extended-action flashback sequence where the audience is given the pleasure of seeing a beautifully done digitally de-aged Harrison Ford and his partner Basil Shaw (played by Toby Jones) fleeing from the Nazis on a moving train in the French Alps.
Jones and Shaw are there because they are trying to retrieve the Lance of Longinus, the blade that allegedly pierced the side of Jesus Christ as he hung on the cross during his crucifixion. The duo soon finds out that the lance is a fake but ends up leaving with another precious artifact: a half piece of Archimedes’ Dial.
Jones and Shaw manage to escape the Nazis and journey back home with the ancient mechanism that reveals time fissures, allowing for the possibility of time travel. After such a fun and exciting opening sequence, you would think that the rest of “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” would complement its opening with an even more entertaining movie. Unfortunately, the rest of the film fails to match the enjoyment of the first fifteen minutes.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is an inconsistent film. Some parts are good, some aren’t so good. That’s what happens when a sequel has been in development hell for many years. One thing this movie gets right is its leading performance.
Harrison Ford as the iconic Indiana Jones in all of his 81-year-old glory is without question the best part about the film. Ford has stated in numerous interviews that Indy is one of his favorite roles and has been waiting eagerly to return to the big screen. Ford delivers an amazing performance for a character that hasn’t been a part of popular culture for a long time.
Ford’s chemistry with the other actors/actresses in the film is also a highlight. Phoebe Waller-Bridge plays Helena Shaw—the daughter of Basil Shaw and goddaughter to Indiana Jones. The relationship between Waller-Bridge’s Helena and Ford’s Indy is rich.
They are complete opposites to each other. Indy is all about preserving ancient artifacts and not selling them in the black market whereas Helena has zero problem stealing something as valuable as Archimedes’ Dial and using it for financial gain. Throughout the runtime, the audience is given lots of good subtle character moments between the two.
The best scene of the film is just the two of them on a boat at night. Helena asks Indy what he would do if he could travel back in time. He responds that he would prevent his son Mutt Williams (played by Shia LaBeouf) from enlisting in the Vietnam War which resulted in him getting killed in action.
The emotion that Waller-Bridge shows after hearing that tragic piece of information coming from Ford is outstanding acting. The way Ford delivers his lines is heartbreaking and goes to show how committed he is to playing the character. Both Ford and Waller-Bridge give their A-game throughout the movie and it is pleasant to watch.
Where the movie falls apart is the lack of creativity in the script and its main villain. Acclaimed actor Mads Mikkelsen plays Jürgen Voller, an astrophysicist who worked for the Nazi regime and had a fascination for Archimedes' Dial. It is later revealed in the movie that Voller wants the dial to go back in time to 1939, assassinate Adolf Hitler and lead Germany to victory in World War II.
The issue with Voller as a villain isn’t the performance but rather the writing of the character. Voller is an extremely bland and forgettable villain for Indy to fight. He never really feels intimidating and the writers never give him any scenes to shine. It’s a total waste of a performance by such a talented actor as Mads Mikkelson.
What the previous Indiana Jones films had that this film doesn’t have were scenes that stuck with the audience. Yes, even “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” (2008) had many more scenes that resonated with moviegoers. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” suffers because it isn’t too different from any other generic Disney reboot/sequel.
However, one thing that I will credit the writers for is the climax of the film. Indy, Helena, Teddy (played Ethann Isidore) and Voller and the Nazis end up traveling back in time not to 1939 Nazi Germany but to the Siege of Syracuse in 212 B.C. There, Archimedes is constructing his dial while two armies are fighting against each other outside.
This climax caught me off guard so much that I must give credit where credit is due. The writers did take a chance on something that may or may not work for certain watchers. It’s by far the most ingenious and risky idea in the whole movie.
One other thing that needs to be addressed is how the film handles the relationship between Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood (played by Karen Allen). It is explained in the film that Indy and Marion decided to divorce after the death of their son created turmoil in their marriage.
What doesn’t work with this decision is that at the end of the movie, Indy and Marion reunite and romantically reconcile with each other. Why doesn’t this fit well? It's because we've already had Indy and Marion split before and have a happy ending in “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.”
The decision to divorce Indy and Marion after they had gotten married to just reunify them in this movie is sloppy screenwriting and mirrors most of the film.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is neither a bad film nor a good film either. It has its ups and downs which makes it hard to recommend to both lifelong fans of Indiana Jones and regular film viewers. If you are interested in seeing it, then go watch it. If you are not interested in seeing it, then you don’t have to watch it. Either way isn’t a bad resolution.
Rating: 2.5/5

,Indy 5's box office haul a disaster for Disney's Bob Iger,Dial of Destiny could end up with just half the receipts its panned predecessor earned 15 years ago and rival John Carter as Disney's biggest bomb.,"Lucasfilm’s fifth Indiana Jones installment is shaping up to be a disaster of epic proportions for parent company Disney and its veteran CEO, Bob Iger.
Released on June 30, Dial of Destiny earned a disappointing $60 million in its opening weekend in the domestic theaters, and interest dropped off sharply ever since. Just one week later, it surrendered the top spot at the box office, despite being one of the most expensive movies ever made, and now it has sunk to a distant fourth in the table.
The new entry could no longer rely on the goodwill built up by the first three films after the critical disappointment of its predecessor, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Poor reviews and dreadful word of mouth look to now sink Lucasfilm’s first theatrical release since 2019.
Its $302 million global take has only matched roughly the reported costs of its production budget, which suffered from expensive reshoots after test screenings indicated audiences were less than thrilled with the initial ending.
Marketing and promotion are expected to have added easily another $100 million to that bill and Disney still has to pay the theaters their share of the receipts.
“It looks certain to fall short of the global total for 2008’s Crystal Skull: $786.6 million,” wrote Box Office Pro on Sunday.
The situation is far more dire, according to The Hollywood Handle. Dial Of Destiny is not expected to even cross the $400 million mark in global box office receipts—half of what the fourth installment made 15 years ago when a dollar went a lot further than today.
This seems a safe bet given the stiff competition it now faces in the form of spy thriller Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning, Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s biopic Oppenheimer. In reality, the Indy sequel needed to haul in around $800 million just to break even.
Should the grim predictions prove true, the Lucasfilm production could potentially rival John Carter as the Mouse House’s worst-ever live-action commercial bomb and call into question the future of studio boss Kathleen Kennedy, a former Fortune Most Powerful Woman.
Iger has made it clear financial responsibility now goes hand in hand with creative decision-makers.
But it may have consequences for Disney, as well. The share price has been trading near nine-year lows when excluding the 2020 pandemic dip, and speculation continues over whether Iger may be forced to sell the company to Apple.
Disney and Lucasfilm did not respond to a request from Fortune for comment.
Hulu cash call
Iger, who had his original two-year boomerang CEO contract extended last week by two more, can ill afford any box office flops.
He’ll need billions in cash next year to complete the buyout of Comcast’s minority stake in streaming platform Hulu.
The problem is that Disney’s lineup this year, with the possible exception of Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume Three, has so far been middling at best.
Commercial disappointments include Marvel’s Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania, the live-action remake of its animated classic The Little Mermaid, Pixar’s Elemental and now Dial of Destiny.
The upcoming slate looks little better: November’s The Marvels has little positive buzz going for it, especially after a recent string of superhero movies failing to make a profit, including Warner Bros. Discovery’s The Flash.
To drum up cash for Hulu, Iger is now exploring the potential sale of some of his linear networks—whether free-to-air or cable. The Disney CEO has said that the business model that has historically underpinned their distribution of content is ‘definitely broken’ thanks to direct-to-consumer streaming.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8xOS9kaXNuZXktaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1kaWFsLWRlc3RpbnktYm94LW9mZmljZS1ib21iLWx1Y2FzZmlsbS_SAV9odHRwczovL2ZvcnR1bmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTkvZGlzbmV5LWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtZGlhbC1kZXN0aW55LWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYm9tYi1sdWNhc2ZpbG0vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-08 16:48:05+00:00,‘Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny’ To Ring Up Around $60M Opening: Here’s Why – Early Box Office Outlook,"In the wake of world premiering in Cannes to lackluster film reviews at 50% Rotten, Disney/Lucasfilm's Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is currently looking at a $60M+ domestic opening.","In the wake of world premiering in Cannes to lackluster film reviews at 50% Rotten, Disney/Lucasfilm‘s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is currently looking at a $60M+ domestic opening.
The movie opens on June 30 heading into what is conceivably a five-day play period given that Independence Day falls on a Tuesday.
Dial of Destiny‘s 3-day is down from the $100.1M 3-day of the last movie, 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull — and this latest sequel reps the finale for the entire franchise. Crystal Skull opened on a Thursday over a Memorial Day weekend earning in total over five days, $151.9M. Logan filmmaker James Mangold took over helming the finale from franchise architect Steven Spielberg. Currently, Dial of Destiny is tracking significantly with older guys over younger, which has many comping he pic to the Daniel Craig 007 finale, No Time to Die ($55.2M) and 2018’s Mission: Impossible – Fallout ($61.2M).
Some are saying a $70M start for Dial of Destiny — that’s quite a stretch. Realize that Lionsgate’s John Wick: Chapter 4 opened to $73.8M with double the tracking metrics that Dial of Destiny is showing here.
Disney will need to pick up the slack in the coming weeks in their marketing to get more interest from younger guys, their distraction now being Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse in theaters and the upcoming Warner Bros DC The Flash on June 16. However, that hard word of mouth out of Cannes is quite the hurdle. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which wasn’t beloved by many, settled at 77% certified fresh and a B CinemaScore versus the previous 1989 installment, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which earned 84% certified fresh from critics and a solid A CinemaScore.
With Dial of Destiny at a $60M 3-day, that’s easily the second-best start for the Indiana Jones franchise. In the box office era, Last Crusade opened to $29.3M 3-day ($46.9M over extended Memorial Day weekend) at 2,327 theaters. 1984’s Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom bowed to $25.3M 3-day ($42.2M extended Memorial Day weekend) at 1,687 theaters. 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark‘s gross trajectory harkens back to the way blockbusters were made over a year: The pic opened to $8.3M at 1,078 theaters and by January 1982 earned $179.6M with an initial cume of $212.2M, lifetime gross of $248.1M.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1hbmQtdGhlLWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLXByb2plY3Rpb24tMTIzNTQxMjAxMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-08 12:01:00-04:00,Dial of Destiny gave me everything I wanted from Indiana Jones,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the last adventure for Harrison Ford in the title role, checks all the boxes that made the series great over the past 42 years.","More than 40 years after its release, Raiders of the Lost Ark is still my No. 1 argument for seeing a movie in a movie theater. It’s the best example of bona fide Hollywood movie magic, the kind that becomes a lifelong memory. I saw Raiders in its first week of release back in 1981, when I was 7 years old. Raiders, for me, doesn’t begin with Indiana Jones running away from a rolling boulder, or grabbing a seaplane’s pontoon under a hail of arrows and blowgun darts. It begins with my dad cooking round steak in an electric skillet on a late-spring Saturday evening, with Siskel and Ebert on PBS at 6:30, raving about this revival of amazing high adventure inspired by 1950s serials.
Dad clapped his hands and told me and my brother, “Hot damn! Boys, we are gonna go see that.” Mom dressed us in church clothes to see Raiders and then go to a nice dinner in a bigger city. We wore the same jackets and ties to Sunday school the next day. (And after Raiders’ Old Testament finale, I sat ramrod straight when the church lady read us the story of Job, the only dude to survive being called out by God.)
The real catalyst of an Indiana Jones movie has always been what viewers bring to the theater before the opening credits roll. So I was one of the fans walking into Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny shouldering some preemptive resentment about how the franchise was exploiting my childhood nostalgia by bringing Indy back to the screen one more time. But when Dial’s credits rolled, I had only a nonplussed, middle-distance stare as my best friend asked what I thought.
“That was... actually good?” I finally said.
“Yeah... I think it was,” he replied.
With the understanding that nothing overcomes the nostalgia of the first time you watched a treasured movie hero do their thing, I can accept that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny still checks all the boxes on my menu of demands for a proper Indy movie.
It sure didn’t sound like it would, heading into its premiere weekend. Reviews, particularly after the film debuted at Cannes, bagged on it for leaning too hard into cameos and callbacks. Redditors and YouTubers, knives drawn as always for any culture-war topic, complained that Harrison Ford portrayed a sad, broken man, and that new character Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) was a detestable sociopath whose only point was to emasculate Jones.
I strongly disagree on both points. Waller-Bridge’s character may not be admirable, but crucially, she returns the series to where it began: As archaeologists, she and Indy are technically grave robbers of questionable methodology. Director James Mangold and writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and David Koepp kept this arc from any problematic colonialism/cultural-theft angle by putting the MacGuffins in Nazi hands and in an ancient Greek tomb. Thus we get the same cynical, borderline antiheroic fortune-and-glory motivation that begins Raiders, without the kind of sociological squeamishness that provokes online duels. Points to Mangold and his team.
That’s important, because even action heroes have to take some kind of emotional journey if their characters are going to be worth a damn. The journey Indiana Jones must make in every movie is one from nonbeliever to believer. That’s what earns the happy ending as John Williams’ classic Raiders march builds up and soars.
In Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indy is convinced of the Ark of the Covenant’s existence and authenticity, but only as an academic or historical matter. “It’s a radio for speaking to God!” Belloq pleads in the Cairo bar. “You want to talk to God? Let’s go see him together, I’ve got nothing better to do,” Jones snarls, almost blasphemously. It takes the Angel of Death, reminding the Nazis that God shall not be mocked, to prove the Ark’s supernatural qualities to him.
In Temple of Doom, chronologically a prequel, Indy is skeptical that a lingam stone, stolen from a desiccated Indian village along with its children, actually has any mystical properties to protect the people or keep their farmland fertile. Much less could it actually be one of the five Sankara stones (a myth invented for this movie). Fast-forward to the scene at the collapsed bridge, where Indy furiously chants Sanskrit and the stones burst into flame, dooming Mola Ram. At the end, Jones warmly agrees with a village elder about his stone’s importance: “Yes, I understand its power now.”
The Last Crusade is another mission to stop Hitler, first and foremost. Indy has spent most of his life resenting his father’s pursuit of the actual Holy Grail, to the exclusion of his family. “This is an obsession, Dad; I never understood it,” he seethes. “Neither did Mom.” Then Indy makes a literal leap of faith, uses the Grail to save his father, and becomes obsessed with recovering the cup himself, before his father tells him to let it go.
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull’s fatal flaw is that both its MacGuffin and its surrounding mythology are complete science fiction. So there’s even less for the audience to either disbelieve or believe in than in Temple of Doom. Suspension of disbelief is crucial to an Indiana Jones story, but Crystal Skull goes forward with no structure to support or enable it. The movie makes a lot of other dumb narrative mistakes, but that’s its biggest shortfall: Jones’ journey from disbeliever to believer, if it even happens, is completely lost.
Which brings us back to The Dial of Destiny. The plot device here is completely different in appearance (and function) from the actual, historical Antikythera mechanism, but at least it has an anchor in reality. Neither the audience nor Indiana Jones really believes that it enables time travel, though. He considers the chunk of the mechanism only as a malefactor that drove a friend insane. In a flashback sequence, when Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) raves about “fissures in time” (which Jones sneers at), Indy fires back, “The proof is what makes it science!”
Indiana Jones gets his proof. In fact, this is the central and most meaningful conflict in any Indiana Jones story: when all is revealed, and the humanist, scientist Indy realizes just how small he is against the cosmos he’s exploring. That kind of point has to be delivered with a velvet hammer — with full impact, but a soft, subtle touch.
Here, The Dial of Destiny succeeds thanks to its remarkably restrained depiction of time travel, especially considering all the wish fulfillment Mangold could have indulged. Who knew time travel is a lot messier than just dialing up coordinates on a flux capacitor? Dial’s version of time is a single strand, with fixed loops backward and forward. Nonetheless, experiencing all this and understanding what time means so stuns Indy that he’s willing to give up the life he has in the present day to remain in ancient Sicily. After decades of seeing the impossible, he’s actually experienced the most impossible — time travel.
Once again, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny takes its hero from disbeliever to rapturous believer. When the story toes that line, regardless of what Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, or any of the other supporting characters do, Dial of Destiny sings the loudest as an honest-to-God Indiana Jones film.
I’ve read so much complaining about how Dial’s third act challenges the audience’s suspension of disbelief, as if it wasn’t challenged in lesser scenes from the first four movies. (Swimming across the open sea to stow away on a submerging U-boat? Escaping an unpiloted airplane with an inflatable raft as a parachute?) The complaints ignore a key detail that invites viewers to suspend their disbelief: This is a real object. The scientists who first studied it said it was too far ahead of its time to have been found in an ancient Roman shipwreck. Could it actually be evidence of time travel?
In either case, there’s an element of real history, and suspension of disbelief in real life, for viewers to lean on in a theatrical flight of fancy, before the film makes a grand leap into the paranormal — like every other Indiana Jones film.
Other things make Dial of Destiny rightfully an Indiana Jones movie, more than just fistfights, or Indy flashing a bullwhip, or people driving antique vehicles beyond their limit. There’s Jones’ overt vulnerability in every action sequence. There’s also the obligatory moment of moral contempt, which recenters Indy’s character, and ennobles his pursuit. In Dial of Destiny, it’s when Helena is a bit too cavalier and self-congratulatory about the escape she engineered from Jürgen Voller (Mikkelsen) and his thugs. “They just killed my friend,” Jones says, which brings the moment up short for antiquities hustler Helena and her streetwise fixer Teddy (Ethann Isidore).
For those who feel Indy is too sad, too angry, or too emasculated in Dial of Destiny, here’s a counterargument: He earns all of his emotions in this movie, thanks to some well-placed foreshadowing. My God, this is a man at the end of his career. He’s cheated death and been beaten senseless as a job description. His son died in Vietnam, destroying his marriage. “Everything hurts,” he growls to Helena as they struggle to make their way into Archimedes’ tomb. He doesn’t just mean physically.
Perhaps Dial of Destiny isn’t the best of the five Indiana Jones films; it doesn’t have to be. After all, Raiders was sui generis, which I think is Latin for “new IP,” so anything following it is going to be derivative by definition. If Dial makes any real filmmaking stumble, it may be that the visual callbacks (to Sallah, to Marion, to the scenes they shared in 1981) are so overt, its real narrative heritage seems buried by comparison.
But the DNA of the rest of the Indy movies is there, even if you have to excavate a little to find it. When I finished digging, at the end of the film, I realized that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny gave me everything I expect from an Indiana Jones movie.
And even if Dial of Destiny didn’t make me feel exactly the way I did when I was sitting in a theater with my family 42 years ago, I’m still struck by how much I’m thinking about the film now, a week after seeing it. I might even go see it again. It’s a throwback to the era in which Indiana Jones was conceived, the era when blockbuster movies and theaters were a perfect match, when my best friend and I would go back to the theater to see something two or three times, because the movie was... actually good.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIzNzg1NzcwL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LWlzLWdvb2QtZmFuLXJldmlld9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tL3BsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8yMzc4NTc3MC9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS1pcy1nb29kLWZhbi1yZXZpZXc?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-26 09:50:00+00:00,Indiana Jones and the Contractually Mandated Fifth Adventure,"The latest chapter may not be necessary, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a blast.","In 1979, when Steven Spielberg and George Lucas signed with Paramount Pictures to develop a film series based on classic Hollywood adventure serials, the deal they struck was to make five separate movies. The first, Raiders of the Lost Ark, was released in the summer of 1981 and became that year’s top-grossing movie, beating even the long-anticipated Superman II and remaining on screens in some cities for more than a year. By 1984, it was Raiders’ sequel, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, that had become the year’s most anticipated movie, banking that year’s biggest opening weekend, and the third entry in the franchise, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, became not only the highest-grossing movie of 1989 but the top-earning Indiana Jones movie yet.
Given that track record, and viewed from the perspective of our own IP-crazed times, it seems inconceivable that Spielberg and Lucas decided not to move forward immediately with a fourth Indiana Jones picture (though Lucas did go on to produce a spinoff TV series, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles). The reason: They were unable to come up with a plot device that would credibly carry the beloved archeology-prof-turned-world-adventurer through another feature-length story. Lucas’ idea, a riff on the 1950s sci-fi films that would have been contemporaneous with a middle-aged Indy, was to introduce extraterrestrial beings into the previously earthbound Raiders universe. But, according to Lucas, that notion was struck down by both Spielberg and star Harrison Ford, who on hearing the pitch replied with a gruffness that’s easy to picture: “No way am I being in a Steve Spielberg movie like that.” (Steve’s own response was so ambivalent as to recall Hamlet: “I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know.”)

Almost 20 years would pass before Ford would once again don the fedora, in a Spielberg movie exactly like that. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, released in the summer of 2008 to mostly thuddingly bad reviews, featured a cursed glass knick-knack from outer space, an interdimensional portal housed in a Peruvian obelisk, and a famously nuclear-blast-proof refrigerator. Some critics, me among them, were so glad to see Indy again that they forgave the fourth movie its silliness and enjoyed its small pleasures (Cate Blanchett as a Russian dominatrix-style villain! John Hurt as an antiquities savant driven insane by the titular trinket!), but very few of us walked out expecting or needing a fifth. And yet 15 years later, with Ford about to turn 81, the Paramount prophecy has been fulfilled. With the release of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the Indiana Jones series is, as originally planned, a pentalogy, even if this last chapter is the first of the five not to have been co-written by Lucas or directed by Spielberg. Instead, James Mangold (Walk the Line, Logan, Ford v. Ferrari) is at the helm—and if it isn’t cinematic sacrilege to say so, his solidly entertaining if not inspired installment feels truer to the franchise’s swashbuckling spirit than the latest Spielbergian contribution.

For the length of the movie’s opening sequence, an elaborately staged chase in the series’ grand first-act tradition, you might think Mangold had cutting-room-floor footage from the Raiders archive, given the smooth surface of Indy’s digitally de-aged face and the agility of his footwork as he escapes from a pack of Nazis on a moving train. With the war nearing its end, the Germans, under the command of true believer Jürgen Voller (a deliciously punchable Mads Mikkelsen), are trying to smuggle a trainload of pilfered treasure out of the country. Indy finds his friend and expedition partner, mild-mannered British archeologist Basil Shaw (Toby Jones), tied to a chair in the train car that doubles as Voller’s interrogation chamber. The Nazis, Shaw explains, have gotten their hands on the Antikythera, a powerful ancient artifact supposed to have been invented by the Greek mathematician Archimedes with the aim of finding “fissures in time.” (This priceless doodad, the world’s oldest known analog computer, is real, though it is only known to predict such celestial events as eclipses, not time warps.)

After one more spectacular chase atop the racing train, Indy and Shaw escape with their lives as the audience encounters a time fissure of our own. Fast-forward 25 years to the summer of 1969: All of America is going wild over humankind’s first trip to the moon. Well, all but for the now gray-haired and craggy-faced Professor Jones, who’s grouchily sleeping off one too many slugs of whiskey in his lonely Manhattan apartment. His wife, Marion (Karen Allen, appearing only briefly), has just filed for divorce, for reasons that will be revealed later on; his job teaching archeology no longer seems to inspire either him or his glazed-eyed students.

Indy’s glum routine is thrown off by the sudden appearance of his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). Helena’s father, the now-deceased Basil, lost his sanity spinning paranoid (or were they?) theories about the missing half of his precious Antikythera.
His daughter is determined to travel the world to find it—a plan that would suit the motives of either a loyal daughter or a mercenary black-market antiques dealer. Meanwhile, Voller, a fascist so committed that he at one point appears to badmouth Hitler for not having believed hard enough in the Thousand-Year Reich, is working undercover as a U.S. government scientist. Herr Voller seeks the mystical Greek whim-wham for an even less noble purpose: Like some contemporary political figures I could name, he longs to travel backward in time to a place where life was simpler and made more sense. You know: Germany in 1944.

The abrupt entrance of Waller-Bridge into the Raiders-verse at first generates a wave of cognitive dissonance: What are Fleabag and Indy doing in New York in the late 1960s? But as we get to know Helena (whom Indy calls “Wombat,” an old childhood nickname), the alliance begins to make sense. She and her irascible godfather, for all their bickering as they hurtle in various hotly pursued vehicles from to Tangier to Sicily and back to New York again, are alike: two wisecracking skeptics with incurable wanderlust and a problem expressing sincere emotion. Waller-Bridge’s physical presence is both commanding and comical, her lanky frame and klutziness in the face of danger giving her an Olive Oyl–like quality. Her relationship with Indy toggles between affectionate and prickly, landing at a place of grudging mutual acceptance that, perhaps because I am basic, I found genuinely touching.

In their travels, Indy and Helena cross paths with some figures familiar from earlier chapters of the saga, like Sallah (a likeable Egyptian character who, as played by Welsh actor John Rhys-Davies, should nonetheless perhaps have stayed back in the 20th century), and others new to this episode, like Helena’s teenage sidekick Teddy (Ethann Isidore) and a Spanish boat captain (Antonio Banderas) who takes the gang on a dive to explore an ancient shipwreck. The cinematic references at play derive less from golden-era Hollywood than from previous Indiana Jones adventures: There is a callback to Indy’s fear of snakes, a clever reversal of a gag from the first movie involving a less-than-fair gunfight, and the familiar but still pleasing image of a globe traversed by a moving red line that establishes the protagonists’ location. (As the Muppets have noted, there are few more efficient modes of transportation than “traveling by map.”)

Though the action is often wittily imagined and choreographed, no one could confuse Mangold’s workmanlike direction with Spielberg’s kinetic instinct for how to place and move a camera. Still, Dial of Destiny clips along nicely: Even at 2 hours and 22 minutes, the pace seldom drags. Above all, this movie understands, respects, and loves its title character, even in a loopy late sequence that drops the bullwhip-wielding scholar into a circumstance we’ve never seen or imagined him in before. A sudden third-act swerve into the supernatural—a feature all the franchise’s movies have shared, if not quite at this level of implausibility—could easily have lost the audience’s goodwill, but by drawing on our long experience of the curmudgeonly grave-robber’s passions, beliefs, and preferences, the movie manages to serve up a twist that’s as psychologically credible as it is contrary to all known laws of physics.

Ford has spoken in proprietary terms about his four-decade-long relationship with the character of Professor Henry Walton Jones Jr.: “I’m Indiana Jones. When I’m gone, he’s gone.” Indy has been the great role of Ford’s career (sympathies to the also-memorable Han Solo) and one of the enduring movie characters of my lifetime. You might say that the last two chapters of his story, contractually intended from the start or no, were unnecessary (though Dial of Destiny certainly stands head and shoulders above The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and, depending on your taste, may surpass the second film in the series, the often cringingly xenophobic Temple of Doom). But now that Indiana Jones (though not, thankfully, the man who plays him) seems in fact to have made his last stand, I for one am grateful to have had the chance to stow away on his final adventure.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy8wNi9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLTUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LW1vdmllLXJldmlldy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Chasing Destiny: The Villains and Antagonists of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"Actors Mads Mikkelsen, Shaunette Renée Wilson, and Boyd Holbrook talk about joining Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, in theaters now.","But there’s only one Indy. So, when it came time to sign on for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Mikkelsen got to join his childhood hero for one last adventure, playing the villain — the Nazi Dr. Jürgen Voller, a mathematician for the United States government credited with helping to put astronauts on the moon. “I mean, since I can’t be Indy, I can be the baddie,” he says. “And it’s been a wonderful journey to see this home.”
On Mikkelsen’s first day on set, he arrived for a costume fitting and a script read, but ended up meeting the man with the hat. “I went outside my trailer and Harrison [Ford] was outside. That was the first time I met him.” Ford was in full costume, and Mikkelsen says he felt like a kid again, recognizing not the esteemed actor and co-star but the hero he loved. “It wasn’t Harrison, it was Indiana Jones. He had the hat, the whip, the jacket. [It was] surreal. Watching him work, it’s just been, you know, an experience of my life….Because, all of a sudden, I’m part of it.”
Mikkelsen wasn’t alone. In Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, he’s joined by Agent Mason, a by-the-book special agent played by Shaunette Renée Wilson, and Klaber, Voller’s enforcer played by Boyd Holbrook, an unlikely team-up that led to plenty of inter-personal conflict on screen. But behind the scenes and on a recent press day, the three actors were constantly making each other laugh as they recounted their path to join the franchise.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1Y2FzZmlsbS5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWRzLW1pa2tlbHNlbi1hbmQtY2FzdC1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWludGVydmlldy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-27 14:00:00+00:00,"James Mangold Believes in Indiana Jones, but His Real Hero Is Steven Spielberg","The ""Logan"" director took on Indiana Jones because his real hero is Steven Spielberg.","The walls of James Mangold‘s spacious office on the Fox lot are covered with posters, many of which are for his own films: “Ford v. Ferrari,” “3:10 to Yuma,” “Walk the Line,” “Cop Land,” and “Logan.” It’s a reminder that this week’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is not the first time he’s steered a vintage franchise into port.
“Logan” tracked a similar arc, as an aging Wolverine makes peace with his daughter while facing his own mortality. It gave Mangold confidence that dealing with Indiana Jones’ seniority was not a problem. “In both cases,” he said, slouching on a sofa in his office, “you’re faced with a hero in a twilight of their life having a reckoning with who and what they are.”
There are reasons, many of which are good, why an established filmmaker should avoid a high-profile sequel. Sky-high expectations; inevitable comparisons to master director Steven Spielberg; multiple power players in the kitchen. It took Mangold some time before he agreed to take on the fourth and final Indiana Jones sequel, the first not directed by Steven Spielberg or written by producer George Lucas. In 2019, Mangold received separate (and coordinated) pitches from producers Kathleen Kennedy and Spielberg, and from star Harrison Ford.
“That was very disarming,” he said.
Mangold knew Kennedy and Ford, and had a superficial relationship with Spielberg, whom he admired and felt kinship as a fellow cinephile. “We share a healthy reluctance to adapt to a new, more aggressive style of filmmaking,” said Mangold.

Spielberg was building sets in pre-production, but Mangold read the script and felt he needed more time to bring the project into focus. “There were some good ideas in it,” said Mangold. “But the biggest reason to say ‘no’ was the date. I would be jumping on a moving train.”
So the director requested a delay. The producers came back with six months. “That’s not enough,” he said. “The script doesn’t show me that there’s a reason to make this movie.”
Mangold moved to the pursuit of his Bob Dylan ’60s folk-scene film “A Complete Unknown” starring Timothée Chalamet, until the pandemic shut that down. Then Kennedy made him an offer he couldn’t refuse: a year to figure out “Dial of Destiny.”
He also had a generous studio budget (hefty development charges, plus extra pandemic costs: $295 million. “They met my terms,” said Mangold. “I had to screw my head on to the idea that I was essentially a pinch hitter for Babe Ruth. I had to understand my job was to move the batters, the men on base, and to play the game as well as I could, but not to try to rethink the whole thing. I didn’t feel like I had to play out some sort of rejection of his aesthetic. I’m a profound admirer.”
Mads Mikkelsen, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and Harrison Ford in “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” Lucasfilm Ltd.
Mangold said he wanted to work with this “Mount Rushmore of historically important film figures. I had admired all these cool potential collaborators all my life. And despite warning signs of this kind of a movie being a bear to manage and to launch, and expectations would run in all sorts of directions, and not all of them could ever be met, the thing that was most seductive was the personal opportunity to work with Harrison, Steven, Kathy, George, and John Williams. It was impossible to say ‘no’ to what was essentially the personal opportunity of a lifetime because you don’t ever get close to people unless you do something together.”
Mangold talked to the creative team about facing Ford’s age. “You can’t make this one of those movies where the leading man is pretending he’s 40,” he said. “But it’s also a chance to figure out what the movie is about. Why can’t it be about, in some sense, what it is to be a hero in such different times, as well as in a body that’s getting older, and in a life that has both its triumphs and its regrets?”
Character is the driving force for Mangold’s movies, including Indiana Jones. “From the moment George first conceived of this character, it was built on so many wonderful character contradictions,” he said. “The bookish, nerdish character who was also an adventurer, almost like a Superman/Clark Kent relationship in his life, and he’s such an avid historian and secularist who believes in science, and is yet repeatedly confronted with miracles.”

Mangold and his “Ford v. Ferrari” screenwriters Jez and John-Henry Butterworth spent six to eight months hammering out a new script. “It needed to be entertaining, fast-moving, and have action,” said Mangold. “It needed to be a family film that introduced a wide array of charming and different eccentric characters, all the things that typify an Indiana Jones film.”
But first, they had to confront the “Crystal Skull” problem. “I had to make something that was going to have a dialogue with a contemporary audience,” Mangold said. “I thought the reason ‘Crystal Skull’ had a rougher ride than the previous three movies was a challenge that I was faced with as well.”
“When the first three movies were made, they all took place in the ’30s or ’40s, they all existed in harmony with their setting,” he continued. “You had a movie that was shot in Technicolor noir, high shadow, deep focus, blocking, and style. You have John Williams doing [composer Erich Wolfgang] Korngold. You have Harrison Ford in his fedora, channeling ‘The Treasure of the Sierra Madre’ and 19 other things all at once. You have George and Steven who are in love with Golden Age filmmaking and you have this tremendous unity of style.”
“Crystal Skull” disrupted all that when it jumped to the mid-’50s, Mangold said. “It was not just that Harrison’s older, but that the movie had now entered a period of modernism. The world was no longer a world of black-and-white villains. The adversaries were going to be inevitably more shaded with gray as we had entered a period of realpolitik and changing values. This made it more challenging if you look like some guy with a bow tie walking around. You have to make a movie about the idea of the character being a little out of time.”
The writers decided to run with the idea of starting the movie in 1944, at the height of Indiana Jones’ powers. “I thought there would be a way to carry the audience through Harrison’s present-day age by greeting them first with an energetic homage to the previous films,” said Mangold. “You confront the audience with a young Indy in full flower and full action, and then make a sharp turn. Take everything away and let the audience confront the difference between now and then in a brazen way. That was the cut I was most excited about for the movie.”

The 1944 Indy had to be digitally de-aged by VFX. Mangold had more to work with than most: There’s plenty of footage of Ford as Indy at different ages and the actor stayed exactly the same size today as he was at age 38. (They had to make do with Ford’s 79-year-old voice.) “Because this is a wrap that goes around the actor, it means that there’s no distortion,” said Mangold, “because their shape hasn’t changed.”
Williams was a huge help to Mangold as he sought the right tone. “[I told Williams], ‘John, in the first reel you’re just letting the horses out of the barn, you do what you do, and let it rip. And then on this cut to 1969, we suddenly shift gears. And I’m not sure when we hear BUM BA BUM BUM again. You’re then doing the score to a ’70s movie.'” (Williams said, “I can do that.”)

“The flow of the movie was falling off this cliff into Indy’s current reality,” said Mangold. “And then as he begins to gather himself, steel himself, and heads onto the road. By the time he and Phoebe [Waller-Bridge] are in full mode racing around Morocco with Mads Mikkelsen, the music found itself back and by the time they get out at sea, in Greece, it’s full-on an Indiana Jones movie with an old Indy.”
Writing Indy’s British goddaughter, con-artist Helen Shaw, was another challenge. The character was inspired by another “comedic yet diabolical” con artist, Barbara Stanwyck in “The Lady Eve,” and Mangold eventually convinced the “Fleabag” auteur to play the role that was tailored for her.
“There was no one else I could possibly imagine who would be more fresh, bring more of a bag of challenges to Harrison as an actor,” he said. “There are actors who are really good on skis, cutting this way and that and yet holding you to the core of their character. You sense about her immediately that there’s so much intelligence and capability in this woman that she could cut the skis.”
Spielberg checked in every week or two with notes on pages and dailies, which Mangold described as “extremely liberating and instructive.”
Said Mangold, “Every shot has a purpose in Steven’s work. A methodology has evolved to just shoot the shit out of it from every direction and figure it out later [and] that basic difference is a big deal in terms of how the process works. Single-camera filmmakers who are building sequences out of shots with a purpose has gotten quite rare. It’s all built on a powerful connection to the movies he grew up with. You see the roots in classical Hollywood filmmaking and you see this effort to keep that dialogue and that vernacular alive. That’s something I’m connected to.”

Next up: Mangold is back in prep for “A Complete Unknown.” Chalamet and the cast are in the studio recording and readying for a fall shoot, assuming the unions have settled by then.
Being part of the Lucasfilm family has yielded a possible “Star Wars” prequel, which Mangold was in the process of mapping out when the WGA strike hit. The movie is set 25,000 years before the other films, at the moment when The Force is discovered. “I pitched to Kathy a religious epic, a Ten Commandments of where this came from, and how it was found, and those who discovered it and how they reacted to it. And the miracle of it,” he said.
Another script, still to be written, is an adaptation of the DC Comic “Swamp Thing,” which Mangold pitched to James Gunn and Peter Safran. “It’s a Gothic horror film about this character,” he said. “It’s a great comic book, but it is also a really interesting character predicament in which this creature is trying to figure out what happened to him. And who did this. It’s kind of a vengeful Frankenstein story. This person had been set up, and somehow poisoned, and turned into this thing in which he had lost all that he had loved, including his own humanity. I find it a resonant, modern theme.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvaW50ZXJ2aWV3cy9qYW1lcy1tYW5nb2xkLWludGVydmlldy1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LTEyMzQ4Nzg2MTQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-02 14:00:40+00:00,"Long Range Box Office Forecast: INDIANA JONES AND THE DIAL OF DESTINY and RUBY GILLMAN, TEENAGE KRAKEN","After a fifteen-year wait by fans, Harrison Ford returns on June 30 for the final performance as one of his most iconic and beloved characters.","Photo Credits: Disney, Lucasfilm, & Phedon Papamichael (""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"")
Fifteen years after its last installment, the Indiana Jones franchise returns to theaters on June 30 with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Sharing a release date with the film is Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, the latest from animation studio DreamWorks. Early analysis and forecasts for those two films, as well as the latest forecasting updates on June’s releases, are below.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny
Disney / Lucasfilm
June 30, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $81M-$111M
Domestic Total Range: $225M-$380M
PROS:
The prospect of a new chapter in the Indiana Jones saga has ignited fan excitement in the years since Lucasfilm announced they’d pursue the film; Harrison Ford returning to one of his most iconic roles is a big plus, as is the presence of director James Mangold (Ford v Ferrari, Logan) behind the camera.
Social media chatter has been mostly positive throughout the movie’s long production history.
A wave of nostalgia helped Top Gun: Maverick surpass $126M over the first three days of its Memorial Day weekend opening last year; if Dial of Destiny manages to appeal to adult audiences, it could get a similar bump.
If those adult audiences show up with families in tow, as happened with Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in 2008, Dial of Destiny could end up more back-loaded than the typical franchise film.
The fourth of July comes the Tuesday following Dial‘s release—meaning Disney could, essentially, be viewing the Friday-Tuesday window as a five-day opening weekend.
Early pre-sales are respectable when given proper context, i.e. the glut of male- and fan-driven films opening before Dial of Destiny hits theaters in June. The film is currently pacing ahead of John Wick: Chapter 4 and Fast X.
CONS:
A monkey on Dial of Destiny‘s back is the mixed reputation of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the only other Indiana Jones film to come out this century. It’s no secret that Kingdom divided Indiana Jones fans upon its release in 2008, becoming the target of numerous memes and drawing comparisons to the Star Wars prequels.
Early critics’ reviews from the film’s Cannes Film Festival premiere have been mixed; the film currently stands at 49% approval on Rotten Tomatoes.
A mixed critical reception doesn’t always mean family audiences will stay at home—see The Super Mario Bros. Movie—but if families do stay away from Dial of Destiny, Indy’s final adventure could prove more front-loaded than Kingdom.
A gauntlet of summer competition lies ahead of Dial of Destiny, with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning: Part One, Barbie, and Oppenheimer, among others, coming to cinemas in July.
Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken
Universal / DreamWorks Animation
June 30, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $13M-$18M
Domestic Total Range: $38M-$66M
PROS:
The female-leaning animated comedy/adventure could serve as a solid counter-programmer against the more male-focused Dial of Destiny.
Ruby Gillman opens in the third weekend of release for Elemental, the latest from Pixar. That film is currently generating mixed critics’ reviews, which could help Ruby Gillman‘s chances as a potential sleeper hit.
CONS:
Though family audiences have definitely returned to theaters—see the success of The Bad Guys, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie—DreamWorks’ original animated films are challenging to forecast in an era when Illumination has taken over as the dominant brand and films like Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse offer cutting-edge animation that appeals strongly to today’s younger audiences.
The aforementioned Across the Spider-Verse, if it enjoys good word of mouth like its 2018 predecessor, could still be drawing in family audiences a month after its June 2 release.

,James Mangold on final Indiana Jones hat shot in 'Dial of Destiny','Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' director James Mangold explains the meaning behind that final shot of Indy's beloved fedora.,"Warning: This article contains spoilers for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
Harrison Ford has been adamant — including in EW's own cover story — that he's saying goodbye to Indiana Jones with the fifth film in the franchise, Dial of Destiny. Fans might be surprised, then, to learn that the film ends with a shot of his hand plucking Indy's beloved fedora off of a clothesline.
So, with Hollywood's penchant for remakes, reboots, and sequels, are we meant to read more into that final shot? According to the film's director, James Mangold, the scene is nothing more than a tip of the proverbial hat to the fact that, though we as an audience may not accompany Ford's Indy on any more adventures, the character himself is never ""giving up.""
""I don't think he'll ever stop digging,"" Mangold explains to EW. ""And when he takes the hat off the clothesline, I think it's because, first of all, you shouldn't put hats on clotheslines. And second of all, no, I don't think he's done. I think that an ending doesn't mean that the characters never move again in their lives. It just means that you feel that you've entered a state of grace with their story.""

Mangold even has some thoughts about where the daring archaeologist goes from here.
""I think he'll wake up tomorrow and want to do something. But whether he's going into battling Nazis through time portals again, I don't think so,"" he says. ""But I could really imagine him and Marion going on a road trip to some Inca dig or to some dig in Montana or North Dakota and renting a cabin. And I could see him really enjoying his life as a retired archeologist.""
These things are easy to imagine, the helmer says, because ""Indy and Harrison are so close together, and Harrison will never retire, and I don't think Indy will [either].""
He clarifies, ""He retires as a teacher [in Dial of Destiny], but I don't think he will retire from being an obsessive learner, thinker about the past and the future, and science and mankind. I think that the second he stops thinking about that, I think it's game over.""
Dial of Destiny — which also stars Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, John Rhys-Davies, Toby Jones, Boyd Holbrook, Shaunette Renée Wilson, and more — is now playing in theaters. For more on the film and Ford's last hurrah as the whip-cracking archaeologist, read EW's cover story.

2023-05-31 14:20:20+00:00,Harrison Ford Told ‘Indiana Jones 5’ Stunt Guys to ‘Leave Me the F— Alone’ While on Horseback: ‘I’m an Old Man’ and ‘Want to Look Like It’,"Harrison Ford wanted Indiana Jones to look and feel like an old man in ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.""","For Harrison Ford, the allure of reprising Indiana Jones for a fifth time in the upcoming “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” was all about time. Ford will celebrate his 81st birthday in July, just a few weeks after “Dial of Destiny” opens in theaters, which is not the typical age of your 2023 Hollywood action hero. That was a selling point for Ford, who told Esquire magazine that he ensured Indiana Jones looked and felt like an old man in “Dial of Destiny.”
“I wanted an ambitious movie to be the last one,” Ford said about reprising Indiana Jones. “And I don’t mean that we didn’t make ambitious movies before — they were ambitious in many different ways. But not necessarily as ambitious with the character as I wanted the last one to be.”
One of the action set pieces in “Dial of Destiny” finds Indiana Jones riding a horse through the streets of New York City during the 1969 ticker-tape parade to celebrate the moon landing. As he was finishing up filming the scene, Ford felt the hands of three stunt workers spotting him from the ground as he was on horseback.
“I thought, ‘What the fuck?’ Like I was being attacked by gropers. I look down and there’s three stunt guys there making sure I didn’t fall off the stirrup,” Ford recalled. “They said, ‘Oh, we were just afraid because we thought, you know, and bah bah bah bah.’ And I said, ‘Leave me the fuck alone…Leave me alone, I’m an old man getting off a horse and I want it to look like that!”’
For similar reasons, Ford made the decision to go shirtless during one of the early scenes “Dial of Destiny.” He said, “Waking up in my underwear with the empty glass in my hand was my idea.”
Ford’s age did show itself at times during the making of “Dial of Destiny,” such as when he pulled the subscapularis muscle off his right shoulder during a fight scene with co-star Mads Mikkelsen. The film’s production shut down for two weeks. When it resumed, Ford had to sit out an additional six weeks.
“Yeah, well, I’m also known for shutting movies down because I get hurt, which is not something you want to be known for,” Ford said. “But hey, shit happens.”
At nearly 81 years old, Ford isn’t slowing down. He’s been spending time in Atlanta filming “Captain America: New World Order,” his first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Is it fun making a Marvel movie? “Uh,” he said. “Yeah. I mean, there are tough days and easy days and fun days and all kinds of days. It’s a tough schedule and, yeah, it’s fun. But it’s not a walk in the park. It’s not fun fun. It’s work.”

2023-07-20 20:44:13+00:00,Lucasfilm Sued in Trademark Dispute Over Backpack in ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’,Lucasfilm has been roped into a legal battle between rival clothing companies over the backpack Indiana Jones wore.,"Lucasfilm has been roped into a legal battle between rival clothing companies over the backpack Indiana Jones wore in the latest installment to the franchise.
In a suit filed on Wednesday in California federal court, Frost River accused Lucasfilm of using its products in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny without permission and then passing off its signature backpacks as a competitor’s product in a deceptive marketing campaign.
“This lawsuit concerns two corporate juggernauts, Filson and Lucasfilm, exploiting the hard work and intellectual property of Frost River, a small American company,” states the complaint.
In the movie, Indiana Jones wears a bag with a knapsack design featuring a drawstring-topped main compartment with a flap cover. Frost River says Lucasfilm never obtained its permission to use its product. Instead, the studio removed identifying marks on the bag in violation of a federal trademark law.
As part of its marketing for the movie, Lucasfilm authorized Filson to run a co-branded campaign to promote the movie and the clothing company’s products, according to the suit. “Lucasfilm and Filson produced a 60 second commercial prominently featuring video clips from the Indiana Jones 5 film intertwined with video clips of actors using Filson’s own products,” writes Devin McRae, a lawyer for Frost River, in the complaint. “Shockingly, one of the intertwined video clips was one from Indiana Jones 5 featuring Frost River’s Geologist Pack.”
Frost River says the marketing is intended to trick consumers into believing that the bags seen in the movie and advertisements are sold by Filson.
The complaint claims a violation of the Lanham Act, a federal trademark law.
Lucasfilm and Filson didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy9sdWNhc2ZpbG0tc3VlZC1iYWNrcGFjay1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LTEyMzU1NDA2Nzcv0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2x1Y2FzZmlsbS1zdWVkLWJhY2twYWNrLWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnktMTIzNTU0MDY3Ny9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-01 15:00:00+00:00,Harrison Ford Is Too Old for This Shit,‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ proves that the 80-year-old film icon has gotten too old for this shit — and there’s nothing wrong with that!,"About an hour into Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the world’s most active archeologist, a little less active of late, is reunited with a friendly face from his past. Dr. Jones, played by Harrison Ford in what he insists will be his final turn in the fedora, is on the run and headed overseas in search of a rare, allegedly supernatural artifact. You know, typical Indiana Jones shit. Can the professor count on a one-time partner in temple-plundering? Are the Raiders boys back together? Afraid not. That old friend is now too old for such mischief; at this late stage in life, he’d rather leave the heroics to the kids. The reunion is short-lived, a quick and bittersweet hit of nostalgia.
Indy, of course, soldiers on. The Nazis are back, you see — a predicament that should sound familiar to any fan of this franchise, not to mention anyone current on the state of American politics. Jones has to saddle up again, aching joints be damned, to take them down. But should he? Watching Ford, now officially an octogenarian, amble back into some semblance of action, you have to wonder if that old friend had the right idea. Let someone else save the world! Indy needs a drink. Lord knows he’s earned one.
Even those with an undying affection for Steven Spielberg’s whip-cracking academic, star of four previous exercises in globe-trotting precarity, might grant that this one last adventure could be one adventure too many. Ford was already out of his running-and-jumping prime in the last sequel, 2008’s widely maligned Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Fifteen years later, director James Mangold, taking over for Spielberg, has no choice but to build the whole movie around an acknowledgement that Indiana Jones is, to paraphrase another Eighties action hero, too old for this shit.
Indy is the last iconic role left for Ford to reprise during this chapter of his career. (At least if one assumes that he won’t be going on the lam as an elderly Dr. Richard Kimble or giving us a grizzled Jack Ryan.) His legacy tour included previous stops in a galaxy far, far away and the cyberpunk future. There was something rather affecting about his performances in those movies. Maybe it was the surprise of seeing the star, often so crotchety in public persona (he’s been playing the part of a grumpy old man since he was a grumpy young man), warmly pass the torch. Ford brought a relaxed gravitas to The Force Awakens and Blade Runner 2049, playing mentor to a younger generation of heroes — which may be why Dial of Destiny follows suit, pairing him with Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s wisecracking goddaughter. Editor’s picks
So why was it poignant to see the actor suit up again for those late sequels and a little sadder somehow to see him do the same here? It could be that Ford, at 80, is simply pushing the limits of his credibility as an action hero in a way he wasn’t five or seven years ago. (No shame there; it happens to every Hollywood cowboy eventually.) But the difference arguably has more to do with the nature of Indiana Jones as a character. For all their occasional fisticuffs and gun fights, neither Han Solo nor Rick Deckard are quite as deeply defined by pure physical activity — the veritable Olympics of environmental obstacles Indy made a career out of vaulting.
To even call Jones a character, in the traditional sense, is arguably misleading. Spielberg and George Lucas conceived of him more as a body in perpetual motion — the adventure-serial spirit incarnate, the human equivalent of a cliffhanger. So much of the fun of the Indiana Jones movies, so much of their excitement and humor, lies in seeing Jones constantly dumped out of the frying pan and into the fire. His ideals are wrapped up in the sheer lengths he’s willing to go to realize them: the boulder he’ll outrun, the punches he’ll lean into, the speeding truck he’ll scramble over and under.

Ford simply can’t credibly perform those kinds of feats anymore, even with stunt doubles on hand to fortify the illusion. It would be strange if he could at his age! For better or worse, Dial of Destiny embraces this reality instead of trying to disguise it. The adventure commences with a shot of the professor shirtless in his apartment — a stark, vanity-free acknowledgement of how Ford’s physique has changed over the years. Jones, when we catch up with him in the late 1960s, is on the cusp of retirement from academia, a subplot that emphasizes the valedictory nature of the larger story. Ford, during the press cycle, underscored that part of the reason he agreed to do Dial was that it promised to not only accept his age but also make it central to the dramatic arc of the movie and its vision of Jones. Should we have expected anything less than an Old Man Indy movie from the director of Logan?
Yet Mangold is boxed in by Ford’s normal, natural limitations as a movie star of a certain age. They necessitate a different kind of Indiana Jones vehicle, pokier and less kinetic. While Spielberg moved fluidly from set piece to set piece, defining Indy largely through action (even Crystal Skull has a rollercoaster momentum), Dial of Destiny often struggles to meet even the most generous fan’s expected quota of derring-do. One of the only sustained bursts of action, a tuk tuk pursuit through the streets of Tangier, seems blocked and shot to minimize Ford’s exertion; we’re a long way from the famed truck chase of Raiders of the Lost Ark. It’s telling that the closest Dial can come to a vintage Indy sequence is the cold open, a flashback that features Ford’s digitally deaged mug pasted, by all appearances, on the body of someone capable of moving like he could 40 years ago.

If there’s anything resonant about this creaky approximation of a classic Indiana Jones adventure, it’s the way it serves as a sobering reminder that everyone gets old. If it can happen to a towering paragon of Hollywood masculinity, to a hero of our collective dreams, it can (and will) happen to you, too. Dial of Destiny is after something much different than what the new Mission: Impossible movie will offer in a few weeks: It lays bare the diminished mobility — and by extension, the mortality — of an aging action star, rather than stubbornly defying it. It’s a summer blockbuster about how history leaves even its legends behind as they shuffle toward oblivion.
Whether anyone wants that out of an Indiana Jones movie is another question. This series once stood outside of time — a reliable source of old-fashioned entertainment, bridging the blockbuster era of the 1980s to an earlier age of propulsive spectacle. Through the enduring involvement of its star, now past the point where his age can go unaddressed, it’s become something impossibly freighted by time’s passage: a meditation on getting older. Ford brings about as much dignity as he can to a character it would have been more dignified to leave offscreen, unblemished by the harsh reality of what he can no longer do. Behind the actor’s weathered star power, you can see the image of a Hollywood machine that refuses to ever let anything go, or to let any beloved character ride permanently into the sunset.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yb2xsaW5nc3RvbmUuY29tL3R2LW1vdmllcy90di1tb3ZpZS1mZWF0dXJlcy9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LWhhcnJpc29uLWZvcmQtdG9vLW9sZC1mb3ItdGhpcy1zaGl0LTEyMzQ3Nzk4MjMv0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vdHYtbW92aWVzL3R2LW1vdmllLWZlYXR1cmVzL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnktaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC10b28tb2xkLWZvci10aGlzLXNoaXQtMTIzNDc3OTgyMy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-21 18:43:37+00:00,‘Indiana Jones 5’ Director James Mangold on ‘Pinch-Hitting’ for Spielberg and Refusing Fan Service: Franchises Have Become ‘Large-Scale Advertising’,"""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" director James Mangold also discusses taking on ""Swamp Thing"" and ""Star Wars.""","Before Indiana Jones entered director James Mangold’s life, Harrison Ford told him he was worried Indy was looking too old.
It was the fall of 2019, and Mangold had joined the team working on the film adaptation of “The Call of the Wild,” in which Ford plays a rugged frontiersman, to help with reshoots. In their downtime, Ford began confiding in Mangold about the fifth “Indiana Jones” movie, which had been bouncing around in development for the better part of three years. Steven Spielberg and screenwriter David Koepp had conceived a roughly five-minute opening sequence set during World War II, in which Ford would be digitally de-aged. Ford wasn’t sure it was a good idea.
“Harrison told me he was nervous, because he felt like if people saw him younger, when they confronted Indiana in his 70s they’d be disappointed,” Mangold says, sitting on a cream-colored couch inside his sunlit office on the Fox lot in early June.
At the time, the filmmaker had no reason to think he was auditioning to be the guy to solve Ford’s dilemma. But Mangold impressed the actor. “He seemed to have a keen perception of what was required,” Ford says. “I just found it very easy and comfortable to work with him.” So much so that when Spielberg decided later that year that it was time to bequeath Indy’s signature whip and fedora to someone else, Ford recommended Mangold.
Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, who has produced every “Indy” film since serving as Spielberg’s assistant on “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” recalls, “It was pretty much immediate that Steven said, ‘Oh, he would be fantastic. Let’s do that.’”
It’s easy to understand why. Starting with his feature debut, the 1995 Sundance hit “Heavy,” Mangold has built a career steeped in the old-school Spielbergian classicism that is embedded in the DNA of the “Indiana Jones” movies. “I’ve always been a little behind the curve of what’s happening in the moment,” Mangold says. “I mean, I made a wordless film about a fat guy in a diner when everyone else was trying to emulate Quentin — when the hot thing was clove cigarettes and rock-’n’-roll soundtracks.”
For decades, that approach has served Mangold well, as he has turned out a procession of quite disparate studio features, from the psychological drama “Girl, Interrupted” and Johnny Cash biopic “Walk the Line” to the Western thriller “3:10 to Yuma” and the historical entertainment “Ford v Ferrari.” In the 2010s, he even stepped inside the Marvel sandbox and brought a brutal humanism to the comic book adaptations “The Wolverine” and “Logan,” the highest-grossing movies in his filmography.
Increasingly, though, Mangold has been feeling out of step with the franchise-building imperatives of a modern film industry fixated on sustaining an ongoing series of interconnected movies. “I am interested in making something that works from beginning to end — to curtain,” he says. “Otherwise, I’m working on the world’s most expensive television show.”
Lucasfilm Ltd.
So when Kennedy approached Mangold in late 2019 about directing the fifth and final “Indiana Jones” movie, Mangold was not an instant yes.
“Oh, he was incredibly intimidated,” Kennedy recalls with a laugh. “He was immediately excited by the potential of it, but he was very daunted by stepping into Steven’s shoes.”
Still, Mangold was captivated by what was by any measure a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, even as he was acutely aware that it came with the singular hazards inherent in taking over a franchise that has meant so much to so many for so long. “There are a million land mines,” Mangold says. “But the idea that I would get a chance to play not just in the backyard of my heroes, but with Harrison, with Steven — it was so profoundly moving to me. How many people get a chance to make a movie with these people?”
Mangold spent a year with his “Ford v Ferrari” screenwriters Jez and John-Henry Butterworth to craft the screenplay for what would become “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.” Mangold’s goal was to make a film worthy of the iconic hero and the movie star embodying him — and, perhaps, explicate his own feelings about the world passing him by. Because while the 59-year-old filmmaker’s success has brought him into the orbit of two other marquee franchises, “Swamp Thing” for DC Studios and a new “Star Wars” movie for Lucasfilm, he remains ambivalent about being seen as a franchise filmmaker at all.
As Mangold talks with me in his office, I can’t help noticing the 22 framed index cards filling the wall just above his head, each with a handwritten rule for cinematic storytelling. For example: “Self-expression (talk without action) is BORING!” And: “What is happening NOW is not as exciting as what may or may not HAPPEN NEXT.”
All of the rules were created by the late filmmaker Alexander “Sandy” Mackendrick (“Sweet Smell of Success”), who mentored Mangold as the dean of the CalArts School of Film in the early 1980s. Mackendrick had the cards hanging in his own office, and, Mangold explains, “he would point at these different rules as he was analyzing your eight-page screenplay.”
When I ask Mangold how often he’s turned to his mentor’s directives over the course of his career, he smiles wistfully. “Every day,” he says. “I’ve lived with these all my life.”

As we converse, I begin to grasp just how much these rules have provided Mangold with the intellectual scaffolding to build a story that feels at once exciting and emotionally connected. Take that WWII prologue that had so concerned Ford. Mangold thought it was a brilliant idea, because it tackled one of his biggest issues with 2008’s “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull”: That film barely acknowledges that Indy is not only older but has aged out of the 1930s and ’40s era that he’s meant to embody.
“What’s so beautiful about the best of the ‘Indiana Jones’ movies is that thematically they know what they’re about,” Mangold says. “I didn’t feel like I knew what ‘Crystal Skull’ was about. He’s living in a world that has overtaken him — a world that has found new heroes in John Glenn or Elvis Presley. No one in the film is really thinking about the past; everyone’s focused on the future.”
Mangold says he “spoke plainly” about these feelings in early discussions with Spielberg and Kennedy about what he’d want to do with “Indy 5,” which he felt was at risk of making many of the same mistakes as “Crystal Skull.” The MacGuffin at the center of the early script, for example, “was just another relic with power, similar to the relics we had seen,” with no clear connection to Indy or what he was going through. So he changed it to the Antikythera, an ancient mechanical device invented, in the new script’s conception, by the Greek mathematician Archimedes to allow its user to manipulate time.
“Indy had spent his entire life exploring time,” Kennedy says. “Once Jim seized upon that as a theme, it emotionally resonated, frankly, with all of us, who have in excess of 40 years invested in this storytelling.”
Mangold also understood, however, that audiences would show up with an image of Indiana Jones in his prime fixed in their memories. So rather than cut the prologue, he expanded it to a 25-minute sequence set in 1944, when Indy encounters the Antikythera for the first time on a Nazi loot train. Effectively, Mangold wanted viewers to be disappointed by the shock of cutting from Indy as a younger man to Indy in his late 70s. “It might be a really good opening gambit for the present-tense part of the movie — that much about growing older in life is disappointing,” he says.
In spite of his trepidation, Ford applied himself to the sequence with his typical aplomb. “I tried to raise my voice into a higher register, which seemed to be appropriate for the age, and physically tried to move with all the grace and youthfulness that my old ass could muster,” he says. “I had not anticipated that the process of de-aging, if you will call it that, would be so successful.”
Neither did Mangold. The director knew Ford would need to be de-aged with a level of verisimilitude that has proven elusive to filmmakers so far. The process involved drawing from hundreds of hours of archived footage of Ford as a younger man and mapping that onto the older actor’s face. But when I ask Mangold how he ensured the technology was up to snuff before he started filming, he just shrugs. He hadn’t.
“You have to believe that they’re going to be able to do something better, but you don’t know,” he says. “Every movie is a leap of faith. People are like, ‘Can Joaquin Phoenix sing?’ And you go, ‘Yeah, absolutely. He’s incredible.’ And you don’t know. You’re just believing in the people around you delivering.”
Lucasfilm Ltd.
Spielberg never told Mangold why he decided to relinquish the “Indiana Jones” director’s chair, and Mangold never asked. “I never went there,” Mangold says. “I mean, it wasn’t my business. I knew he had a personal movie he had been working on, so I assumed that he wanted to make ‘The Fabelmans.’ But I didn’t grill him about it.”
The two did talk frequently throughout the making of “The Dial of Destiny,” shot from from June 2021 to February 2022, most often about the “mechanics of things” and how an “Indy” movie should feel and move. “Steven told me, ‘Think of shooting an “Indiana Jones” movie like you’re shooting a trailer — no scene can ever last too long,’” he says.
When I ask how Mangold approached making the film his own, however, he corrects me. “I wasn’t looking to make the movie my own,” he says. “I would say I was looking to have a voice.” More than practically any other film franchise in cinema history, “Indiana Jones” is inextricably associated with one filmmaker, and Mangold had no interest in changing that.
“You don’t want me doing a knockoff Steven, but I want to be playing from the same hymnal, using the same tools,” he says. “I mean, I’m pinch-hitting for Babe Ruth. I at least have to use my own swing some of the time. But the reality is, every day I’m thinking of what he would do, how he would do it. In any way I could, I wanted to do the movie in his style. It didn’t feel threatening to me at all.”
Mangold knew comparisons were inevitable, so he wasn’t exactly shocked when the premiere of “The Dial of Destiny” at the Cannes Film Festival in May drew a muted reaction from critics. “When you’re in franchise land, it’s very hard for critical thinkers” — meaning journalists — “to overlook what I’m sure their editors want, which is this business prism of how does it rate to the other ones?” he says. “I always thought if I were second or third best to one of the greatest films of all time, I’d be good. I mean, it all vaporizes later. Either the movie will live or it won’t.”
Mangold talks about this with the kind of good-natured forbearance built up over decades in the studio trenches, so I’m surprised by how animated he gets when I bring up the future of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s character, Helena Shaw, Indy’s goddaughter. Mangold and the Butterworths wrote Helena specifically for Waller-Bridge, seeing in her the same kind of pluck and resourcefulness that made Karen Allen’s Marion Ravenwood a perfect foil for Indy in “Raiders.” I ask if he has talked with Disney and Lucasfilm about the potential for Waller-Bridge to carry on the franchise. Mangold smiles and waves his hand dismissively.
“I’m not interested,” he says. “I refuse. I just can’t do it.” He gestures to the rules hovering just over his shoulder. “The amount of lore and Easter eggs and fan service starts to become antithetical to any of this stuff at a certain point. It isn’t storytelling anymore. It’s large-scale advertising.” (For her part, Kennedy says that while it’s “entirely possible” that a Helena Shaw movie could happen, “we’re not having any of those conversations right now. We’re just focused on finishing this with Harrison.”)
Lucasfilm Ltd.
At the same time, Mangold seems resigned to the inevitability of the franchise economy. For instance, Hugh Jackman will return in 2024 as Wolverine in a Marvel Studios film with Ryan Reynolds’ Deadpool, seven years after Jackman retired the character in “Logan” — the film that earned Mangold his first Oscar nomination (for adapted screenplay). “I can’t say that there’s a part of me that doesn’t wish that we’d let it be,” he says. “But there was always going to be another Wolverine. There could be a baby Wolverine and a cartoon Wolverine. As much liquid as they can squeeze out of that rag, they’re going to try to. I don’t measure my success on a movie like ‘Logan’ with whether we ended the conversation. I ended my conversation.”
The great irony is that Mangold is attached to make a DC movie and a “Star Wars” movie — he’s just choosing not to see them that way. “While I’m sure DC views ‘Swamp Thing’ as a franchise, I would be viewing it as a very simple, clean, Gothic horror movie about this man/monster,” he says. Mangold had been “toying for years with the idea of making a kind of Frankenstein movie,” he adds, so when James Gunn and Peter Safran took the reins at DC last fall, Mangold “put in a friendly call” to suggest himself. “Just doing my own thing with this, just a standalone.”
With “Star Wars,” Mangold had “more than flirted” years earlier with making a Boba Fett movie that would have been a one-off spaghetti Western in the vein of Sergio Leone. (Lucasfilm turned it into the Disney+ series “The Book of Boba Fett” instead.) So while in production on “The Dial of Destiny,” Kennedy asked him if he was still interested in exploring a galaxy far, far away. “I said, ‘Yes, but it seems like everything you’re developing is continuing forward,’” he says. He pitched “a ‘Ten Commandments’ about the dawning of the Force,” he says. “It is basically, for fans, a kind of religion. What is it to have found this power and not even understand what it is?” Kennedy pounced.
“Jim’s pretty fast — he’s already got the basic treatment laid out in his head,” she says. Once the writers strike is over, she adds, “He has every intention of wanting to move this forward very aggressively, and we want to support that.”
Before either project goes anywhere, though, Mangold intends to begin shooting the relatively small-scale Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown” with Timothée Chalamet in August. It’s the film Mangold was working on in 2019 when Kennedy approached him about “Indy,” and he’s been itching to get back to it. But the looming prospect of an actors strike in July could scuttle the movie before it starts. If a strike goes on too long, Chalamet’s commitments to promote “Dune: Part Two” and “Wonka” in the fall and winter could prevent the film from happening. When I ask Mangold about that possibility, he grimaces.
“I get asked this question,” he says. “All we do is keep moving. Just keep trying to prep the movie and hope that the two sides will resolve things. I don’t know what else I can do.”
The only thing Mangold is certain of is that he never wants to get too comfortable making anything. “I don’t put myself in one bin in the record shop,” he says. “Is he country and western or jazz? Is he rock ’n’ roll or is he soundtracks? What the fuck is he?” He laughs. “To me, sticking within one lane, I don’t know whether I’d keep learning.”
I make note of another Mackendrick rule of cinema — and, it seems, of life — hanging just out of Mangold’s view: “Drama is EXPECTATION mingled with UNCERTAINTY.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LWphbWVzLW1hbmdvbGQtaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC0xMjM1NjUwODk0L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LWphbWVzLW1hbmdvbGQtaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC0xMjM1NjUwODk0L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Asked about LaBeouf’s absence at the Dial of Destiny premiere this week, Mangold told Variety: “I think the point I had was that when I came on, I wanted to capture that wonderful energy between Indy and an intrepid female character.”
The franchise’s fifth instalment sees the new addition of Fleabag star Phoebe Waller-Bridge, 37, as Indiana’s goddaughter Helena who helps him on his new quest.
“So that was my first goal, and there’s only so many people you can edge into a picture,” Mangold added.
The maligned fourth film in the Indiana Jones franchise, starring LaBeouf, was widely panned by critics.
At the end of the movie, it is heavily hinted that Mutt would be Indiana’s successor as the adventurer’s iconic hat is seen flying in the breeze and landing at Mutt’s feet.

However, screenwriter David Koepp revealed in 2017 that LaBeouf would not be reprising his role.
LaBeouf criticized the production in a 2010 interview with the Los Angeles Times. He said that he “dropped the ball on the legacy that people loved and cherished”, and that Harrison Ford wasn’t happy with the film either.
Ford, 80, later responded by calling his costar a “f***ing idiot” for making the comments.
In recent years, the Even Stevens star has been repeatedly mired in controversy.
The actor is currently fighting a legal battle over allegations of abuse made against him by his former partner, the musician known as FKA Twigs.

Though he denied each of the allegations, LaBeouf admitted to being aggressive and mentioned his alcohol addiction, stating: “I’m not in any position to tell anyone how my behaviour made them feel. I have no excuses for my alcoholism or aggression, only rationalisations.”

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is out in theatres on 30 June.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL2FydHMtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9maWxtcy9uZXdzL3NoaWEtbGFiZW91Zi1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LWIyMzU4NjYyLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-30 12:36:20+00:00,"‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Teenage Breakout Ethann Isidore on Battling Nazis By Day, School Homework by Night",The 16-year-old French actor discusses his major role in Dial of Destiny and bonding with Harrison Ford and Phoebe Waller-Bridge on set,"While much of the attention regarding Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has been — understandably — on Harrison Ford, plus the franchise finale’s renowned and much-loved additions in Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Mads Mikkelson, the film also welcomes a (very) fresh-faced newcomer into the globe-trotting historical adventure mix.
In his feature debut and first English-speaking role, French actor Ethann Isidore, 16, appears about halfway into the Lucasfilm movie as Teddy Kumar, the sneaky sidekick of Waller-Bridge’s relic-stealing Helena Shaw. From there on in, the teenager — who was just 14 years old when he was cast and turned 15 during the shoot — is a regular presence on screen, heavily involved in the film’s biggest action sequences, including tuk-tuk races, airborne pursuits and the Dial of Destiny‘s rather spectacular time-twisting climax.
Born on the outskirts of Paris and of Mauritian descent, Isidore was already a “huge fan” of Indiana Jones years before the long-awaited final movie came his way (and despite being more than two decades younger than the original trilogy). But he doesn’t appear to have been starstruck by its iconic whip-cracking lead, with Ford pulling faces at him as they filmed scenes together (on one occasion he was laughing so hard that director James Mangold kept having to tell him to concentrate). He and Waller-Bridge, he says, came up with their own special handshake.
Such was the friendship he developed with his co-stars that at the end of the 8-month-shoot, the two presented their young companion with an electric guitar and wrote Isidor a letter saying how much they’d enjoyed working with him (“one of the greatest gifts I’ve ever received”).
Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter from his grandmother’s apartment in Paris while on school holiday, Isidore discusses his special audition tactic (one that may well have landed him his life-changing role), the nicknames given to him and Waller-Bridge on set, his upcoming appearance in another epic franchise, and juggling time-traveling, Nazi-bashing adventures with schoolwork.
At the Cannes premiere, you just looked like you were having an absolute blast. How was the Cannes experience for you?
Cannes was amazing. It feels like you’re in a dream. And everything is so fancy. I’ve never seen anything like it before. And there are all these stars around you. You feel like you’re on top of the world. And it also feels like there are all these fireworks going off when photographers are taking pictures of you.
Did you manage to chat with any other stars?
I didn’t really speak to anyone. I was staying at the Carlton, which was the same hotel as Leonardo DiCaprio. But I left the day he arrived at the hotel.
Have you been part of the Dial of Destiny‘s big global tour since then?
Well, I went to LA, but I didn’t go to Berlin with the other members of the cast, and I didn’t go to Italy. But that’s fine because I went to the Paris premiere. And I was really happy about it because I was the only member of the cast there, so everyone was asking me questions. I had to go on stage to speak to around 2,600 people — it feels like you’re God!
I’m sure you’ve been asked this question thousands of times already, but how did you get to be part of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny?
I was coming back from school and my mom told me that my agent had received a call from a casting director asking me to do an audition for a “very famous adventure franchise.” This was in Paris. So I went there and I didn’t think I was going to be chosen. Because there were so many kids in the waiting room — about 20 other kids. I thought, “yup, not me.” Then I went to the audition. And they called me back, asking for me to meet with James Mangold in London two weeks later. I met him and he told me he liked what I did. And then, two days later, they called me and said I was going to play in Indiana Jones.
Wow, that was it? Can you remember what you did in the audition?
I did the same in Paris and in London. I had lines to learn, but there’s something I do for every casting audition, which is I learn my lines at the last minute, like the night before, so it’s more natural in the audition and to take away the pressure. And it kind of works!
It clearly does. Where were you when you got the call and what did you do?
I was actually on London Bridge in front of Big Ben. I was with my family as we were in London for a week. But we called my cousins, my aunts, my uncles, my grandma, my grandfather, my entire family from Mauritius, where we’re originally from. I think even the neighbors got a call.
The original Indiana Jones films were already getting quite old when I was your age, a very, very long time ago. Did you know them or did you have to quickly watch them before the audition?
Oh, I definitely knew them — I used to watch all these movies with my family when was I younger. I had the DVD collector pack. And I also had the Lego Indiana Jones game on Xbox. And I used to make Indiana Jones short films with my cousins when I was about four. I’d play a kid Indiana Jones who was looking for animals. I don’t know why. I was a big fan!
Most of your scenes are with Phoebe Waller-Bridge. How was it working with her?
She’s really nice and very funny. She kept making jokes with me and the entire cast. We even had a personal handshake! They would call us Bonnie and Clyde on set. I had a line in the original script, where I say we’re Bonnie and Clyde. It didn’t make it into the movie, but it stayed in people’s minds, and on set that’s what we were called.
Harrison Ford doesn’t seem like an easy guy to amuse. Did you manage to make him laugh? Was he good fun to be around?
When you make Harrison laugh, you do feel really proud of yourself, basically like you could make anyone laugh. But I had the time of my life making jokes with him and we’d make fun of each other. I remember James Mangold kept telling me to concentrate because I was laughing too much during one scene, but it was just because Harrison was making faces. So it was all Harrison’s fault.
There’s so much going on in the film — tuk-tuk races, adventures on boats and that spectacular climax. How much of it was real and not done in a studio in front of a green screen?
Actually, most of it was real — we traveled to Sicily and Morocco, and the New York scenes were shot in Glasgow. And even on the boat — we were actually out in the ocean.
Do you have a favorite moment from the entire production?
I think it was the last week because Harrison and Phoebe bought me an electric guitar. They also gave me a letter and they signed it, telling me that I was doing a great job and that it was awesome working with me. I was so happy — I cried when got it. It was one of the greatest gifts I’ve ever received. I’ve got the letter on the wall in my room.
Why did they get you a guitar?
Because I used to talk about music with Harrison and Phoebe, and about rock and roll, which I love. And also they know I’m a musician. I play the piano. So they knew I was going to play it.
Did you manage to take home any other souvenirs from the set?
Yeah, I have a rope. There was a scene way where I have to tie a rope on a boat — it was really brief, like two seconds. But I kept it because I just wanted to have something from the film.
What were you doing with schoolwork during the shoot?
I had teachers on set on Zoom. I had at least three hours of school every day. And every Friday I’d have an exam — it’s one that all 14 and 15-year-olds in France have to do. And it was quite complicated because I’d be on set and like “Yeah, I’m gonna fight Nazis. And then: Math.”
Are you back at school now?
Well, it’s the holidays now, but yeah, I’ve been back to school.
How was returning to post-Indy normality?
It felt really weird like you were in a dream and someone smacked you and told you to wake up. And you see your math teacher again, and you’re like, well, so this is reality.
And what do your friends and classmates think about the fact you’re in Indiana Jones with Harrison Ford?
At first, they didn’t believe me. I was really proud of it, but first when I told them they were like ‘yeah, yeah, yeah.’ So I had to show them photos to prove I wasn’t lying. But my friends have been amazing and they haven’t changed since they found out. So I’m happy about that because I was scared people would going to change. So life is good!
Besides school, what’s next for you?
I have a role in the Walking Dead spin-off about Daryl Dixon. We filmed that last year — it was really fun to see zombies everywhere. I can’t say much about that though.
So do you now have agents in the U.S.?
Not yet, but my French agents are working on it. We’re going to have some meetings. We’re also waiting for the release to see what’s going to happen next.
And now you’ve starred in a major film series that you were already a fan of yourself, is there anything else that you’d love to do?
I’d love to be involved in a Spider-Man movie. I have a lot of Spider-Man comic books in my room. I’d love to play Miles Morales (the star of Sony’s animated Spider-Verse franchise) That would be a dream.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9ldGhhbm4taXNpZG9yZS1pbnRlcnZpZXctaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnktMTIzNTUyNjE4Ni_SAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3MvZXRoYW5uLWlzaWRvcmUtaW50ZXJ2aWV3LWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LTEyMzU1MjYxODYvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

,"James Mangold, Harrison Ford on deciding if Indiana Jones dies",'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' director James Mangold and star Harrison Ford open up about making the decision to kill the beloved archaeologist or keep him alive at the end of the fifth film.,"Warning: This article contains spoilers for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
""How could I have done that?""
This is what Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director and co-writer James Mangold says emphatically when EW thanks him for not continuing in the recent Hollywood tradition of bringing back iconic characters only to kill them off.
Still, he understands why you were worried about the titular archaeologist's fate. ""I think everyone, particularly, because I made Logan and wrote it as well, there was a lot of anxiety that I was just going to turn into the icon executioner,"" he says with a laugh. (The 2017 superhero film famously killed off Hugh Jackman's Wolverine.)
So yes, the cat is out of the bag and Indy fans can rest easy: Though he comes close in the film's final moments, Harrison Ford's fedora-wearing adventurer does not in fact meet an untimely end, and lives to don the hat another day.
Mangold says that he and his fellow co-writers, brothers John-Henry and Jez Butterworth, never discussed if Indiana Jones should die. ""Honestly, I enjoy that people were so atwitter about it, because to me, there really is no attraction to just getting thousands of people in a theater and hitting them in a head with a hammer... Death is not an ending. The reason death worked in Logan is because of the beautiful irony of his death, which is that he lived such a painful life, that it was only in the last 30 seconds of his life that he actually got to experience love. And that to me was what was so moving about that ending,"" Mangold says, adding, wryly, ""And [Jackman's] off making another one right now [with Deadpool 3]. So you could see the finality of that.""
""But,"" he continues, ""for Indiana Jones, it isn't about him dying. It had to be about him coming to terms with this period of his life and this period of the world. And in a way, coming to terms with whether Indiana Jones has relevance to ours.""
Harrison Ford stars as Indiana Jones in 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny'. Lucasfilm Ltd.
The film, which Ford has sworn is his fifth and final in the franchise, follows Indy and his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) as they race to keep the mysterious Dial of Destiny out of the hands of a Nazi, Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), who has dastardly plans to alter the course of history.
For his part, Ford confirms he and and the film's creatives never had serious discussions about his character's death ""because the script came out, and it didn't have Indiana Jones dying, so we didn't really need to talk about it."" However, he says, ""It came up in conversation a few times, and [Mangold] said he didn't want to be the one to kill me.""
By film's end, Indy is back at home in his own time, recovering from his injuries and surrounded by loved ones — Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and his grandkids, goddaughter Helena, and his estranged wife, Marion (Karen Allen), with whom he rekindles their longtime love. (More on that, here.)
""I think it's a good choice to leave him in the condition we see him at the end of the film,"" says Ford. ""Most of his problems have been solved, dealt with. He's back to the form that we like to see him in, I think. And I think it's a wonderful last scene... I really like it.""

2023-06-13 22:30:00.326000+00:00,Harrison Ford Endorses Punching Nazis Like Indiana Jones Does,The Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny star comments on the character's modern implications.,"In the realm of fictional characters who are well-known for punching Nazis, Indiana Jones has to be at the top of the list. So one might wonder what Indiana Jones himself, Harrison Ford, has to say about that.
With Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny coming to theaters soon, Ford sat down with Yahoo, which asked him if he thinks Indiana Jones would still be punching Nazis today, especially since they’ve been making a sad, unfortunate comeback. The answer is pure Harrison Ford. Would Indiana Jones be okay with people punching Nazis? “He’d push ‘em out of the way to get in the first punch. As well he should,” Ford said. Here’s the clip.

“That was a black-and-white world,” Ford continues. “And as evil presented itself to the world ... it’s incalculable that this vision of evil not be confronted.”

Jones fought Nazis in Raiders of the Lost Ark, set in 1936; he fought them in Last Crusade, set in 1938; and in Dial of Destiny, he’ll fight them again, both during World War II and in the film’s present-day of 1969.
We’ll have much more from Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny in the coming days, including our sit-down interview with co-writer and director James Mangold. The movie opens June 30.

You'd be forgiven for thinking that knowledge would make the final day of filming an emotional day. However, talking to Digital Spy, Ford has revealed that he felt something different when he hung up his fedora and whip.
""The feeling I had is the feeling you have when you've made something, and you can look at it, or you can remember having made it, [and having] the satisfaction of putting work in, and getting something worthy out of it,"" he recalled.
""I felt a sense of peace, a sense of contentment, that this particular job that [James Mangold] and I and all the other people involved had done together, was concluded in a way that really felt satisfying to me. It is my hope that others find it as satisfying as I did.""

This final outing has certainly been a long time coming for Indiana Jones fans, with it finally arriving in cinemas more than 15 years after Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Ford explained that another movie wasn't immediately on the horizon when they finished Crystal Skull, and it was more of a case of waiting for the right idea for Indy's final adventure.
""There were some interesting ideas that were floated, but they didn't quite gel over a period of time. And then we found an idea, and a script, and a strong story that we wanted to tell. I'm very happy with the story that we're telling,"" he continued.

2023-06-22 12:27:07+00:00,"Harrison Ford, Mads Mikkelsen, and more reflect on the final Indiana Jones adventure, Dial Of Destiny","EXCLUSIVE: We spoke to Harrison Ford, director James Mangold, and the cast about Indy's last ride","“If adventure has a name, it must be Indiana Jones.” So said the famous tagline on the poster for 1984’s Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, the second film in the franchise created by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. Now the world’s most famous archaeologist is back for one final hurrah, in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. And so Harrison Ford, who has stated that this is his last outing as the character, is back donning that hat and cracking that whip once again.
His last venture was 2008’s much-maligned Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. So, can adventure still have a name when Indy’s pushing seventy? Ford definitely thinks so. “This is not an endless stream of jokes about old farts and that kind of thing,” he says, kicking back in the Carlton Hotel the day after the film’s world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival. “This is more complex and textured. And I owe that to what Jim accomplished in the screenplay.”
(Image credit: Disney)
“Jim” is James Mangold, the director of films including Ford v. Ferrari and Walk The Line, who becomes the first filmmaker to step into Spielberg’s shoes and direct an Indy instalment. After four previous outings with the ’Berg at the helm, was it strange for Ford to be without his main man? “It was all strange. It’s always been strange. But we have a long relationship, Steven and I, and Steven has incredible grace and generosity at his core and we talked a lot. Steven’s fingerprints are all over this movie... [and] not in a bad way!”
Mangold already has experience of taking on an iconic character in his later years, directing Hugh Jackman as Wolverine in the 2017 film Logan. But how did he feel following Spielberg? “We’re following the DNA of something he built with you many years ago,” he says. “You’re having a continuous dialogue. I mean, I often say in regard to Steven that I’ve been learning from him long before I met him. I was making Super 8 movies and watching his films and studying them shot by shot. This became an opportunity, this film, to meet your heroes on an equal footing and play with them… which is a kind of a dream!”
Entering Indy's world

Even for experienced actors, entering the world of Indiana Jones for the first time, it felt like a dream come true. “When I was 15, I rented a movie box as we call it – five films – with my brother,” explains incoming Danish star Mads Mikkelsen. The second movie in the box? It was 1981’s Raiders Of The Lost Ark, the first time Ford took on the role. “We didn’t watch the other ones. We just watched that one.” Who can blame them?
This time around, Indy is living in 1969 New York on his own and lecturing to a bunch of students who don’t care for his knowledge. His adventuring days seem to be behind him, until his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) turns up, looking for an artefact, Archimedes’ Dial, which can pinpoint fissures in time. As they travel to Morocco and Greece, they’re joined by Helena’s sidekick Teddy (Etthan Isidore) in a race to find the Dial before Jürgen Voller (Mikkelsen), a former Nazi who has helped the U.S. win the Space Race.
Indy vs. the Nazis

Indy has faced Nazis throughout the franchise, right back to Raiders when he battled them for the Ark of the Covenant. But he maybe hasn’t met an adversary quite as chilling as Voller. “Like Indy, he has this passion, he has this dream, to make the world a better place,” says Mikkelsen. Quite what he’s planning to do with the Dial is too spoilery to say, but his plans would be catastrophic for world peace.
Ford felt Jones’ hatred of Nazis had to be rooted in something real – in this case the nature of evil. “Something that Jim and I talked about before the movie started, which made its way into the film and in a line of dialogue, is that ‘I’ve seen a lot of things in my life that I can’t explain.’” Anger boils as Ford thinks about the ongoing Russian invasion of the Ukraine. “I can’t understand why we’re fucking sitting here, and that war is going on right over there. And we allow it. And we go on and act like it’s not fucking there.”
Embracing your childhood

As serious as Ford is, his co-stars are full of praise for his childish side. “He is the youngest person I’ve ever met,” says Mikkelsen. “He’s 80-years-old and he behaves like a 16-year-old boy. It’s insane. At the press conference, my name comes up, people start clapping and he just whacks me! This is just inappropriate 16-year-old boy [behaviour]! And so you don’t feel it. You feel a man full of passion standing right in front of you. This is what he is! He’s the annoying big brother. I might be the little brother.”
For the actual 16 year-old Isidore, who is half-Brazilian and half-Mauritian, he got advice from Ford on set. “We had a little conversation, and he said, actually, that being an actor is a little bit like being a child, but you get paid for it. And it’s really true. I mean, I think he’s right when he says that. When you’re an actor, you keep playing with your imagination, and having fun with people who play also with their imagination. And I think it brings you back to your childhood.”
I think it brings you back to your childhood
Naturally, comparisons are being made to Isidore and Ke Huy Quan, who starred in Temple of Doom as the sidekick Short Round and most recently made a glorious comeback, winning an Oscar for Everything Everywhere All At Once. “Harrison told me something very sweet when we were on the [Palais] stairs at Cannes. He told me that Ke Huy Quan was as excited as me for the premiere of Indiana Jones [and the Temple of Doom] and he told me ‘look where he is now.’ And I was like, ‘wow!’ I wanted to cry. But I kept my tears in. Because I had the photos to do. But it was very sweet of him!”
Moving forward
(Image credit: Disney/Lucasfilm)
So what did Spielberg make of the final cut? “He was really happy with the movie,” reports Mangold. “He didn’t only see the final cut, he came and visited many times and was watching dailies as we were shooting and even on weekends when he was shooting The Fabelmans, he and I would talk and check in or he’d just report what he saw and liked. It was the least politically complicated movie I’ve ever been part. That makes no sense if you look at the players involved but it’s absolutely true!”
As for Mikkelsen, his time on the film adds another remarkable franchise to his name. He has already graced the worlds of Star Wars (Rogue One), James Bond (Casino Royale), Marvel (Doctor Strange), and Harry Potter (Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore) on film, as well as play Dr. Hannibal Lecter in the TV show Hannibal. Is there another franchise he’s got his eye on? “It’s not a real franchise but if you talk about genre... I always wanted to be a zombie.” Maybe he could play a Nazi zombie? “A Danish Nazi zombie – why didn’t I think of that?”

The highs (and lows) of returning to iconic roles,Actors love to return to their most famous roles decades later – and digital de-ageing is Hollywood’s next big thing.,"Saddle up, don the fedora and crack that whip: Harrison Ford is back as the intrepid archaeologist in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. The film premiered at Cannes, where Ford was awarded an Honorary Palme d’Or in recognition of his life’s work.
Reviews for the fifth film in the franchise have been mixed, and it is the first Indy film not to be directed by Steven Spielberg (this time, it’s James Mangold, best known for his motor-racing drama Ford v Ferrari).
But this is “event” cinema that combines nostalgia, old-school special effects and John Williams’ iconic score.
So, Ford is back, aged 80. What draws actors back after all this time?

Role returns
Ford first played Indy in 1981 and last played him in 2008. That is a full 15 years since the most recent film in the series, and 42 years since his first outing in Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Ford has form in returning to celebrated characters. One of the great pleasures of watching The Force Awakens back in 2015 was seeing Ford play Han Solo again for the first time in over 30 years.
Actors return to roles for numerous reasons:
financial (Ford was reportedly paid US$25 million for Dial of Destiny)
protection of their brand, image and star persona (Michael Keaton returning to play Batman after three decades and three other actors who have embodied the role)
professional (Tom Cruise admitted over the 36 years between Top Gun films he wanted to make sure the sequel could live up to the original)
personal (once-huge stars are working less and less, and only feel the need to return to a built-in fan base every few years – Bill Murray in the 2021 Ghostbusters sequel springs to mind).
It’s not always a successful endeavour.
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone – two of the biggest action stars of the 1980s off the back of iconic roles as The Terminator, Rocky Balboa and John Rambo – have repeatedly returned to those roles, and critics have been particularly harsh.
It did not work for Sigourney Weaver in Alien: Resurrection in 1997, 18 years after her first time as Ripley; nor for Keanu Reeves in The Matrix Resurrections in 2021, 23 years after the original.
And still, I’m intrigued to see what Michael Mann could do with his long-rumoured sequel to Heat, his definitive 1995 crime film. Ever since Mann published his novel Heat 2 last year – a kind of origin story for Heat’s key protagonists – fans have been hoping a de-aged Al Pacino (now aged 83) might return as LA cop Vincent Hanna.

Undoing time
“Digital de-ageing” first entered the Hollywood mainstream in 2019 with The Irishman and Captain Marvel.
Via this process, older actors (Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Samuel L. Jackson have all been subject to the technology) move back and forwards in time without younger actors having to play them.
Films still tend to cast two actors to play older and younger versions of the same character, a choice that dates back at least to 1974’s The Godfather Part II, in which a young Robert de Niro plays Vito Corleone, portrayed by the much older Marlon Brando in the first film.
In 1989, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade features a delightful opening scene where River Phoenix plays the young version of Indiana Jones, before Ford takes over for the rest of the film.
Actors used to just play characters of their own age when reprising earlier roles. Paul Newman finally won a Best Actor Oscar for his role as “Fast Eddie” Felson in The Color of Money (1986), a quarter of a century after first playing him in The Hustler.
The sequel plays on Newman’s age, and his role as a mentor to an upcoming Tom Cruise, and bathes viewers in nostalgia and memories of a younger Newman.
But actors no longer have to exclusively play their age.
The first part of Dial of Destiny is an extended flashback, set in 1944, in which Ford has been digitally de-aged to appear in his 40s. This process used an AI system that scanned used and unused reels of footage of Ford from the first three Indy films to match his present-day performance.
Here, it is as if we are getting two Fords for the price of one: the “younger”, fitter Indy and the older, more world-weary version. It makes for a powerfully emotional connection on screen.
Yet there are some pitfalls to de-ageing. Some viewers complain that the whole process is distracting and that the hyper-real visual look of de-aged scenes resembles a video game.
Even so, de-ageing in Hollywood cinema is here to stay. Tom Hanks’s next film is using AI-based generative technology to digitally de-age him.
Given its reduced cost, speed and reduced human input, AI-driven innovation might have industry-changing ramifications.
The star of Ford
Harrison Ford remains a bona fide “movie star” in an industry profoundly buffeted by COVID, the rise of streaming platforms, the demise of the monoculture, and the changing nature of who constitutes a star.
In the midst of all this industry uncertainty, it seems there is no longer a statute of limitations on actors returning to much-loved characters.
The next big ethical issue for the film industry as it further embraces AI is whether to resurrect deceased actors and cast them in new movies.
Still, I’m looking forward to seeing more actors de-aged as the technology improves and audiences acclimatise to watching older actors “playing” younger versions of themselves. We are only at the start of Hollywood’s next big adventure.

2023-05-30 11:00:00+00:00,Indiana Jones 5 has set an unwanted record ahead of release,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny﻿ has set an unwanted record on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes ahead of its release in cinemas next month.,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has set an unwanted record on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes ahead of its official release in cinemas next month.
The fifth Indiana Jones instalment had its world premiere at Cannes Film Festival on May 18, but it seems the critics in attendance weren't impressed by the film, which currently sits at 49% on Rotten Tomatoes from 43 reviews.
Given the critic scores for previous films in the franchise (93% for Raiders of the Lost Ark, 84% for Last Crusade, 77% for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and 76% for Temple of Doom), this makes it the lowest Tomatometer rating of the series to date by a large margin.

This score is likely to fluctuate as more critics get to watch James Mangold's film over the coming weeks, while audiences will be able to share their own thoughts on Indy's final adventure from next month.
Dial of Destiny will see Harrison Ford reprise his role as the legendary archaeologist for the fifth and final time, though Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy recently teased that the franchise could continue on TV in the future.
""It's Harrison's last entry. That's how we look at the Indy franchise,"" she told .

Kennedy continued: ""I mean, truthfully, right now, if we were to do anything, it might be in series television down the road, but we're not doing anything to replace Indiana Jones.
""This is it. It's five movies that Harrison Ford did. And Harrison is so specific and so unique to creating this role. We just… Steven [Spielberg] agrees, we just wouldn't do that.""
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is released in UK cinemas on June 28 and in US cinemas on June 30.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxzcHkuY29tL21vdmllcy9hNDQwMzUxMzIvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LXJvdHRlbi10b21hdG9lcy1yZWNvcmQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Mask used for stunts in Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny is giving people nightmares,They definitely fall squarely into the uncanny valley,"A mask used during the production of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has been giving fans 'nightmares' online.
In the age of wall-to-wall CGI, there's still no replacing the real feel produced by a practical effect in a movie.
A straight up comparison between the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films, for example, can show how strange CGI sometimes looks next to top-notch practical effects.
Advert 10
However, sometimes such effects can look a little... interesting before post-production works its magic on them.
And a mask used in the new Indiana Jones movie has shown just that.
Creepy but also very impressive! Credit: Twitter/@IndianaJones_ch
The mask was worn by stunt doubles so that they would look more like star Harrison Ford. The effect would then be completed in post, and make the process easier than replacing the face altogether.
Advert 10
However, before post-production, they look somewhere between Michael Myers from Halloween and an old-school alien from Doctor Who.
And viewers were quick to pick up on the uncanny valley appearance of the mask, which featured both an old version and a young version for flashback scenes.
One person wrote: ""Seeing this right before bed on the night I saw the movie. 1000% nightmare fuel.""
Another joked: ""They should hand them out at each screening.""
Advert 10
Meanwhile, a third pointed out the resemblance to a certain villain, saying: ""Paint it white and you have a whole new Halloween franchise.""
And a fourth said: ""On one hand, this has been a thing for a while, on the other SWEET JESUS.""
Despite looking creepy, the masks also received some positive feedback, with fans remarking that they were still an improvement compared to an over-reliance on CGI.
One said: ""Looks better that the CGI face…""

Another wrote: ""Long proud history of these in movies. I'll take these over CGI any day because at least the brain knows there's a real person in the shot.""
""Horrifying, but at least movie magic blends this in, unlike CGI where it's almost always recognisable."" someone else commented.
Nonetheless, there was no denying that the masks were pretty horrifying to look at despite how fantastic they might look once the editing process was complete.
Advert 10
And it's not the first time that movies have taken an unusual approach when it comes to replacing the faces of actors in movies.
Stars Wars franchise movie, Rogue One, also featured the regenerated faces of Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin and Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia.
The film drew some criticism for 'resurrecting' the actors for their appearances instead of recasting the roles or writing around the characters, so there wouldn't be the need to use the technology.
And director Gareth Edwards responded to the criticism, telling CNN in 2017: ""I think it’s fair enough and you should tread carefully around this area.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaWxhZC5jb20vZmlsbS1hbmQtdHYvaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC1tYXNrLWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtZmlsbWluZy03MzQ2OTMtMjAyMzA3MDPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

,Indiana Jones and the fedora boom,Indy’s latest caper proves a help to hatters | Business,"Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the <audio> element.
I n a summer crowded with blockbusters, Disney may sweat to recoup the $295m it reportedly spent making “Dial of Destiny”, the fifth and final Indiana Jones film, out on June 30th in America. But the movie is already a hit for a firm in another industry. Herbert Johnson, a 134-year-old London hatmaker, is fielding soaring demand for a certain fedora.
“It’s been just glorious,” says Michelle Poyer-Sleeman, the master hatter who designed the latest iteration of the Poet, the hat first donned by Harrison Ford in “Raiders of the Lost Ark” in 1981. The firm had to keep the product under its hat until a couple of weeks before the movie’s launch. But already the “Destiny Poet” has caused a seven-fold rise in Herbert Johnson’s revenue since June last year. A backlog of over 300 orders waits to be handmade in a workshop that hums with the sound of fans, steam and irons.
The boom marks a sharp turnaround for the firm. After the success of “Raiders” it provided Indy’s hats in the follow-ups, “Temple of Doom” (1984) and “Last Crusade” (1989). But a downturn in hat-wearing brought hard times. Venerable hatters such as Italy’s Borsalino went bust. Herbert Johnson was sold and for a while stopped making its hats in-house. For “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull”, Indy’s fourth adventure, in 2008, the producers went elsewhere.
After a rethink in 2016 the firm went back to handmaking and focused on the Poet, which today accounts for three-quarters of sales. The internet brought new customers, many of them American (and many women). Customers wait up to six months for their £495 ($630) rabbit-felt Poet, which comes with an optional “Raiders turn”, a 25-degree twist of the crown to match the jaunty angle at which Mr Ford wore his (supposedly to keep it on during stunts). The firm advises keeping it out of heavy rain and heat and to brush it only anticlockwise. Dr Jones would surely scoff.
Swaine, the 273-year-old luxury-goods firm that owns Herbert Johnson, hopes for success with other on-screen products. It sells a £520 umbrella of the sort twirled by Gene Kelly in “Singin’ in the Rain” and a £3,200 attaché case used by James Bond in “From Russia with Love” (minus the concealed knife). In March it opened a new flagship shop. Hat-wearing is making a comeback, says Ms Poyer-Sleeman, who spotted several clients at the “Dial of Destiny” premiere. There is also a “swing back to quality”, she says. People want something that will last, “and we’re in that niche.”■

Ahead of the movie's debut, Ford praised his wife in front of the Cannes crowd.
""My life has been enabled by my lovely wife, who has supported my passions and my dreams and I'm grateful,"" Ford said, according to People. ""And you know, I love you too. You've given my life purpose and meaning and I'm grateful for that, so grateful.""

2023-07-01 15:21:27+00:00,"Movie review: Nostalgic, yes, but ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ lacks adventure",This dose of “Indiana Jones” is a disappointingly diluted version of this favorite hero.,"It’s been 15 years since we last encountered Indiana Jones, the whip-cracking archaeologist made iconic by star Harrison Ford, director Steven Spielberg, and George Lucas, who conceived of the story while seeking to update the classic adventure serial. Audiences fell for the brainy, blunt and brave Indy in his globe-trotting adventures explored in the original trilogy, which started with “Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark” in 1981. Even the fourth installment, arriving in 2008, “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” was profitable, and warmly received despite its goofy story.
It’s no surprise that in a filmmaking landscape where legacy sequels, or “legasequels,” roam the box office, the powers that be would take ol’ Indy out for another spin. Ford had returned to both “Star Wars” and “Blade Runner” to positive notices, so it made sense to get the band back together for one more gig, to see if there’s any juice left to squeeze. Enter “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” in which James Mangold takes the reins from Spielberg.
Mangold also co-wrote the script with Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and David Koepp, and, true to the spirit of the legasequel, it’s about time travel — the story reflecting the nostalgic desire of both filmmakers and audiences to utilize movies as vehicles to revisit the emotions we felt when we were young. Lucas and Spielberg used “Indiana Jones” to recreate the feeling of their favorite childhood serials, and Mangold is tasked with delivering a film that brings us back to that feeling of falling in love with “Raiders of the Lost Ark” back in the ‘80s. He approaches the task so literally that he seems to have overlooked the goal of simply making a great adventure movie.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” hits the nostalgia button from minute one, with an almost creepy, fetishistic reanimation of Indy’s appeal. These reminders of what was are like constant jabs in the ribs, as if the filmmakers are saying, “Remember this? You like this.” It’s cameos from beloved characters, reminders of Indy’s well-known idiosyncrasies (he hates snakes and enjoys punching Nazis), and do-overs of famous bits from the previous films. They try so hard to recapture the original charm but haven’t actually thought about what made it charming in the first place, and the result is a sloggy, dull sequel that’s more “Bogus Journey” than “Excellent Adventure.”
It opens with a sequence that takes place toward the end of World War II, as Jones and fellow archaeologist Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) sneak around piles of treasure looted by Nazis, trying to liberate a few historically significant — and potentially powerful — baubles. Fast forward to the late ‘60s, where Indy is a grumpy professor in New York City. He has no groupies, no wife and no child when a strange woman, Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), ambushes him at a dive bar. She’s Indy’s goddaughter, the daughter of dear departed Bas, and she wants a mysterious dial crafted by Greek mathematician Archimedes that her pop pilfered from the Nazi loot train. Can Indy help her?
He doesn’t have much of a choice when they’re suddenly pursued through the city by two bloodthirsty blondes with buzz cuts (Boyd Holbrook and Olivier Richters). These menaces are in the employ of Dr. Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), a shadowy figure from Indy’s past and a rocket scientist/former Nazi who needs the dial to “fix Hitler’s mistakes.” Yes, the plot itself is a rather hackneyed pop culture meme.
Mangold is a slick filmmaker, and in “Dial of Destiny,” he alternates the nostalgia bumps and surprise cameos with extremely fast set pieces; the entire film feels like one long car (horse, boat, tuk-tuk) chase. All of the action sequences are capably crafted, and a total snooze. As Indy and Helena — and a precocious poppet (Ethann Isidore) they pick up in Morocco — dart around the globe retrieving various items, the bad guys chase them and relieve them of said items. Helena quips annoyingly, Indy grumbles predictably, and Mangold stuns us into a stupor with his perfectly competent filmmaking. It is a crushingly dull film until it becomes jaw-droppingly cartoonish.
Perhaps a swig of something familiar in an air-conditioned theater will be just the ticket for a summer weekend. However, this dose of “Indiana Jones” is a disappointingly diluted version of this favorite hero that has the power to put a fan off the franchise forever.

2023-07-20 15:40:00+00:00,Boyd Holbrook Breaks Down His ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ and ‘Justified: City Primeval’ Baddies,"Boyd Holbrook talks about his villains in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Justified: City Primeval opposite Harrison Ford, Timothy Olyphant.","[This story contains spoilers for Justified: City Primeval‘s two-episode premiere and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.]
From Logan and Sandman to Indiana Jones and Raylan Givens, Boyd Holbrook has a knack for being a thorn in the hero’s side.
Holbrook recently returned to the big screen in James Mangold’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which marked the conclusion of Harrison Ford’s 42-year tenure as the title character of Indiana Jones. The Kentucky native played Klaber, a neo-Nazi wannabe who served as Jürgen Voller’s (Mads Mikkelsen) top lieutenant, resembling Holbrook’s role as Donald Pierce in Mangold’s Oscar-nominated film, Logan (2017). Despite some early reservations over the similar parts, Holbrook couldn’t resist the opportunity to work with Ford and help say goodbye to his iconic and daring archaeologist.
“Jim [Mangold] called and said, ‘Listen, I don’t want to offend you, but have a look at it,’” Holbrook told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike. “So the character was a similar second-in-command bad guy who does all the bidding. That was the similarity, and that was my hesitation when I read it. But then there’s the pull of, ‘Wow, this is the last hurrah. This is the last run of Indiana Jones.’ So I didn’t want to repeat anything for Jim, and we were very adamant about that.”
Dial of Destiny revolves around the decades-long pursuit of Archimedes’ time dial, the Antikythera, as Klaber (Holbrook) wants to help Voller travel back to 1939, so he can replace Hitler and lead Nazi Germany to victory during World War II. Voller ultimately commandeered the Dial from Indy but severely miscalculated along the way, resulting in a group trip to the Siege of Syracuse in 212 BC. Despite Holbrook’s first-hand involvement, Indy’s voyage to the past still moved him as an audience member.
“It’s so elegantly done that it’s not farcical whatsoever,” Holbrook said. “It bottlenecks to a really touching moment where you feel that Indiana has earned this moment and wants to stay. When I saw it, I was surprised that it grabbed me by the throat. I was a little emotional, even though I’m so close to it.”
Holbrook also plays the main villain on Justified: City Primeval, FX’s revival of one of its most beloved television properties. Timothy Olyphant’s affable U.S. Marshal character, Raylan Givens, ends up having to pass through Detroit while on a road trip with his now-teenage daughter, Willa (Vivian Olyphant), and their stay in the Motor City is quickly extended due to a double murder involving Holbrook’s Clement Mansell.

Written by co-showrunners Michael Dinner and Dave Andron, the second episode of the two-episode premiere, “The Oklahoma Wildman,” ends with Raylan beating Mansell to a pulp for threatening Willa, and Holbrook wants to make it clear that this is only the beginning of the lawman’s showdown with his murderous conman.

“Clement can’t get enough of it. He loves it. He loves screwing around with this guy to a point, and then it gets a little too serious. But it is a totally different dynamic than Boyd Crowder [Walton Goggins]. Those guys knew each other, and there’s more longevity between the characters. Being that this is a limited series, the structure is built from the get-go that these guys are gonna collide.”

Below, during a spoiler-filled conversation with THR, Holbrook talks Indy and Justified, while also looking ahead to Jeff Nichols’ long-awaited sixth film, The Bikeriders, co-starring Tom Hardy, Austin Butler, Jodie Comer and Michael Shannon.



Well, it’s an exciting time for you right now.

Yeah, it is. I did a lot of things over the pandemic, and now they’re all bottlenecking.

When I last spoke to you for The Fugitive (2020), the key point you made was that you wouldn’t have said yes to the project if you were asked to play the fourth version of Dr. Richard Kimble. So when you were eventually cast in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny alongside the second Dr. Richard Kimble, Harrison Ford, I said to myself, “I bet Boyd is even more glad that he didn’t end up playing Richard Kimble.” Did that ever cross your mind once you knew you’d be working with Harrison?

Yeah, for sure. I wondered if he was aware of things and what he would say, because there’s always a predecessor to something. And I guess you always want a little bit of approval if you’re in it for the right reasons. But it never came up. We stuck to the business at hand. And watching Harrison work, there’s a reason why I had that initial reservation.

There’s even a stretch of the film where Indy is a fugitive and you’re the one chasing after him.

I didn’t even think about that. It’s funny how everything just gets thrown in a blender and all of our soups kind of come together.

Other actors have told me that you get over the Harrison Ford of it all rather quickly just because he’s pretty cool and whatnot. Was that your experience as well?

Absolutely. Harrison cuts the mustard, man! He gets it off the plate really quick. It’s like a construction site. That’s what I also love about Jim Mangold. He’s just very to the point; direct, blunt and has a good sense of humor while doing it, which makes for a great work environment. Harrison had this saying on set, “Alright, let’s shoot this piece of shit,” and it just cut the air out of everything. So we gave it 10 tries, two tries, 20 tries until we got it. And that’s what acting is all about.

When James Mangold came to you with this role, it was probably an easy sell on one level because it’s Harrison Ford’s final Indiana Jones movie. But the flip side is that you had just played another lead henchman of sorts for Jim in Logan. So did he carefully differentiate these guys to you, assuming you would probably notice the similarity?

You’re a hundred percent right. You hit the nail on the head, man. Jim called and said, “Listen, I don’t want to offend you, but have a look at it.” I don’t know if it was because of what the character did or who he’s associated with or the size of the part. We talked about doing another project before this, but I looked at it and it was Indiana Jones. So the character was a similar second-in-command bad guy who does all the bidding. That was the similarity, and that was my hesitation when I read it. But then there’s the pull of, “Wow, this is the last hurrah. This is the last run of Indiana Jones.” So I didn’t want to repeat anything for Jim, and we were very adamant about that.

I think the character was even written as German in the beginning, but I couldn’t figure out why this guy was hanging out with these neo-Nazis. Why was he not in Haight-Ashbury, smoking a spliff or something? (Laughs.) But then I got into it and thought, “Well, he wants to be a part of this gang or club because nobody else wants the guy. He’s just a vagrant mess.” And then he’s trying to learn German to fit in; he’s eager. So I just had to figure out how to humanize it and make a character that I could actually believe, instead of just the surface or veneer of whatever. So we talked a lot about that.

The term “trigger-happy” feels like an understatement in regard to Klaber, so he really did drink Voller’s Kool-Aid if he was that quick to kill for him.

Yeah, I thought about it as Voller being this enterprise that was starting up, and Klaber was getting equity in the startup as the first on board. So the loyalty and the dedication comes from, “Well, I’m gonna be first in line and at the top of the totem pole when we get to the new island.” He was a mad lapdog.

I based it all upon being accepted by Voller. It’s a classic archetype of approval. You’ve gotta find something real in there. Birds of a feather flock together, but I don’t think Voller’s ideology came first. I think Klaber was just desiring a real primitive acceptance that he’s never had. So, somebody didn’t love him.

Were you pretty blown away when you found out the characters would be time traveling to the Siege of Syracuse in 212 BC?

I was. I thought it was a bold, earned choice. It’s so cleverly speckled in throughout the film. Those seeds are planted, and it’s preparing you for it, subliminally. You don’t really know it until it’s happening and it’s so elegantly done that it’s not farcical whatsoever. It bottlenecks to a really touching moment where you feel that Indiana has earned this moment and wants to stay. When I saw it, I was surprised that it grabbed me by the throat. I was a little emotional even though I’m so close to it.

Many decades from now, what day on Dial of Destiny are you going to tell your grandkids about first?

Good question, bud. And God, there are a lot. You remind yourself every day that this is the last one, and so there’s a really special feeling that it puts off. There was a fantastic scene, and just watching Harrison work was a true master class. It’s mainly a scene between Dr. Schmidt [Voller’s American alias] and Indiana where he’s shot, and Dr. Schmidt is about to transform back into Voller. And Harrison just used the rocking motion of the [plane] to come up into this line of dialogue. So there were just moments like that that I got to be around all the time and soak up, and so it was a great experience. A real experience.

Before we get into Justified: City Primeval, I would love to hear about your time on The Bikeriders because I’m a Jeff Nichols fanatic.

Oh, I couldn’t be more excited about something. I did a little run here with The Sandman, Indiana Jones and then Justified, which was a dark period, I guess. That’s just the way it happened, but with The Bikeriders, it’s a totally different character and color to all of this other stuff that we’re talking about. And Jeff is a national treasure of a director. He is Americana filmmaking. He’s exceptional. We had a great cast, and it’s an excellent time in history. It’s the early ‘60s when biker clubs were getting put together and culture was really developing. It’s great. I’ve seen most of it, and it’s really good.

So, from one trigger-happy lunatic to the next one, we’ve now arrived at Justified’s Clement Mansell. He’s a sadistic killer and thief, but the oddest detail about him is that he’s apparently a musician who refuses to share demos of his own White Stripes covers with anyone but himself. Sandy said that he doesn’t play his stuff for her. Could you make sense of that?

Well, the reason why I got into the show was because a friend of mine who worked on season five asked me if all the same people were still involved, and I said yes. And he said, “Run, don’t walk, to the project.” So that [detail] wasn’t in the book. I don’t know which brilliant dude created it, whether it was [co-showrunner] Dave Andron, [co-showrunner] Michael Dinner or [EP] Graham Yost. But they gave Clement so much humanity. He just really thinks he’s gonna make it. He really thinks he’s this undiscovered talent. And when all of this stuff comes up about his past, he thinks it’ll just legitimize him as this outlaw, disillusioned singer. But he’s really just mentally ill.

Do you think he genuinely loves Sandy (Adelaide Clemens), or does he just need her for the game they run on wealthy marks?

He trusts Sandy. He can trust Sandy, and that’s a big thing. That’s got a lot of traction on it, but Sweety [Vondie Curtis-Hall] is the one that he admires. Sweety is somebody he really looks up to, because he’s done the things musically that he’s looking to do. So there’s a lot of great relationships in the show. It’s fantastic writing.

So was it a painful day when Quentin Tarantino had to drop out as director?

Yeah, that was tough. That was how I discovered the project. I was offered the part, and things happened. We had a great time, and I hope to still work with Quentin one day. That’d be great. I know [Justified] is one of his favorite shows, so hopefully he’ll be tuning in. But yeah, it was great, man. It was a great experience. I can’t really complain. Things happen.

In the first episode, Clement instigates a high-speed car chase involving guns, and it’s quite eerie considering a very similar real-life situation happened to cross paths with your set. Were you anywhere near this incident?

Yeah, I had wrapped up my scene, and it took place in between my scene and the next one up. So I was a couple football fields away, maybe. But these things happen in big cities, sometimes, and luckily, no one was hurt. Fiction does imitate life.

Well, in the second episode, Raylan confronts Clement in relation to the murders of a judge (Keith David) and his assistant. And then Clement declares war by seeking out and threatening Raylan’s daughter, Willa (Vivian Olyphant), without her realizing it. Raylan then proceeds to unload a few fists on him in retaliation. Was this encounter just the tip of the iceberg for what’s to come between them?

Yeah, Clement can’t get enough of it. He loves it. He loves screwing around with this guy to a point, and then it gets a little too serious. But it is a totally different dynamic than Boyd Crowder [Walton Goggins]. Those guys knew each other, and there’s more longevity between the characters. Being that this is a limited series, the structure is built from the get-go that these guys are gonna collide.

You’ve mentioned wanting to find humanity in both Klaber and Mansell, but could you really pull that off, especially with a guy like Mansell?

I dissect the script and figure out what I am getting out of it. If it has heart, then it has heart. If it’s not that, then what else is it? Because it can’t be one note. I don’t want to give one note. And the great thing about Justified is that it’s fucked up and funny. That balances the show out.

,Harrison Ford Jokes Wife Calista Flockhart Is 'Still Giving Me S---' for Recent Curse-Filled Interview,"While speaking with 'Esquire' about the upcoming movie 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,' Harrison Ford referenced his wife Calista Flockhart's reaction to his February interview with 'The Hollywood Reporter,' in which he used a significant amount of colorful language","Harrison Ford says his wife Calista Flockhart is taking note of his tendency to curse during interviews.

While speaking with Esquire for a cover interview published Wednesday, Ford, 80, used the phrase “f------ A,” at one point during a conversation about his long-held interest in aviation, prompting him to reference his February interview with The Hollywood Reporter, in which he utilized some crude language while promoting his Apple TV+ show Shrinking.

“Hey, if you don’t mind, leave the ‘f------ A’ out,"" Ford, now promoting the latest Indiana Jones movie, said. ""My wife is still giving me s--- about that Hollywood Reporter thing, and I’m trying not to say that too much.""

“Me and the writer were sitting on folding chairs in a horse stall. It didn’t feel like a formal enough atmosphere to have to clean up my language,” he added to Esquire. “And they printed every single f---.""



As Ford's iconic Indiana Jones character embarks on his final adventure in the upcoming Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the actor told the outlet that he reprised the role one last time — and for the first time since 2008's Kingdom of the Crystal Skull — to give an ""ambitious"" send-off for the character.

“I wanted an ambitious movie to be the last one,” he told the outlet. “And I don’t mean that we didn’t make ambitious movies before—they were ambitious in many different ways. But not necessarily as ambitious with the character as I wanted the last one to be.""

Ford has been busy as of late, between trying out television roles with Shrinking and 1923 and replacing the late William Hurt in upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, including the next Captain America film.

2023-07-07 22:01:50+00:00,‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Reused This ‘Force Awakens’ Plotline,Comparisons between the newest Indiana Jones film and the Star Wars sequel trilogy were inevitable.,"Comparisons between the newest Indiana Jones film and the Star Wars sequel trilogy were inevitable. However, I am certainly feeling a bit of déjà vu when it comes to the storyline. Specifically, the many ways in which Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’s plot resembles that of The Force Awakens.

The plot

Both Dial of Destiny and The Force Awakens revolve around Harrison Ford’s character losing his son and the resulting dissolution of his marriage with his brunette wife. As a result, Ford’s character starts both films a bit miserable and washed-up with only a few good friends left, longing for the days of his youth.

Despite his grumpiness, he still gets pulled into an adventure when some young people follow in his character’s footsteps, forcing him to be a mentor / surrogate father to them as a replacement for the child he lost.

Unoriginal or intentional?

The first accusation concerning this plotline is that it’s unoriginal and therefore bad. However, I would also point out that many aspects of this plot are aspects of the “requel” (or legacy sequel) as a whole; Logan, Scream (2022), and Halloween (2018) featured plotlines about failed marriages or estranged children that the hero must come to terms with while guiding the next generation.

These requel plotlines mostly explore how being a hero or protagonist is not conducive to maintaining family bonds and often leaves the hero alone and bitter now that they’ve survived to old age. Requels also analyze the physical toll of heroics, with many legacy heroes struggling with the realities of aging.

In many ways, the film borrows from Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as much as it borrows from The Force Awakens, only this time, the young person Indy is mentoring is his goddaughter and not his biological son. Personally, I think Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Helena is a great foil for Indiana; she reflects a lot of his worst tendencies back at him, from grave-robbing to recklessness and willful child endangerment.

What makes Dial of Destiny unique is that Jones survives the film, saved from his own self-destructive tendencies thanks to the intervention of his goddaughter. This breaks the trend of “passing the torch” to the next generation via the older hero sacrificing themselves, and arguably thumbs its nose at how self-sacrifice in many films is actually just thinly veiled self-destruction.

If anything, the last shot in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny—of Indy grabbing his hat from where it hangs on his balcony—shows that the great adventurer’s journey is not yet over.

What “requel” / legacy sequel do you think did this plot the best? Comment below!

Harrison Ford has addressed the long wait fans have faced in getting the fifth and final film, ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.""

The film, set to be released in theaters on June 30, marks Ford's final farewell to the franchise and comes 15 years after ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.""

Speaking to Digital Spy, Ford addressed the 15-year gap between the fourth and fifth ""Indiana Jones"" films, revealing that there weren't immediate plans for a followup after ""Crystal Skull"" was released in 2008.

""Well, it wasn't as though we sat around for 10 years waiting to come up with an idea,"" he said.

""When we finished the last film, I don't think anybody thought about going and doing another film for some time.""

""Crystal Skull"" is considered by many to be the worst film in the franchise and currently holds a 53% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. Adjusted for inflation, it has the lowest box office gross of any movie in the franchise, according to Box Office Mojo.

The 80-year-old actor said that in the last few years, ""there were some interesting ideas that were floated"" for a fifth movie, but ultimately they ""didn't quite gel over a period of time.""

""And then we found an idea, and a script, and a strong story that we wanted to tell,"" he said of ""Dial of Destiny"" which is directed by James Mangold and cowritten by Mangold, Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and David Koepp.

Ford said that he was ""very happy"" with the story of the new film in which the archaeologist adventurer is joined by his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), in a race against time to retrieve a legendary dial that can change the course of history.

Taking place against the backdrop of the 1960s space race, the sequel sees Indy going head-to-head with a former Nazi scientist (Mads Mikkelsen) and also stars ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" alumni John Rhys-Davies and Karen Allen.

Ford said: ""We're coming to the end of Indiana Jones's time on the planet, and I wanted to see a conclusion of his story that accommodated the reality of his age, and what that effect has on this person that we've come to know over the years.""

He added that when it came time to hang up Indy's iconic fedora and whip for the last time, he ""felt a sense of peace, a sense of contentment.""

""The feeling I had is the feeling you have when you've made something, and you can look at it, or you can remember having made it, the satisfaction of putting work in, and getting something worthy out of it,"" he said, adding that the story has ""concluded in a way that really felt satisfying to me.""

2023-06-30 14:02:44+00:00,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Is a Failure,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a fiasco for two reasons. Admittedly, one reason is purely personal, and so that’s on me.","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a fiasco for two reasons. Admittedly, one reason is purely personal, and so that’s on me. The other, though, is totally the movie’s fault.

Dial of Destiny is the fifth movie in the Indiana Jones franchise, an action-adventure series that began and seemingly ended in the ‘80s as a perfectly self-contained trilogy. The third film was even subtitled The Last Crusade and featured our intrepid, titular hero riding off into the sunset. Nothing else needed to be said, right?

19 years after the “final” 1989 theatrical adventure, the original creative trio–series creator George Lucas, director Steven Spielberg, and star, Harrison Ford–all returned for another Indy adventure only to prove that no, nothing else needed to be said about the character.

So here we are, another 15 years later and another go at an Indy adventure, this time with only minimal involvement from Lucas and Spielberg. I hoped this movie’s existence was based on course correcting from the last adventure, an apology for what went wrong the last time. I mean, Harrison Ford is 80 years old, what else could sway him to once again don Indiana Jones’s iconic fedora, leather jacket, and whip?

Money, probably.

But I’m not that cynical. Harrison Ford has plenty of that (…money, I mean, though a healthy dose of cynicism as well, it seems). Plus, his grouchy demeanor and apparent displeasure at being on movie sets, preclude him from doing something solely for the cash.

My hopes for Dial of Destiny’s course correction were dashed almost immediately, though. The original trilogy of films had muscular action sequences with real stunts: dudes dragged underneath trucks, jumping from a horse to a real tank, actual motorcycles careening off cliffs with stuntpersons freefalling through the air.

Dial of Destiny kicks off with a twenty-minute sequence featuring a (*sigh*) de-aged Harrison Ford. Motionless, the effect is quite good. Lots of details on the face. Once things start moving, though, all bets are off. It looks painfully awkward: a too big head on a normal size body, a weird cg blur over the face. The opening sequence’s main event is a lengthy chase/fight on a train. The entire sequence is accomplished through thoroughly unconvincing CG. Worse, the avalanche of computer graphics completely erases any semblance of danger, which wipes out all hopes for excitement. On the big screen were explosions, gunfights, John Williams’s iconic score blaring in the background; in the auditorium, a dude started vaping. Not a good sign.

Even moving to its present day of the 1960s, the whole movie is shellacked in a thick miasma of CG. But the computer graphics imagery isn’t the movie’s real dilemma. The problem here is the director, James Mangold. He simply doesn’t have a feel for action. As befits an Indiana Jones movie, Dial of Destiny is filled with it–mostly chases on a variety of vehicles both organic and in-, mostly I assume because Harrison Ford is too old to be involved in any other kind of action–but they’re largely pointless endeavors because they lack narrative drive or reason. The chases begin and end seemingly at random. It’s never clear who’s chasing whom and why, and they don’t build to anything. Mostly, they just…end. They’re just there to fill the setpiece quota expected from an Indiana Jones film.

So much of the movie does just that: fill a quota. Since the original Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones is known to hate snakes, and so he had to face a tomb full of them in that first film. So what do we have here? Indiana facing eels under water. In Temple of Doom, Indiana had to face a room infested with bugs, so Dial has to have a sequence with bugs also. And again, like the action sequences, none of these moments are presented with any aplomb. Remember how the bug sequence in Doom kept escalating? The ceiling began lowering, threatening to crush our protagonist while squeezing even more bugs onto him. Then someone had to stick their hand into a hole swarming with even more creepy crawlys to pull a lever and stop the crushing. It built tension, anxiety, and the audience’s gag-reflex. Here, in the fifth film, the bugs show up, crawl on our hero a bit, and just as quickly disappear when he turns a corner. How are the bugs in only one small section of a cave? They read the script, obviously. The same happens with the eel sequence. They show up without build-up, harass only Indiana for some reason and not his diving mates (like Steve Zissou and his leeches), and then just disappear.

Add a painful repetitiveness to the general lackluster presentation and you have yourself one lame-duck adventure movie (Do me a favor, count how many times an innocent person is threatened with a gun to the face during the film’s runtime). What really grinds my gears about the film, though, is that its very existence stands in direct contrast to what the Indiana Jones movies were made for in the first place. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg loved the heroes (square jawed, indestructible) of matinee adventure serials (think Zorro, Lone Ranger…) of their youth. Indiana Jones was their homage to those heroes and movies. They were built to be pure action-adventure escapism. An 80-year-old Indiana Jones, grappling with old age, the death of loved ones, feelings of uselessness and alienation from a society that’s moving on without him is bold, yes, and preferrable to pretending he’s still a spring chicken, but it’s antithetical to what the character of Indiana Jones was created for.

It’s a bait and switch. I’m at the tail end of 45 years on this earth. Every day I’m reminded that I’m getting older. It sucks. I need escapism more than ever. Indiana Jones by its very nature is an explicit promise of that break from reality. Instead, this new “adventure” gives you a dour two plus hours that reminds you with every passing frame of the ravages of age. I would say it’s time for this franchise to hang up its fedora for good, but it never should have picked it back up in first place.

,Harrison Ford Addresses That Age-Old Rumor That He Stapled His ‘Indiana Jones’ Hat to His Head During Filming,"Harrison Ford reflected on Indiana Jones' iconic costume in a new interview with GQ, in which he talked about stapling the character's hat to his head.","Harrison Ford is spilling the beans about Indiana Jones' wardrobe staples.

The 80-year-old actor said that during his stint as the franchise’s titular archaeologist — which he reprised one last time for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny this year — he had to use an unusual method to keep his iconic hat from flying off.

In a GQ video about the bullwhip-wielding character's legacy, behind-the-scenes footage from the first Indiana Jones installment shows a young Ford stapling Indy’s signature pinch-front fedora to his forehead.

“That should do it,” he says in the clip from the Raiders of the Lost Ark set.

When a GQ staffer mentions the video to Ford, the actor motions to a spot near his hairline, saying, “I still have the [scar], see it?”

“You do what you need to do,” he told the interviewer.

Ford also reflected on other aspects of his iconic Indiana Jones ensemble, which he said he had a lot of initial qualms about.

""It was presented to me as [an] aspect of character in the first film,"" he said in the video. “My questions about it were many.”

He went on to list some of his costume queries: “Why am I wearing a leather jacket in the jungle? Isn't it hot here? Why am I carrying a whip? What am I gonna do with a f------ whip? Are you gonna whip people?”

The Star Wars actor went on to say that he was told, presumably by someone in the 1981 film’s wardrobe department, that the archaeologist's outfit was “an evocation of a time period” and “reflection of movies past.”

The star added that despite his initial hesitation, he said “okay” to wearing the now-iconic 'fit, which, according to him, “makes it my own.”

Ford’s final go-around as Indy has led to some nostalgic and touching moments, including an interview in which he appeared to momentarily choke up when a journalist thanked him on behalf of Indiana Jones fans and telling him, “You mean the world to us.”

“And I must say to you, thank you, sincerely,"" Ford responded in the BBC Radio 1 interview. ""It means the world to me.”

The actor went on to say that the franchise is “peopled with some of the most amazing actors and characters and the stories are so compelling and they mix adventure and humor and heart,” and that he admires ""the depth and the subtlety of the emotion, and the importance of emotion in these films.""

""As this one concerns age and frailty and changing nature of life, it was especially compelling to me because I am of that age and I wanted it to feel real for the audience,"" Ford said of Dial of Destiny. ""I wanted them to see the complexity of that experience with someone they spent 40 years with.”

,Indiana Jones: Car buyer discovers new motor stars in film,The new owner of a classic car says he did not realise it had been driven by A-lister Harrison Ford.,"Indiana Jones: Car buyer discovers new motor stars in film

By Pritti Mistry BBC News

Martin Ward

The car was used in a car chase scene with Harrison Ford in the driving seat

A motoring journalist who bought a Fiat 500 was amazed to discover his new wheels star in a car chase in the new Indiana Jones film.

Martin Ward, from Huddersfield, said he bought the 1964 classic vehicle six weeks ago from a specialist dealer.

But unbeknown to him at the time, the car had been driven by Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Mr Ward said.

""I think it's great and it just makes me smile,"" he said.

""You hear about the car's the star, I think in the film this little car - along with one or two others - really will be the star of the movie.""

Ford, 78, stars alongside Fleabag writer and actor Phoebe Waller-Bridge in the latest Indiana Jones instalment, which comes 40 years after Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first film in the series.

Mr Ward, a classic car enthusiast, said he was aware the car had been previously used by Pinewood Studios but he did not know for which film.

He said he later found out it was used in a car chase scene with Ford at the wheel and Waller-Bridge, who plays his goddaughter, in the passenger seat.

""It's going to be probably the most viewed Fiat 500 ever in the world,"" he said.

""It's just a nice history. I mean the car is a classic anyway, the Fiat 500 is really very collectible.

""But that sort of history with it, that it's been in a film driven by Harrison Ford; Phoebe Waller Bridge sat next to him in a chase in [Sicily].

""I just think it makes what is a very special car into something even more special. I just love it.""

Mr Ward said number plates of the Fiat 500 in the film - released in the UK on Wednesday - matched that of his vehicle, which corroborated they were the same car.

""This little car that spent most of his 50-plus years of its life in Italy now ends up in Huddersfield, Yorkshire.

""You don't have to drive it. I feel happy just sat in it, looking at it and touching everything, because it really is immaculate.

""Everywhere I go people just stop and stare at this little thing. I think because it's in such good condition.

Most would describe actor Harrison Ford‘s approach to life as ‘dry wit.’ He’s sarcastically stoic in many of his most iconic roles, like Han Solo in the Star Wars series and, of course, Indiana Jones. Every Ford fan is dying to see the newest installment in the Indiana Jones film franchise, and finally, Dial of Destiny debuts in theaters tonight and is fully released tomorrow! Disney and Lucasfilm have done a bunch of promotions for Indiana Jones 5, but you can’t help but smile at this latest video featuring Indiana Jones action figures.

Lucasfilm uploaded an absolutely adorable video to YouTube featuring Harrison Ford and Dial of Destiny co-star Phoebe Waller-Bridge. With the Indiana Jones soundtrack playing in the background, the video opens on a table holding action figures of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones and Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Helena Shaw. The dolls are surrounded by the Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Lego set.

The first question the director asks the co-stars is, “Did they get the likeness okay?” After inspecting his figure on the table, Harrison Ford replies, “I’m actually bigger than that.” Hilarious. Classic Harrison Ford. Phoebe and the crew laugh as Ford gives a shrugging smirk.

Waller-Bridge is impressed at all the different Indy figures from all the different ages. She lists out Lego Indy, Big Indy, and Car Whipping Indy. You’ll have to watch the video to see what she’s referring to. She asks which of those three Ford feels most drawn to, and he replies casually but CLEARLY into it, “The biggest one.” Waller-Bridge does a Fleabag-style reaction to the cameras.

Later, Phoebe can’t get her action figure to stand up, and they wonder if Indy’s hat can come off. Ford nearly removes the doll’s head when he tries. Perhaps the cutest part of the interview is when Ford and Waller-Bridge march the action figures around while they sing Indiana Jones’ iconic theme music.

The video ends with intercut scenes from the new Indiana Jones movie, but you have to watch the hilarity for yourself below!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpc25leWRpbmluZy5jb20vaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC1pcy1hY3R1YWxseS1zby1jdXRlLXBsYXlpbmctd2l0aC1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLXRveXMtbGYxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

A stunt performer who performed in the latest Indiana Jones film set himself alight at a recent actors’ strike rally.

Mike Massa, who body doubled for Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, appeared on stage during the ongoing Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) protests on Monday (24 July).

Actors and performers withdrew their labour from film and TV productions on 13 July in order to achieve, among other requests, fairer wages and greater protections against the use of AI in the industry.

As seen in a video posted on Instagram, Massa walks in front of the crowd as his blazer and trouser leg are on fire. He is seen to pump his fist upward as the audience cheers him on.

Massa shared the footage in a joint Instagram post with fellow stunt actor Elena Sanchez. They directed their ire at Hollywood bosses, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), in a caption. “We are tired of being burned by the AMPTP,” their message reads.

Other union performers and Hollywood employees on the ground applauded the eye-catching stunt. Massa’s actions have also garnered support online.

“For putting your life on the line for stunts, you deserve more residuals and protection from AI replicas too,” reads one comment on the post.

Another supporter noted that his actions were “proving stunt people would rather get burned for real than the metaphorical getting burned by the studios”.

“Bravo. Way to bring in the HEAT,” reads one comment, while another person added: “You’re on fire brother!”

Actors and performers began striking earlier this month, following film and TV writers who have been protesting since May.

This marks the first time that both actors and the Writers’ Guild of America (WGA) have been out of action simultaneously in 60 years. With writers nor performers able to work on any productions, including participating in any promotional work, these strikes have effectively shut down Hollywood.

Elsewhere, Dwayne Johnson reportedly donated a “seven-figure” amount to the union, as a way to help performers who will be hit hardest during the strikes.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL2FydHMtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9maWxtcy9uZXdzL2hhcnJpc29uLWZvcmQtc3R1bnQtZG91YmxlLXN0cmlrZS1maXJlLWIyMzgyMDYwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-25 13:14:00+00:00,"In 'The Dial of Destiny,' Indiana Jones Wears a Watch for the First Time Ever",And it's a Hamilton.,"Hamilton watches have appeared in hundreds of Hollywood movies. Now, the latest installment of the iconic Indiana Jones franchise, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, joins the ever-expanding . As watch fans, we can't help but wonder if the watch itself is significant, based on that title — and the fact that Harrison Ford's beloved character hasn't previously worn a watch at all.

We won't know until the movie debuts on June 30 (and until we've seen it) exactly how the watch factors into the story or what kind of screen time it'll get. But we do know what watch it is: it's the Hamilton Boulton Quartz, the modern version of which was released in 2018. (Apparently, there will also be a Hamilton Khaki Navy Scuba watch making an appearance on the wrist of actor Antonio Banderas.)

Harrison Ford’s character has always had a distinct style, but it hasn’t included a wristwatch — causing some watch-forum nerds to speculate on what he would wear. Now they finally have an answer. CBS Photo Archive Getty Images

With the film set in 1969 (excluding flashbacks), a quartz watch wouldn't be historically accurate, but the vintage (mechanical) watch it's based on came out decades before (in the 1940s) and so would certainly be plausible as a choice for the character. Think of it this way: just as Indiana Jones is played by Harrison Ford, the historical Hamilton Boulton watch is portrayed by a modern quartz Boulton.



We will, however, be checking to see if the watch features a ticking seconds hand in the movie — in which case we'll stand up in the theater and start yelling at the screen, naturally. It'll be hard to spot, since the Boulton Quartz features a small seconds subdial, just like the vintage watches — such a trait always makes the seconds hand's motion more difficult to detect than watches with large central seconds hands, even when you see them in person.

The Hamilton Boulton is nicely sized at 27mm wide by 41.5mm long and, thanks to its quartz movement, nice and thin at only 7.8mm thick. Hamilton Watch

Sure, the film's prop master could have chosen the ($895), which has a sweeping center seconds hand, but the quartz version is the more stylistically accurate. The Quartz is also smaller and thinner (27mm wide by 41.5mm long and 7.8mm thick), and most watches of the time would have been small by our modern standards.

The film's costume designer can't be faulted for the choice. We feel it fits the era and the character well, and this particular version with its gold-toned steel case will match Indy's khaki and leather ensembles. We like the Boulton style for everyday wear, too — it offers a look that's uncommon today and a great alternative to dressy, ""shaped"" watches like the Cartier Tank.

If you fancy yourself an intrepid archaeologist, or just like the Boulton's style, you can get your own version direct from Hamilton — whip and fedora not included.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlYXJwYXRyb2wuY29tL3dhdGNoZXMvYTQ0MjcwNzYzL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LWhhbWlsdG9uLWJvdWx0b24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Review,Sonny Bunch reviews the latest Indiana Jones movie and finds that the problems start before the action does.,"Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (Courtesy of Walt Disney Pictures)

THIS IS GOING TO SOUND LIKE A SILLY, petty complaint. And maybe it is. But you get a glimpse of everything that’s wrong with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny in the opening moments. Specifically, the order of the credited production companies. Even more specifically: the refusal to start the film as every other Indiana Jones movie has started: by dissolving from the Paramount logo to a mountain or mountain-like shape on the screen.

You know what I mean: going from the logo’s rendering of the Ben Lomond Mountain to a peak in South America in Raiders, or an engraving on a gong at the start of the musical sequence in Temple, or the butte in the American Southwest at the start of Last Crusade. Even Crystal Skull kept the gag going, though its rendering—a poorly animated gopher hole—betrayed some of that film’s problems as well.

It’s a little thing—one might even call it hokey—but it’s important because it sets the whole mood. This is a movie, that dissolve says. Not just any kind of movie. An old-timey action-adventure romp of the sort we, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, grew up watching. Go get your nickel’s worth of popcorn and kick up your feet.

Dial of Destiny doesn’t start on that dissolve because it can’t start on that dissolve because starting on that dissolve would defeat the entire purpose of this picture: for Disney to lay claim to the Indiana Jones property and all it stands for going forward. That’s why Lucasfilm and Disney share the first title card. Paramount gets the next one—an “in association with” credit, adding insult to injury—and one can only imagine the negotiations that went into securing that, as Paramount is no longer the distributor of these films.

Again: this is potentially dumb and possibly petty, but for a movie that is almost purely a nostalgia play—and a frequently charming one at that—it’s a sour note to start on. I couldn’t help but feel the same sort of pang I felt when John Williams’s opening Star Wars theme blared out of the theater speakers during The Force Awakens without the 20th Century Fox fanfare preceding it. The movie felt … naked. Exposed. It’s just wrong.

Anyway. After a prelude in World War II during which a de-aged Harrison Ford fights with Nazis for control of an ancient artifact supposedly built by Archimedes, the titular dial, we move to the late 1960s. The Beatles are on the radio. Ticker tape litters the street, as astronauts take their victory lap. Indiana Jones (Ford) lives alone in a messy one-bedroom, passed out in his easy chair, annoyed by the kids making a racket down the hall. A quick pan shows everything we need to know: a folded flag by a photo of a boy in uniform, presumably Mutt (Shia LaBeouf in the fourth movie), rests next to a faded picture of Indy’s dad (Sean Connery in the third). The sad story of this little apartment practically tells itself.

Indy—he of Arks and Temples and Crusades—is about to retire in lonely obscurity. On his way out the door, he’s stopped for drinks by his goddaughter, Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), who has some questions about the Antikythera, the Greek name for the eponymous dial. Where she might find the other half, for starters. So she can sell it. (She believes in the importance of museums a bit less than her godfather, particularly since she has some debts to pay.) A bit of hubbub later, and Indy and Helena are off to track down the Antikythera in its entirety, racing with Nazi physicist-turned-U.S.-rocket-scientist Dr. Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen).

I won’t talk much more about the plot; you deserve to see if the film’s big swing connects or not. What I will say is that it rides much less smoothly than Raiders of the Lost Ark, a perfect movie that just zips along from scene to scene and moment to moment, or Last Crusade, which is nearly as efficient. At more than two and a half hours, the picture drags, though it’s never quite boring. Ford remains incredibly charismatic, even as the broken, somewhat-hangdog Indy, and his repartee with Waller-Bridge is natural. Sallah’s (John Rhys-Davies) back! Antonio Banderas plays a diver pal of Indy’s! We may be missing the Paramount peaks, but there’s still a mountain of charm on the screen.

I just don’t think that’s quite enough. Dial of Destiny has the same problem that Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had: It looks phony throughout, and not only during effects-heavy scenes. I can’t tell if we’ve regressed when it comes to the technology of rear projection and green screen or what, but the sequences in which people are driving simply look fake, poorly done, the lighting and shadow and shading all wrong. At least with Crystal Skull we still had Spielberg behind the camera, meaning there’s a motion, a liveliness, a vibrancy to the proceedings. James Mangold is a solid, competent director—and there are moments, as in that aforementioned pan across the apartment, when you appreciate his restraint—but he’s not Spielberg. He doesn’t have that innate sense of visual movement or the ability to translate it to the big screen. No one does.

The only reason for this film to exist, then, is as an exercise in intellectual property propagation. Indy already got his sendoff in Crystal Skull; they even nodded at the passing of the torch to come. But now the character’s owned by a new distributor with new priorities. And so, Indiana Jones is pressed into duty once again at the behest of the raiders of the lost IP. When their faces melt at the sight of the nine-figure loss headed their way, one imagines they’ll wish they never tried to turn back time.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vcGx1cy50aGVidWx3YXJrLmNvbS9wL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The fifth and final film in the series and the first to not be directed by Steven Spielberg — he handed the baton to James Mangold — Dial of Destiny embraces the rich mythology that stems from the 1981 original Raiders of the Lost Ark, while making allowances that even Indiana Jones must age and his search becomes about solace and inner peace, after all those wild archaeological adventures. In his way is the need to thwart one last attempt by the Nazis to use a time travel invention by Archimedes to change history and once again plunge the world into darkness.

2023-07-06 20:35:00.730000+00:00,Now’s A Great Time To Play This Classic Indiana Jones Game,"With a new Indiana Jones movie in theaters, let’s remember the greatness of The Fate of Atlantis","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is now in theaters, finding Harrison Ford’s swashbuckling archaeologist returning to the big screen for one last (?) adventure. And boy, do people have opinions on this movie. I rather liked it (careful, my letterboxd review has spoilers); my friend, the great film critic Walter Chaw, hated it; and many a right-wing YouTube “film critic” is railing against it as the latest manifestation of Hollywood’s “woke agenda.” But even most of us who do like it don’t think it quite recaptures the magic of Indy’s greatest adventures. Y’know, I’m talkin’ stuff like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and, of course, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis. What’s that? You’re not familiar with that last one? Well, there’s no better time than now to experience one of the greatest point-and-click adventure games—and one of the greatest Indiana Jones tales—of all time.



The year was 1992. Indiana Jones had literally ridden off into the sunset at the end of 1989’s Last Crusade, and for all we knew, we’d never see Harrison Ford don the hat and wield the whip again. But this was also the era in which LucasArts was rapidly establishing itself as a major player in the point-and-click adventure game field, The previous two years had brought us the one-two punch of The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge, games which threatened Sierra’s long-held dominance of the genre by operating under a totally different design philosophy. While Sierra’s games routinely killed you at every opportunity, urging you to “save early, save often,” LucasArts’ adventures encouraged you to try anything and everything. Go ahead, say that dialogue choice you wouldn’t dream of saying in real life. It’ll be fine!

Indiana Jones® and the Fate of Atlantis™

So even if we couldn’t have another movie, that was no reason Indiana Jones’ academic pursuits couldn’t continue in games. But could a point-and-click adventure by LucasArts where dying was rarely a possibility actually capture the tone of the movies, which are full of death-defying action? Indeed it could, it turns out, thanks to the story, dialogue, and game design, all of which manage to wonderfully evoke the globe-hopping, Nazi-punching spirit of Indy’s escapades.

Like the films, Fate of Atlantis is of course fantasy, but there’s just enough of a historical basis to its fantasy to lend it an air of archaeological legitimacy. It’s 1939, and the Nazis are seeking the power of Atlantis to aid them in their nefarious plans. If Indy’s going to thwart them, he’ll need to find the Lost Dialogue of Plato, which may actually exist or have existed at some point. (Orichalcum, a metal mentioned in several actual ancient writings including Plato’s writings on Atlantis, plays a key role in the story as well.) And as you’d expect for an Indiana Jones adventure, your quest to track down the clues to Atlantis’ location and the secrets of its true power takes you all over the world, from New York to Iceland, from Monte Carlo to Crete. All the while, the game’s gorgeous pixel art has you feeling the 1930s atmosphere and stunning natural beauty of its varied locations.

The adventure’s middle section even has three distinct paths you can take, called Team, Wits, and Fists. The first emphasizes Indy’s testy, flirtatious dynamic with his companion, a woman named Sophia Hapgood. The second puts a focus on some pretty tough adventure game puzzles, while the third sees Indy punching his way through many situations. (Some of those puzzles had me stumped for a while as a youngster, but there’s a discernible logic to all of them, and when I finally did solve them, it felt great.) Each of these paths feel consistent with the character as we’ve come to know him from the films, and they lend the game some replay value, which is a rarity in the point-and-click genre.



Whatever path you pursue, Fate of Atlantis builds up to a memorable showdown with Nazis that earns its place alongside the climaxes of Indy’s greatest adventures. So if Dial of Destiny has you craving more Indy, whether because you loved it or because you hated it, you owe it to yourself to experience this gem. I want to punch a Nazi just thinking about it.

2023-06-29 13:46:13+00:00,Everything you need to know about Indiana Jones in Glasgow,Scotland's biggest city stands in for New York in one of the summer's biggest blockbusters.,"Scotland's biggest city stands in for New York in one of the summer's biggest blockbusters.

For a few days back in July 2021 visitors to Glasgow's City Centre were able to walk down a street taken straight from 1960s New York thanks to filming for the fifth in the Indiana Jones series of films.

Almost exactly two years later cinema audiences can see the results on the big screen, with Glasgow's Cineworld Renfield Street just a five minute walk away from the set.

No expense was spared for the shooting of the film which, at an estimated $295 million budget, is one of the most costliest ever made.

Here's everything you need to know about Glasgow's part in movie history.

Where was Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny filmed?

In Glasgow, shooting took place in the city centre in St Vincent Street, Cochrane Street and the City Chambers.

Other UK locations used included Bamburgh, Bamburgh Castle, Holy Island, North Yorkshire Moors Railway and Pinewood Studios.

The filmmakers also shot scened in Marsala, in Italy, and Morocco.

What is the plot of Dial of Destiny?

The latest Indiana Jones film sees Harrison Ford's adventuring archaeologist set out to find the fabled Archimedes Dial, on object that is capable of changing the course of history. Helped by his goddaughter, played by Phoebe Waller-Bridges, he has to make sure he finds the item for former Nazi Jürgen Voller, who is now working for NASA.

What scene is set in Glasgow?

The scene to look out for is just after Indy and goddaughter Helena have retrieved the first piece of the Archimedes Dial from a university storeroom - only to be attacked by Voller. When Indiana Jones escapes into a parade on the streets of New York celebrating the Apollo 11 astronauts (the first men to walk on the moon) that's Glasgow not the Big Apple. He then escapes into the subway before getting help from an old friend who is now a taxi driver.

Who is in the cast?

Aside from Harrison Ford and Phoebe Waller-Bridges, Dial of Destiny sees the return of Karen Allen as Indy's long-suffering wife Marion. Other big names in the cast are Antonio Banderas, Toby Jones and Mads Mikkelsen.

What other films have been shot in Glasgow?

Indiana Jones isn't the only big budget film that has been shot in Glasgow . The city stands in for Gotham City in The Flash - which is also in cinemas at the moment.

Other big films that have used the city include 1917, Fast & Furious 6, Cloud Atlas, The Dark Knight Rises, The Eagle, and World War Z.

Batgirl was also shot in Glasgow, but was pulled at the last moment and has yet to see the light of day.

,New Indiana Jones: Den of Destiny Bar at Disney’s Hollywood Studios,,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny will arrive in theaters on June 30, 2023. In anticipation of the opening, a new limited-time beverage outpost has opened at Disney’s Hollywood Studios.

The new bar is located in the former Indiana Jones Adventure Outpost store, which closed in March 2020. It is near the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular attraction, just off Echo Lake.

The former Indiana Jones Adventure Outpost store contained some themed elements which remain, but props from the new film have been added, primarily housed within glass cases. The Den of Destiny promises “rare antiquities” and “refreshing libations.”

Guests will recognize some costume items within the bar, including Indy’s iconic fedora. You can view movie props and curiosities while preparing to place your order.

Two adult cocktails are available for purchase at the bar: The Adventures Margarita and The Weathered Fedora, in addition to draft beers Lost Coast Tangerine Wheat Ale, and Cigar City Jai Alai IPA. A non-alcoholic beverage L’Atlantique Green Tea is an option as well.

Maps and travel posters dot the walls. Some of the same art can also be found at Jock Lindsay’s Hangar Bar at Disney Springs. The Den of Destiny opens daily at 10:00 am through August 15.

There are some stand-up tables in the shade available for guests. The bar was most recently the location for a Chip & Dale Rescue Rangers Meet & Greet. Chip and Dale have been relocated to make room for The Den of Destiny.

7/1/2023 14:56,Karen Allen on one last hurrah as Marion Ravenwood in ‘Indiana Jones: Dial of Destiny’,"Karen Allen's cameo in the last “Indiana Jones"" is finally out of the bag.","NEW YORK (AP) — Indiana Jones. Karen Allen always knew he’d come walking back through her door.

Since 1981’s “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” Allen has been only a sporadic presence in the subsequent sequels. But the glow of the freckled, big-eyed actor who so memorably played Marion Ravenwood has only grown stronger over time.

Indiana Jones may be one of the movies’ most iconic characters, but he’s always needed a good foil. It was Kate Capshaw and Ke Huy Quan in “Temple of Doom” and Sean Connery in “The Last Crusade.” Yet none could top, or out drink, Allen’s Marion, a wisecracking, naturalistic beauty and swashbuckling heir to screwball legends like Katharine Hepburn and Irene Dunne.

Allen’s place in the latest and last “Indiana Jones,” the just-released “Dial of Destiny,” has long been a mystery. Now that the movie is in theaters — spoiler alert — we can finally let the cat out of the bag. Allen returns. And while her role isn’t large — tragedy has driven Marion and Indiana apart — it’s extremely poignant in how she figures into Harrison Ford’s swan song as Indiana Jones.

“Secrets,” Allen chuckled in a recent interview, “are not my specialty.”

Allen, 71, was a magnetic presence in some memorable 1970s and ‘80s films, including 1978’s “Animal House” (the performance that caught Steven Spielberg’s eye), 1984’s “Starman” and 1988’s “Scrooged.” But while she’s steadily worked ever since, the era’s male-dominated Hollywood often seemed to squander her talent. Allen has lived for decades in the Berkshires, where she opened a textiles and clothing boutique and has frequently performed at Tanglewood.

Allen also returned to Marion in 2008’s “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.” But as much as “Dial of Destiny” signifies the end of Ford’s run as Indy, it’s also Allen’s goodbye to her most beloved character. This time, Indiana’s sidekick went to Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the “Fleabag” creator and star. Allen, praising Waller-Bridge as a strong woman, approves.

“If it wasn’t going to be me,” said Allen, “I’m glad it was her.”

___

AP: Did Spielberg or “Dial of Destiny” director James Mangold reach out to you about returning as Marion?

ALLEN: There was a period of time when Steven was going to direct the film. It was my understanding — although I never read any of those scripts — that it was being developed very much as a still-ongoing Marion-and-Indy story. When Steven decided to step down and James took over and brought in new writers, I knew it was going into a different direction. Having not even known what it was before, it was even more mysterious after they took it over. So I really didn’t know anything for a long period of time until they had a script. And I have to confess, I was a bit disappointed that she wasn’t more woven throughout the story and didn’t have more of an ongoing trajectory. However, the way in which she does come back into the story was very satisfying. I just thought, “OK, I’m just going to embrace this.” I certainly would have been wildly disappointed had Marion just sort of vanished into the ether.

AP: Did you always think Marion and Indiana were destined for each other? You don’t exactly get a sense of permanence between them in “Raiders.”

ALLEN: It’s funny. When I first started working on it, I just decided that Indy was the love of her life. I just decided to make a deep commitment to that and to play through “Raiders of the Lost Ark” with the feeling they’re soulmates. When we end up married in “Crystal Skull,” I wept when I read that script.

AP: “Indiana Jones” could be a boys world but you were such a spirited force of nature.

ALLEN: Well, Steven and George had this experience as young boys with these Saturday afternoon matinee serial films. They were just a little bit older than I am, so I kind of missed that. I don’t have a reference point for that. So I don’t think that I necessarily understood the genre of film we were making. I thought we were making “Casablanca.” I really, truly did. So I sort of defined my character in that sort of genre — which I think weirdly enough works quite well for the film. I never imagined Marion as a damsel in distress in any sort of way. I was always pushing back against that, and in the end, Steven was supportive of that.

AP: Do you ever wish you had gotten the chance to star in more Hollywood films?

ALLEN: I make movies all the time, although I have tended in the last 10 or 15 years to focus more on indie films. In truth, the kinds of roles I’m really hungry to play, particularly for someone my age, they’re written more in the indie world. People kind of think, “Where have you been?” There were times I was raising my son but I often do at least two films a year. They’re very satisfying, probably more satisfying than the sort of roles I would be offered. A lot of times I turned down things. There’s a lot of thankless roles for women in bigger budget films.

AP: What has Marion meant to you?

ALLEN: She’s sort of at the core of my growth as an actor and certainly my relationship to the world. As I move through the world, I’ve become very identified with that character. There was maybe a brief period of time where I found it annoying. But that passed and now it’s just this character that I love. I can’t imagine anything more satisfying to have had the chance in life to create a character that has some meaning for people.

AP: What was it like to shoot your scenes with Ford in “Dial of Destiny”?

ALLEN: It was fantastic. We shot it all in one day or maybe two days. To just imagine these two people that have been wrenched apart through grief and loss and then she’s coming back with this hope that they can move forward. When we played the scene, that was very, very affecting. We were both very affected by it and a little teary. And the crew was a little teary.

AP: How has it been keeping your role in the film secret?

ALLEN: It’s been excruciating. (Laughs) I never have to do anything like this again. People have come up to me and they’ve been so upset because they didn’t see my name on IMDb. People would be so mad I’d have to stand there and just be like, “What do I say? Do I say, ‘Yeah, isn’t that a drag?’ or ‘You never never know — wink, wink.’” I’ve had to say I just can’t answer any questions about “Indiana Jones” — which I feel like is sort of saying that I’m in the film. It’s a lose-lose situation. (Laughs)

AP: Does playing Marion one last time cap anything for you?

ALLEN: More so for Harrison than for me. He’s such a fully developed character and has done all five of these. With Marion, I’ve kind of come and gone. But she will always be a character that moves through life with me. I don’t know if I really have a sense of it being over. There always was a sense that one more would be done, even if it took 20 years. Now, they’ve been very clear that this is the last one. So it is a letting go.

The film made its world premiere at the prestigious international 2023 Cannes Film Festival, where it received a five-minute standing ovation. Mangold first came to Cannes in 1995 with his film Heavy as part of the Directors’ Fortnight. Returning to Cannes for the premiere of his take of Indiana Jones made for a special night:

“Merci, I just wanted to say thank you, thank you so much for having us here,” Mangold said, as reported by Deadline. “One thing that was true then [when he first came to Cannes] and true now is that this film was made by friends. It’s probably hard for you to believe that a movie this big can be made by friends, but it was. It was made out of love, it was made out of devotion to what came before it, and it was made with tremendous trust from all these people.”

Indiana Jones vs. the Subway

There were a few things I knew before seeing Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny—and, after seeing it, can now confirm.

The CGI de-aging of Harrison Ford is spectacular. I question the more insidious implications of how well the effects team were able to pull off this digital approximation, but it has to be said: Harrison Ford, you will always be hot!

The movie is also endless (derogatory); the two-and-a-half-hour running time is offensive and unnecessary. But the ending is one of the silliest things I’ve had the pleasure of witnessing on a big screen. I was genuinely delighted at how ridiculous the time-travel finale is. I won’t spoil the specifics, but envisioning director James Mangold, Ford, and esteemed auteur/actress Phoebe Waller-Bridge filming it with a straight face recontextualized for me the shameless power of money, and for that I am grateful.

But there is one scene that early reviewers have not talked enough about, which I am here to shout about through any speaker phone on any platform I can: the subway horse scene.

This is not a spoiler, as it happens in the first act of the movie, but there is a SUBWAY HORSE SCENE IN INDIANA JONES that, by virtue of its unapologetic ridiculousness and commitment to seriousness, may just be the pinnacle of any action sequence we’ll see this year.

Ford, as Indiana Jones, is living in New York City in 1969 and just celebrated his retirement, when his connection to an artifact leads to him being kidnapped by Nazis. He escapes them, in the middle of a Manhattan parade celebrating the astronauts from the moon landing. In order to further evade the baddies, he has few options: He must steal a police horse, and he must take that police horse into the subway.

From there, Jones and said horse gallop through the tunnels, evading multiple trains that would surely hit and kill anyone not protected by John Williams’ Indiana Jones score. The whole sequence is thrilling, and yet hilarious. It ends perfectly, with Jones tossing off a grumpy one-liner. I don’t ever endorse going to see a movie of this length, but, for this scene, it is worth it.

Consonant Professional?

Listen: I don’t know if Vanna White wanted the job of replacing Pat Sajak as the host of Wheel of Fortune. I would hope that, if she did, execs would have given it to her. But in lieu of that, we’re left wondering whether or not Ryan Seacrest is the right choice to take over the institution. (And we’re also starting a rallying call to give Vanna a raise.)

The thing about Seacrest being hired to host anything is: yeah, sure. It’s obvious. Seacrest hosts things. Is there any way to be more imaginative in hiring?

But as someone who has watched Seacrest host things for over 20 years, and who has watched other people try and wildly fail at the same job, I think we take for granted how easy he makes it look.

Based on how many celebs have flopped harder trying to host a game show than Carrie Bradshaw working the runway at a fashion show, this is a more complicated job than it seems. I don’t love that someone as problematic as Sajak is being replaced with someone who also has skeletons in his closet. So it’s not like I’d cheer this news. But an obvious choice is sometimes a good choice, something that Jeopardy! favorite James Holzhauer elucidated in this tweet:

Fall Out Boy Started the Fire

Every time I write this sentence, I still don’t believe it’s real: Fall Out Boy wrote and recorded a sequel to Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire,” updating the lyrics to account for the nearly 35 years since Joel released the original.

The song is atrocious, obviously. But it is my journalistic duty to point out some of the most hilarious (abhorrent) lyrics:

“Oklahoma City bomb / Kurt Cobain, Pokémon / Tiger Woods, MySpace / Monsanto, GMOs / Harry Potter, Twilight / Michael Jackson dies / Nuclear accident, Fukushima, Japan.”

There’s also:

“More war in Afghanistan / Cubs go all the way again /Obama, Spielberg / Explosion, Lebanon / Unabomber, Bobbitt, John / Bombing, Boston Marathon / Balloon Boy, War On Terror / QAnon / Trump gets impeached twice / Polar bears got no ice.”

But then there’s the height of songwriting, a moment in music (and history!) I will never forget:

“Self-driving electric cars / SSRIs / Prince and the Queen die / World Trade, second plane / What else do I have to say?”

What else do I have to say?

What Would Zenu Say?

I would truly love to hear all of Tom Cruise’s thoughts on the Barbie movie.

The format of his appearance is currently unknown. It may be a small show — like Nick Fury’s debut at Avengers Campus, a character sighting, or a traditional meet and greet.

Are you excited to see Indy at Disneyland? Let us know in the comments.

“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny”

“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 18. It will open in theaters on June 30.

The MPAA rates the movie PG-13. According to their classification, the rating is due to “sequences of violence and action, language and smoking.” While the rating itself doesn’t add much to what can be expected in the fifth and final film, it is an interesting reminder that the second film of the franchise, “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,” was a main catalyst (alongside “Gremlins”) that led the MPAA to create the PG-13 classification in the first place.

“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” will take place in 1969, amidst the space race. Indiana Jones will encounter his old enemy, the Nazis, again. Voller is a villain inspired by Wernher von Braun, a real Nazi who became a NASA engineer.

The teaser trailer and artwork for the film debuted in December. A second teaser for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” premiered during Super Bowl LVII.

Harrison Ford, now 80 years old, stated this will be the last “Indiana Jones” movie.

Before the film’s full title was announced, Empire shared behind-the-scenes photos and interviews with the cast last November.

“It’s full of adventure, full of laughs, full of real emotion. And it’s complex and it’s sneaky,” Ford said at the time. “The shooting of it was tough and long and arduous. But I’m very happy with the film that we have.”

It’s rumored that an Indiana Jones TV series could be in development for Disney+. It remains unclear if the storyline of this series would be a prequel to the films, set somewhere inside the franchise narrative, or following a totally new character rather than Henry Jones Jr. If this series is developed, it would not be the first TV show about Indiana Jones. In 1992-1993, “The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles” aired on ABC. Harrison Ford made a cameo appearance in one episode.

,A whip-cracking journey through nostalgia,,"Review: Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the latest instalment in the legendary Indiana Jones franchise, is a thrilling adventure that takes us on a nostalgic trip down memory lane. As a die-hard fan of the series, I couldn’t help but be captivated by the film’s homage to its iconic predecessors (perhaps with the exception of the fourth instalment The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), while still managing to carve out its own unique identity in this classic franchise.

One of the greatest strengths of this film lies in its ability to invoke a profound sense of nostalgia. From the opening scene to the unexpected and surprising grand finale, director James Mangold co-written by Mangold, Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and David Koepp successfully weave elements from the classic Indiana Jones movies, paying homage to the series’ signature blend of action and humour, memorable characters, and pulse-pounding set pieces and action sequences. Every familiar whip crack, witty one-liner, and perilous chase brings back cherished memories, allowing fans to relive the magic that made the original films such classics.

Harrison Ford’s last turn as the legendary archaeologist, Indiana Jones, is a genuine treat for fans. Despite the passage of time, Ford effortlessly slips back into the role, infusing the character with the same charm, wit, and rugged determination that made him an enduring icon. It’s clear that Ford has a deep connection with the character, and his portrayal shines through, further enhancing the nostalgic experience.

The quest for the Dial of Destiny, a mystical artifact with incredible power spilt in two, which was invented by the Syracusan mathematician Archimedes, serves as the driving force behind the story. While the plot follows the classic Indiana Jones formula of globe-trotting adventure and a race against time, it introduces new characters and unexpected plot developments that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.

The film begins in 1944 (with a de-aged Harrison Ford) during the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. Indiana Jones and his colleague Basil Shaw (Toby Jones), a fellow archaeologist from Oxford, are captured by Nazis while attempting to retrieve the Lance of Longinus (the spear that pierced Christ’s side during the crucifixion). The train full of looted antiquities is being taken back to Germany when astrophysicist Jürgen Voller informs his superiors that he has found Archimedes’s Dial (part of the haul), which was invented by Archimedes and is capable of locating fissures in time.

After determining the Lance of Longinus is a fake and acquiring the Dial, Jones and Shaw escape the train before it derails after passing over a bridge destroyed by Allied bombers.

This is just the opening sequence that sets the search for the other half of the Dail across continents in motion when the story cuts to 1969 and Shaw’s daughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) enlists Jones help to locate the missing pieces of the Dial to sell to the highest bidder.

To reveal any more about the plot would ruin the callbacks, characters and reunions that ensue as the plot carries on at a whip-cracking pace.

The 1960s era production design and visual effects deserve special mention with the usual attention to detail in recreating the settings, from ancient temples to bustling marketplaces, is truly commendable. Each location feels authentic and immersive, effortlessly transporting the audience to the exotic locales that have become synonymous with the Indiana Jones series. The practical effects and seamless integration of CGI lend the film a sense of spectacle, enhancing the thrilling action sequences and breathtaking moments. Although the de-aging technology has come a long way, there are a few scenes which look like they are straight from a PS5 game, but not enough to take the audience out of the white-knuckle action.

Despite these minor drawbacks, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is an exhilarating adventure that fans of the series will thoroughly enjoy. It successfully taps into our nostalgia, honouring the legacy of Indiana Jones while presenting a fresh final chapter in his legendary saga. For those seeking an action-packed journey down memory lane, this film is a must-watch, capturing the spirit of the original films and reigniting our passion for the adventurous archaeologist we have all grown up with.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lnaHRzLnVjYS5vcmcuYXUvYS13aGlwLWNyYWNraW5nLWpvdXJuZXktdGhyb3VnaC1ub3N0YWxnaWEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Steven Spielberg predicted that an ‘implosion’ in the film industry would happen a decade ago,The Oscar-winning Jaws director made his prediction at a panel at the University of Southern California,"With movie buffs salivating over big summer releases including Oppenheimer, Barbie and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, an ominous 2013 prediction made by Steven Spielberg about the film industry 'imploding' has resurfaced.

The Oscar-winning Jaws director predicted that a succession of high-budget box offices failures could lead to dramatic cinematic ticket-price fluctuation.

He was talking alongside fellow legendary filmmaker, George Lucas, as well as CNBC anchor, Julia Boorstin, and Microsoft president of interactive entertainment business, Don Mattrick.

The Jurassic Park director spoke about half a dozen $250million (£190million) movies failing in quick succession resulting in dramatic price variances in the same theatre.

He said: “That’s the big danger, and there’s eventually going to be an implosion – or a big meltdown. There’s going to be an implosion where three or four or maybe even a half-dozen megabudget movies are going to go crashing into the ground, and that’s going to change the paradigm.

“You’re gonna have to pay $25 for the next Iron Man, you’re probably only going to have to pay $7 to see Lincoln,"" he said.

He also touched on students entering the industry at a time when even firmly established directors were struggling to get their commercial releases into cinema, admitting that his Oscar-winning film, Lincoln, came 'this close' to premiering on HBO rather than the big screen that same year.

The father of the Star Wars franchise, Lucas, seemed to agree that an upheaval was coming down the pike for the industry.

Lucas seemed to see cinemas adopting a Browadway-play model: this would involve fewer movies hitting screens but staying for up to a year with ticket prices higher.

He noted that Spielberg's 1982 blockbuster, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was in theatres for a whopping 16 months.

When Spielberg expressed his belief that the ingenues were 'too fringe-y for the movies', Lucas agreed and said that the 'pathway to get into theatres is really getting smaller and smaller' for everyone.

The Schindler's List director did a slight back pedal in 2015, however, when he denied making comments on there being an 'implosion' coming.

Advert 10

He wanted to set the record straight as USA Today reported following a press conference for Bridge Of Spies: “To clarify, I didn’t ever predict the implosion of the film industry at all.""

He continued: “I simply predicted that [with] a number of blockbusters in one summer – those big sort of tentpole superhero movies – there was going to come a time where two or three or four of them in a row didn’t work. That’s really all I said. I didn’t say the film industry was ever going to end because of them.""

He said he was talking about the superhero genre in particular and that it 'doesn’t have the legs or the longevity of the western, which was around since the beginning of film, and only started to wither and shrivel in the 60s'.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaWxhZC5jb20vZmlsbS1hbmQtdHYvc3RldmVuLXNwaWVsYmVyZy1tYXJ2ZWwtcHJlZGljdGVkLWltcGxvc2lvbi1maWxtLWluZHVzdHJ5LTc2NjA1Ny0yMDIzMDcxNNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-30 22:25:17+00:00,Why Audiences Should Boycott Disney's 'Indiana Jones & the Dial of Destiny',,"Rarely has a film stuffed all of the worst elements of what people dislike about modern Hollywood into one giant ugly mess of a film, but that’s exactly what Disney’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, does. But because it is also one of the most expensive films ever made (nearly $400 million), Disney may be extremely vulnerable to audience reactions, giving people a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to send a strong message to Disney and Hollywood as a whole by staying away.

Jason Williams of the Oregon Catalyst, has made a list of seven very reasonable rationales for moviegoers to boycott the 4th sequel in the franchise, and they are presented here in their entirety:


This fits a pattern. In its 2019 Dumbo remake, Disney offered a political theme that all zoos are unnecessary and should be abolished. Disney used Captain America to describe the Tea Party movement and its call for lower taxes as a racist movement. In Spider-Man: Homecoming, the audience is told that the George Washington Monument was shamefully built by slaves, which is a verifiable lie. Disney’s cartoon, Proud Family, told middle school-aged kids that Lincoln did not free the slaves—another verifiable lie. It also quietly elevated people who support Marxism, defunding police, and abolishing prisons. In 2022, Disney’s Strange World animated film was described by one reviewer as “a preachy, suffocatingly politically correct slog … a poorly disguised, preachy lecture about climate change.” That film’s political messages repelled audiences so much that it lost nearly $200 million dollars, making it one of the biggest mistakes in Disney history. It is bad enough that Disney inserts politics into films targeted to young children, but it’s obscene that much of the politics being spoon-fed to our kids is outright falsehoods.



Disney chooses to tear down these milestones by making Indiana suffer a divorce and introduce news that his son was killed in Vietnam. Jones is shown passed out with a hangover, shirtless and pant-less on his couch.

The Hollywood Reporter says Indiana’s “older, but not necessarily wiser. Drinking a bit too much, he’s full of regrets.” Film reviewer Jeremy Jahns says he is a “grumpy, alcoholic, very depressed old man.”

Under Spielberg, in films No. 1 and No. 3, Indiana is shown as a distinguished professor whom students adore listening to. In Disney’s updated version, it is the exact opposite as his students, bored and uninterested, disrespect Jones. For most of the film, Jones’ new partner, goddaughter Helena, ends up insulting and degrading him. When Jones complains of his injuries and gun shot wound, Helena puts him down. Helena tricks and outsmarts him repeatedly in the film. Indiana is a discarded shell of what people loved about the character. The complete shaming of a character is bad enough, but it also represents a widespread pattern by Disney. For a bonus list of how Disney sabotages legacy characters beyond recognition for quick profit (Snow White, Captain America, Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Thor), see the appendix at the end.


It is not limited to fictional heroes either. This is why, as previously described, Disney finds it so easy to denigrate symbols of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in their films. A larger movement is stake here.


Indy’s goddaughter, Helena, appears motivated more by money and obsession than by protecting treasures for historical preservation, a goal Indiana Jones and his fans embraced. In one scene, an angry man in his pajamas emerges with a machete and chases Helena, hinting that she uses sex to steal from people. Film reviewer Chris Gore states, “It is made very clear in this movie that she sleeps around to get what she wants.” Disney could have given us two heroes who were each inspirational, family friendly, and rich in virtue—the type of role models America needs right now. Instead, Disney gives our children heroes with barely any virtue at all. If people continue to pay money for these shallow movies, then Disney will keep cranking out fake heroes who act like people we disrespect in real life.


Yet, as discussed, it is Helena who drives the film, makes the key decisions, and draws the focus. Disney wanted to hijack a popular Indiana Jones film by putting their spin-off star at the center of the film, but didn’t want to make her the center of the poster. They value the money over the story.

This type of poster placement politics has garnered Disney criticism before. Disney downgraded the Black actor, John Boyega, in its Star Wars posters for international audiences.

Interestingly, as much as I documented how much they have bleached Indiana Jones of his core values, the film promoters are saying the exact opposite. Actor, Boyd Holbrook, touted to the media “They stay true to the subject and they stay true to the characters.” This very odd line that seems out-of-place is proof that the filmmakers know that fans are angry and that the film creators are guilty of character assassination of a hero the fans love. This is why they are sending out actors to kill the rumors — even though the rumors are sadly true.

There is additional information on dishonesty in promotion of this film in the appendix.


There’s actually much more at the original article, including an 8th reason, an alternative to boycotting, and even an appendix with even more reasons to boycott this abomination. And it looks as though some fans of the franchise may already be staying away. Deadline reported today that Dial of Destiny came in at only $7.2 million in previews Thursday, which Deadline reassures its readers that this range is where “older-skewing action-guy comps live.”

We’re specifically referencing the Thursday night starts of No Time to Die, which grossed $6.3M (started at 4 p.m.) before its $55.2M opening weekend in October 2021, and 2018’s Mission: Impossible – Fallout which made $6M before its $61.2M weekend start. Dial of Destiny, which started previews at 3 p.m. Thursday, is expected to gross between $60M-$65M at 4,500 theaters, making is the second-highest stateside opening for the Steven Spielberg-George Lucas franchise after 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which posted a five-day opening of $151.9M, after a 3-day of $100.1M.

Deadline can spin it however they like, but this movie isn’t going to make anywhere near what Crystal Skull made. The current projection is that Dial of Destiny will earn $140 million globally this weekend, but Crystal opened to $272 million worldwide, with a total worldwide take was around $790 million. Dial of Destiny’s production and promotional budget is around $400 million. That means the Disney Grooming Syndicate could lose hundreds of millions. That calculation led cynical and hilarious film critic John Nolte to only one conclusion:

Kathleen Kennedy will earn yet another massive promotion because that talentless, woke franchise killer has been failing her way up the chain of command for 15 years. She’s already killed Willow and the same Star Wars that survived the dreadful George Lucas prequels. If she proves capable of killing the same Indiana Jones that survived Crystal Suck, they will probably make her president of Disney, maybe even the president of the United States.

He’s joking of course, but at this point, Disney is liable to do anything wrong. Don’t you do the same. Stay away from Indy 5 and go see Jim Caviezel’s new movie Sound of Freedom instead, for free in theaters.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdmb29sLmNvbS9ibG9ncy93aHktYXVkaWVuY2VzLXNob3VsZC1ib3ljb3R0LWRpc25leXMtaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny movie review (2023),Never boring and never really entertaining.,"The unsettling mix of good and bad starts in the first sequence, a flashback to the final days of World War II that features Indy (Harrison Ford) and a colleague named Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) trying to reclaim some of the historical artifacts being stolen by the fleeing Nazis. Jones looks normal, of course, but Ford here is an uncanny valley occupant, a figure of de-aged CGI that never looks quite human. He doesn't move or even sound quite right. It’s the first but not the last time in “The Dial of Destiny” in which it feels like you can’t really get your hands on what you’re watching. It sets up a standard of over-used effects that are the film’s greatest flaw. We’re watching Indiana Jones at the end of World War II, but the effects are distracting instead of enhancing.
It's a shame, too, because the structure of the prologue is solid. Indy escapes capture from a Nazi played by Thomas Kretschmann, but the important introduction here is that of a Nazi astrophysicist named Jurgen Voller (a de-aged Mads Mikkelsen), who discovers that, while looking for something called the Lance of Longinus, the Nazis have stumbled upon half of the Antikythera, or Archimedes’ Dial. Based on a real Ancient Greek item that could reportedly predict astronomical positions for decades, the dial is given the magical Indy franchise treatment in ways that I won’t spoil other than to say it’s not as explicitly religious as items like the Ark of the Covenant of The Holy Grail other than, as Voller says, it almost makes its owner God.
After a cleverly staged sequence involving anti-aircraft fire and dozens of dead Nazis, “The Dial of Destiny” jumps to 1969. An elderly Indiana Jones is retiring from Hunter College, unsure of what comes next in part because he’s separated from Marion after the death of their son Mutt in the Vietnam War. The best thing about “The Dial of Destiny” starts here in the emotional undercurrents in Harrison Ford’s performance. He could have lazily walked through playing Indy again, but he very clearly asked where this man would be emotionally at this point in his life. Ford’s dramatic choices, especially in the film's back half, can be remarkable, reminding one how good he can be with the right material. His work here made me truly hope that he gets a brilliant drama again in his career, the kind he made more often in the ‘80s.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvZ2VyZWJlcnQuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1hbmQtdGhlLWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS1tb3ZpZS1yZXZpZXctMjAyM9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny review: Harrison Ford's lively (final?) adventure,"If Indiana Jones does hang up his hat, the fifth film is a surprisingly emotional, diverting, and satisfying conclusion.","It's not the years, it's the mileage… and in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, out June 30, the titular hero racks up plenty of thrilling miles in what is supposedly his farewell to the big screen.
We open on a younger Indy (a de-aged Harrison Ford in the best use of the often questionable technology to date) running for his life amidst the death throes of the Third Reich. Infiltrating a Nazi treasure trove, he and fellow academic/archaeologist Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) attempt to recover priceless historical artifacts from the retreating Nazis. On board a train, Indy encounters Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), a Nazi mathematician intent on locating the Dial of Destiny, more formally known as Archimedes' antikythera, a cosmological device with potentially world-altering powers.
Harrison Ford de-aged in 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny'. Lucasfilm Ltd.
Flash forward to 1969 and the celebration of the moon landing in New York City. Indiana Jones is living alone. He mourns his son Mutt, who died in combat in the Vietnam War (an expedient end to the problematic specter of what to do about Shia LaBeouf's existence within the franchise); he's separated from Marion (Karen Allen); and he's now preparing to retire from Hunter College where he's been a professor for over a decade.
His lonely life is interrupted by the arrival of Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), his goddaughter, who is on the hunt for the antikythera with questionable motives. Helena's appearance and bid for the dial thrusts Indy into a new adventure where he must once again face off against Voller, who now goes by the name of Professor Schmitt, and stop his quest to return the Nazi regime to power.
Ford returns as Indy, but he's not merely a guy with a cool hat and a bullwhip with a few more lines on his face. Just as James Mangold did for Hugh Jackman's Wolverine in Logan, he presents an Indiana Jones weathered by life — a man who has spent decades chasing down ancient artifacts and fighting Nazis.
Harrison Ford in 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny'. Lucasfilm Ltd.
Indiana Jones has always been a world-weary guy, cynical and full of wise cracks in the face of danger, but here, he feels like he's finally earned it. Ford's soulful, craggy face is the cipher for the lifetime of adventure, physical pain, and loss that Indy has endured. There's humor in that, as when Indy lists off some of the more ridiculous things he has done while scaling a wall with Helena. But there's sadness too, in the friends he's lost and the tragedy he has faced.
Ford has always lent Indy a humanity and depth that is too often ignored in favor of celebrating his capacity for dry one-liners and his rugged good looks (both well-deserving of the praise they've received). Here, he gets to unleash the emotional side of Indy, his reverence for history and love for those he holds dear visibly weighing him down. In 1969, as humanity looks to the future, Indiana Jones, a man dedicated to protecting the past, is a man out of place in his own time. Ford's curmudgeonly restraint barely conceals the open wounds of his losses.
Dial of Destiny is often best in its moments of quiet resonance, but it doesn't leave enough breathing room to maximize the impact of Ford's performance. Instead, the film volleys from one action sequence to the next, whether it be a dangerous dive into deep ocean waters, a horse race through New York City streets and subways(!), or a perilous car chase through Tangiers. Mangold crafts these scenes with precision, building them to a fever pitch and then throttling the accelerator when it seems the scene has peaked. This makes the pacing wonky, and more scenes of introspective Indy would have been welcome in exchange for shaving a few minutes off the nonstop danger. But that doesn't make the sequences any less exciting or nerve-wracking, generating an old-school adventure energy reminiscent of the original trilogy.
Harrison Ford and Phoebe-Waller Bridge in 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny'. Lucasfilm Ltd.
Unlike the monkey swinging or the infamous nuclear explosion refrigerator nonsense of Crystal Skull, the action here also feels utterly believable. The physical toll it takes on an older Indy is palpable, the stakes higher because of the acknowledgement of his mortality. At his best, Indiana Jones has always been a hero that feels utterly human. Maybe a little smarter than the rest of us, but no less earthbound. In Raiders of the Lost Ark, when he takes a punch to the jaw, we feel it — and Dial remembers that Indy's greatest asset is his conspicuous humanity in the face of peril.
Waller-Bridge, who leaped from Fleabag's critical acclaim to writing for James Bond and starring in an Indiana Jones flick, is a saucy, slippery foil to Ford. Where Marion was feisty and reckless, and Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery) was persnickety and gruff, Helena is whimsical and brash. Her loyalties shift faster than sand in an hourglass, keeping Indiana Jones, and by extension, the audience, on their toes. Waller-Bridge has a winking sense of humor as a performer that imbues her natural ability to make the audience believe they're her confidantes while remaining delightfully unpredictable.
Mads Mikkelsen in 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny'. Lucasfilm Ltd.
Mikkelsen, a prince of silver-tongued, elegant villainy, is under-used. Jürgen Voller lacks distinction as a villain, possessing neither the naked ambition of Belloq (Paul Freeman) from Raiders or the self-serving sycophancy of Walter Donovan (Julian Glover) in Last Crusade. While his goons are outright unhinged, Voller is chilled cardboard, a Nazi who lacks any personality besides his commitment to the ideals of Nazism. His villainy lacks teeth, but perhaps that's because the notion of bringing fascism back feels like a day-to-day occurrence in our world. He's not half so frightening as anything on the nightly news.
Dial of Destiny is 85 percent of a delightful return to form for the franchise and 15 percent absolutely ludicrous climax. We won't spoil the reveal, but suffice it to say it leans too heavily into a plot point that Marvel and DC have exhausted in recent years — and the temporal, geographical place it decides to take its climactic sequence is both outlandish and entirely too on-the-nose.
It's not that Indiana Jones hasn't always built its stories around fantastical ancient artifacts. (See: the Ark of the Covenant, the Sankara Stones, the Holy Grail, and, sigh, the Crystal Skull.) The antikythera is as good a McGuffin as any other (and it is based on a real scientific device from ancient Greece). But while the mystical, inexplicable power of objects like the Ark and the Grail have the capacity to shock and awe, the antikythera is merely a tool for a tired trope with a payoff that verges on tritely absurd.
One can understand the allegorical impulse of the storytelling device. This older, probably not wiser version of Indiana Jones is one who feels as much a relic as the artifacts he's dedicated his life to studying and preserving. It's hard to resist literalizing the metaphor in a story where the hero is made to feel like time has passed him by. But it doesn't land the way the filmmakers intended, instead undercutting Indy's reckoning with history and his place in it.

It's a testament to Ford's performance and the movie's overall effectiveness that this disappointing climax doesn't outweigh how much fun it all is. Much like the entries of the original trilogy, at its heart, Dial is a rip-roaring adventure that borrows more from the cinematic language of golden age swashbucklers than modern blockbusters.
In a sense, Indiana Jones has always been about nostalgia. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas set out to make movies that evoked the 1940s serials they loved growing up. That operates on two levels in Dial of Destiny, both in the film's historical setting and our own yen for the way the original movies made us feel.
Dial uses nostalgia as an appetizer, not a main course, and it's absolutely delicious for it. Nothing feels pandering, but rather each nod to the past is welcome in its measured distribution, as cozy and familiar as a favorite sweater or reconnecting with an old friend. Speaking of, Sallah (John Rhys-Davis) is back, but mainly as a vestige of the life Indy feels he's lost. Sallah too yearns for their shared past.
There are nods to our hero's well cataloged hatred of snakes, a cheeky reversal of the Raiders bringing a knife (or whip) to a gunfight, plenty of traveling by map, and a tear-jerking return to kissing where it doesn't hurt, all set to the core memory sounds of John Williams' inimitable score (including a new theme for Helena!).

Much has been made of the fact that Dial will be Ford's last outing in the franchise. The movie has been billed as a send-off for Indiana Jones, but it doesn't feel definitive, particularly when the film's final shot makes a very decisive point about Ford/Indy hanging up the hat.
If it is indeed the last we'll see of Ford's Indiana Jones, it's a far more satisfying goodbye than where we last left him. But Dial makes one thing clear: whatever happens next, this franchise still has fresh skullduggery left to explore. Indiana Jones does not (and will never) belong in a museum. He's far too vital for that; his mileage, as a character and a pop culture icon, is infinite. Grade: B+

,Phoebe Waller-Bridge on punching Indiana Jones in 'Dial of Destiny',"Phoebe Waller-Bridge gets to punch Indiana jones in 'Dial of Destiny,' and she says it's a 'glorious' moment.","Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny character, Helena, gets to kick a lot of ass... including the one belonging to Indiana Jones.
In a very shocking — albeit hilarious — moment in the upcoming film (in theaters Friday), Helena punches her godfather, Indy (Harrison Ford), so hard in the face that she knocks him out, a moment which Waller-Bridge calls ""glorious.""
""It's such a brilliant cut, and it's such an excellently scripted moment. And particularly because there's so much fighting and left hooks and all that stuff all the way through the film, when she's just fighting the bad guys,"" Waller-Bridge tells EW. ""But to have to level a punch to the hero of the film... It was glorious, because it was so funny.""
The British star laughs when EW tells her that at both screenings we've attended, audiences loudly cheered at that moment. This makes Waller-Bridge laugh, but she hopes viewers understand her character's decision in the moment. ""Underneath, it really had heart and emotion. And that's really a testament to Jim [Mangold, director] and the Butterworths [Jez and John-Henry] for writing a moment like that. I hope the audience understands why she does it.""

In the film — which also stars Mads Mikkelsen, Antonio Banderas, Toby Jones, John Rhys-Davies, Karen Allen, and more — Helena and Indy are reunited in a race against time to get the mythical Dial of Destiny, which can reportedly change the course of history, before a nefarious Nazi, Voller (Mikkelsen).
It's the fifth film in the beloved franchise about the daredevil archaeologist, and like all of its predecessors, it features wild action sequences, which means Waller-Bridge got to do a lot more than just punch the film's hero.
""I managed to do quite a lot of the landing and jumping off bits, but none of the actual real, proper dangerous stunts. But I got to drive a tuk-tuk!"" she says excitedly, before adding, ""I did crash it... which wasn't meant to happen.""
Waller-Bridge continues, ""I got to jump out of a plane. And I got to jump into water, and roll out from under things, and jump over things. So there was a lot to do, and I was completely covered in bruises. Each one was a mark of honor for the day.""

,Indiana Jones: Harrison Ford says he wanted 'emotional ending',The actor is playing the character for the final time in the fifth instalment of the franchise.,"Indiana Jones: Harrison Ford says he wanted 'emotional ending'
By Emma Jones BBC Talking Movies
Disney
Harrison Ford said he wanted the ageing of his character to be developed into a complex story
There's often speculation when an artist announces a ""last"" project that it won't be - which is why Harrison Ford is still being asked whether this really will be his last outing wearing the battered hat of legendary adventurer Indiana Jones.
But the actor is unequivocal in his reply to BBC News.
""It is my final film,"" he says. ""And I was always ambitious with this final film.""
It could be argued the movie, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the first for the franchise since 2008's Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, wasn't even necessary to conclude the series, since Ford is now 80 years old.
But the actor says he wanted to give this beloved character ""an emotional ending"" while acknowledging the passing of time.
""We've been making these films for 40 years, we can't deny the effect of age on the character, and I wanted to see that developed into a complex story,"" he says.
Disney
Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen plays the villain in the latest instalment of the franchise
The film makes a virtue of the character's age, showing the professor of archaeology complaining as he's performing action stunts with his god-daughter Helena, played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, as the pair chase an ancient dial that can alter the course of history.
The film is packed with in-jokes about the character as well as featuring Indiana Jones's greatest enemies, the Nazis, led in this film by Danish actor and former Bond villain Mads Mikkelsen.
But Ford insists he won't be tempted back: ""I was not so much interested in doing the same thing over and over again, I wanted to have an emotional ending to this character.
""And I'm so grateful for the audience that we've had, I just wanted to make sure that they would be satisfied and happy with the final iteration.""
That's not guaranteed - the film's world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival drew lukewarm reviews from critics. The BBC review at the time said that the film was ""a depressing reminder of how much livelier his past adventures were"".
It's also the first film in the series that's not directed by Steven Spielberg, although he remains an executive producer.

Harrison Ford received an honorary Palme d'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival in May
At one point, Dial of Destiny ranked at only 52% on American review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, although it's since risen.
But the nostalgia factor could still be a powerful lure for audiences. Those who remember the trilogy from the 1980s - Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade include Mikkelsen, who says: ""Anyone I know would have killed me if I turned it down.
""I watched it first when I was 15 years old. And it was a huge inspiration to me in terms of acting, but also to a lot of my colleagues, a lot of directors.""
Audiences can be reminded of Indiana Jones in all his glory in an extended flashback scene in this movie, played by the present-day Harrison Ford and altered by technology.
Ford explains that the images ""are just what I looked like 35 years ago. It's not disquieting, it's not Photoshop, because it's real images.""
Martin Scorsese's The Irishman also digitally altered Robert De Niro to take his character in the mafia film backwards and forwards in age, and as Dial of Destiny director James Mangold explains, the technology is continuing to advance.
""Steven Spielberg shot four Indiana Jones movies with Harrison, three of them were in the age that the opening sequence takes place in,"" he says.
Disney
Phoebe Waller-Bridge has played down the suggestion the franchise will continue with her character as the lead
So, he had a reservoir of Harrison's face, every expression, every lighting style. On top of that, Harrison is not a pound over the weight he was when he was 35 years old. So, the computer mapping of putting that young flesh, visage on him, is easy because the bones of the man haven't changed at all.
""And he's driving the performance. It's not just motion capture, it's a performance based on his acting, knowing he is playing himself much younger.""
Emmy-winning Fleabag actress and writer Waller-Bridge took on her first action role in the character of Helena, described by the Guardian's review as ""a naughty Enid Blyton heroine"".
She says Ford told her to ""act like you're hammered"" in a punching scene.
""It was a scene where I was going to be punched and I was very tense. And he came up and was like, 'just act like you're hammered.' It was that kind of mature advice I was given daily,"" she jokes.
""But the stunts alone were the time of my life. They're my happy place now, being thrown off things, or tripping over things, sometimes just being strung from a ceiling. It doesn't get old.""
Ford says that her action performance is ""terrific - I had no idea she would be so capable and so fearless"".
Disney
The film received mixed reviews from critics following its Cannes premiere
But Waller-Bridge has reportedly ruled herself out of succeeding Harrison Ford if its makers want to continue the franchise. Ford himself quipped to reporters at the US premiere that ""Jennifer Lopez would be fantastic"" when asked who should succeed him as Indiana Jones.
But the actor isn't retiring. He'll continue working in two series - the western 1923 with Helen Mirren and Shrinking, where he plays a curmudgeonly therapist.
Indiana Jones is now a closed chapter in his life, the actor reiterates, saying: ""I just feel a sense of completion.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LWFydHMtNjYwMDEwMzjSAThodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3MvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1hcnRzLTY2MDAxMDM4LmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director James Mangold has revealed the team worked on the movie's opening sequence for three years, but some are now referring to it as the ""AI sequence"".
Long before the movie hit theaters, we knew Dial of Destiny's opening sequence would feature a de-aged Harrison Ford as the movie kicks off in 1944, when Indiana Jones and Mads Mikkelsen's Nazi astrophysicist Jürgen Voller encounter Archimedes' Dial.

Mangold was keen to give moviegoers an adrenaline rush at seeing a young Indiana Jones swing back into action in the opening minutes before transitioning into the main adventure, but that the sequence took a long time to complete, he told The Hollywood Reporter.
""I never presented it as time travel. I never really thought of it as time travel,"" Mangold said of the movie's prologue. ""There's this way the press can frame a story that can then help drive the story. We worked for three years on the opening sequence, but only in the last 30 days have people started calling it the 'AI sequence at the beginning of Indiana Jones'.""
The VFX team reportedly used several different techniques to pull the scene together, including a new ILM software that scanned through archived footage of Ford in his earlier years before matching it to the footage shot for Dial of Destiny in the opening sequence.
Twitter user @IndianaJones_ch also recently shared photos of the masks the movie's stunt performers wore to look more like Ford before the post-production team worked their magic on the faces, offering fans a closer look at the mask used for young Indy in the flashback scenes.

It is not the first time we have seen the masks as photos leaked from the set during production featured a stuntman wearing one of the hyperrealistic disguises to resemble a younger Ford, which was an early indicator the movie would explore Indiana Jones' past.
""This is the first time I've seen it where I believe it,"" Ford previously said of the de-aging technology used in the movie. ""It's a little spooky. I don't think I even want to know how it works, but it works. Doesn't make me want to be young, though. I'm glad to have earned my age.""

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny hit theaters on June 30, and won the global weekend box office with ticket sales reaching $130 million. Plenty of movie-goers have been enjoying this final adventure, however, IGN's review of the film gave it a 4/10, noting it ""fails to recapture Spielberg's magic"".

,How 'Dial of Destiny' explains the absence of Shia LaBeouf's Mutt,"Here's how 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' explains the absence of Indy's son, Mutt, played by Shia LaBeouf in 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.'","Warning: This article contains spoilers for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
When audiences sit down to watch Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny this weekend, one character will be noticeably absent from the big screen: Shia LaBeouf's Mutt Williams, a.k.a. Henry Jones III.
This in and of itself should come as no surprise — screenwriter David Koepp revealed way back in 2017 that Mutt wouldn't be in the fifth installment. This was welcome news for some fans, particularly ones miffed by the introduction of the cocky greaser in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and the implication at the time that he was heir apparent to the Indiana Jones franchise moving forward.
Still, Mutt's absence in Dial of Destiny couldn't be ignored, what with his prominent role in Crystal Skull and an ending that saw Mutt's mother, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), marrying his father, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford).
Dial of Destiny deals with Mutt in a way that also explains why Marion isn't a bigger part of the narrative. Near the beginning, we glimpse divorce papers and Indy himself angrily covers up a picture of Marion, indicating an estrangement between the pair. Later, in one of the film's most emotional moments, Indy tells his goddaughter, Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), that if he could go back in time he'd tell his son not to enlist to fight in the Vietnam War. He says he'd tell his son that he's going to die, and the resulting grief would so consume his mother and impact his father's ability to be there for her that it would end both their happiness and their marriage.

It's not all sad news for the Jones family, however. Though the film makes it clear it's the end of the road for Mutt's character, it's insinuated that Marion and Indy might still get their happily ever after. After the daredevil archaeologist nearly loses his life in the film's climax, he awakens to find that Marion has returned to look after him. After recreating their romantic ""where does it hurt"" moment from Raiders of the Lost Ark, the two share a tender embrace in the film's final moments. Allen spoke to EW all about the ""emotional"" scene.

2023-06-14 21:39:02.085000+00:00,Why Ke Huy Quan’s Short Round Isn’t in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"For Dial of Destiny director/co-writer James Mangold, it was all about Indy’s predicament in the twilight of his life and which characters, new or old, would best serve that purpose from a storytelling perspective.","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny brings back beloved legacy characters Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) but there’s one notable supporting player from the long-running franchise who isn’t in this last hurrah: Short Round, Indy’s sidekick played by a young Ke Huy Quan in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.
While it should be noted that only Marion, Sallah, and Marcus Brody (played by the late Denholm Elliott) ever returned for the Indy sequels, many fans have long wondered if Indy and Short Round would ever cross paths again (besides Harrison Ford and Ke Huy Quan reuniting at industry events). Quan himself has also voiced his enthusiasm for reprising the role of Short Round .
Quan’s Oscar-winning comeback in Everything Everywhere All at Once only further fueled hopes for a Short Round cameo (or more) in Dial of Destiny, even though that film had already long since wrapped production by the time Quan took home Best Supporting Actor.
IGN had the chance to ask Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director/co-writer James Mangold at the film’s press junket Monday if there were any internal discussions about bringing back Short Round.
Director James Mangold on why Ke Huy Quan doesn't appear in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. pic.twitter.com/oIj5rbUht3 — IGN (@IGN) June 16, 2023
For Mangold, it was all about Indy’s predicament in the twilight of his life and which characters, new or old, would best serve that purpose from a storytelling perspective. A middle-aged Short Round didn’t.
“We looked at all these different things, but the first thing we were trying to do was assemble a story that made sense in the present, meaning in the 1969 section of the movie,” Mangold said.
“If you notice… the only person we follow through the whole way is Indy himself. Joined by Helena [Shaw, played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge ], and I felt like we needed to have a female lead who challenged him. But we looked at all these different things and tried to figure out how they would work. I just didn't want another adult along for the ride.”
The youthful sidekick role in Dial of Destiny is Helena’s associate Teddy, played by teenager Ethann Isidore, and it’s largely the trio of Indy, Helena, and Teddy together for most of the movie.
While Mangold couldn’t find a way to bring back Short Round for Indy’s swansong, the filmmaker is excited by how Quan’s career has turned out. “It's also thrilling what he's done this year, and I'm so happy for him to have suddenly found an entirely new picture to assert both his acting talent and his incredible martial arts skill,” Mangold said.

15:00.2,AutoMatters & More: Movie Review: Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"Set primarily in 1969, with flashbacks to establish the backstory in World War II, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the final Indiana Jones adventure — undoubtedly due to Harrison Ford’s advanced age.","Set primarily in 1969, with flashbacks to establish the backstory in World War II, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the final Indiana Jones adventure — undoubtedly due to Harrison Ford’s advanced age. Nevertheless, his on-screen persona is immediately recognizable, complete with his leather jacket, brown fedora and intimidating, loudly cracking bullwhip.
If you enjoyed the previous Indiana Jones movies, you will not be disappointed with this globe-trotting final installment. It has everything, beginning with fights with dastardly Nazis, and moving along to improbably campy derring-do atop a rapidly moving train, behind the wheels of automobiles, endless chases on foot and appropriate one-liners.
In the theater for the preview screening.
(Jan Wagner)
This time around Harrison Ford portrays a reluctant Indiana Jones. A professor at Hunter College in New York, he is facing his imminent retirement. His students find him boring. He lives a rather sedate, peaceful, uneventful life and he seems to be quite content with that. Soon, however, he is dragged kicking and screaming out of his retirement by someone from his past who needs his help. Of course, that character is much more than they initially appear to be, a situation that inevitably leads to Professor Jones’ efforts to try to save the world from an unimaginably horrible, history-changing, dire fate.
That said, important aspects of this movie merit criticism. Right at the start, the World War II fighting scenes are dark. I’m not talking about dark in tone (although it can be argued that they are that, too), but rather they are literally too dark. Much of the action takes place in near darkness — so much so that you can barely see the details of the action and the stunts, which were no doubt produced at very great expense. Why would they do that — and at a preview screening of the film in IMAX, no less? That was distracting and unnecessarily annoying.

That’s not all. I soon became distracted by another serious technical problem, but this one continued throughout the film. The sound was so distorted at times that I could not understand the dialog. It was as if the audio track was being played through the theater’s sound system at way too high an audio level. I’ll put that one on the theater. Hopefully your screening will be better.
Without spoiling the details for you, I will tell you that the really cool stuff related to the dial of destiny — the Archimedes Dial — happens close to the end of the film. The bulk of the film, however, was made up of silly, wildly improbable chases. The hero Tuk-Tuk vehicle which, by its frail-looking appearance should have been quite fragile, instead was seemingly indestructible as it endured innumerable impacts — many if not almost all of which should surely have caused it to fail massively, but instead it continued on, again and again. I’m talking about a degree of silliness almost as ridiculous as Wile E. Coyote falling off of cliffs while in the almost futile pursuit of the Road Runner.
(Courtesy The Walt Disney Studios)
It used to be that in movie car chases the film was undercranked, so that when it was played back at normal speed the cars appear to be sped up — which looked very fake. These days car chases in the movies — especially stratospherically high-budget movies — feature much more realistic chase scenes which at least look like they might somehow be possible — but not here. Be prepared to Laugh Out Loud. Unless you are a really little kid (in which case you would probably not be reading this review), you just will not be able to take what you see seriously.
I left the theater wishing that the script had focused more of its attention on the really clever, jaw-dropping stuff that focused on what the dial of destiny was capable of doing.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny was directed by James Mangold (Ford v Ferrari) and, in addition to Harrison Ford, its stars include Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Fleabag), Antonio Banderas (Pain and Glory), Karen Allen and John Rhys-Davies (Raiders of the Lost Ark), Shaunette Renée Wilson (Black Panther) and Thomas Kretschmann (Das Boot).

Henry “Indiana” Jones (Harrison Ford) is one of the most iconic and legendary characters to ever grace the silver screen. The timeless archeologist hero returns once again(!) in Indiana Jones & The Dial of Destiny. Fifteen years have passed since his last monumental return in Indiana Jones & The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull. It’s hard not to wonder if this entry is even necessary. Once in a blue moon, audiences are gifted with a well-crafted and excellent continuation to a beloved franchise à la Toy Story 4. Unfortunately, a lot of the time, we get lackluster, disappointing blockbuster franchise films like Jurassic World: Dominion or Terminator: Genisys. As a lifelong fan that grew up watching Indiana Jones on VHS, I hate to report that his latest film doesn’t quite meet the bar set by the previous installments.
Familiar Ground But A Little Less Fun
For the first time ever, a director other than the incomparable Steven Spielberg is directing an Indiana Jones film. Enter James Mangold to step in behind the camera. Now, Mangold is no doubt a talented director. He boasts an impressive resume of Academy Award-winning films including Ford V Ferrari & Walk The Line.
While he crafts some exciting and epic action set pieces in Indiana Jones & The Dial of Destiny, there always seems to be something not quite right. There is an extended sequence involving CGI de-aging technology that quickly wears out its welcome. It’s uncomfortably distracting and looks unnatural the more it is on screen. We are then treated to a couple of awesome chase sequences that are fun but are a little busy editing-wise. There are a couple of heartwarming and welcome cameos that don’t amount to much minus one in the final act. The reoccurring theme here is falling short, and as a whole, it represents the entire film.
Too Much Reality?

Both Harrison Ford & James Mangold have established that they wanted to explore the titular hero dealing with age and the inevitable end of his journey. Mangold previously delivered a similarly somber and heartbreaking reflection in the superhero film, Logan.
However, examining growing old and loss of purpose is not why I used to re-watch all of Indiana Jones’ previous adventures. I watched them over and over for pure escapism fun. It swept me away in something majestic and extravagant. Indiana Jones, the hero, is someone I can enjoy with comfort and joy. It is not that he cannot reflect the realities of life. Rather, it’s just that it feels counter-productive as to why the character even exists in the first place. This clashing of themes and principles makes for a journey that is much more of a downer than I had anticipated.
Not All Bad, But Not Enough

There are indeed things to enjoy in this film despite what didn’t sit well with me. Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Solo: A Star Wars Story, Prime Video’s Fleabag) portrays Indiana Jones’ goddaughter, Helena Shaw. She brings an impressive lift both in terms of the story and with much-needed levity to counter the film’s underlying sorrow. Waller-Bridge is charismatic and likable, which makes her humorous moments genuine and not so corny. Although I prefer Ford’s father/son relationship with Shia LaBeouf in the previous film, the godfather/goddaughter dynamic works well here.
Mads Mikkelsen treads familiar ground as the film’s antagonist, Dr. Jürgen Voller. Mikkelsen has famously brought several other villains to life like Hannibal Lecter, Casino Royale‘s Le Chifre, or as Kaecilius in Doctor Strange.
He is a fine actor and does well enough, but there isn’t anything about his character that we haven’t seen many times over. Which again leads to what wasn’t working with the film.
The film sees a couple of firsts in the Indiana Jones mythology. For starters, there’s an engaging deep diving sequence in the Mediterranean Sea. We also have an epic chase through New York City which was my favorite action sequence overall. However, for all of those new ideas, we have several others that retread things we have seen before. There is also a huge, ambitious concept for the final act that is sure to make or break the audience’s satisfaction with the story. I, unfortunately, was not one of them.
Overall, Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny is an entertaining adventure that checks off most of the boxes fans have come to expect. It’s just not quite the sendoff that they may have imagined, especially with an ending that is enjoyable but nowhere near as good as the previous two that came before it.

We opted for an intergenerational approach to this film dynasty stretching back to 1981 when Laura was graduating high school through this year when Josiah is in his final year of high school. Five movies later, the legacy comes to an end with The Dial of Destiny. And our intrepid review team of Elijah and his mum Sarah have the details – Sue
It was a lot like the first two movies.
It was most like the first movie, Raiders of the Last Ark, and the second, Temple of Doom, because it had more of the adventure but still felt like a sequel. Indiana Jones teamed up with a woman and a boy to go on an adventure. The Nazis were the antagonists. It had the same way of showing how they traveled across the world. It was interesting how the started off in at the end of World War II with Indy and his sidekick trying to save a rare artifact only to find out that there was a much more important artifact that needed to be saved from German hands.
Move forward to the time of the moon landing, to find out that Indiana Jones is now a cranky old man grieving the loss of his son and the soon to be divorce of his wife Marion. This is where things get exciting. He is approached by an old acquaintance Helena, who is the daughter of the sidekick from his time with the Nazis. She approaches him about the artifact that they took off the train. Chaos ensues, there is a chase through the streets. We are only then to find out that one of the Nazis survived the original train wreck.
At the beginning we thought that she was just going to be a love interest for Indy or just another sidekick for his journey, but as movie progressed, we learned she was more of a bad guy because she wanted to steal the artifact and sell it for herself and we felt she didn’t really care about it or her fathers research. After she escapes New York with the artifact and is chased down by Indiana Jones in Tangier, we meet Teddy, a young boy very similar to Short Round from the older movies. Towards the end, we learn that she really does care, not only about saving the world but also about her father’s research and Indiana Jones. This was a good twist.
At the end, Indy, Helena and Teddy find themselves in many harrowing situations, including lots of bugs and eels (which are just sea snakes). They all learn to trust each other and save the world.
All in all, this was probably the second best of the franchise. It was good to hear the familiar fast of the past and to hear all the great music that we had learned to love.
And while Indy may hang up his hat and whip, we’ll forever have this five movie legacy as a reminder that Nazis exist so the good guys have to resist them.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBnaGxlc2JpYW4uY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvcmV2aWV3LWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3Rpbnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Fans were worried if that creative flop would be the last they’d ever see of Indy, but now he has a second chance to make a last impression.
With new director James Mangold at the helm, I suppose there was a chance that this franchise could have dug itself even deeper into the hole, but I’m pleased to say that this entry is not an embarrassment. It’s too bad I can’t say anything better than that, but it’s more than I could say for the last movie.
An opening sequence sees a younger Indy (using not-perfect but not-distracting digital de-aging effects on Ford) rescue an artifact from Nazis at the tail end of World War II with the help of bumbling colleague Basil (Toby Jones). This sequence takes place on a moving train, so there are seemingly endless opportunities to throw bad guys off screaming. It’s fun, if a bit overlong, which can be said of all the action sequences in this movie.
Flash forward to 1969. Indy is in his twilight years, and it seems the world has left him behind. His wife Marion (Karen Allen) has left him, his neighbors wake him up with loud rock music, he can’t keep his students’ attention in class, and the university is forcing him into retirement.
The only pleasant surprise in his day is a visit from Helena (Pheobe Waller-Bridge), the late Basil’s daughter and his goddaughter. She has a proposal involving the Dial of Destiny, the artifact Indy and her father rescued from the Nazis. He’s not up for another adventure, but he can help her in simple fashion, and this ironically gets him pulled into an even bigger adventure.
It turns out that the duplicitous Helena just wants to steal the Dial and sell it. She’s being tailed by the CIA and renowned scientist Jurgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), a Nazi leftover who knows the Dial’s true power. Indy just wants the Dial to be safe, and if that includes protecting Helena and her kid sidekick Teddy (Ethann Isodore) and stopping the bad guys, then so be it.

The rest of the movie is mostly just an elaborate treasure hunt where Indy and Helena navigate clues, booby traps, and conflicting loyalties in various cities, with Voller usually showing up to get everyone into an action sequence. Old friend Sallah (Jonathan Rhys-Davies) shows up along the way, as does Renaldo (Antonio Banderas), a diver Indy enlists for an underwater mission.
The film’s climax sees Voller try to exploit the time-travel capabilities of the Dial. As evil as he is, I had a laugh at the idea that Voller’s master plan is technically the same thing that every time traveler wants to do.
Until the time-travel conclusion (which is at least handled with more dignity than those aliens from “Crystal Skull”), “Dial of Destiny” is just perfectly average for Indiana Jones. Certain visual components look a little too polished to be natural, but otherwise, a familiar sense of fun is still in play. Indy’s wit is as quick as ever, and of course, any character played by Waller-Bridge is going to be pretty sharp too.
The charm of 1981’s “Raiders of the Lost Ark” is never quite matched, but that may be too high a standard. Some will say that putting a character as iconic as Indiana Jones in a just-okay movie is a disservice to his cinematic legacy, but I choose to focus on the upside of this movie being a satisfactory end note for the character, compared to what it would have been otherwise.
Grade: B-
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is rated PG-13 for sequences of violence and action, language, and smoking. Its running time is 154 minutes.

Harrison Ford: ‘Raiders March follows me everywhere… it was in my last colonoscopy!’ | Classic FM
By Sophia Alexandra Hall
Indiana Jones is back for his final adventure in ‘The Dial of Destiny’, and just like the artefacts he collects, this score by John Williams is sure to go down in history.
Listen to this article Loading audio...
Legendary explorer, Indiana Jones, returns to our screens for his final action-packed adventure, and luckily for all of us film music fans, John Williams is here to play him out.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the fifth film starring the titular fictional character, played by Harrison Ford, and concludes a storyline spanning over 34 years.
Williams’ rousing ‘Raiders March’ theme is synonymous with the character of Indiana Jones, and the legendary film composer returned to score new music for the highly-anticipated final film due to be released in June 2023.
But how much original music does the film include, and what new melodies did melodies write, if any, for the concluding chapter of the fictional professor? Read on to explore the (spoiler-free!) soundworld of Indiana Jones’ last hurrah.

Who wrote the soundtrack for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny?
At the age of 91 years old, legendary film composer John Williams returned to write and conduct over two hours of new music for the final Indiana Jones film. Williams has written music for every Indiana Jones film, and his themes are synonymous with the intrepid adventurer.
According to reports, the extent of Williams’ involvement with the highly anticipated fifth film wasn’t certain from the get-go.
In a featurette with LucasFilm, director James Mangold related humorously, “I didn’t know if John would do the whole movie when I jumped on – I only prayed.
“At first he said, ‘I’ll write some themes’, and then he just couldn’t stop writing all the music to the movie.”
Williams’ score includes a mix of new musical themes, alongside rearrangements of old fan favourites such as ‘The Raiders March’ and ‘Marion’s Theme’.
In an interview discussing the film last year, Williams suggested that this score would be his last before retirement. However he has since gone back on that promise, and in January this year said he would be ‘sticking around’ in the music industry for a while yet.

What is the plot of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny?
The official spoiler-free synopsis of the fifth and final adventure of the intrepid explorer reads, “Daredevil archaeologist Indiana Jones races against time to retrieve a legendary dial that can change the course of history.
“Accompanied by his goddaughter, he soon finds himself squaring off against Jürgen Voller, a former Nazi who works for NASA.”
Harrison Ford reprises his role for the last time as Dr Henry Jones Jr. (or ‘Indiana’ Jones), while English actor Phoebe Waller-Bridge stars as the professor’s goddaughter, Helena Shaw.
Danish actor, Mads Mikkelsen is cast as the film’s antagonist, Dr Jürgen Voller, and he is joined by a host of familiar faces from previous Indiana Jones movies in nostalgia-fuelled cameos.

Who plays on the soundtrack for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny?
Violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter plays ‘Helena’s Theme’, a heart-wrenching, lyrical work for violin and orchestra, which showcases the lower range of the sonorous string instrument.
The German musician told Classic FM, “I am over the moon excited about Helena’s theme by the one and only John Williams.”
Mutter describes the character of Helena Shaw as a “strong female role” in the highly-anticipated new Indiana Jones film. “It is such a huge honour to be on this,” she added.
Mutter and Williams have a long history of musical partnerships, with the American composer having written for the German violinist multiple times. In 2024, she makes the UK debut of the ‘Superman Suite; Violin Concerto No.2’, written especially for her by Williams.
The violin virtuoso invited Williams to write a concerto for her, and the legendary composer was touched, commenting at the time, “I thought it was a wonderful opportunity to write for one of the world’s greatest artists.
“It was also a challenge, of course,” Williams added, “because there are so many great violin concertos in the repertoire.”

2023-07-07 16:30:00+00:00,‘Indiana Jones 5’: It Took 100+ VFX Industrial Light and Magic Artists to De-Age Harrison Ford,"Over 100 VFX artists spent three years working on ""Indiana Jones 5"" to help de-age Harrison Ford.","Before “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” even opened, the Disney adventure tentpole sparked intrigue with a de-aged Harrison Ford, who, in his fifth film playing the whip-cracking archaeologist, is now 80 years old.
The shots of a young Ford look impressive, and it’s thanks to the team of over 100 artists at Industrial Light and Magic, who spent three years on the film’s visual effects, which also included enhancing and developing their existing de-aging technology to create ILM FaceSwap.
Photorealism de-aging was nothing new to the team. After all, technology such as Flux existed and had been used on films such as “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” and “The Irishman.”
But when the film’s VFX supervisor Andrew Whitehurst and Robert Weaver, VFX supervisor at ILM, first took on the James Mangold-helmed “Dial of Destiny,” they knew this was going to be the biggest project they had undertaken.
Disney
“We knew we would have to use all of the tools we already had and develop some new ones,” Whitehurst says. So they developed ILM FaceSwap.
This new set of tools allowed the team to blend a full computer-generated 3D head, combine elements that had been extracted from on-set photography and, as Whitehurst explains, use “machine learning-based reference material from previous ‘Indiana Jones’ films.” Once the artists had that reference material, including a raw clay model in the shape of Ford’s Indy, they went to work making the actor look like a younger version of himself on a shot-by-shot basis.
But the process didn’t end there.
Weaver explains that while the machine learning aspect gave them a 2D replica of what they needed, there was still a full 3D CG asset that needed to be built.
“That involved putting Harrison through the process of recording all the facial performances and all its extremes, and the marrying of various technologies by the artists to blend between one and the other to get the final performance that you’re looking for,” Weaver explains. “The important aspect is that there’s not a single recipe that was cooked up that could be done for all shots.”
Whitehurst worked on the film for over three years, and one of the first things he did was “scan Harrison’s head so we had a current cast.” Once they had that, he and his team began building the 1944 CG head and used other elements from the Lucasfilm archives to help build that out.
While they were doing that, they also storyboarded the film’s prologue sequence to get an idea of the shots they needed. When it came to filming, Whitehurst says, “We made sure we were shooting with extra cameras attached to the main unit camera so we could get as much reference as we possibly could.”
That included capturing lighting references for every single setup so they could replicate it in the CG process.
Weaver says, “On the ILM side there were a few hundred artists involved in the process from start to finish, working on the various shots. They were working on every nuance in every shot. But we were able to achieve that because the reliance on the performance of Harrison was of utmost importance. He was the major driving force of what we needed to do for that opening act and make a younger act of that exact performance.”
Mangold was also key. Whitehurst calls it an “intense collaborative process” that began early, with the director laying out creatively how the sequence would play and “the action beats that would have to be featured within it.” Once the film got to post-production, Whitehurst says Mangold was “so open to hearing ideas from others.”
As to Ford, Weaver says, “We were just in awe as to what he is able to deliver, how fit he is and how much we could rely on him driving every aspect of the performance.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9hcnRpc2Fucy9uZXdzL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtNS1kZWFnaW5nLWhhcnJpc29uLWZvcmQtMTIzNTY2MzI2NC_SAVxodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvYXJ0aXNhbnMvbmV3cy9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLTUtZGVhZ2luZy1oYXJyaXNvbi1mb3JkLTEyMzU2NjMyNjQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-02 10:50:38+00:00,"Movie Review: ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" features a game Harrison Ford in a hit-and-miss final adventure - The Independent","When ""Indiana Jones & the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" hit theaters in 2008 nearly two decades after ""Last Crusade"" was released, I couldn't help but","MOVIE REVIEW: INDIANA JONES AND THE DIAL OF DESTINY (PG-13)
Let me preface this review by stating the obvious; I LOVE INDIANA JONES!!
“Raiders of the Lost Ark” is the film I’ve seen the most times in my 54 years on this planet. It’s an adventure movie of the likes we very seldom, if ever, see anymore. It’s lightning in a bottle. A near-perfect motion picture experience that I simply never tire of. As much as I love both “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” and “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade” (and I do love both of those films with every fiber of my being), neither is at the same level as the film that started it all. Given my absolute passion for “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” however, how could any of the other entries possibly measure up?
When “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” dropped in theaters in 2008 (nearly two decades after “Last Crusade” was released), I couldn’t help but be excited. Who are we kidding? I was ecstatic! At that point, I don’t think I had ever been that excited about a movie in my adult life. No…Not even with the arrival of new “Star Wars” movies. Of course, expectations can be a bitch and when unrealistically high expectations enter the equation, we have no one to blame but ourselves when a movie doesn’t quite hit that sweet spot for us. That is especially true of yours truly.
I love film so much that I am easily excitable, particularly when it comes to my favorites. That certainly dampened my experience with “Crystal Skull.” That was a movie I really thought I wanted but when I finally did get to see it, I realized pretty quickly that I only thought I wanted it. In fact, shortly before “Crystal Skull” opened, I joked that it didn’t have to measure up to the previous 3 and that I’d settle with it being half as good as its predecessors. And wouldn’t you know it? It was, arguably, half as good.
I didn’t hate it like a lot of other Indy fans do but there was no denying that it was a letdown of monumental proportions for me. Was it those damned expectations? Partly. But a big part of it is just how unnecessary that movie is. Yes… “Crystal Skull” certainly has its entertaining moments (who in their right might wouldn’t find the idea of seeing Indy and Marion together again at least moderately appealing) but in the end, that movie as a whole played like a shadowy reflection of its former self.
An epic 15 years have now passed since “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” divided fans. After months of waiting and a plethora of speculation and online scrutiny (some warranted and some not so warranted), “The Dial of Destiny” has finally arrived. And it comes to us with the great James Mangold at the helm marking the first time an Indiana Jones movie has hit the silver screen without the legendary Steven Spielberg leading the charge. It also comes to us with a now 81-year-old Harrison Ford at its center! Not that there’s anything wrong with that as I’m sure Ford could take a man half his age in a fight.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” (which, sadly, ditches the traditional transition shot/cross-dissolve from the Paramount logo to the opening frame of the film) wastes no time plunging us into the Nazi-centric action as Indy (played by a de-aged Ford) takes on his favorite enemy once more, circa the 1930s. After an extended opening, we cut to the late 60s and are introduced to a considerably older, slightly grumpier (and shirtless) Dr. Jones who, after being awoken from his nap, gets after his hippie neighbors for blasting their rock music too loud.
Eventually, on the day of his retirement, Indy is re-acquainted with his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge) and before long this unlikely duo is whisked away on a globe-trotting adventure that brings them face-to-face with old Indy foes, familiar friends from the past, and the mysterious title artifact.
As expected, “The Dial of Destiny” deals with themes of time and age head-on. Quite obviously, the film also deals with adventure, and through it all, Ford doesn’t let a little thing like age keep him from riding horses, punching out bad guys, and climbing mountains. Yes…Every step of the way, Ford proves that there are still plenty of years AND mileage left in this vehicle. But it isn’t just about physicality. Ford does manage to bring real emotional beats to the table (a scene in which he talks about his son with Helena is very moving) and he brings these beats when you might not expect them. In that regard, this weathered and more thoughtful Indiana Jones reminded me a little of another memorable character made popular by Harrison Ford; Jack Ryan.
Of course, the real question of the moment here is, how’s the movie? Well, I liked parts of it but if I’m being entirely honest, by the time the end credits rolled, I sort of felt the same way I felt after I watched “Crystal Skull” for the first time. I just sort of felt let down. No hate here, mind you, but again, it just all felt unnecessary. Not that these last two films were ever going to reach the heights of the 80s trifecta that inspired them but it would have been nice if they were at least in the same ballpark.
“The Dial of Destiny” does feature a handful of noteworthy moments that feel like vintage Indy. This film also manages to be more grounded than “Crystal Skull,” that is…Until a wild and altogether bonkers finale that is sure to divide fans just as much, if not more, than any interdimensional being ever could. That said, it isn’t the ridiculousness of this finale that bugged me but rather the way the characters are acting amidst all of the craziness. I just didn’t buy into it. Yes…I know it’s fantasy, and yes, I’m fully aware that Indy jumped from a plane in a raft and managed to survive a nuclear blast thanks to a refrigerator but even by those standards, the finale of this picture is pretty damn silly. Again, though, ridiculousness aside, “The Dial of Destiny” makes an attempt at something more somber and more grounded. Sometimes to a fault. As nutty as “Crystal Skull” was with its interdimensional beings-centric plot and despite the obvious CG overload, there was a propulsive energy to the action set pieces and a kind of magic to them, particularly the motorcycle chase across the college campus. Nothing in “The Dial of Destiny” rivals that particular set piece. No, not even the much-talked-about tuk-tuk chase. Technically speaking, the tuk-tuk chase is fine, but somehow, it simply isn’t as exciting mostly because it feels like it’s going through the motions and because there’s no real sense of urgency. That’s a real shame, too, because James Mangold (insert “Ford vs. Nazi” jokes here) is no slouch. He’s a perfectly capable director. Look no further than an incredibly diverse resume that features the likes of “Cop Land,” “Walk the Line,” “3:10 to Yuma,” “Logan,” and yes, “Ford vs Ferrari.” That said, one can’t help but wonder just how in charge Mangold was here. This is to say that there are times when “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” feels more like a film that was made by committee and again, that sucks…Especially with a storyteller as creative and as talented as Mangold in your corner.
As for the character work, it should come as no surprise that this is Ford’s movie, even when jokes are being made at his expense. There’s been a lot made of Bridge’s involvement in this film and as it stands, she’s okay. Whereas Indy co-leads go, she’s far less shrill than Willie Scott (Kate Capeshaw) and has more personality than Elsa Schneider (Allison Doody) but a Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) she’ll never be. As for her purpose and motivation, Helena Shaw is often quite selfish and even a little shifty in this movie, and that makes her somewhat unlikable to a certain degree. That said, in some ways, she’s driven in the same sort of way that the Indy of old was so taking her as such, you can feel what Mangold and crew were going for here. On the other hand, her occasional swipes at Indy can be obnoxious, and her pivotal moment during the finale (it involves a punch) didn’t work for me. Thankfully, though, Helena isn’t quite the harbinger of woke that some fans feared she might be.
Far more problematic in the character department is Helena’s sidekick, Teddy (played by Ethann Isidore), a role reminiscent of Short Round in “Temple of Doom” only without the natural likability of Ke Huy Quan. This is by no fault of Isidore. It’s simply the character as written. Seriously, there is virtually no reason for this character. He does serve a purpose in the finale but that purpose could have just as easily rested in the hands of Helena.
Elsewhere, “The Dial of Destiny” is populated by a handful of supporting characters. Some familiar (Sallah makes an all too brief return) and some new to the series (watch for bit parts by Antonio Banderas and Toby Jones.) When some of these new characters come face to face with danger, we don’t know them well enough to feel for them as much as we probably should, and that sometimes hurts the emotional impact of the movie. Thankfully, though, actors like Banderas and Shaunette Renee Wilson are charismatic enough to make their brief appearances at least a little engaging.
As for this film’s big bad, we get the great Mads Mikkelsen as Dr. Jurgen Voger. I count myself as a fan of this actor (if you haven’t seen his understated work in “Another Round,” do yourself a favor and go check it out.) and while it’s great seeing him front and center as the heavy, I’d be lying if I said the writing didn’t let him down a little bit. Translation; There have been stronger Indy foes and Mikkelsen was put to better use as a villain in “Casino Royale.” Likewise, Boyd Holbrook is a competent enough actor but despite his vicious nature in this movie, I didn’t find his Klaber particularly interesting. He’s just kind of one-note. More disappointing, though, is Olivier Richters’s lumbering henchman, Hauke. So big and so physically imposing is this man that when people run into him, it’s like they’re running into a brick wall. From the moment we see Hauke, it’s inevitable that he’ll get into an epic scrape with Indy, only…He doesn’t. Further still, Mangold resists the temptation to allow this guy to meet a grandiose demise and that’s disappointing because hulking baddies like this deserve the most grandiose demise possible.
As for the MacGuffin, it is in the grand tradition of other Indy MacGuffins; In the end, it’s all just an excuse to allow us to spend more time with Indiana Jones again, and some of the time, I was along for the ride. A lot of the time, I found myself surprisingly bored. That’s mostly due to wonky pacing and a running time that’s in the neighborhood of thirty minutes too long. “The Dial of Destiny” is front-heavy with action but once the tuk-tuk chase comes to a close at less than the midway point of the film, things slow down tremendously. Furthermore, an over-reliance on CG is often distracting. Perhaps not as much as it was in “Crystal Skull” but it’s still all too noticeable.
There’s been a bit of a turning of the tide with this movie in recent days. Following a couple of years of aforementioned speculation and a mostly lukewarm response after premiering at the Cannes Film Festival back in May, there have been plenty of fans jumping to the defense of this movie…Fans are more than willing to go along for the ride. Quite frankly, I think that’s awesome! I love that so many are getting the joy out of this film that they crave. Me? I’m clearly on the fence. Again, I’m certainly not a hater. There are things to enjoy here and there, and yes…It’s a joy seeing Ford don the Fedora one last time. Also, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t moved by a sweet and tender fan servicey moment at the end of the movie. It helps that this said moment is played affectionately and with real sincerity.
It also helps that maestro John Williams is back in the saddle. Truth be told, certain cues from the score–most notably in the first act–sound like they were directly lifted from past Indy scores but once the 60s hit, Williams settles into a groove and once again knocks it out of the park.
Beyond all of that, I’m certainly not delusional. As was the case with “Crystal Skull,” there was no way this movie was going to live up to its enormous legacy because quite frankly, the first three came out in a completely different time and there’s simply too much history there. Only time (no pun intended) will tell if “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” will get better with age or if it will fade from our collective memories but one thing is certain for this particular Indy fan; Even though I liked aspects of this Indiana Jones swan song, the series truly concluded with our favorite archeologist riding off into the sunset at the end of “The Last Crusade.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3N1aW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tL21vdmllLXJldmlldy1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LWZlYXR1cmVzLWEtZ2FtZS1oYXJyaXNvbi1mb3JkLWluLWEtaGl0LWFuZC1taXNzLWZpbmFsLWFkdmVudHVyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The actor, who is now 80, is playing a 70-year-old version of Indy in the upcoming movie.
In a new interview with Esquire, Ford shared a particular scene in which he fought to show this. Early on in the movie, Indy is riding a horse on a subway platform in New York City. When he finished the scene, he recalled feeling hands on his legs.
""I thought, 'What the fuck?' Like I was being attacked by gropers,"" he told the magazine. ""I look down and there’s three stunt guys there making sure I didn’t fall off the stirrup. They said, 'Oh, we were just afraid because we thought, you know, and bah bah bah bah.' And I said, 'Leave me the fuck alone, I’m an old man. Leave me alone, I’m an old man getting off a horse and I want it to look like that!'""
It’s certainly refreshing for age to be a central topic in an action movie like this, and Ford has previously spoken about it being one of the main reasons he came back. Chatting to Total Film magazine in our big cover feature on the movie, Ford explained: ""I always wanted to see a completion of the character. I wanted to see [Indiana Jones] at a later stage of his life, when he’s beyond the youthful enthusiasm and capacity, and beset by age and [stifled by academia]. I wanted to see him engage on one more unexpected, unanticipated adventure.""
It was important James Mangold’s version didn’t shy away from the topic, continued Ford. ""I wanted it to concern age, I wanted it to confront the issues of age for a character who had always been adventurous, youthful, and capable, physically. I wanted to see the effects of age on the character.""

2023-07-16 21:16:06+00:00,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny crosses $300 million at the global box office,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny crosses hits $302m at the global box office.,"Good news for Doctor Jones as Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny crosses the $300 million barrier at the global box office, far from the amount it would have hoped to acquire at this point but an indication that maybe the good doctor will have a better run at the box office than initially thought after its opening weekend.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny might not be doing so bad at the worldwide box office, but its extensive production budget might be the factor that prevents it from being a total success. As of this morning, the sequel directed by James Mangold has earned $302 million, finally matching the estimated $300 million it cost to be made. Even with Harrison Ford back in the iconic role of an archeologist who spends his free time saving the world from unspeakable evil, there’s no denying that the movie will have a hard time with turning a profit for the studio.
As Collider mention, the hefty budget is the main problem here, but with most major blockbusters costing upwards of $200m (Indy was north of $300m) it’s an obstacle that would appear to be here to stay. If Dial of Destiny had cost nearer to what Crystal Skull did 15 years ago ($185m back in 2008) then it would be a very different story. Surely the attitude of the Prequel Trilogy – develop technology to allow epic films to be made on a far more stringent budget – needs to be returned to in order to avoid such financial issues, even within the lucrative blanket of Disney. Either way, Dial of Destiny now looks far more likely to end its run in the $400m range rather than the $6-700m it was most likely looking for.

7/11/2023 23:32,‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Projected to Be Worst Performance of a Franchise,But that doesn't necessarily mean audiences' appetites for more adventures with Ford sporting a fedora have waned,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny might be destined ... to be a box-office flop.
Or, at least, a flop, relatively speaking, given that the fifthquel starring Harrison Ford, Mads Mikkelsen, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and Boyd Holbrook, had a $300 million budget and is projected to break even at the global kiosk. (Indy 5 has made about $250 million worldwide at the box office so far.)
But compared to its predecessors' finances (and if this projection is correct), the fifth and final adventure with the Man in the Hat would be a franchise-worst. Here's where the lifetime gross rankings stand as of now (July 11, 2023), per Box Office Mojo.
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull - $317.1 million Raiders of the Lost Ark - $212.2 million Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - $197.8 million Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom - $179.9 million Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny - $122.13 million
That's about $50 million shy of the 1984 sequel Temple of Doom's lifetime earnings. So, what happened?
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Ford's farewell as the titular swashbuckling, Nazi-fighting archaeologist and adventurer (and the first of the five flicks to be helmed by director James Mangold, taking over from Steven Spielberg), was hindered by critics' early thumbs-downs after catching it at its Cannes Film Festival premiere this May.
And critics have remained mixed on Indy's swan song, which garnered a 68% score on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, versus the 88% of positive audience reviews on the platform. The lukewarm feedback may have swayed Disney+ subscribers to wait to watch the film from the comfort of their homes when it hits streaming. (The rising cost of ticket prices doesn't help either.)
It isn't necessarily improbable that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny will be able to lasso more sales throughout its theater run, but with Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One's debut this Wednesday (a film that has averaged a 98% approval rating from 211 critics thus far), it appears impossible for Dial of Destiny to compete with the seventh installment in Tom Cruise's action/adventure spy saga this week (it releases this Wednesday).
Indy 5's not-so-dazzling box office performance hasn't exactly put a dent in Disney's theatrical earnings this year. Even with the Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny upset, coupled with an Elemental flop from Pixar, Disney has accrued $3.4 billion worldwide at the box office for the period of Jan. 1-July 2, owning five of the top 20 highest earning movies of 2023. (Funnily enough, Indy 5 and Elemental are two of those five titles, along with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, The Little Mermaid, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.)",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWVzc2VuZ2VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnktcHJvamVjdGVkLXdvcnN0LXBlcmZvcm1lci1mcmFuY2hpc2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

LaBeouf played the titular archaeologist and adventurer’s son, Mutt Williams, in 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, directed by Steven Spielberg.
Explaining LaBeuof’s absence at the Dial of Destiny Los Angeles premiere on Wednesday (June 14), Mangold told Variety: “I think the point I had was that when I came on, I wanted to capture that wonderful energy between Indy and an intrepid female character.”

“So that was my first goal, and there’s only so many people you can edge into a picture,” he added.
The fifth instalment in the Indiana Jones franchise stars Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Indy’s goddaughter, Helena.
Back in 2017, screenwriter David Koepp revealed that LaBeouf would not be returning. “Harrison plays Indiana Jones, that I can certainly say,” he told Entertainment Weekly, “And the Shia LaBeouf character is not in the film.”
The latest offering marks the final instalment of the Indiana Jones franchise, and sees Harrison Ford reprise his iconic role at the age of 80.
So far, Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny has received mixed reviews from critics, with some hailing it as delivering a “sweet blast of pure nostalgia”, while others have declared it to be a “complete waste of time”.
It’s also predicted to earn a disappointing $60million at the US box office in its opening weekend.

“This is perhaps sad for those weaned on the superb practical effects of earlier Indy outings. Still, it’s a lively, enthralling tale with some particularly emotive scenes in the final act that are bound to cause a tear or two. Some will ask why make this film at all?

,Harrison Ford Addresses That Age-Old Rumor That He Stapled His ‘Indiana Jones’ Hat to His Head During Filming,"Harrison Ford reflected on Indiana Jones' iconic costume in a new interview with GQ, in which he talked about stapling the character's hat to his head.","Harrison Ford is spilling the beans about Indiana Jones' wardrobe staples.
The 80-year-old actor said that during his stint as the franchise’s titular archaeologist — which he reprised one last time for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny this year — he had to use an unusual method to keep his iconic hat from flying off.
In a GQ video about the bullwhip-wielding character's legacy, behind-the-scenes footage from the first Indiana Jones installment shows a young Ford stapling Indy’s signature pinch-front fedora to his forehead.
“That should do it,” he says in the clip from the Raiders of the Lost Ark set.

When a GQ staffer mentions the video to Ford, the actor motions to a spot near his hairline, saying, “I still have the [scar], see it?”
“You do what you need to do,” he told the interviewer.
Ford also reflected on other aspects of his iconic Indiana Jones ensemble, which he said he had a lot of initial qualms about.
""It was presented to me as [an] aspect of character in the first film,"" he said in the video. “My questions about it were many.”
He went on to list some of his costume queries: “Why am I wearing a leather jacket in the jungle? Isn't it hot here? Why am I carrying a whip? What am I gonna do with a f------ whip? Are you gonna whip people?”
The Star Wars actor went on to say that he was told, presumably by someone in the 1981 film’s wardrobe department, that the archaeologist's outfit was “an evocation of a time period” and “reflection of movies past.”
The star added that despite his initial hesitation, he said “okay” to wearing the now-iconic 'fit, which, according to him, “makes it my own.”

""As this one concerns age and frailty and changing nature of life, it was especially compelling to me because I am of that age and I wanted it to feel real for the audience,"" Ford said of Dial of Destiny.

,‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Review,Sonny Bunch reviews the latest Indiana Jones movie and finds that the problems start before the action does.,"Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (Courtesy of Walt Disney Pictures)
THIS IS GOING TO SOUND LIKE A SILLY, petty complaint. And maybe it is. But you get a glimpse of everything that’s wrong with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny in the opening moments. Specifically, the order of the credited production companies. Even more specifically: the refusal to start the film as every other Indiana Jones movie has started: by dissolving from the Paramount logo to a mountain or mountain-like shape on the screen.
You know what I mean: going from the logo’s rendering of the Ben Lomond Mountain to a peak in South America in Raiders, or an engraving on a gong at the start of the musical sequence in Temple, or the butte in the American Southwest at the start of Last Crusade. Even Crystal Skull kept the gag going, though its rendering—a poorly animated gopher hole—betrayed some of that film’s problems as well.
It’s a little thing—one might even call it hokey—but it’s important because it sets the whole mood. This is a movie, that dissolve says. Not just any kind of movie. An old-timey action-adventure romp of the sort we, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, grew up watching. Go get your nickel’s worth of popcorn and kick up your feet.
Dial of Destiny doesn’t start on that dissolve because it can’t start on that dissolve because starting on that dissolve would defeat the entire purpose of this picture: for Disney to lay claim to the Indiana Jones property and all it stands for going forward. That’s why Lucasfilm and Disney share the first title card. Paramount gets the next one—an “in association with” credit, adding insult to injury—and one can only imagine the negotiations that went into securing that, as Paramount is no longer the distributor of these films.
Again: this is potentially dumb and possibly petty, but for a movie that is almost purely a nostalgia play—and a frequently charming one at that—it’s a sour note to start on. I couldn’t help but feel the same sort of pang I felt when John Williams’s opening Star Wars theme blared out of the theater speakers during The Force Awakens without the 20th Century Fox fanfare preceding it. The movie felt … naked. Exposed. It’s just wrong.
Anyway. After a prelude in World War II during which a de-aged Harrison Ford fights with Nazis for control of an ancient artifact supposedly built by Archimedes, the titular dial, we move to the late 1960s. The Beatles are on the radio. Ticker tape litters the street, as astronauts take their victory lap. Indiana Jones (Ford) lives alone in a messy one-bedroom, passed out in his easy chair, annoyed by the kids making a racket down the hall. A quick pan shows everything we need to know: a folded flag by a photo of a boy in uniform, presumably Mutt (Shia LaBeouf in the fourth movie), rests next to a faded picture of Indy’s dad (Sean Connery in the third). The sad story of this little apartment practically tells itself.
Indy—he of Arks and Temples and Crusades—is about to retire in lonely obscurity. On his way out the door, he’s stopped for drinks by his goddaughter, Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), who has some questions about the Antikythera, the Greek name for the eponymous dial. Where she might find the other half, for starters. So she can sell it. (She believes in the importance of museums a bit less than her godfather, particularly since she has some debts to pay.) A bit of hubbub later, and Indy and Helena are off to track down the Antikythera in its entirety, racing with Nazi physicist-turned-U.S.-rocket-scientist Dr. Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen).
I won’t talk much more about the plot; you deserve to see if the film’s big swing connects or not. What I will say is that it rides much less smoothly than Raiders of the Lost Ark, a perfect movie that just zips along from scene to scene and moment to moment, or Last Crusade, which is nearly as efficient. At more than two and a half hours, the picture drags, though it’s never quite boring. Ford remains incredibly charismatic, even as the broken, somewhat-hangdog Indy, and his repartee with Waller-Bridge is natural. Sallah’s (John Rhys-Davies) back! Antonio Banderas plays a diver pal of Indy’s! We may be missing the Paramount peaks, but there’s still a mountain of charm on the screen.
I just don’t think that’s quite enough. Dial of Destiny has the same problem that Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had: It looks phony throughout, and not only during effects-heavy scenes. I can’t tell if we’ve regressed when it comes to the technology of rear projection and green screen or what, but the sequences in which people are driving simply look fake, poorly done, the lighting and shadow and shading all wrong. At least with Crystal Skull we still had Spielberg behind the camera, meaning there’s a motion, a liveliness, a vibrancy to the proceedings. James Mangold is a solid, competent director—and there are moments, as in that aforementioned pan across the apartment, when you appreciate his restraint—but he’s not Spielberg. He doesn’t have that innate sense of visual movement or the ability to translate it to the big screen. No one does.
The only reason for this film to exist, then, is as an exercise in intellectual property propagation. Indy already got his sendoff in Crystal Skull; they even nodded at the passing of the torch to come. But now the character’s owned by a new distributor with new priorities. And so, Indiana Jones is pressed into duty once again at the behest of the raiders of the lost IP. When their faces melt at the sight of the nine-figure loss headed their way, one imagines they’ll wish they never tried to turn back time.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vcGx1cy50aGVidWx3YXJrLmNvbS9wL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny”
In this fifth installment of the franchise, Harrison Ford returns as the titular character who races to find an artifact that can change history. Phoebe Waller-Bridge plays his goddaughter.
Walsh: “They are trying to bop you over the head with nostalgic reminders and cameos. … They're trying to make you feel something with these reminders. But they're not actually making you feel anything with storytelling or character work. And it's a movie about time travel, literally, and then on a macro-level, it's just about them wanting to … travel back in time to recapture the magic of young Harrison Ford, which they do so quite literally and in a way that I find frustrating. And also at this point, I'm like, ‘Can we just leave this man alone?’”
Grierson: “It feels very much like a lot of sequels these days, where … they just didn't want to screw it up. And when you do that, I feel like you're not ambitious, you're not interesting. And then the last thing I would say is that as opposed to the original films, that had such great action sequences, the action sequences in this movie are not good specifically because they are so CGI-heavy that nothing feels real in any of them. So it's a big disappointment for me as well.”
“Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken”
This animated comedy follows a high school student who discovers she is a descendant of the kraken queens. She has to use her powers to protect the ocean from mermaids.
Grierson: “The movie has a lot of similarities to Pixar movies: ‘Turning Red,’ and ‘Luca.’ … But it also has a comparison to the most recent Pixar movie ‘Elemental,’ in that for me, I think the animation is really really gorgeous. … The underwater stuff looks great. My problem was that some of the story stuff is a bit familiar, a bit derivative. As appealing as Ruby is as a main character, I found the characters around her perhaps not as engaging.”
Walsh: “It is following this very standard, teen movie story. She wants to go to the prom but she happens to be a kraken and so it's a funny twist on that. … Also these ideas of friendship and figuring out who you are obviously. Like ‘Turning Red,’ it has this puberty metaphor built into it about when you reach a certain age, you turn into a giant monster, like the women in your family do, but you also get your powers.”
“Every Body”
This documentary, directed by Julie Cohen, follows the stories of three intersex activists.
Walsh: “This film really packs in a lot of scientific information about intersex people, as well as historical context and the way that the medical establishment has really … forced surgery on children, forcing parents to choose which gender their child should be at birth … and giving these kids surgery without their consent. And it's also told them to shroud their lives in secrecy. A lot of the intersex movement is about stopping the surgeries on kids until they can consent to what they want to be and it's also about coming out and living their lives without shame and secrecy.”
Grierson: “It is intended to be very much the introduction for a lot of viewers into this subject matter. It doesn't aspire to be definitive in any way. It's very personal and intimate. The movie also, I think, is very sympathetic and gracious about their parents — what the parents went through, not realizing that they were doing more harm than good for their kids.”
“Prisoner's Daughter”
A man who served 12 years in prison tries to reconnect with his daughter after finding out about his terminal illness. It stars Brian Cox and Kate Beckinsale.
Grierson: “[Brian Cox’s character has] spent a lot of his life in and out of prison, and he is a bad person who has done bad things, [and] is legitimately trying to make amends with his daughter because he knows his time is running out. Brian Cox is so good that Kate Beckinsale kind of pales in comparison, unfortunately. I would also say that the movie starts off pretty decently and there's a connection between these two characters. But it gets more and more convoluted as it goes along.”
Walsh: “The script by Mark Bacci is so predictable and standard. We know that they're gonna have a tough relationship because she doesn't want to let them back in. But then he's going to teach the grandson how to stand up to the school bullies and they're all going to have a nice experience together, but it's got a timeline on it. So this one you can skip.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rY3J3LmNvbS9uZXdzL3Nob3dzL3ByZXNzLXBsYXktd2l0aC1tYWRlbGVpbmUtYnJhbmQvdW5ob3VzZWQtc2NvdHVzLWZpbG0tcmV2aWV3cy1qdWx5LTQvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1kaWFsLXRlZW4ta3Jha2VuLWV2ZXJ5LWJvZHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” avoids the curse that befell its even-numbered predecessors, so score it 1,3,5,2,4, with this fifth adventure – the first not directed by Steven Spielberg – trailing the best two but ranking ahead of the others, especially “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” in 2008. Feeling the years and the miles, Harrison Ford cracks the whip for the last time, in a film that offers the requisite thrills and proves fairly emotional before it’s over.
Lucasfilm brass obviously liked what they saw, tasking director James Mangold (“Ford v. Ferrari”) with overseeing a “Star Wars” movie after he turned in “Dial of Destiny,” which features a world-weary Indy in 1969, looking out of place in that tumultuous period and weathering personal losses to go with various aches and pains.
Before getting to that, though, the film kicks off with a rousing 20-minute-plus flashback sequence, boasting some of the best de-aging technology witnessed yet, as the archaeologist and a colleague (Toby Jones) battle a train full of Nazis in the waning days of World War II.
Although they’re seeking the usual priceless relic, they actually stumble upon the MacGuffin that drives the action, an invention of the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes with the potential to achieve astonishing objectives to rival the Ark of the Covenant and Holy Grail. The object also catches the eye of a Nazi scientist (Mads Mikkelsen, whose reputation as a can’t-go-wrong villain, from James Bond to the Harry Potter franchise to “Doctor Strange,” is well served here).
Leaping forward, Indy is on the verge of retirement from a university gig when his old pal’s daughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge, perfectly credible in this mostly serious, swashbuckling role), waltzes into the picture seeking his help finding the aforementioned Dial of Destiny, with the Nazi and his henchmen, naturally, in hot pursuit.

Globetrotting adventures follow, and while Indy (and Ford) can still credibly pull off action sequences, the movie wisely acknowledges the passage of time, with Indy more than once noting he’s getting a little long in the tooth for these sorts of shenanigans.
Frankly, the “Indiana Jones” franchise would have been well-served by quitting when Jones and company literally rode into the sunset at the end of 1989’s “The Last Crusade,” but lobbying for such restraint ignores the sequel-hungry nature of the movie business. That disclaimer noted, “Dial of Destiny” delivers a credible and even somewhat poignant continuation of the character’s arc, including the amusing wrinkle of seeing him chafe against the Hippie culture of the late ’60s.
The notion of Indiana Jones himself becoming a relic from a bygone era shouldn’t be lost on anyone, and building such an exercise around a now-80-year-old lead imposes certain limits. But the film can still rely upon a few extremely durable assets, from Ford’s charisma to the giddy thrill of hearing composer John Williams’ fanfare struck up at theater-quality volume.
Although he’s about a decade older than Indy is supposed to be in most of the film, Ford is hardly slowing down, with current TV roles in “1923” and “Shrinking” to go with Marvel’s upcoming “Captain America” movie.
Even so, “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” serves as a nicely symmetrical bookend to his near-half-century run as an action star, and a role he’s inhabited for more than four decades. In that context, even with the movie’s dry patches, there’s enough here to make it well worth seeing Indiana Jones ride into the sunset – metaphorically, if not literally – one more time.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” premieres June 30 in US theaters. It’s rated PG-13.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8yOS9tb3ZpZXMvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1hbmQtdGhlLWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS1yZXZpZXcvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Tom Cruise wants to still make 'Mission: Impossible' movies in 20 years,"Tom Cruise wants to follow in Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones footsteps: ""I hope to keep making 'Mission: Impossible' films until I'm his age.""","Tom Cruise has already been playing Mission: Impossible hero Ethan Hunt for more than 20 years, but he doesn't intend to stop anytime soon. In fact, he wants to follow in the footsteps of long-tenured franchise star Harrison Ford, who just led Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny 42 years after first playing the title character in Raiders of the Lost Ark.
""Harrison Ford is a legend,"" Cruise told The Sydney Morning Herald at the Australian premiere of Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One this past weekend. ""I've got 20 years to catch up with him.""
Cruise continued, ""I hope to keep making Mission: Impossible films until I'm his age.""

While Cruise is certainly paying Ford a compliment, the latter previously told EW in a new digital cover story that he didn't totally love being called a ""legend.""
""I do not know what a legend does for a living,"" Ford said. ""I know that I consider myself to be a working actor, and I'll settle for that.""
He added, ""I suppose legend means that you've been around for a long time. And I think it's meant to be, uh, gracious, but it just, uh… sounds old.""
Ford hasn't just been occupied with donning his iconic fedora and picking up his token bullwhip. Also starring in the TV shows Shrinking and 1923, he's as busy as ever.
Meanwhile, Cruise has already starred in seven Mission: Impossible movies, and he's hardly out of juice. In EW's new review of Dead Reckoning, Part One, Maureen Lee Lenker writes that the movie's ""action and thrills are next-level,"" with a climactic stunt that is ""quite literally jaw-dropping.""

2023-06-30 10:00:01+00:00,"Indiana Jones hits theaters for one last adventure, but box office prospects look shaky","Box office analysts predict Disney's ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" will open to between $60 million and $65 million at the domestic box office.","It's Harrison Ford's final bow as the boulder-dodging, whip-wielding, Nazi-punching Indiana Jones.
On Friday, ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" arrives in theaters, marking the fifth and likely final chapter in the Lucasfilm movie franchise.
Disney spared no expense in bringing the film to the big screen, starting with a nearly $300 million production budget. Factor in marketing costs, which are typically equal to half the production budget, and a swanky premiere and after-party at the Cannes Film Festival, and ""Dial of Destiny"" has quite a hole to dig itself out of.
Box office analysts are predicting the film will capture between $60 million and $65 million during its first three days in theaters and around $90 million for the five-day holiday weekend. That would mark the latest mediocre opening in the summer blockbuster season, following disappointing bows for ""The Flash,"" ""Elemental"" and ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" earlier this month.
It would also fall well short of the $100 million ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" secured during its first three days in theaters in 2008. Previous Indiana Jones installments, released in the 1980s, saw significantly lower box office openings because tickets were significantly less expensive at that time and the films were released in fewer theaters.
For instance, ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was released in more than 4,200 theaters, while 1989's ""The Last Crusade"" was released in 2,300 cinemas, according to Comscore data. In 2023, blockbuster features are generally opening in 4,200 locations, with some films, such as Marvel's ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3,"" opening in as many as 4,450 locations.
""Dial of Destiny"" also marks the first time Steven Spielberg hasn't directed an Indy movie, although the musical score was written by franchise stalwart John Williams. James Mangold, who helmed ""Logan"" and ""Ford v Ferrari,"" directed the new one.
The sequel comes 15 years after the ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" which ended up with a 77% ""Fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes but was widely panned by audiences. Despite a solid opening, the fourth Indiana Jones film tallied only $317 million domestically. It did manage to reach $786 million globally, according to data from Comscore.
The lackluster audience response resulted in a pause in future films, including the potential for a spinoff featuring Shia LaBeouf as Indiana Jones' son Mutt Williams. In 2012, Disney bought Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion, eventually taking the franchise away from its previous studio partner Paramount Pictures. Disney kept the character on ice while it worked on new Star Wars and Willow content — two other franchises that came from Lucasfilm.
Now, in 2023, the fifth installment in the swashbuckling archaeologist's movie adventures has generated a 67% ""Fresh"" score as of Friday morning, with critics saying ""Dial of Destiny"" doesn't quite capture the thrill of earlier adventures. Still, with Ford donning his iconic hat and whip combo, the film gives audiences a nostalgic rush, according to the critical consensus.
It's unclear whether that will result in a ton of ticket sales, however.
""The target audience of men over 35, who grew up on the entire series, will need to show up with their families and, perhaps, introduce the iconic character to their little ones who weren't even around for the previous movie,"" said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. ""The franchise has overcome stalled pop culture relevance before, but this time it also has to face that added challenge of winning back viewers who weren't as keen on 'Crystal Skull' as they were for the original films.""
Hollywood has had mixed results with nostalgia plays in recent years. While ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" and ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" captured healthy box office sales, others have floundered on the big screen. ""Blade Runner 2049,"" ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" and ""Terminator Genisys"" came up short with old fans and new audiences in North America.
""Dial of Destiny"" could benefit from audiences keen to see Ford, who will turn 81 next month, hang up his fedora and potentially even pass off the torch to a new generation.
Even with tepid reviews heading into Friday's release, Robbins notes that critics and audiences don't always agree.
""Indiana Jones' nature as a traditionally less front-loaded franchise compared to the comic book blockbusters we're used to seeing play with a short fuse also means a sizable portion of its audience could opt to see the film after the initial fan-driven previews and opening day,"" he said.

,Harrison Ford and Phoebe Waller-Bridge are fighting for their lives in the otherwise lifeless Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"If there is one thing to take away from Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, it is that we owe the much-maligned prior entry...","click to enlarge Less boulder, more older.
If there is one thing to take away from Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, it is that we owe the much-maligned prior entry Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull an apology. At least that was well-directed and dynamic where this new entry is not.
While both are imperfect sequels that attempt to build on a trilogy that concluded decades ago, the first crack at it now looks downright charming. For any who bemoan its ""nuking the fridge"" scene, moments like that fit in well with the cartoonish roots of the character. Above all else, it saw series director Steven Spielberg returning to prove he is still a talented filmmaker whose passion and precision are now painfully absent here. All the fridge nuking in the world would be more fun than whatever this is. The only saving grace is the cast, but they are trapped in the confines of a surprisingly dull film.
Starting it all off is an extended flashback scene in 1944 where Indiana Jones must fight the Nazis once again. Yet, we don't really see Harrison Ford in any real sense for quite a while. Rather, we see a digitally de-aged version of him that, while not the worst example of the technology, still holds viewers at a distance that grows increasingly distracting. Worse still, the stiffness of his voice sounds perpetually off, making it hard to get immersed in what is meant to be the movie's exciting start, while also establishing the timey wimey artifact that the characters will spend the rest of the film chasing.
When the film then jumps forward decades into the future as the space race is in full swing, we pick back up with Ford's Jones in the actual flesh in what is initially promising fashion. Drunkenly passed out in his apartment, he is stirred from his fitful slumber by the loud music of his neighbors. He grumpily yells at them to turn it off before going to his last day of work before a forced retirement. This is complicated when his goddaughter Helena, played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge (of the spectacular and shattering series Fleabag) pays him a visit to ask about said time artifact he recovered back in 1944.
Of course, since this is an Indiana Jones film, a group of Nazi goons — led by Mads Mikkelsen's Dr. Jürgen Voller — are not far behind. Cue the classic John Williams theme as we then go on one last globe-trotting adventure. (At least, one hopes this is the last one, if any future sequels are going to be as banal as this one.)
It isn't that Dial of Destiny does anything particularly egregious, as it mostly plays out as a greatest hits of Indiana Jones from solving puzzles to evading creepy-crawlies, but there is nothing all that bold about it either. When the execution of these rather safe sequences are pedestrian at best and plodding at worst, it soon grows tiresome rather than thrilling. Though it picks up in the finale by taking us somewhere Indiana Jones has never gone before, the superficial and often empty road to get there undercuts the more bonkers swing it attempts. For a film about a character looking to the past, you'd have hoped it would have learned something new rather than just regurgitating more of the same that we've all seen done far better before.
There is still something more substantial Ford brings, but we only get small glimpses of it. Jones carries plenty of regrets, and we see they have taken their toll on him. Ford has portrayed this character more than any other, and it's unfortunate to see the care for the role be let down by the slapdash film around him. Even the action — which had a kineticism in all of the past films, even in Crystal Skull — is without the same spark. The back-and-forth Ford has with a delightful Waller-Bridge is the only thing keeping the film even close to afloat. This was obviously never going to be a fully somber affair, as the series has always been centered on adventure, but the scenes where the two performers are given space to delve into loss makes one wish this impatient yet also oddly rushed film had not been so averse to leaning into this pathos.
Though the way the ending leaves behind silly spectacle for genuine emotion is unexpectedly sweet, it comes far too late to matter much. Much like how Jones himself was haunted by the mistakes that accumulated in his past, the last-ditch attempt by the film itself to tap into something deeper can't stop it all from slipping away. ♦

2023-07-06 14:00:31+00:00,‘Indiana Jones 5’ actress asked to change “offensive” scene,'Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny' star Shaunette Renée Wilson says she asked director James Mangold to change one of her scenes.,"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny star Shaunette Renée Wilson has revealed that she asked director James Mangold to change one of her character’s scenes.
Wilson plays CIA Agent Mason in the fifth Indiana Jones installment who is fatally shot by Mads Mikkelsen’s Nazi astrophysicist, Jürgen Voller, in the film.
But Wilson was compelled to give Mangold notes about the “problematic” way that her character exited the movie.

She spoke to Variety in May at the film’s Cannes premiere about the situation. Variety held off from publishing her comments at the time to avoid sharing spoilers about the movie, which was released last month.
“I was quite impressed by a lot of things, but I also had thoughts and wanted to make input about my character in particular,” she said.
“And the brilliance and wonder of James Mangold is his ability to collaborate, and he heard me out and he was very honest about it and took what I said and it was implemented in rewrites. That has been a wonderful part of this process – to actually be able to feel like you are integral and you have a point of view when it comes to what’s being written.”
She continued that she initially found her character’s exit “to be a little too offensive and a bit problematic”.
“I was like, ‘We probably don’t need to say these words or have it done this way, and this is something I’m uncomfortable with.’”

Wilson praised Mangold for his openness to collaboration, adding: “He was like, ‘You know what, you’re completely right, I hear you. That’s something I flagged as well.’ And we were able to work on that.”
Meanwhile, in other news, a mask used for Harrison Ford’s stunt double in Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny has been described as “horrifying” by fans online.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5tZS5jb20vbmV3cy9maWxtL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtNS1hY3RyZXNzLWFza2VkLXRvLWNoYW5nZS1vZmZlbnNpdmUtc2NlbmUtMzQ2NTY3ONIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Harrison Ford accepts blame for Brad Pitt tension on Devil's Own set,Harrison Ford is opening up about the creative differences that troubled the Brad Pitt-starring 1997 thriller.,"Harrison Ford is finally dishing on the drama that went down between him and Brad Pitt while they were shooting the 1997 film The Devil's Own.
The Indiana Jones star admitted to Esquire that he was partially at fault for the long-rumored tension that swirled between him and Pitt on the set of the cop drama.
""First of all, I admire Brad. I think he's a wonderful actor. He's a really decent guy. But we couldn't agree on a director until we came to Alan Pakula, who I had worked with before but Brad had not,"" Ford explained, referencing his work on Pakula's 1990 film Presumed Innocent.
Brad Pitt & Harrison Ford. everett
In addition to not seeing eye-to-eye on a director, Ford said that his desire for his character to have a more complex storyline like Pitt's also drew pushback. In the film, Ford stars as NYPD Sergeant Tom O'Meara, whose family takes in an Irish construction worker named Rory Devaney (Pitt) only to discover that Devaney is an undercover IRA terrorist attempting to purchase a cargo of missiles.
""Brad had this complicated character, and I wanted a complication on my side so that it wasn't just a good-and-evil battle,"" he said. ""And that's when I came up with the bad-shooting thing.""
As a result, a subplot for Ford's character in which he's conflicted over what to do after witnessing his partner, Eddie Diaz (Rubén Blades), fatally shoot a thief was worked into the film. However, the process of weaving it all together — while the film was still shooting— proved to be a serious challenge.
""I worked with a writer — but then all the sudden we're shooting and we didn't have a script that Brad and I agreed on,"" Ford said. ""Each of us had different ideas about it.""
Now, in hindsight, Ford knows his requests were largely responsible for the pair's standoff. ""I understand why he wanted to stay with his point of view, and I wanted to stay with my point of view — or I was imposing my point of view, and it's fair to say that that's what Brad felt,"" he said. ""It was complicated. I like the movie very much. Very much.""
In 1996, EW's Chris Nashawaty detailed the breakdown that Pitt and Ford's feud had on the film, noting that its budget ballooned from $70 million to almost $100 million. It also caused Pitt to push back filming his upcoming project, 1997's Seven Years in Tibet, for an additional two months after Devil's Own did not wrap at its June deadline.
At the time, a Columbia-based producer told EW that Pitt and Ford ""seem to have had different versions"" of the film in their minds. However, Ford's agent denied ""all these ugly rumors"" surrounding The Devil's Own in a statement and claimed that there was no fight for its leading role between the actors.

,How to watch the Indiana Jones movies in order,"Ahead of 'The Dial of Destiny,' here's how to watch the Indiana Jones movies in order, from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' to 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.'","Since his debut in 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark , Indiana Jones has remained one of Hollywood's most iconic action heroes. The blockbuster series currently consists of four movies (the fifth, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny , comes out June 30), and its influence on pop culture cannot be overstated. The franchise reinvigorated the adventure genre, prompted the PG-13 rating , and inspired multiple generations of filmmakers and audiences alike. Now, ahead of the newest installment, we've assembled a guide to the first four Indiana Jones movies and where to stream them. Here's how to watch them in order.
01 of 04 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) Everett Collection The movie that started it all follows archaeologist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) as he tries to locate the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis can get their hands on its mysterious mythical powers. Co-creators George Lucas and Steven Spielberg sought to recapture the spirit of old-school adventure serials from their childhood with modern technology and massive production value — and, no surprise, they pulled it off. The final product established a breathtaking period aesthetic and maintained an exhilarating pace that rivaled every action-adventure movie that came before it. Set in 1936, Raiders begins with a legendary opening sequence in Peru in which Indy's pursuit of an ancient golden idol pits him against rival adventurer René Belloq (Paul Freeman) and duplicitous sidekick Satipo (Alfred Molina) in a booby-trapped temple. Almost immediately, we're treated to some of the most iconic moments in adventure film history: Indy swapping the artifact with a bag of sand, snatching his fedora as a door comes crashing down, and barely outrunning an enormous boulder. After catching his breath enough to teach at Marshall College, Indy reconnects with his old flame Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and embarks on his quest to find the Ark's hidden resting place, lest it fall into the wrong hands. The next sub-two hours gallop along at a breakneck speed as Indy punches his way out of a burning Nepalese bar, evades adversaries in a Cairo marketplace, escapes a pit full of snakes, fights enemies under an airplane, chases a Nazi truck on the back of a horse, and avoids having his face melted off by the power of Yahweh. Raiders owes much of its success to the electrifying, enduring performances from Ford and Allen. The former uses his signature sarcastic swagger to create a scrappy, romantic action hero who's an exhausted perennial underdog, while the latter blends a warm, bubbly demeanor with a tough, no-nonsense attitude that makes Marion a formidable match for Indy. They each possess considerable cleverness and physical toughness that make them perfect onscreen partners, and their screwball banter ensures that all of their conversations are a blast to watch. Beneath it all is impeccable direction from Spielberg with an assist from John Williams' unforgettable score. Where to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark: Disney+ and Paramount+
02 of 04 Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) © Lucasfilm Ltd. & TM. All Rights Reserved. The second Indiana Jones film, Temple of Doom, is actually the first Indy movie chronologically — it takes place in 1935, one year before the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Given that their plots are barely connected, there's no real advantage to watching Temple before Raiders, so we recommend binging the movies by order of release date. More importantly, Temple is vastly inferior to its predecessor as an introduction to Indy and as an overall film. Nightclub singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) sings a Mandarin rendition of ""Anything Goes"" in Temple of Doom's magnificent opening sequence (which foreshadows Spielberg's future musical virtuosity in 2021's West Side Story). Soon, there's a tense shootout in Club Obi-Wan (a not-so-subtle nod to Lucas' other adventure mega franchise) that unites Willie with Indy and his orphan sidekick Short Round (a 12-year-old Ke Huy Quan). During a botched escape attempt, the gang falls out of a plane and ends up in an Indian village, where they take on a mission of rescuing kidnapped children and recovering a sacred stone from a nearby palace. Along the way, they face a murderous cult, assassins, and various modes of supernatural peril. Temple of Doom took on a darker narrative and tone than its beloved precursor, perhaps in part because of its creators' recent personal tragedies (at the time of its production, Lucas had just gone through a divorce, and Spielberg's previous project, Twilight Zone: The Movie, had an infamous on-set helicopter accident that resulted in three deaths). Gleefully torturing both its characters and its audiences, Temple of Doom's violence — featuring disembodied hearts, human sacrifice, and child slavery — prompted an outcry that directly led to the creation of the PG-13 rating. Though all Indy movies paint with broad, uneasy strokes when it comes to cultural depictions, Temple of Doom is particularly egregious. The film's reductive, cartoonishly negative representations of East and South Asian cultures makes it a more uncomfortable watch than the other films in the series. It isn't without its merits, though: The action scenes are undeniably thrilling, the aforementioned musical number is dazzlingly constructed, and the sets and practical effects provide a foreboding atmosphere and a magnificent sense of scale.

03 of 04 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) Getty Indy's third adventure sands down the rougher edges of the franchise, injecting more humor and heart via a focus on the hero's relationship with his father. It's the most lighthearted, family-friendly entry in the series — and one of the funniest movies in the filmographies of Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford. Last Crusade starts with the earliest chronological scene in the entire series: A flashback prologue chronicling one of Indy's teenage adventures in 1912. River Phoenix portrays the younger version of Ford as he fights a group of robbers on a circus train in Utah. The rest of Last Crusade functions as a pretty straightforward sequel to Raiders. In 1938, Indy once again goes on a quest for another biblical artifact, and yes, this one also sees him racing the Nazis to the finish line. Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) both join him on his journey, but Indy's primary partner in Last Crusade is his father, Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery). The elder Jones is also a professor in pursuit of the Holy Grail, and his relationship with his son is complicated — a dedicated career man, Henry was distant as a parent during Indy's youth, and neither man fully respects the other. Over the course of their adventure, however, the two come to recognize their similarities and grow closer than ever before. Ford and Connery share a stellar chemistry that creates constant humor via incessant bickering, and also brings the most emotional catharsis of the entire series. Though it's not quite as tightly constructed as Raiders, Last Crusade undoubtedly earns its place in the canon of great adventure movies thanks to a multitude of strengths. The globetrotting location work and exemplary set design provide a gorgeous, expansive backdrop to every exhilarating set piece — Indy fights robbers in Monument Valley, zooms through Venice's canals on a speedboat, escapes from a Scottish castle, infiltrates a Nazi zeppelin, battles a tank in Turkey, and explores a massive temple in Petra. The character work is also stronger than the previous two entries, shedding light on facets of Indy's personality and psychology that hadn't been explored before.

2023-06-09 13:00:00-04:00,REVIEW: Three New Cocktails From Indiana Jones: Den of Destiny at Disney’s Hollywood Studios,"The Indiana Jones: Den of Destiny opened today at Disney's Hollywood Studios, and it features a host of new drinks.","The Indiana Jones: Den of Destiny opened today at Disney’s Hollywood Studios, and it features a host of new drinks. The lounge opens at 10:00 AM each day, so those wishing to start their day with a cocktail and no judgment are welcome at this limited-time outpost. The Den of Destiny was created to promote the upcoming film “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which opens later this month in American theaters. The full tour can be found here.
The lounge is located in the former Indiana Jones Adventure Outpost store. Currently the bar does not require reservations, and accepts walk-up guests.
Den of Destiny Bar Menu
The menu features three signature cocktails representing exotic adventures and two beers. There is a limit of two alcoholic beverages per adult. Lost Coast Tangerine Wheat Ale from California is $10.25 and the ubiquitous Cigar City Jai Alai from Tampa, Florida is also $10.25.
We tried the three cocktails: The Adventuress Margarita, The Weathered Fedora, and L’Atlantique Green Tea.
L’Atlantique Green Tea – $6.25
Pomegranate Green Tea, Blood Orange, Lemon Juice and Agave Nectar
This non-alcoholic drink is a very refreshing tea perfect for summer. Probably sweeter than most would expect, it’s got more fruit juice than green tea. The citrus is featured prominently, with enough agave nectar to eliminate any chance of sourness. The more we drink, the more we think it tastes like Hi-C fruit punch.
The Adventuress Margarita – $13.50
Corazón Blanco Tequila, Passion Fruit Papaya Green Tea, Cucumber, Lime Juice, and Agave Nectar
This is another refreshing drink but it’s a bit too syrupy for our taste. Both this and the L’antique Green Tea are premixed in a dispenser, so they are clearly shooting for a quick turnaround at the expense of quality, handcrafted beverages. The flavor of the green tea base is almost lost because the cucumber flavor dominates. If you like cucumber-flavored drinks, you’ll love this. If you’re accustomed to light, lime-forward, tart, and boozy margaritas, this will disappoint. It’s too sweet and syrupy to really be considered a margarita, so we would recommend you pass on this one.
The Weathered Fedora – $14.50
Old Forester Kentucky Straight Bourbon, Sweet Vermouth, Vanilla, Hella Cocktail Co. Ginger Bitters, Star Anise, Cinnamon and Nutmeg served over an Ice Sphere
Introducing The Weathered Fedora, an intriguing libation that combines the classic allure of Old Forester Kentucky Straight Bourbon with a touch of creativity. This concoction offers a familiar bourbon foundation complemented by the delightful interplay of Sweet Vermouth, Vanilla, Hella Cocktail Co. Ginger Bitters, Star Anise, Cinnamon, and Nutmeg. Served over an Ice Sphere, it presents a visual feast and a captivating taste experience. For those unaccustomed to bourbon, the unique flavors of vanilla and spices provide an unexpected twist that is sure to please. However, bourbon aficionados seeking complexity may find themselves yearning for a more intricate blend.

2023-07-01 15:32:08+00:00,Box Office: ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Whips Up $24 Million Opening Day,"""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is still projecting a $60 million debut weekend for the Harrison Ford finale.","Indiana Jones has begun his last box office crusade, with the fifth franchise entry earning $24 million on its opening day from 4,600 theaters. It’s a figure that includes $7.2 million in Thursday previews.
The release from Disney and Lucasfilm is expected to debut near the bottom of projections, with a three-day opening of $60 million or so. It’ll be more than enough for the Harrison Ford action-adventure film to land in the top spot on domestic charts, setting itself up to draw crowds through the Fourth of July holiday — but it’s not exactly the victorious tone-setter for one of the most expensive American blockbusters ever made. With a whopping $295 million production budget, “Indiana Jones 5” faces quite the trek to theatrical profitability.
The skies have been cloudy for “Dial of Destiny” for some weeks now, ever since the franchise finale made a splashy debut at the Cannes Film Festival and earned reviews that could kindly be described as mixed. After weathering that mediocre buzz for more than a month, the film has balanced out at a 58% approval rating from top critics on Rotten Tomatoes. In Variety‘s review, chief film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote that “James Mangold’s action epic is made in the style of Steven Spielberg, but the exhilaration is gone.”
The first round of ticket buyers are more positive, as indicated by the “B+” grade through research firm Cinema Score, but that’s still not a level of excitement that’s appropriate for a beloved franchise homecoming, especially one of this scale.
The last feather in Indy’s cap was “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” which opened to $100 million over the Memorial Day holiday in 2008 and legged out a $790 million worldwide gross. That film drew its own middling reception, which may have taken away some of the thrill of the franchise for audiences. It’ll be difficult for “Dial of Destiny” to match the final gross of its predecessor.
James Mangold took the director’s seat for this outing after franchise co-creator Steven Spielberg bowed out during a lengthy development process. “Dial of Destiny” sees a weathered Indiana Jones searching for a mystical artifact with the power to change the course of history. The professorial globe-trotter is accompanied by his goddaughter, Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), in a race against a former Nazi (Mads Mikkelsen) for the treasure.
While Disney is facing an underwhelming arrival for “Indiana Jones,” it can take some solace in the fact that it’s not laying the biggest box office egg this weekend. Universal’s “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken” is likely opening outside of the top five after earning $2.3 million from 3,400 theaters on Friday. A finish around $6 million over the three-day frame seems to be where things are headed.
Nobody in the industry has been projecting good numbers for the DreamWorks Animation film and this pin-drop opening represents the proverbial Band-Aid getting ripped off. Facing strong competition for family audiences in “Indiana Jones” and animated holdovers “Elemental” and “Across the Spider-Verse,” “Ruby Gillman” doesn’t have any hope to recoup its $70 million production budget. For what it’s worth, ticket buyers have been positive, as indicated by the “A-” grade on Cinema Score.
Sony looks to take silver with “Across the Spider-Verse,” projecting an $11.7 million gross for its fifth weekend of release. The “Spider-Man” sequel is looking at another soft drop around 40% or so; arachnids have eight legs and this movie is using all of them to keep its numbers climbing. Total domestic gross should push to $340 million through Sunday.
Disney and Pixar’s “Elemental” is looking at third place. The animated romance added $3.4 million on Friday to push its North American total to $80 million. “Elemental” still won’t be able to justify its $200 million production budget after debuting with the worst opening numbers in Pixar’s history, but it’s held well since then. The film will almost certainly push beyond a $100 million domestic gross — a milestone that seemed beyond reach two weeks ago.
Sony’s “No Hard Feelings” is projecting $7.1 million through the weekend, which would push its domestic total to $28 million. That would be a modest 51% drop from its opening numbers, but the Jennifer Lawrence comedy still cost $45 million to produce.
“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” looks to round out the top five, projecting a 43% drop in its fourth weekend of release. The Paramount sequel should reach a $135 million domestic gross through the three-day frame.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LW9wZW5pbmctZGF5LWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS0xMjM1NjU5NjEyL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LW9wZW5pbmctZGF5LWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS0xMjM1NjU5NjEyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Harrison Ford's Heroic Legacy Explored in New PEOPLE Special Edition: From Landing 'Star Wars' to His Last Ride as Indy,"PEOPLE explores Harrison Ford's iconic movie career and life in a new Special Edition, looking back to his years as a carpenter in Hollywood before securing his iconic 'Star Wars' role as Han Solo — and how it led to another major film franchise as famous archeologist Indiana Jones","Harrison Ford has starred in some of the world's most popular movies — and yet he's said he never set out to be a movie star.
“I don’t want to be a movie star,” Ford, now 80, told PEOPLE in 1981. “I want to be in movies that are stars.”
Ford, a Park Ridge, Il., native, dropped out of Wisconsin's Ripon College to move to Los Angeles in 1964, though it took him close to a decade to break through in the film industry.
PEOPLE's new special edition, Harrison Ford: America's Greatest Movie Hero, is available now wherever magazines are sold.
After working for a number of years as a carpenter to supplement income earned from a contract with Columbia Pictures, the actor met eventual Star Wars creator George Lucas when he was cast in Lucas's 1973 movie American Graffiti.
Though Ford and Lucas had already worked together before Star Wars began searching for its Han Solo, Ford only got the part by happenstance: he was doing carpentry work for Francis Ford Coppola when Lucas and Richard Dreyfuss arrived to read for Solo. Eventually, Lucas asked Ford to read for the part — launching his career to new heights in a galaxy far, far away.
Ford went on to play Han Solo in all three original Star Wars movies, shocking fans when his character was indefinitely frozen in 1980's The Empire Strikes Back before his rescue in Return of the Jedi's opening sequence three years later. He also reprised the role in 2015's The Force Awakens, which made good on the actor's long-held desire to give Solo a tragic death.
Notably, the actor improvised perhaps the most memorable line of Star Wars' original trilogy: he decided to say ""I know,"" in response to Princess Leia's (Carrie Fisher) declaration of love, though the movie's original script called for a longer line and its director Irvin Kershner simply wanted Han to say ""I love you"" back.

Star Wars spawned a creative partnership between Lucas and Ford that was fastened further when the filmmaker teamed up with Steven Spielberg for what became the first Indiana Jones movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).
Surprisingly, Ford was not their first choice for the role: the two visionary filmmakers wanted to cast Tom Selleck, but when Selleck committed to film Magnum, P.I., instead, they turned to Ford, who helped spawn a second iconic Hollywood franchise. Ford reprises the role one last time in his new movie Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
Jonathan Olley / Lucasfilm Ltd.
Spielberg's desire to collaborate with Ford did not end with Indiana Jones' adventures. The director filmed a cameo with Ford for his 1982 classic E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, in which Ford played Elliott's (Henry Thomas) school principal Harold Solo.
In the final cut of the film, the actor's face is obscured from full view, but a sequence was originally filmed that would have shown Ford in full view for a scene with Elliott and E.T. himself.
Ford debuted Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny at the Cannes Film Festival in May, with some critics calling it his ""most emotional"" performance as the character.
In September 2022, Ford himself got emotional while speaking at the D23 Expo and showcasing footage from the sequel to fans. ""Thank you for making these films such an incredible experience for all of us. I'm very proud to say that this one is fantastic,"" he said.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny opens in theaters June 30.

,"'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' PEOPLE REVIEW: Indy's Last Hurrah Starts Slow, Finishes Strong","Read PEOPLE's review for 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,' starring Harrison Ford and Phoebe Waller-Bridge","Admirably stoic and unfussy, Harrison Ford has played Indiana Jones for more than 40 years—running, riding, jumping and tumbling this way and that, up and down as the physically challenging role demanded. If he hadn’t been a Hollywood star he could have been a battle-scarred Norse legend—Beowulf with a fedora.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the fifth and final film in this astonishingly successful franchise, starts with a long, clunky and somewhat dull prologue that’s also a bit of a bait-and-switch. We’re back in World War II Europe: Young Indy (Ford, de-aged with great skill) has been captured by the Nazis and foiled in his attempt to keep Hitler from getting hold of a legendary artifact, the Lance of Longinus. But there’s a second object of antiquity in play, a device that could upend world history (no one in an Indiana Jones movie is ever itching to discover something as insignificant as a painting from Picasso’s lost ""purple"" phase). Created by the Greek mathematician Archimedes, this mythical doohickey is a dial with wheels as meticulously engineered as those in a modern watch. It would have required an enormous Swatch band!
At any rate, Indy escapes, and the dial becomes the engine of a 2 hour, 20-plus minute film that alternately ambles and races to its conclusion, with John Williams’s brassy theme blaring out from time to time like a strategically administered dose of Viagra.
The story jumps forward to 1969. Indie is now more rumpled and taciturn than ever, living in a messy, ugly Manhattan apartment that could have been rented to Richard Dreyfuss in an old Neil Simon rom-com. He’s still having to contend with that Greek thingie: His goddaughter Helena (Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge) wants to find it and make a fortune. So off they go!
Waller-Bridge and Ford. Jonathan Olley / Lucasfilm Ltd.
Waller-Bridge is a brilliant talent, but she’s wrong here — she lacks the right cynical brassiness. It’s like casting Emma Thompson when you need Barbara Stanwyck. Okay, sure, that actress died in 1990, but who’s to say that digital magic and Archimedes’ genius couldn’t resurrect her? Meanwhile, the movie squanders Antonio Banderas in a tiny role and under-utilizes Mads Mikkelsen in a bigger one: Voller, Indy’s Nazi rival for the disc. Then again, Mikkelsen doesn’t necessarily have the hammy vitality to capitalize on a role like this. His performances tend to be immaculately precise, as if the emotions were measured by pipette.
The movie delivers some satisfying if unsurprising action sequences — the customary boobytrapped tomb — before suddenly springing to thrilling life in its concluding third. There have been grumblings online that this final twist, which is both crazy and inspired, isn't too far off from shark-jumping, but that’s scarcely fair: Let's not forget that Raiders of the Lost Ark reconfigured the Ark of the Covenant as a nuclear device.
Even as time itself spins on its invisible axis, Ford always seems completely sane. That may have been key to this whole franchise. Imagine if it had starred Jack Nicholson.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is now playing in theaters.

2023-07-03 03:36:28+00:00,"China Box Office: ‘Indiana Jones’ Flops on Opening, as ‘Lost in the Stars’ Reaches $320 Million by Second Weekend","'Lost in the Stars' expanded on its second weekend of release at the mainland China box office, earning it a cumulative of $320 million.","Chinese mystery drama “Lost in the Stars” expanded in its second week on release and gave China its third biggest box office weekend of the year. That local success came as Hollywood tentpole “Indiana Jones: The Dial of Destiny” failed to land a top five place in the Middle Kingdom on its debut weekend.
“Indiana Jones” earned just $2.4 million in China, according to estimates from local data providers. It played some 25,000 screenings per day on Friday but earned less than $900,000. Exhibitors then slashed the number of sessions by half on Saturday. They further trimmed the number of playdates on Sunday when it slipped to seventh place. Consultancy, Artisan Gateway did not provide confirmed data for “Indiana Jones” in China.
“Lost in the Stars” earned $117 million, according to Artisan Gateway. That was significantly up from its opening weekend of $70.7 million (RMB502 million) a week earlier and enough to make it the second biggest film on the planet, behind “Indiana Jones,” which was more successful in other territories. After two weekends on release, “Lost in the Stars” has accumulated $320 million.
“Lost in the Stars” is a Chinese adaptation of a 1990 Russian movie “A Trap for the Lonely Man,” which itself was adapted from a Robert Thomas stage play. It sees a woman disappear while on an overseas trip with her husband. Just as mysteriously, she reappears at the moment that the search for her is running out of steam. But the man refuses to accept that she is the same woman and believes that she is an imposter.
The Chinese adaptation was scripted by hitmaker Chen Sicheng (“Detective Chinatown” franchise) and co-directed by Liu Xiang (“Knock Knock”) and Cui Rui. The cast is headed by Zhu Yilong, Ni Ni, Janice Man and Du Jiang.
“Never Say Never,” written and directed by actor Wang Baoqiang (“Lost in Thailand,” “Detective Chinatown””) does not officially release in China until July 6. Nevertheless, its previews were strong enough to earn it $25.6 million and take second place over the weekend. Earnings to date add up to $38.9 million.
Chinese romance film “Love Never Ends” earned $10.7 million. With a five-day opening a week earlier, the film now has a cumulative score of $45 million.
“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” was the top Hollywood title in China, earning $3.8 million in fourth position. Its cumulative total is $85.4 million.
Previews for Lightchaser animation “Chang An” earned the film fifth place and $3.2 million of advanced revenue. It releases officially on July 8.
The strong performances of the top two films, in particular, made it a big weekend. Nationwide gross revenue was $170 million. Artisan Gateway calculates that the year-to-date total is $3.77 billion. That is 56% ahead of the same point last year and 14% behind the equivalent in 2019.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvY2hpbmEtYm94LW9mZmljZS1sb3N0LWluLXRoZS1zdGFycy1zZWNvbmQtd2Vla2VuZC0xMjM1NjYwMjE4L9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvY2hpbmEtYm94LW9mZmljZS1sb3N0LWluLXRoZS1zdGFycy1zZWNvbmQtd2Vla2VuZC0xMjM1NjYwMjE4L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

This weekend, Indiana Jones rocks the signature fedora one more time in a fifth and final Indy adventure, opposite Phoebe Waller-Bridge (""Fleabag"") as a roguish new character in the franchise and Mads Mikkelsen as a villainous Nazi scientist. But if animation is more your jam, Annie Murphy and Jane Fonda star in a coming-of-age comedy about a teenage kraken girl while Riz Ahmed and Chloë Grace Moretz headline a Netflix fantasy.
Here's a guide to new movies that will satisfy every cinematic taste, plus some noteworthy theatrical films making their streaming and on-demand debuts:
If you live for Harrison Ford cracking a whip: 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny'
Indy's swan song isn't one of his greatest adventures, but director James Mangold's action-packed franchise installment does enough right to satisfy longtime fans. Set in 1969, Indy retires from academia and is pulled into another globe-trotting quest with his goddaughter (Waller-Bridge) to find the rest of the mysterious and powerful Archimedes Dial and keep an ex-Nazi scientist (Mikkelsen) from using it to change history. While the plot has pacing issues and the movie is reticent to veer from the proven ""Jones"" formula, it all leads to a bonkers finale and an emotionally satisfying sendoff for Ford's Man in the Hat.

Their duty is to keep the oceans safe from villainous mermaids, and if young adulthood wasn't already stressful enough, the popular new girl at high school (Murphy) turns out to be one of these power-hungry baddies.

If your kids are in need of an excellent adventure: 'Nimona'

To prove his innocence, Ballister teams with mercurial Nimona (Moretz), a shape-shifting teen who might be the same creature the kingdom's knights have been trained to destroy. It's an inclusive and thoughtful piece about friendship and honor with engaging queer characters that's also a heck of a lot of fun.

She's not overly pleased when her 7-year-old daughter (Lily LaTorre) takes in a stray bunny as a pet for her birthday, but the newest member of the household is just the inciting incident for a series of bizarre turns and revelatory truths as the youngster exhibits increasingly dangerous bad behavior.

2023-06-30 20:47:47+00:00,Shia LaBeouf is missing from ‘Indiana Jones: Dial of Destiny’ — here’s why,"""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" has finally swung its way into theaters. Indiana's son, Mutt Williams, played by Shia LaBeouf, appeared in the series' fourth flick, 2008's ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" But the character — and LaBeouf — are nowhere to be found in the franchise's newest installment.","SPOILER ALERT: Major plot points are revealed below — so don’t say we didn’t warn you.
Put on your fedoras and crank out your bullwhip because Indiana Jones is taking you on another wild ride.
But there’s one noteworthy character missing from the fifth installment of the iconic action-adventure franchise.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” has finally swung its way into theaters and a lot has changed since the last time viewers saw Harrison Ford’s archeologist.
The character previously appeared in the series’ fourth flick, 2008’s “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” which also featured Indiana’s son, Mutt Williams, played by Shia LaBeouf, as they set off on another historical quest in 1957.
However, in “Dial,” Mutt is noticeably absent — with his storyline all tied up.

The newest installment takes place in 1969, amid the turmoil of the Vietnam War, and shows Indy — still a professor and now teaching at Hunter College but on the verge of retirement — shockingly living alone in a small apartment in Manhattan.
One day, his estranged goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), approaches him with a new journey that piques his interest, and as they begin their search for the mysterious dial of the film’s title, Indy shares some startling information.
He reveals that, tragically, Mutt decided to enlist in the military and was killed while serving in the war.
In the wake of his death, Indy’s wife, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) — whom he married in the epilogue of “Crystal Skull” — decided to leave him, as the grief was too much for either one of them to bear.
LaBeouf’s omission from the fifth “Indy” movie — and that of his character — may have been an easy decision on the part of the filmmakers.
He reportedly was not even invited to appear in the new movie, after criticizing “Crystal Skull” in 2010.
“I feel like I dropped the ball on the legacy that people loved and cherished,” LaBeouf said of his performance to the Los Angeles Times. “If I was going to do it twice, my career was over. So this was fight-or-flight for me. The actor’s job is to make it come alive and make it work, and I couldn’t do it.”
Ford — who turns 81 on July 13 — had a tart response to LaBeouf’s flaming of the flick.
“I think I told him he was a f – – king idiot,” he said of LaBeouf in a 2011 “Today” show interview. “As an actor, I think it’s my obligation to support the film without making a complete ass of myself.
“Shia is ambitious, attentive and talented — and he’s learning how to deal with a situation which is very unique and difficult,” Ford bluntly added.

As for the “Star Wars” octogenarian’s future in the franchise, Ford’s turn in “Dial of Destiny” marks his final outing as the character.
He “felt a sense of peace, a sense of contentment” about closing the book on Indy, Ford revealed in a recent, emotional interview.
“The feeling I had is the feeling you have when you’ve made something, and you can look at it, or you can remember having made it, the satisfaction of putting work in, and getting something worthy out of it,” Ford said.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2LzMwL3NoaWEtbGFiZW91Zi1pcy1taXNzaW5nLWZyb20taW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnktaGVyZXMtd2h5L9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2LzMwL3NoaWEtbGFiZW91Zi1pcy1taXNzaW5nLWZyb20taW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnktaGVyZXMtd2h5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-30 19:37:52+00:00,‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Review: Temple of Dull,James Mangold's entry into the 'Indiana Jones' franchise lacks so much of what made its predecessors special and enduring.,"Making another Indiana Jones movie is one of those ideas that everyone, on some level, knows is a bad idea but seems to be powerless to stop, like signing a free-agent deal with the Oakland Athletics at the end of your career or returning to the WWE at 50 for one last championship run: It’s just one of those things that you have to do when you have few options left with your time and a surplus of hope. Retirement isn’t an option, nor is recasting (strangely enough, no one seemed to have much of a problem with the Young Indiana Jones series), so the only choice is to stay the course and hope for the best. Keep in mind these facts: It’s been nearly a decade since Disney purchased Lucasfilm and all of its assets, nearly fifteen since how poorly Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was received upon its release (even if it didn’t necessarily deserve to be so thoroughly hated, as it’s really not that bad), its star is nearly 80 years old, and the primary creative forces behind it have the least amount of input they’ve ever had on one of these films. There was no real universe in which James Mangold, Steven Spielberg’s replacement here, could pull it off, and if anything, the fact that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is even hitting theaters is a testament to how hope springs eternal, regardless of its ultimate quality. Its time has passed, yet its appeal remains eternal: We will suffer through hundreds of Jones-inspired adventures in the years to come, estranged from their pulpy roots, with all of their knowledge of this tribute to ’30s serials and adventure novels coming from their second-hand interpretation by Spielberg and George Lucas. They made entertainment so potent and compelling that they singlehandedly knee-capped their metaphorical descendants’ ability to make similar art.
One can kind of understand Spielberg’s reluctance to continue: He’s already stated his desire for the franchise to move past its Nazi-punching roots, given his inability to have fun making cartoonish Germans his baddies following his experiences making Schindler’s List, but the series’ newest setting — 1969 — fits within the period in which he began his career. He was a direct witness to the events name-checked in this film (the Apollo 11 mission, the Vietnam War protests) and there’s not a ton of nostalgiac fun in doing that, given that Spielberg was imagining the adventures of his parents’ (and grandparents’) generations. So it’s understandable that his exhaustion echoes through Henry Jones, Jr. (Ford) as he settles into another day at Hunter College, teaching students who don’t give a shit, only looking forward to a lonely apartment to return to. He’s a museum piece, only forced out of retirement when Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), his goddaughter and the child of one of his wartime buddies, shows up trying to crack a mystery — the origins and purpose of the Antikythera, a mysterious dial invented by the great Archemedies — that her dad spent the remainder his life puzzling over. However, she’s not all that she seems: she’s a treasure hunter looking for a big payday, and is being chased by the CIA, as well as the private security hired by Jurgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), one of the US’s leading rocket scientists and a still-ardent Nazi. So, it’s off around the world to try and keep Voller from getting his hands on the Dial, while the odd couple try to figure out exactly how the device works, and what its true purpose is.
Mangold may have seemed like an odd choice at the time — he’s not exactly a major collaborator or protege of Spielberg’s, at least from his production credits — but there’s one attribute he’s particularly good at, one that’s even more useful for a project like this than his ability to make quality middlebrow films intended for an adult audience (the 3:10 to Yuma remake, Ford v. Ferrari) or the fact that he’s a Fox company man through and through, merger notwithstanding. He’s long specialized in the I’m Getting Too Old For This Shit subgenre of action, with films like Cop Land and Logan providing action stars nearing the end of their once-assumed age-limited commercial viability with a solid parting shot. Of course, all of his work there is frequently undone by the nature of the business — there’s always a Creed or a Deadpool III around the corner — but that doesn’t negate their qualities as individual works. Yet Mangold functions best as a revisionist, his best work being Oater-stylized reinterpretations of established characters and related screen iconography. Cop Land is mobster High Noon in the Jersey suburbs; Logan is Shane with a toy deal. The revisionism comes in their application to these narratives, and what little subtext can creep in on the edges (there’s something almost dope about Indiana Jones going up against Werner Von Braun and the legacy of Operation Paperclip, yet Mangold is limited to the briefest suggestion of American malfeasance, and that even comes with an excuse: our problem was not that we welcomed in ex-Nazi scientists, but that we were fooled by one was a different Nazi than he said he was). But beyond that, his fantasies are dark tributes mourning a lost American past, defined in some part by the collapse of their mythology through the slow creep of time.
Applying that ethos to an Indiana Jones story isn’t necessarily a terrible idea but rather a hideously boring one, retreading paths firmly ground down by Spielberg himself in the parts of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull that people liked, fridge moment notwithstanding (I read somewhere on Reddit recently that that scene — a holdover from those mythically better Frank Darabont drafts — would have played better had he not be catapulted across the desert inside the icebox, and I would genuinely agree). Indy has already had his I’m Getting Too Old For This Shit movie, directed and conceived by the people who brought him to life. There’s a moment in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull that has always stuck with me, in which Jim Broadbent, upon reflecting on the losses that Jones has suffered — his dad, his friend Marcus — and the national malaise and paranoia that has cost both of them their jobs, remarks that they’ve “reached the point where life stops giving us things and has started taking them away,” and the strange potency of the way Spielberg shoots that scene gives it a mournful quality that feels appropriately genuine, given the closeness that the brain trust behind the series shares with their creations. By Dial of Destiny, even Spielberg’s attempts to plug the cracks in the slowly-collapsing foundations — Shia LaBeouf, Jim Broadbent, John Hurt — are all gone from the film’s 1969. Aside from Ford and a few other established figures from the franchise, we’re mainly introduced to new and soon-to-be-forgotten replacements.
The Indiana Jones series has always had a Poochie problem, and I’m referring to the ill-timed, Homer-voiced addition to the Itchy and Scratchy cartoon that was meant to draw the kids of Springfield back to The Krusty the Klown Show on The Simpsons. This is somewhat due to inherent serialization issues, where the central figure at the heart of a given long-running franchise remains its bedrock, but Spielberg made a deliberate pivot to try and get away from that by the time Last Crusade rolled around. It wasn’t necessarily his fault that it took decades for each subsequent installment to make it to the screen. Still, one gets the feeling that potentially permanent and ongoing additions to the canon were all undone simply because they couldn’t make the movies fast enough anymore. As such, they’re dealt with off-screen, with viewers meant to accept their substitutes as bracingly modern-yet-traditional equivalents, fitting with the new eras that the film goes to temporally. Mutt Williams controversially took on the sidekick role in Crystal Skull. Still, LaBeouf’s estrangement from Spielberg (and Hollywood at large) rendered him to an off-screen fate that’s as handled as bizarrely as it is perfunctorily — a mid-film reveal that, with apologies to Noel Coward, lacks all of that “potency” that the “cheap music” had under Spielberg. Waller-Bridge, his replacement, isn’t terrible, and she’s got the tenor of the franchise right, even if she’s a bit too current for the film’s style, but she appears out of nowhere, lacking even the slightest relation to the previous events. It might have been too easy to have her be Marcus Brody’s daughter, but it would have been an appropriate solution to the narrative problem she poses.
Then again, without her retconned appearance — Toby Jones essentially cameos as her father, who was Jones’ wartime buddy in lieu of Brody — we wouldn’t have the film’s WWII-set opening action sequence, which is a testament to both the quality of de-aging technology and a demonstration of its genuine horror. The Imagineered de-aging tech is astonishing in stills, as one would assume it would be. Yet, its application in sequential frames is about as hideous as your average Robert Zemeckis fetish project. The young Indiana Jones, chronicled here on a mission to stop a Nazi plunder train, looks and moves like a Raiders-era Harrison Ford for whole seconds, and the problem is that the sequence goes on for nearly twenty minutes. He has the same problem that De Niro did in The Irishman, without the bona fides behind the camera: His younger self moves like old Harrison Ford, sounds like Old Harrison Ford, and is, aside from the odd blurriness around his face, old Harrison Ford. Mikkelsen fares even worse with the de-aging treatment, which is bizarre given his near-perfect digital enhancements in something like Hideo Kojima’s Death Stranding, with his entire face smoothed over in computer-generated concealer. This reliance on new-fangled tech sticks out like a sore thumb to the practically-realized work done in the previous films, with its application even in Crystal Skull being pretty alright until that jungle-set action sequence. Worse, the movie is shot digitally, which wouldn’t be such an issue if not because every other film in the series looks better in comparison. The light feels wrong, the color correction looks strange, and the film is, like most of its digital ilk, too dark, meant to obscure the CGI’s stitching.
So what is Dial of Destiny if not an ill-fitting coda to a series that has, for some segment of the Raiders audience with each release, had most of its luster polished off? It is, on some level, a tribute to Harrison Ford’s resilience, given that some disaster inevitably plagues his franchise work with the Lucasfilm brain trust (a plane crash here, a broken limb there), and, in all seriousness, his presence as a grade-A capital-letter Movie Star in an era where they’ve become an endangered species. His age is the movie’s defining concern and its most obvious trait — he is, like Mangold’s protagonists, Too Old For This Shit — but his charisma is undimmed. In the film’s best moments, he channels that pathos into something real and genuinely reflective (that Mutt moment almost works with his teary-eyed sincerity) or, through sheer will, defies age-bound expectations with a solid bon mot and a right cross. Roger Moore never quite had it this good. Through Ford’s approach — a kind of combination of the inherent pluck of Moore’s Bond and his relationships in the back half of his career, where 007’s girls essentially became his tenderly drawn friends and companions rather than love interests — one can see where Dial of Destiny might have gone right. But, as Mangold takes great pains to point out, we exist in an era incompatible with Indiana Jones, even as he remains, but not because he’s a relic. It’s because modernity has made his stories’ aesthetic pleasures inert as we progress further into whatever digital future awaits us. In a way, this is his final warning: The qualities that made his adventures so enticing don’t have to be hidden away in secure government facilities or limited to those with the means. They can be continuously enjoyed by all, though one doesn’t necessarily need them to belong in a museum.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdmFueWFsYW5kLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2LzMwL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnktcmV2aWV3LXRlbXBsZS1vZi1kdWxsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-04 14:19:32+00:00,This Indiana Jones stunt mask is giving people nightmares,"A mask used for Harrison Ford's stunt double in Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny has been described as ""horrifying"" by fans online.","A mask used for Harrison Ford’s stunt double in Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny has been described as “horrifying” by fans online.
The IJ Adventure Outpost account on Twitter, which is an unofficial blog on the latest news about the action-adventure movie franchise, shared photos purporting to show the mask worn by stunt performers while filming the latest instalment.
While many agreed that the mask is realistic, others pointed out how “creepy” it is – some even likening it to “the new Michael Myers” due to its skin folds.

“That’s horrifying,” wrote one Twitter user beneath IJ Adventure Outpost’s photos. “Definitely looks like something from Dawn of the Dead…,” said another.
This is my sleep paralysis demon — Mr. Tusk (@_oh__wells_) July 3, 2023
Other users online joked that it’s the kind of image that will haunt their nightmares. “This is my sleep paralysis demon,” one person said.
The reactions follow news last month of Ford recalling how he told stuntmen to “leave me the fuck alone” while shooting the fifth and final instalment, which is out now.
More than four decades after he first appeared in the lead role, Ford celebrated his 81st birthday shortly after the film hit theatres. However, when speaking in a recent interview, the acclaimed actor shared that he was determined not to conceal his age in the project.
One moment that highlighted this best, he said, was a scene in Dial Of Destiny in which Jones is seen riding a horse through the streets of New York City during the 1969 ticker-tape parade that followed the moon landing.

While filming this, as Ford explained to Esquire, he felt the hands of multiple stuntmen helping him get off the horse, which irritated him as he wanted the scene to show him dismounting how he normally would.
“I thought, ‘What the fuck?’ Like I was being attacked by gropers. I look down and there’s three stunt guys there making sure I didn’t fall off the stirrup,” he said.
“They said, ‘Oh, we were just afraid because we thought, you know, and bah bah bah bah.’ And I said, ‘Leave me the fuck alone…Leave me alone, I’m an old man getting off a horse and I want it to look like that!”’
In a four-star review of The Dial Of Destiny, NME said: “The biggest question – could another director succeed Steven Spielberg after four Indy films in a row – is well-answered. James Mangold marshals frantic set pieces with plenty of quite noticeable CGI. This is perhaps sad for those weaned on the superb practical effects of earlier Indy outings.
“Still, it’s a lively, enthralling tale with some particularly emotive scenes in the final act that are bound to cause a tear or two. Some will ask why make this film at all? The answer should be, why not?”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5tZS5jb20vbmV3cy9maWxtL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtc3R1bnQtbWFzay1yZWFjdGlvbnMtaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC0zNDY0NjQz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-26 10:30:03-07:00,Is Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull really that bad?,"15 years ago, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull forgot what made its beloved franchise so great in the first place. Does it still hold up?","From the moment it begins, something about Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull just feels off. The film was released nearly 20 years after Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which brought Steven Spielberg and George Lucas’ original Indiana Jones trilogy to an extremely traditional, but nonetheless celebratory, end. Despite that fact, Spielberg, Lucas, and franchise star Harrison Ford decided to bring the franchise back in 2007.
It was a poor decision, and not because Spielberg or Lucas had become worse filmmakers in the 20 years since Last Crusade. Not even Ford’s older age was much of a hindrance in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. On the contrary, the actor is quite good in the film, and he repeatedly proves throughout it that not many other performers have ever been able to strike a pose as well as him.
Recommended Videos
However, in the 18 years between Crystal Skull and Last Crusade, the franchise’s key creative team seemed to forget what made it so good in the first place. As a result, when Indiana Jones finally stepped on-screen again, the old-school filmmaking spirit that had once made his original adventures so exciting had vanished, replaced by contemporary shortcuts that left Kingdom of the Crystal Skull feeling like the zero-calorie version of a meal audiences had once savored.
The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull’s main sin
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull opens with a shot of a CGI prairie dog popping up out of a mound of dirt. To say that this one image foreshadows many of the problems that are still to come in the film would be an understatement. Not only does the shot itself look surprisingly fake, but it also signals to viewers that the Indiana Jones franchise’s once-famous reliance on practical effects is a thing of the past. The rest of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, unfortunately, follows through on that promise.
From a truly unnecessary and much-derided sequence involving CGI monkeys swinging through a jungle to a third-act climax that slowly but surely devolves into a swirling storm of bad digital effects, the Indiana Jones franchise’s fourth installment is full of moments that look laughably bad. While that’d be a disappointing thing to say about any film, it’s a particularly frustrating criticism to be able to make of an Indiana Jones movie.
The franchise has, after all, never been all that thematically compelling. Instead, the series’ first three installments — 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark most of all — stand out mostly for just how exuberantly they were made. The three blockbusters feel like pure-hearted exercises in big-budget action filmmaking on the part of Spielberg, a director who has always been more at home in the action-adventure genre than most.
If ain’t broke, don’t CGI it
Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, and The Last Crusade are bound together not only by their similar tones and recurring stars, but also by their practical effects, locations, and set pieces. From the face-melting scene at the end of Raiders to the nightclub sequence in Temple of Doom, the first three Indiana Jones movies feel simultaneously fake and real, and that’s part of their charm. Viewers may, for instance, know that they’re not seeing a real boulder roll toward Harrison Ford during the iconic opening scene of Raiders, but they also know that something is rolling toward him.
There’s a tactile quality to the filmmaking on display in the franchise’s first three installments. They look and feel like the products of a filmmaker who was given the chance to utilize every moviemaking trick at his disposal. The result is a trio of action movies that are hokey and cheesy, but also effective on a truly visceral level. Therefore, when Spielberg and Lucas chose to abandon that tactile quality by using CGI to bring large portions of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull’s sci-fi story to life, what they were left with was a film that was just hokey and cheesy.
Will Dial of Destiny repeat the franchise’s past mistakes?
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny | Official Trailer
Now, 15 years after Kingdom of the Crystal Skull first tarnished its reputation, the Indiana Jones franchise is coming back to the big screen. The series’ latest entry, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, is the first not to be directed by Spielberg, who relinquished the director’s chair this time around to Ford v Ferrari filmmaker James Mangold. While viewers will have to wait until the film’s June 30 release to find out how well Mangold dealt with the pressure of stepping into Spielberg’s shoes, too, the first trailers for Dial of Destiny don’t suggest that the film learned from its predecessor’s greatest mistake.
Instead, Dial of Destiny looks to be even more CGI-reliant than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Consequently, although the new film’s overall quality has yet to be determined, it’s undeniably disappointing to see a series that was once defined by its practical filmmaking tricks ultimately adopt the same shortcuts as many of Hollywood’s other, less well-regarded franchises.
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is available to stream now on Paramount+ and Disney+.

2023-07-04 13:43:45+10:00,Indiana Jones and the Hollywood experiment with AI de-ageing technology,"Actors used to just play characters of their own age when reprising earlier roles – but that is now changing, for better or worse.","By Ben McCann, University of Adelaide
Saddle up, don the fedora and crack that whip: Harrison Ford is back as the intrepid archaeologist in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. The film premiered at Cannes, where Ford was awarded an Honorary Palme d’Or in recognition of his life’s work.
Reviews for the fifth film in the franchise have been mixed, and it is the first Indy film not to be directed by Steven Spielberg (this time, it’s James Mangold, best known for his motor-racing drama Ford v Ferrari).
But this is ‘event’ cinema that combines nostalgia, old-school special effects and John Williams’ iconic score.
So, Ford is back, aged 80. What draws actors back after all this time?
Role returns
Ford first played Indy in 1981 and last played him in 2008. That is a full 15 years since the most recent film in the series, and 42 years since his first outing in Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Read: Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny review: a whip-smart success
Ford has form in returning to celebrated characters. One of the great pleasures of watching The Force Awakens back in 2015 was seeing Ford play Han Solo again for the first time in over 30 years.
Actors return to roles for numerous reasons:
financial (Ford was reportedly paid US$25 million for Dial of Destiny)
protection of their brand, image and star persona (Michael Keaton returning to play Batman after three decades and three other actors who have embodied the role)
professional (Tom Cruise admitted over the 36 years between Top Gun films he wanted to make sure the sequel could live up to the original)
personal (once-huge stars are working less and less, and only feel the need to return to a built-in fan base every few years – Bill Murray in the 2021 Ghostbusters sequel springs to mind).
It’s not always a successful endeavour.
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone – two of the biggest action stars of the 1980s off the back of iconic roles as The Terminator, Rocky Balboa and John Rambo – have repeatedly returned to those roles, and critics have been particularly harsh.
It did not work for Sigourney Weaver in Alien: Resurrection in 1997, 18 years after her first time as Ripley; nor for Keanu Reeves in The Matrix Resurrections in 2021, 23 years after the original.

And still, I’m intrigued to see what Michael Mann could do with his long-rumoured sequel to Heat, his definitive 1995 crime film. Ever since Mann published his novel Heat 2 last year – a kind of origin story for Heat’s key protagonists – fans have been hoping a de-aged Al Pacino (now aged 83) might return as LA cop Vincent Hanna.
Undoing time
‘Digital de-ageing’ first entered the Hollywood mainstream in 2019 with The Irishman and Captain Marvel.
Via this process, older actors (Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Samuel L. Jackson have all been subject to the technology) move back and forwards in time without younger actors having to play them.
Films still tend to cast two actors to play older and younger versions of the same character, a choice that dates back at least to 1974’s The Godfather Part II, in which a young Robert de Niro plays Vito Corleone, portrayed by the much older Marlon Brando in the first film.
In 1989, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade features a delightful opening scene where River Phoenix plays the young version of Indiana Jones, before Ford takes over for the rest of the film.
Actors used to just play characters of their own age when reprising earlier roles. Paul Newman finally won a Best Actor Oscar for his role as ‘Fast Eddie’ Felson in The Color of Money (1986), a quarter of a century after first playing him in The Hustler.
The sequel plays on Newman’s age, and his role as a mentor to an upcoming Tom Cruise, and bathes viewers in nostalgia and memories of a younger Newman.
But actors no longer have to exclusively play their age.
The first part of Dial of Destiny is an extended flashback, set in 1944, in which Ford has been digitally de-aged to appear in his 40s. This process used an AI system that scanned used and unused reels of footage of Ford from the first three Indy films to match his present-day performance.

Here, it is as if we are getting two Fords for the price of one: the ‘younger’, fitter Indy and the older, more world-weary version. It makes for a powerfully emotional connection on screen.

Yet there are some pitfalls to de-ageing. Some viewers complain that the whole process is distracting and that the hyper-real visual look of de-aged scenes resembles a video game.

Even so, de-ageing in Hollywood cinema is here to stay. Tom Hanks’s next film is using AI-based generative technology to digitally de-age him.

Given its reduced cost, speed and reduced human input, AI-driven innovation might have industry-changing ramifications.

The star of Ford

Harrison Ford remains a bona fide ‘movie star’ in an industry profoundly buffeted by Covid, the rise of streaming platforms, the demise of the monoculture, and the changing nature of who constitutes a star.

In the midst of all this industry uncertainty, it seems there is no longer a statute of limitations on actors returning to much-loved characters.

The next big ethical issue for the film industry as it further embraces AI is whether to resurrect deceased actors and cast them in new movies.

Still, I’m looking forward to seeing more actors de-aged as the technology improves and audiences acclimatise to watching older actors ‘playing’ younger versions of themselves. We are only at the start of Hollywood’s next big adventure.

Leicester Square is considered the UK's home of film.

Since 2020, Heart of London Business Alliance and Westminster City Council have overseen the Scenes in the Square statue trail in the famous Square, which has fast become one of London’s most popular free tourist attractions.

The trail features some of the world’s most beloved film characters and iconic scenes, brought to life in bronze statue form.

Now, Paddington Bear, Mary Poppins, Charlie Chaplin, Harry Potter, Batman and Bugs Bunny are welcoming a new addition: Indiana Jones.

The bronze effigy of the famed archaeological explorer was unveiled at the UK premiere of the latest film in the franchise, Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny.

The statue, which was welcomed by the legendary Harrison Ford, brings to life the moment the intrepid professor of archaeology and adventurer extraordinaire Dr. Henry Walton “Indiana” Jones Jr. first donned his trademark fedora in Raiders of the Lost Ark.

In true Indy style, the statue was teased before the premiere with a mysterious crate labelled ‘PROPERTY OF DR. H JONES,’ mirroring the wooden case containing the Ark of the Covenant from his first cinematic adventure in 1981.

The Indy statue - unveiling TBD Heart of London Business Alliance

Mark Williams, Director of Destination for Heart of London Business Alliance, stated that they are “beyond thrilled to welcome Indiana Jones to the Scenes in the Square trail, honouring the character’s major part in cinema history since 1981 and cementing Harrison Ford’s status as a movie icon.”

“The dynamic statue trail is a true celebration of entertainment and there are few more worthy inclusions than the legendary Indiana Jones. Taking pride of place on Leicester Square’s bustling north terrace, Indy promises to be a hugely popular addition to the Square, further cementing his legacy in movie history.”

A legacy which has fans hoping that the final chapter in the Indiana Jones saga will live up to its (mostly) stellar reputation. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny premiered at the Cannes Film Festival last month, and it’s our sad duty to inform you that while we were thrilled to be at the premiere, Indy aficionados should brace for disappointment. Harrsion Ford, 80, rises to the challenge and just about manages to keep things afloat. However, the film’s script – signed Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, James Mangold and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull scribe David Koepp (red flag), utterly sinks the final act, and with it destroys the hope that Dr. Jones’ swansong would be a fitting one. You can read our full (non-spoiler) review here.

Safe to say that the rankings now go thusly:

Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) - just because the first half hour is excellent – otherwise, it’s pretty interchangeable ranking-wise with the final spot.

Indiana Jones’ latest film hit the big screens on June 30, 2023, and less than a month later, small American outdoor company Frost River filed a lawsuit against both Lucasfilm and its competitor brand Filson — over Indy’s backpack.

The pack, which Frost River recognized immediately as one of its own, was featured in the new film “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” without permission, the brand’s lawyers claim. The filmmakers allegedly removed identifying marks on the bag for the film, violating federal trademark law, and produced an advertisement that disingenuously passed the pack off as one of Filson’s.

“This lawsuit concerns two corporate juggernauts, Filson and Lucasfilm, exploiting the hard work and intellectual property of Frost River, a small American company,” stated the complaint.

The Frost River Geologist Pack on an Archeologist’s Back

Throughout the film, Indy carries a waxed canvas knapsack, with leather straps and brass buckles. That bag is the Frost River Geologist Pack. It was designed after the rucksack used by renowned geologist James Byron Hustad. Hustad explored Minnesota’s Iron Range by float plane and canoe, in search of deposits for U.S. Steel. It’s a classic-looking bag, with a distinctly vintage adventurer feel.

So, Frost River claims, when it recognized the Geologist Pack in the new Indy movie, allegedly with all of its brand-identifying markings removed, alarm bells went off. Removing identifying marks from a product that is then prominently featured in a film violates the Lanham Act, a federal trademark law.

In its filing, Frost River claims Lucasfilm also authorized Filson to run a co-branded marketing campaign. The minute-long ad promoted both the film and Filson’s products — as well as Frost River’s unmarked Geologist Pack.

“Lucasfilm and Filson produced a 60-second commercial prominently featuring video clips from the Indiana Jones 5 film intertwined with video clips of actors using Filson’s own products,” Devin McRae, a lawyer for Minnesota brand, wrote in the complaint. “Shockingly, one of the intertwined video clips was one from Indiana Jones 5 featuring Frost River’s Geologist Pack.”

According to the brand and its lawyers, that is intentionally misleading consumers to believe that that pack is made by Filson.

Neither Lucasfilm nor Filson have offered comment on this lawsuit.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZ2Vhcmp1bmtpZS5jb20vbmV3cy9mcm9zdC1yaXZlci1zdWVzLWx1Y2FzZmlsbS1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWJhY2twYWNr0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Celebrating the success of Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind while holidaying together, George Lucas pitched Steven Spielberg an idea about an archeologist adventurer.

This would be their James Bond, and hark back to the movie serials of their youth, with a cliffhanger every few minutes. And so one of the great movie franchises was born.

,Where to Stream All the ‘Indiana Jones’ Movies Right Now,"Fortune and glory, kid","There’s never a bad time to put on an “Indiana Jones” movie, but the release of “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” makes it a particularly good time to binge every installment of the American action-adventure franchise that has come before. And we’ve got all the franchise streaming details.

It all began over 40 years ago, in 1981, when “Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark” first hit theaters. Directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Lawrence Kasdan, the 1930s-set action-adventure starred a hunky, mumbling Harrison Ford as an archaeology professor named Indiana Jones who spends his weekends traveling the world in search of historical artifacts. When Indy is approached to find the fabled Ark of the Covenant before Nazi German forces can, he teams up with former flame Marion (Karen Allen) to keep the powerful treasure out of enemy hands.

The face-melting, sweepingly romantic film was a huge hit with audiences, and led to two more franchise installments in the 1980s: “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” (1984), co-starring a young Ke Huy Quan (“Everything Everywhere All At Once”), and “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade” (1989), co-starring Sean Connery as Indy’s dad, Henry Jones Sr. Spielberg returned to the world in 2008 with “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.” The movie did well at the box office, but both critical and audience reviews were less than enthusiastic. Still, a love of the franchise endures, and Indy will be back on our screens later this month with “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.”

The Nazis are back in “The Dial of Destiny,” which will be the only film in the franchise so far not to be directed by Spielberg. (“Logan” director James Mangold is stepping behind the camera for the film.) In 1969, Indy is drawn back into the world of archaeological adventuring by Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), the goddaughter of Indy’s former colleague Basil Shaw (Toby Jones). Twenty years prior, Indy and Basil kept a mysterious dial known as the Antikythera from falling into Nazi hands. Now, it is in danger of being used for evil again—but not if Indy and Helena get there first.

If you’re looking to watch or rewatch the “Indiana Jones” franchise before catching “The Dial of Destiny” in theaters, you’re in luck. They are available to stream, and you have two different options.

Below, we’ve rounded up which “Indiana Jones” movies are streaming where with the most up-to-date information.

,Harrison Ford Grows Emotional as Indiana Jones Fan Thanks Him for the Franchise: 'Means the World to Me',"As Harrison Ford and his 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' costar Phoebe Waller-Bridge spoke with BBC Radio 1's Ali Plumb recently, the actor appeared to grow emotional as the journalist thanked him for his work on the beloved adventure franchise over the years","Harrison Ford is looking back on Indiana Jones' legacy ahead of his final film in the franchise.

While speaking with BBC Radio 1 during an interview published on Monday, Ford, 80, appeared to momentarily choke up as journalist Ali Plumb thanked the veteran actor for his contributions as the star of the long-running film series.

""Can I just say, on behalf of all the fans, thank you. It's been such an adventure, we love you so much. I don't want to make you blush or anything, but you mean the world to us,"" Plumb told Ford at the conclusion of his interview alongside costar Phoebe Waller-Bridge. ""Thank you, that's all I have to say.



“And I must say to you, thank you, sincerely,"" Ford responded. ""It means the world to me.”



Prior to the exchange, Plumb had asked Ford to speak to why he believes the franchise — which originated with 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark — has remained so successful and loved by fans over the years.

“Because of the talents of the screenwriters and directors and actors that have poured their hearts and souls into it,"" Ford told the outlet. ""And the experience that I had making these five films... the films are peopled with some of the most amazing actors and characters and the stories are so compelling and they mix adventure and humor and heart.”

The actor added that he admires ""the depth and the subtlety of the emotion, and the importance of emotion in these films.""

""As this one concerns age and frailty and changing nature of life, it was especially compelling to me because I am of that age and I wanted it to fell real for the audience,"" Ford said of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which will mark his final turn as the iconic bullwhip-wielding archaeologist. ""I wanted them to see the complexity of that experience with someone they spent 40 years with.”

While speaking with PEOPLE recently, the actor noted that he most often quotes 1997's Air Force One in his own day-to-day life rather than any of his iconic lines from Star Wars or the five Indiana Jones films.

""Because I fly, I probably say why more than I need to, 'Get off my plane!' "" Ford said, reciting his most famous line from the film.



Ford was honored with a Palme d’Or for lifetime achievement at the new Indiana Jones movie's world premiere at Cannes Film Festival last month, where he paused to take in the film industry and fans' affection for his work.



“I was just trying to keep myself composed,” he told PEOPLE recently. “There was very generous applause from the crowd [and] it was positive and humbling and nice.""

,COLUMN: Indiana Jones and an ongoing focus on Nazis,Other wars and brutal totalitarian regimes have arisen since end of Second World War,"Other wars and brutal totalitarian regimes have arisen since end of Second World War

Harrison Ford’s last Indiana Jones movie concluded with many of the same elements as the first film in the series more than four decades earlier.

As with the 1981 film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, the 2023 film, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny included plenty of fast-paced action chase scenes in exotic locations and dangerous creatures in the search to find an archaeological treasure.

And in both films, the villains are Nazis.

Why Nazis?

From 1933 to 1945, Germany was a totalitarian regime under Nazi rule. Raiders of the Lost Ark, set in 1936, takes place during this period. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny opens in 1944, but most of the story is set in 1969, long after this regime had ended. Still, a Nazi is one of the main characters in this story.

READ ALSO: COLUMN: It’s time to stop making comparisons to Hitler

Nazi Germany and the Second World War from 1939 to 1945 are part of history, not contemporary news.

In 1969, when the final Indiana Jones movie takes place, there were plenty of totalitarian nations.

Dictators at that time included Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay, Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, Kim Il Sung in North Korea and others. And in the decade following, totalitarian rulers included Augusto Pinochet in Chile, Idi Amin in Uganda, Pol Pot in Cambodia and many others.

Totalitarian governments also exist today, but they do not necessarily resemble those in place in the 1960s and 1970s, let alone the 1930s and 1940s.

The world has changed and whatever the future brings will not be a duplicate of the Second World War. Technological changes alone have altered the way wars are fought today. Terrorist organizations today have also affected the shape of warfare and global tensions.

Brutality was not limited to the Second World War or the era of Nazi Germany.

Still, this period of history continues to provide plenty of fodder for novels and films. It also plays a part in our popular culture today. There are a lot of references to this war, often to the exclusion of other important parts of the 20th century.

The Second World War was the most destructive war in recorded history.

The death toll is estimated at between 70 million and 85 million. But it is not the only time people have gone to war.

An estimated 17 million people were killed in Nazi death camps.

They included around six million Jews as well as millions of Roma, people with disabilities, communists, socialists, Jehovah’s Witnesses and homosexuals.

But since the end of that war, genocides and extermination efforts have been part of other wars and totalitarian regimes.

While it is important to remember this period of history and the atrocities of this war, more recent wars, conflicts, genocides and other brutalities must not be ignored. Wars and military actions have played out time and again since the Second World War ended in 1945.

The ongoing war in Ukraine is unfolding around us. This alone has far-reaching effects and is altering our world. Oppressive regimes in Afghanistan and elsewhere, the ongoing conflict in Syria and other incidents are affecting the lives of millions of people.

These things are happening right now.

Putting the focus on a global war from eight decades ago takes attention away from present-day atrocities.

7/7/2023 1:00,Rivertown Reviews,"‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,’ ‘‘Ruby Gillman: Teenage Kraken’ are entertaining reasons to go to the movies.","‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’

In Theaters

Amber-Rose Reed

Amber-Rose Reed

I’m pretty sure if you want to know why I turned out the way I did, you can look no further than Indiana Jones.

All three of the movies — scored for a cheap price with purchase in VHS form of a burger at McDonald’s — were on regular rotation in our VCR. I pretended my closet had a secret passage full of bugs that led to an underground lair, and I was pretty sure that the thing that would make me happiest in life would be to run around inside some ancient ruins.

(That last one was 100% true. I have literally never been happier than in the ruins of the Villa Jovis on Capri.)

Even though they’re full of objectively nonsensical history (and many problematic ideas), Indiana Jones inspired in me not just a great love of the ancient past, but also a deep-seated belief that past and present are not as separate as we think. Because while Dr. Jones is a trained archaeologist, fluent in ancient languages, the thing he’s really most known for is saving the world — and his loved ones — from contemporary malevolent forces, usually Nazis. (He hates those guys.)

In “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” the fifth and final film in the series, Indy returns to fighting Nazis, both in the past (during a segment set in 1944, done with some very good de-aging that is somewhat undone by Harrison Ford’s un-de-aged voice) and in the movie’s present, the summer of 1969.

He and his estranged goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) are pitted against both each other and Nazi scientist Jurgen Voller (Mads Mikklesen) in the quest to get both halves of the titular dial, also known as the Antikythera Mechanism, a real-life ancient analog computer.

First of all, this review is going to be sort of vague.

Parts of this movie are impossible to talk about without huge spoilers, and who wants to go into it knowing the (divisive) third act twist? But I will say this: Dial of Destiny is fun. It’s very fast-paced, going from action set piece to action set piece as quickly as the characters travel from city to city on the on-screen map. They do try to keep said action scenes fresh. There’s an extended car chase through the streets of Marrakesh, a creepy underwater deep-dive, and the aforementioned sequence set in 1944 – much of which takes place on a train.

“Dial” has its heartfelt moments as well, as Indy grapples with both the grief of losing his son to the malaise of feeling out of place in his own life. Both of these are intimately linked with the overall themes of the movie, which deal with obsession with the past instead of grappling with it and coming out the other side into the present.

Reboots or sequels or “rebootquels” are all inevitably driven by some form of nostalgia (and inevitably driven by a desire to make more money). “Dial of Destiny” treads the line of giving into that nostalgia and also cautioning against it.

I think it treads it well.

It genuinely has something to say about nostalgia and the allure of the past, which I think fits into the overall ethos of Indiana Jones, a man willing to let fortune and glory of the past slip through his fingers if it means saving lives.

But the movie doesn’t seem to know the answers to some of the questions it asks. Sometimes, this can be shrugged off as plot holes or lampshading, but sometimes, those questions are so core to the themes of the movie and the arc of the character that it left me feeling unfulfilled.

Overall, I enjoyed “Dial of Destiny.”

It doesn’t live up to the original outings, but it certainly is miles better than 2005’s “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.”

A couple of the standouts to me: Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Helena, smart and bright and cynical, and Mads Mikklesen’s Voller, a man who is as calm and “logical” about his Nazi fanaticism as he is about physics and math. He’s an interesting villain without ever being sympathetic, the former accomplished by Mikklesen’s micro-expressions and somewhat alien stare.

The latter is something I deeply appreciate Indiana Jones for.

While I owe some of my love of history to Indy and his adventures, I think the greatest lesson “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” can teach us is evergreen.

Don’t ever forget what evil is.

It might be packaged in a pressed SS uniform or in a slightly rumpled suit, but what’s inside is the same.

‘Ruby Gillman: Teenage Kraken’

In Theaters

Alexa Chipman

Alexa Chipman

“Release the kraken” takes on a whole new meaning with this lighthearted family adventure.

Ruby (voiced by Lana Condor) has only one thing on her mind — the upcoming school prom, specifically, attending it with the dreamy Connor (Jabouki Young-White). Alas, the gala event will take place on a boat, and her mother has obsessive rules about staying away from the ocean.

What begins as an amusing drama of teenage angst quickly turns magical when all is revealed. Ruby transforms into a massive glowing kraken when entering the sea, destined to protect the world from its greatest evil.

What could possibly be that dangerous?

Mermaids.

In defiance of her mother, Ruby begins training with her formidable Grandmamah (Jane Fonda) in the art of swimming, laser eye attacks and armor mode. Despite her excitement at being plunged into a new realm, she can’t help but wonder if perhaps they could settle things peacefully with the mermaids, instead of perpetuating the war.

Filled with adorable creatures and lovable characters, this sparkling seaside romp is a perfect summer film. Children will enjoy the colorful animation, teenagers can relate to Ruby’s high school shenanigans, and adults will appreciate a relaxing story that ends with a neat, cheerful bow of happiness.

“Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken” may have an odd and lengthy title, but it delivers on its promise, proving to be a satisfying, delightful story. Don’t think too hard about the plot, just sit back and enjoy the ride.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBldGFsdW1hMzYwLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvcml2ZXJ0b3duLXJldmlld3MtMjUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-06-24 09:00:09.646000+00:00,John Williams on ‘Indiana Jones’ and His Favorite Scores,"In a long career making music for the movies, the composer has made an indelible contribution to cinema. Williams shares his thoughts on some landmark works.","When the New York Philharmonic honored the work of the film composer John Williams this past spring, the director Steven Spielberg introduced a clip of the opening scenes of “Raiders of the Lost Ark” — without the music. The effect, he noted apologetically, was like something out of the French new wave.

The clip was played again, this time with the orchestra joining in. Like magic, the adventuresome spirit of the movie was restored.

On June 30, the rugged archaeologist at the heart of that film (played by Harrison Ford) will return for the fifth entry in the franchise, “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.” He’ll be accompanied, as ever, by Williams’s indispensable music.

The composer, who turned 91 this year, had said it would be his final film score. Speaking during a video call more recently, he walked back his retirement plans. “If they do an ‘Indiana Jones 6,’ I’m on board.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvMjQvbW92aWVzL2pvaG4td2lsbGlhbXMtaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnkuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-14 12:07:36-04:00,Why isn’t Indiana Jones going to daily Mass?,This man has seen the Ark of the Covenant melt faces and the Holy Grail grant eternal life. Wouldn’t that convert even the most ardent atheist?,"Indiana Jones has been going on fantastical adventures for more than 30 years—punching Nazis, witnessing miracles and saving lost artifacts. Indy is famous for his strict moral code of being anti-fascist (and pro-museums), but overall, he remains largely agnostic.

But this man has seen the Ark of the Covenant melt faces and the Holy Grail grant eternal life. Wouldn’t that convert even the most ardent atheist? He has witnessed God’s might firsthand.

This man has seen the Ark of the Covenant melt faces and the Holy Grail grant eternal life.

In the new film installment, “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” Indy remarks, “I don’t believe in magic. But a few times in my life, I’ve seen things. Things I can’t explain. And I’ve come to believe it’s not so much about what you believe. It’s how hard you believe it.” This quote is evocative, yet ultimately nonsensical. Does he think that believing something hard enough makes it true? That we all create our own realities, and that belief itself creates the supernatural?

There is some evidence in the films to back up this pluralistic worldview. Indy’s experiences aren’t strictly Christian, or even religious. In “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,” he has to retrieve a sacred lingam stone that cultists have stolen to use in a human sacrifice. This stone burns his enemies when he invokes the god Shiva. This could suggest a spiritual world where Christian and Hindu gods co-exist, but a hot stone does not evoke the same level of awe and power as the Ark of the Covenant or the Holy Grail. Another possibility is a henotheistic world, in which only one God is to be worshiped, though many gods exist. Christianity itself warns of false gods that may have demonic power. In this way, Indiana’s quote would be true: When something is believed and worshiped it gains power. The spiritual world requires an invitation to affect the natural world.

Indy and his adventures do not dive into the theological implications of these events. Each film paints him as a person who seemingly walks away from emotionally harrowing, supernatural experiences unaffected. This is a professor who is clearly a brilliant academic and is passionate about education and historical preservation, yet he seems wholly uninterested in what these observations mean about his natural world. The most recent films, “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull”and “Dial of Destiny,” lean on scientific explanations, turning their noses up at the mysticism of their more spiritual predecessors. Perhaps we have lost the mysterious whimsy required for Steven Spielberg’s magical realist adventure filmmaking of the 1980s.

The Indiana Jones films have enjoyed such longevity because they remind us of the possibility that there is more out there.

Most likely Indiana is not disinterested, but rather unwilling to accept what it means to be a religious or spiritual person. Perhaps Indy even questions the goodness of the angry, vengeful God he has witnessed. He may acknowledge that a higher power exists, but he is reluctant to give up his own autonomy and pledge any obedience to it. Indy is a man stuck in his ways, prone to self-destructive decision-making. He impulsively drinks and risks his life without care. He takes his relationships for granted, often pushing away the people he loves the most. He feels comfortable in the intellectual world, but emotional maturity, humility and flexibility are not exactly his strong suits.

There is, of course, the issue staring us in the face when tackling this question. These are pulp adventure movies modeled after serials from the 1920s, so obviously the filmmakers have no interest in taking their hero on a personal spiritual journey. Fairly stated, hypothetical commenter! However, Indy’s response to his experiences doesn’t exactly feel out of place in our non-cinematic world. Ignoring deeper questions when presented with challenges represents the human experience all too well. Maybe Spielberg and George Lucas didn’t envision this character searching for meaning in his encounters with God, but maybe Indiana Jones wouldn’t want to anyway.

Seeing is not believing. Belief requires acceptance, open-mindedness and a willingness to change. Each film requires Indiana Jones to open up a little more both in his relationships and expand his worldview, but he is never able to truly learn to live in faith and love. Perhaps he stumbles along his faith journey just like the rest of us. Faith is a choice that must be picked up and made every day. It is much easier to fall into comfortable old patterns than to push yourself to live for something greater than the simple and convenient.

The Indiana Jones films have enjoyed such longevity because they remind us of the possibility that there is more out there, while being a ton of fun along the way. They ignite a fire in our bellies to question our assumptions and keep searching into the mysterious unknown.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FtYWdhemluZS5vcmcvYXJ0cy1jdWx0dXJlLzIwMjMvMDcvMTQvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1kaWFsLWRlc3RpbnktMjQ1Njcx0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-06-21 01:00:00+00:00,Phoebe Waller-Bridge on why Hollywood should never recast Indiana Jones,"Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the star of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, talks about the heartbreak of saying goodbye to the legendary character.","“Then I sat down with it and honestly, within three pages, I just felt like I was in the world, I couldn’t wait to see what happened next. And I just forgot everything else.” Waller-Bridge had worked with the film’s executive producer, Lucasfilm boss Kathleen Kennedy, on the Star Wars film, Solo, in which she had voiced the droid, L3-37. The pair then met for dinner — Waller-Bridge’s last night out before the COVID-19 lockdown, “so that was quite an event,” Waller-Bridge says — and Kennedy offered her the role. “I didn’t know what the dinner was going to be about, I was happy to see her.” Waller-Bridge says. “I knew that Jim [the film’s director, James Mangold] had seen Fleabag. And the thing that really blows my mind is that these bigwigs are sitting around watching BBC3 comedies.” As a girl, growing up in Hammersmith in west London, Waller-Bridge had seen the Indiana Jones films and loved them. “I was so young, I wasn’t probably thinking about him in a particularly gendered way, he was just a hero and a legend and someone that went on these incredible adventures,” she says. “I’ve always really identified with adventure/action hero-led stories.

“I was just looking at the stuff he was doing and the places he was going to and just idealising being in that situation,” Waller-Bridge says, adding that she was also impressed as a kid by Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), Indiana’s love-interest. “She was such an equal match for him, it’s that first punch that she throws at the beginning, and you know she’s not your regular heroine.” At the time, though Indiana Jones was a dominating presence, Waller-Bridge’s attention was also drawn to what was in many ways the first wave of female movie action heroines, such as Sigourney Weaver’s Ellen Ripley in the Alien movies, and Linda Hamilton’s Sarah Connor in The Terminator movies. “Sigourney in Alien was a kind of awakening in some ways because she wasn’t a ‘female lead’ in the way that she had all the attributes and qualities and complexities of the male action heroes that I’d seen before. I came to Terminator a little bit later, but I had the same experience,” Waller-Bridge says. “I was a tomboy as well, and that may have been part of it. It seems like such an archaic word now, but I was a really committed tomboy, so I immediately put myself in the position of those male characters because it looked to me like they were having just more fun. I get excited when there’s a blend of masculine and femininity in any character. And there’s certainly that element in Sigourney’s performance. It’s so fundamentally female, and yet she’s so gloriously in touch with her feminine and her masculine.” The same can be said of Indiana Jones. “He’s frightened of things, like snakes, which you wouldn’t necessarily say is a feminine quality, but you would associate that kind of behaviour with screaming damsels. I think that’s why he was so successful and appealed to people all over the place.”

Meeting the 80-year-old screen legend who also played Star Wars′ iconic stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking, Nerf-herding space-smuggler Han Solo, was, for Waller-Bridge, a genuine pinch-me moment. A role can be a “a kaleidoscope of joy or torment really, depending on who you’re partnered with,” Waller-Bridge says. “I had a voicemail from Harrison a couple of weeks before rehearsals. I listened to his voice, I was like, oh my God, so I got my weird moment out of the way. Waller-Bridge in the Emmy-winning series, Fleabag. Credit: Amazon Prime Video “And then I spoke to him, and we talked about the process, or at least, we talked about how he didn’t want to talk about the process, which I was very happy to do. “He said, ‘I’m so happy it’s you and I’m so happy with this script.’ I was quite nervous but when I met him [in person], he was so warm and lovely and he made me feel like we were great mates from day one and that we were equals.”

The role of Helena Shaw seems writ large from the tapestry of Indiana Jones stories, where quick-witted women match the film’s hero step for step. Mangold did not give Waller-Bridge complex notes, though he did say that he saw in Helena an echo of Barbara Stanwyck’s conwoman, Jean Harrington, in the Preston Sturges film, The Lady Eve. “I love Barbara Stanwyck, I love that movie, and I love her performance in it,” Waller-Bridge says. “So when he said that, and I’d been thinking so much about that era and the style of acting and how she was so natural anyway, and the 1940s, I was doing a deep dive into those movies anyway. “What I got from [the note] is that he wanted her to be light on her feet and witty, and her to feel like she was a step ahead of the audience. “She has an ease, and there is a sexuality about her, but she’s not pushing her sensuality.” The Dial of Destiny is the final Indiana Jones film, at least for Ford, but Waller-Bridge says she can’t imagine the role with another actor.

The film itself hews closely to the Indiana Jones canon, a period action-adventure set in the pre-modern world, where Zeppelin airships and mystical relics like the Holy Grail, the Cross of Coronado and the Ark of the Covenant are woven into Biggles-grade, white-knuckle moments. They’re caper movies which send the heroes in pursuit of an arcane MacGuffin. The Dial of Destiny, however, is a little different. Some of its story elements, the way it plays with time, the fact that it features a younger version of Indiana Jones and the way it leans into the inescapable qualities of fate, seem to serve as metaphors for the larger piece itself. The fact that it is the final movie seems to weigh heavily around the story. In some respects, Waller-Bridge says, that overwhelming sentiment comes from the audience more that Ford himself. “We were all with him, being like, how do you feel, this is the end and are you going to miss him? And he’s always like, f... off, no, he’s a character, he’s not real. We were projecting a lot of that onto him.” Loading There was an “openness” in Ford’s performance though, that he hadn’t afforded Indy before, she says.

“And I felt he was so determined to make this movie and to make it about growing old and about looking back at your life as much as at history, and actually really explore the impact that has on the character rather than it just be the adventure, that once we saw those moments happen, when Harrison through Indy opened that heart or that window, that’s when we all felt it powerfully. “It’s easy to forget when we’re all just floundering, jumping off a ship or out of a plane or doing some fun stuff, but there were those real moments of poignancy when we’d all go like, oh my God. And then you look around at those sets, and you go, will there ever be sets built specifically for this world again like this? And then everything suddenly becomes very, very precious.” On the last day of filming, in 2022, Waller-Bridge says she was a wreck. “We’d been filming for just under a year, there was such hype going into it and such nerves. And then I think, from that first moment with Harrison, it became a place to have fun and really go on this adventure together, the most fun, beautiful, hilarious, challenging, but really positive experience,” she says. “It was an exhausting, impossible job, and everyone put everything into it. And then the joy and the celebration of it at the end, with Harrison, and saying goodbye to everyone was really, really emotional. Saying goodbye to Harrison was unbelievably emotional. I almost couldn’t do it, I was just crying so much. It was a lot.” Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny opens on June 28.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbWguY29tLmF1L2N1bHR1cmUvbW92aWVzL3Bob2ViZS13YWxsZXItYnJpZGdlLW9uLXdoeS1ob2xseXdvb2Qtc2hvdWxkLW5ldmVyLXJlY2FzdC1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLTIwMjMwNjE5LXA1ZGhrcy5odG1s0gGCAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNtaC5jb20uYXUvY3VsdHVyZS9tb3ZpZXMvcGhvZWJlLXdhbGxlci1icmlkZ2Utb24td2h5LWhvbGx5d29vZC1zaG91bGQtbmV2ZXItcmVjYXN0LWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtMjAyMzA2MTktcDVkaGtzLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-06-22 15:11:42+00:00,Mads Mikkelsen met Indiana Jones before he met Harrison Ford,EXCLUSIVE: Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’s villain tells us about his first meeting with the Hollywood legend,"There are few movie characters as legendary as Indiana Jones. So we can imagine that seeing Harrison Ford in the costume is quite a moment, even for an actor who has worked on Bond, Star Wars, and Marvel.

Mads Mikkelsen tells GamesRadar+ that this was exactly what happened when he first saw Ford in the iconic get-up on the set of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Speaking at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, he also reveals that this was the first time he met Ford too.

""I got confused,"" Mikkelsen recalls. ""I was supposed to meet Harrison. We had to read through the script. I was just jumping into my trailer, we had a costume fitting. I went out and he came out of his trailer – hat, whip, jacket. I was meeting Indiana Jones instead of Harrison. That was it! Standing there, grumpy, 'What am I doing here?' With the whip. Dan-da-dan! I was smiling all over.""

It certainly made an impression on the actor who plays villain Jürgen Voller in the movie, a former Nazi scientist working on the 1969 Apollo program. Mikkelsen was thrilled with the opportunity to work with Ford too and adds that he doesn’t think another actor could take on the iconic role after the character's swansong.

""The only thing that reminds me a little of Indiana Jones was way back in the '40s, '50s with Burt Lancaster and the pirate films he did,"" he explains. ""I was glued to the screen… it was charming. Harrison and Indiana Jones take it to a completely different level. So yeah, you can’t copy it. You can get inspired and find something else that makes us fly off into our imaginations.""

2023-06-19 12:01:18+00:00,"Does the world really need a $4,650 Indiana Jones bag?",Luxury leather bags inspired by Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s character in the new Dial of Destiny movie are the latest collaboration between fashion and film – but this time fans can fawn over Indy discreetly,"The latest, and hopefully last, Indiana Jones film is released this month. It isn’t a spoiler to say that it probably won’t end up occupying the same cultural territory as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but then again what could? Still, it isn’t a bad film. It contains some digital de-ageing that’s almost convincing, a big twist at the end that feels specifically designed to make the crankiest corners of the internet choke to death on its popcorn and – most importantly – Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s character carries a bag around for some of the film.

No, really, that’s important. When the dust has settled on the Indiana Jones series, everyone will remember the key pieces of its iconography. When future generations come to watch Indiana Jones, they will instantly picture Jones’s hat and whip, and also the bag that Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s character carries around for some of the last film.

Why? Is it because the bag plays an important role in the film? Not really. Is it because it’s an especially memorable bag? No. I’ve seen the film and didn’t even realise that she had a bag until I went back and did a Google Image search for it. But the bag is still very important, because otherwise nobody would have bothered to make an officially licensed partial replica of it and sell it on the internet for several thousand dollars.

But they have, so here we are. It has been announced that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny costume designer Joanna Johnston has collaborated with London-based luxury leather goods maker Métier to make a bunch of bags and wallets and playing card holders inspired by the film. These are statement pieces, and that statement is ‘I am slightly too invested in the fourth-best Indiana Jones film, and also I have more money than I really know what to do with.’

Which isn’t to say that the resulting pieces aren’t nice. Of course they’re nice. They’re beautiful. One of them is a suede duffle bag that’s roomy and practical and very well made. But it costs $4,650, which is a lot of money to invest in something designed to commemorate the sequel to a film where Indiana Jones gets blasted across a portion of the American wilderness inside a fridge.

This is, of course, just the latest collaboration between the worlds of fashion and entertainment. The final series of Game of Thrones, for example, caused an enormous rush of brands desperate to get in on the action, with Urban Decay bringing out a special Game of Thrones make-up set and menswear brand John Varvatos bringing out a $2,698 leather jacket designed to make you look like someone who lived in a time before the invention of laundry detergent. Jimmy Choo made shoes to commemorate the live-action Cinderella remake. Mr Porter sold a range of menswear based on Kingsman. Start to look for it and you’ll see it everywhere.

In a way, it’s quite sweet. When you’re a child, it’s easy to show the world that you like a film, because all you have to do is wait until Halloween and then buy a hellish padded superhero muscle suit to demonstrate your abiding love for, say, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. But it gets harder as you age. You can’t go to work dressed up as Darth Vader, because you are now a grownup and as such experience a suitable amount of shame when it comes to being enthusiastic about things.

True, there are plenty of ways in which one’s fandom can be celebrated indoors. You can buy all sorts of expensive merchandise – limited edition action figures and elaborate Lego sets, maybe even props from the actual movies – and fill your home with them, in the process creating a shrine to both the object of your enthusiasm and your own harrowing lack of impulse control.

But perhaps this represents a new and better way. These bags are a way for people to quietly and discreetly demonstrate their love for Indiana Jones. Take the duffle bag out for a weekend away, and most people will simply think you have a fondness for well-made but pricey luggage. However, those who know will know. Maybe one day a stranger will tap you on the shoulder and whisper “Excuse me, isn’t that the bag inspired by the bag that Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s character wore in some of the fourth-best Indiana Jones movie? I’d recognise that anywhere,” into your ear and, instantly, you will have made a friend for life.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZmlsbS8yMDIzL2p1bi8xOS9kb2VzLXRoZS13b3JsZC1yZWFsbHktbmVlZC1hLTQ2NTAtaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1iYWctcGhvZWJlLXdhbGxlci1icmlkZ2UtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW550gGFAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjMvanVuLzE5L2RvZXMtdGhlLXdvcmxkLXJlYWxseS1uZWVkLWEtNDY1MC1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWJhZy1waG9lYmUtd2FsbGVyLWJyaWRnZS1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3Rpbnk?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny viewers have been left stumped by a major “plot hole” in the new Harrison Ford sequel.

The film, the fifth entry in the adventure franchise, sees Dr Henry “Indiana” Jones Jr (Ford) come up against an old Nazi adversary (Mads Mikkelsen) in 1969.

Spoilers follow for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny... you have been warned!

Most of the plot of the film revolves around the hunt for the two pieces of Archimedes’ dial, an ancient device that could supposedly be used to “read fissures in time”, potentially allowing the user to travel back in time, by locating the right fissure at the right time.

By the end of the film, the villainous Jürgen Voller (Mikkelsen) has acquired the dial, and follows it towards a wormhole located somewhere in the sky. He flies through the wormhole in an airplane with Indiana Jones on board, expecting to arrive back in Nazi Germany, where he will change the course of history and win the war for the Nazis.

The plane does indeed get transported back in time – but instead arrives in ancient Greece, during the Siege of Syracuse in 213-212 BC.

It is ultimately revealed that the dial was invented by Archimedes to help direct people from the future to his location in the past, during the ancient battle.

However, while the ending clears up some of the questions posed earlier in the film – namely, how Archimedes’ entombed body was wearing a modern-day wristwatch – the nature of the time travel still seemed to leave open a large plot hole.

Given that the dial was simply a device for reading the “fissures” in time, as opposed to creating them, it remains unexplained how Voller was able to locate a portal to Archemedes’ exact time and location, just hours after the device fell into his possession. The most logical explanation would be that the “time portals” are constantly opening up all over the world, round the clock – which poses further questions as to why no one had ever noticed them, or travelled through them.

One person shared his confusion on Reddit. “I’m not sure I really understand the time travel,” they wrote. “So archimedes was working on his dial when the Romans attacked. During the attack, the Nazi plane came out of the sky and murdered the enemy army. So archimedes knew in the future, the dial would be found and this would happen. So he built a device that allowed the user to find a worm hole to that exact moment in time?

“But like why is there a time hole to that exact moment? Are there just time vortexes to any point in history? How did archimedes even know there was a time hole to the time of this attack. Idk maybe I don’t understand it.”

Another viewer wrote that the film featured “plot holes the size of 18-wheelers”.

In a three-star review of the film for The Independent, Geoffrey Macnab wrote: “Tonally, the film wavers. It pulls in too many different directions at once. On the one hand, this is an exercise in affectionate nostalgia.

“On the other, like its predecessors, it’s an old-fashioned matinee adventure in which characterisation is deliberately broad. Certain episodes are knowing and ironic, while others seem painfully naive.”

2023-06-18 19:14:22+00:00,Mads Mikkelsen says it’s an “enormous honour” to be in ‘Indiana Jones 5’,"Actor Mads Mikkelsen has said it's an ""enormous honour"" to be in the upcoming new Indiana Jones film, India Jones and the Dial of Destiny.","Actor Mads Mikkelsen has said it’s an “enormous honour” to be in the upcoming new Indiana Jones film, India Jones and the Dial of Destiny.

Mikkelsen, who plays villain Jürgen Voller in the film, said it felt that way due to his personal connection to the franchise – something he said he “grew up with”.

During a recent press conference about the film, Mikkelsen said: “It’s not my first franchise, but it’s the first one I grew up with. I’ve been lying in all the other interviews when I did Bond and Star Wars. I always said I saw them, but I didn’t” [via Digital Spy].

“I remember my brother and I, we [rented] the film together with five other films, and we ended up watching Indiana Jones five times and not the other ones. And so, it is true to say that this shaped our generation,” he continued.

“I have plenty of friends who are film directors specifically because of that one film. So obviously, sitting there as a kid and just wanting to be him or be up there and not wanting to be an actor at all, it is an enormous honour to be, 42 years later, part of this world.”

The latest offering marks the final instalment of the Indiana Jones franchise, and sees Harrison Ford reprise his iconic role at the age of 80.

In a four star review of the new film, which arrives in cinemas on June 28, NME said: “It’s Harrison Ford’s final crack at playing Indiana Jones – and his fifth time out as the great adventuring archaeologist is much more than a fond farewell.

“…It’s a lively, enthralling tale with some particularly emotive scenes in the final act that are bound to cause a tear or two. Some will ask why make this film at all? The answer should be, why not?”

2023-06-15 06:00:00-04:00,Ford v. Technology: How James Mangold rebuilt the past for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"Mangold could not have possibly conceived that he would one day be collaborating with his Raiders idols: Ford, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, John Williams","Open this photo in gallery: Director James Mangold at the Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny party at the 76th international film festival in Cannes, southern France, on May 18.Vianney Le Caer/The Associated Press

For director James Mangold, making Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny was an exercise in revisiting – and then reshaping – the past on two very different levels.

First there was Mangold’s personal connection to the franchise’s roots. Like pretty much every movie fanatic of a certain age, the filmmaker still retains a visceral, core memory of encountering Raiders of the Lost Ark.

“I was in the Orange Plaza Mall in Middletown, N.Y., all alone at the very first matinee 42 years ago to the day, actually,” the 59-year-old Mangold recalls. “I was 17, and I was no further into the film then when Harrison Ford looks back over his shoulder before he crosses that Peruvian creek in the opening, and I remember going, ‘Yeah, this rocks.’”

Mangold already knew by that time that he wanted to make movies himself – a decade and a half later, he would release his first film, the Liv Tyler indie drama Heavy, before moving onto such bigger studio fare as Walk the Line, Logan and Ford v Ferrari – but he could not have possibly conceived that he would one day be collaborating with his Raiders idols: Ford, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, John Williams.

“These were people from the Mount Rushmore of cinema who were coming to me to make a new Indiana Jones movie – how could you not find it flattering?” Mangold says.

But while the director “knew that there was money to be made, that the franchise was a valuable commodity” that would get made one way or the other, he wasn’t so sure that he had a reason himself to make the movie. Then it hit him – an idea, one of those big juicy themes, hidden just beneath the surface of the very proposition of another Indiana Jones adventure itself.

“Let’s make a movie about aging, about getting older, about being a hero at a time when the world around you no longer recognizes the exploits that you did in the past,” Mangold says. “What happens to Indiana in the late sixties when no one is looking down at archeology and everyone is looking up at the stars and space? What does a greyer time look like and feel like for someone who comes from a golden age?”

But to contrast one age from another, Mangold realized he had to go backward as much as forward. Which led him and his team to create Dial of Destiny’s outrageous opening sequence, a thrilling and unprecedented bit of technical wizardry that de-ages the 80-year-old Ford to place his whip-cracking hero in the thick of the Second World War, during his Raiders heyday.

While Hollywood has been making steady advances in digital de-aging practices over the past decade – think of Ang Lee shaving a few decades off Will Smith in Gemini Man or Martin Scorsese smoothing the visages of Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci in The Irishman – Dial of Destiny represents a wild next-gen leap. For the film’s 25-minute sequence, which focuses on Indiana trying to retrieve a MacGuffin from the hands of a Nazi madman played by Mads Mikkelsen, Mangold has his star punching, shooting and leaping his way out of trouble, all while sporting the wrinkle-free face and athletic body of a shockingly spry swashbuckler.

When we first see Ford’s de-aged mug – in a nicely meta “aha!” reveal moment, during which a Nazi soldier pulls a black hood off a tied-up Indiana – Mangold forces his audience to do something beyond a double take. This is triple- or quadruple-level innovation, with Dial of Destiny leaping straight past the uncanny valley into something more paradoxically organic.

“There’s a theory that I have that you always want to be on the right place of the curve when you invest yourself in new technology,” Mangold says. “Clearly there’s a lot of brilliant people who have been working on visual effects like this for a while, and every time that they finish a new film, they learn something new. So we could come in at a good place.”

The Dial of Destiny filmmakers also had the benefit of resources other productions couldn’t claim: Production company Lucasfilm retained a vast wealth of archival photos and film negatives capturing Ford during the original Raiders shoot.

“We had this incredible data repository of Ford in any kind of lighting, with any kind of expression, captured in any kind of close-up or wide-shot,” Mangold says. “The artists and computers could then build something not from their imagination but based upon reality.”

The result was that Mangold could film Ford with motion-capture dots placed on his face one day, and then two days later he would be able to see footage of the actor looking 35 years younger.

Still, there was a not-insignificant risk in conceiving of such an opening – unquestionably the film’s high point – before knowing whether or not the visual-effects bet was going to work or not.

“That’s what I do every day as a filmmaker, though – make these calculated bets,” Mangold says. “My whole life is trying to take a risk that’s broad enough but not so far out on a limb that I can’t deliver.”

But more than that, Mangold wanted to ensure that audiences recognized that this was the Indiana Jones who they grew up watching – just as Mangold did in that suburban mall so many years ago.

“I wanted to give audiences a taste of something that they missed and loved, which is classic golden-age Indy, because I knew that we were after going to land in a period of time where that kind of adventure can’t happen that way any more,” the director says. “Part of how you set up that loss or disorientation is to give audiences exactly what they want, and then take that away. You watch the character earn their way back to getting that mojo back by the third act of the movie. It’s never worthwhile to make a movie if we’re not challenging the audience.”

The Indiana Jones saga began in 1981 with Raiders of the Lost Ark, while prequel Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom arrived in 1984. The series seemed like it concluded with Last Crusade in 1989. But then Kingdom of the Crystal Skull arrived in 2008.

Less well-received than its predecessors, that really seemed like it would be the end for the archeologist adventurer. But in spite of the fact that star Harrison Ford is now 80, a fifth film hit screens this week in the shape of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.

So is the franchise over? Or will Indiana Jones don leather jacket and and fedora and crack that whip one last time? SPOILERS FOR INDIANA JONES 5 below…

Will there be an Indiana Jones 6?

No, there will not be an Indiana Jones 6. While presenting footage from Dial of Destiny at D23, Harrison Ford stated that this will be the last time he plays the character.

“This is it!” Ford joked. “I will not fall down for you again.”

In the film’s official production notes, he says his farewells, stating: “I’ll miss the people who I’ve worked with on the film – everyone at Lucasfilm, at Disney, [director] Jim Mangold, and the actors. But I’m not going to miss Indy because he’s fulfilled his purpose, and I’m really happy to have seen it come around to the end.

“I felt good. I felt that we had made a film that the audience deserved. For those people who had been fans of the earlier films, had enjoyed seeing them, had shared them with their families, I feel confident that we’re going to knock their socks off with this one.” Right, SPOILERS follow…

What happens to Indy at the end of Indy 5?

It does look like Indiana Jones might die at Dial of Destiny’s end, with the title character taking a bullet to what looks like the chest. But next scene, he’s recovering in bed in his apartment, the film telling us the bullet hit him in the shoulder.

What follows is a lovely end for Indy. He’s reunited with love-of-his-life Marion Ravenwood. And in spite of the fact that they’ve been estranged for the duration of the movie, they kiss in his kitchen.

But just when you think he’s retiring from adventuring – much like he’s just retired from teaching – the final shot features Indy grabbing his iconic hat.

Why Indiana Jones won’t be recast

Harrison Ford is 80 years old now, which is one of the reasons the Indiana Jones films are ending. There were rumors of a TV spinoff, but that is now off the table. While the role could always be recast. But producer Kathleen Kennedy believes that isn’t an option.

Speaking in April 2022, Kennedy told Vanity Fair: “We would never make Indiana Jones without Harrison Ford. Having just finished the fifth movie, I can tell you, there wasn’t a day I wasn’t on set where I wasn’t like, ‘Yes – this is Indiana Jones.'”

So at this point, the only way it seems like the Indy universe will continue, is through his goddaughter Helena Shaw, who is played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and who has much in common with her godfather.

2023-06-22 19:43:25+00:00,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"Since its inception in 1981, Indiana Jones has been a staple of my cinematic fandom. Raiders of the Lost Ark is widely considered one of the greatest films ever made and one of my favorites. Going through the landscape of adventure films throughout time, the first three adventures with Indiana Jones were near perfect, then came 2008.","Since its inception in 1981, Indiana Jones has been a staple of my cinematic fandom. Raiders of the Lost Ark is widely considered one of the greatest films ever made and one of my favorites. Going through the landscape of adventure films throughout time, the first three adventures with Indiana Jones were near perfect, then came 2008.

While Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is far from awful, as many have yelled from their soap box for 15 years, the film fails at capturing the charm and adventure the previous three entries executed effectively. Fifteen years later, Indiana Jones has a new ship captain, James Mangold. That ship, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, is a deserving swan song for our fedora-wearing hero.

Like every great band, great franchises deserve a “greatest hits” compilation, and James Mangold’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny covers the memorable hits of Indy’s past while molding a path for a fitting finale. Yes, it’s The Force Awakens of the Indy world, but that’s not bad.

Dial of Destiny travels back to 1944 to find Indy in pursuit of the Spear of Longinus. As with any Indy adventure, he is not alone as Basil Shaw joins Indy, and on this pursuit to find one item, Shaw discovers the Nazis have discovered lost Antikythera, a dial designed by Archimedes that will give someone the ultimate power (think Biff in Back to the Future Part II).

Unfortunately for Indy and Shaw, Jürgen Voller knows the power of the dial, and as time moves forward, so does Shaw’s obsession and Voller’s desire to attain the dial. As we jump to 1969, Indy is set to retire while Helena Shaw, daughter of Basil, arrives in New York. That arrival spawns one final memorable journey.

Dial of Destiny’s screenplay plays it safe as Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, David Koepp, and James Mangold do not look to reinvent the wheel but bring back the charm and feel of an Indy adventure lacking in the previous entry. Most importantly, the screenplay does a fine job of examining the past and confronting it head-first. Speaking of Mangold, replacing Steven Spielberg is a challenging task. However, Mangold’s skill is on display as he brings to the series the same respect and adoration obtained when he helmed Logan a few years ago.

Cinephiles head to the theater to spend time with Indiana and Harrison Ford, as with any Indiana Jones film. With Dial of Destiny, Ford says goodbye to one of cinema’s most notable characters with the charm, laughs, and action that cemented him as one in 1981’s masterpiece. Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Helena is a perfect match for Indy as Waller-Bridge becomes one of the franchise’s most memorable character debuts with her grit and not only warrants a partnership with Indy but a dive into Helena’s world, a Disney+ series, if I say so.

As with Crystal Skull, there will be extensive conversations. However, it’s not the CGI de-aging of Ford, which is flawless, its the third act that will divide cinephiles. While it can be seen as wildly ridiculous, I look back at every Indy film, and each offers a third act “suspend your disbelief moment.” While Dial of Destiny will have you suspending your disbelief, the finality of its execution left me satisfied.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny affirms one thing. There is only one Harrison Ford and Indiana Jones. The film treats its character with the utmost respect, and as John William’s final Indy score plays our character off into the sunset, it’s bittersweet that the whip and fedora will no longer hit the silver screen.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlY2luZW1hdGljcmVlbC5jb20vaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1hbmQtdGhlLWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,James Mangold Responds to Negative Reviews of INDIANA JONES AND THE DIAL OF DESTINY — GeekTyrant,,"While a lot of critics and fans love Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the movie is still seeing a good amount of negative reviews. Having seen the film, I totally can see why people don’t like it, but I enjoyed the movie and had a ton of fun watching it! It really does take Harrison Ford’s iconic character on an insane adventure and that adventure is driven by some emotional things going on in Jones’ life.

Director James Mangold recently gave an interview with Variety, and when asked about the negative reviews that the film has been getting, he said:

“When you’re in franchise land, it’s very hard for critical thinkers” — meaning journalists — “to overlook what I’m sure their editors want, which is this business prism of how does it rate to the other ones? I always thought if I were second or third best to one of the greatest films of all time, I’d be good. I mean, it all vaporizes later. Either the movie will live or it won’t.”

I don’t really care what the critics think, I’m more interested in seeing how the audience and fans respond with the movie actually hits theaters. While I’ve already seen the movie, I’m definitely going to see it again in a theater filled with fans because that’s the experience I enjoy most about the movies!

Ford returns to the role of the legendary hero archaeologist for this final installment of the iconic franchise-- a big, globe-trotting, rip-roaring cinematic adventure. The story is set in 1969 during the Space Race, and Indiana Jones is pulled into another grand adventure, which involves Voller, a NASA member and ex-Nazi involved with the Moon landing program, who wants to ""rectify the world and make it into a better place as he sees fit."" He’s looking to correct the mistakes that Hitler made when he was in power with the Dial of Destiney artifact.

The movie also stars Mads Mikkelsen (Rogue One), Boyd Holbrook (Logan), Shaunette Renée Wilson (The Resident), and Thomas Kretschmann (Avengers: Age Of Ultron).

The film will open in theaters on June 30, 2023.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZ2Vla3R5cmFudC5jb20vbmV3cy9qYW1lcy1tYW5nb2xkLXJlc3BvbmRzLXRvLW5lZ2F0aXZlLXJldmlld3MtZm9yLWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Ranking the Indiana Jones movies from worst to best

We’ve already posted a detailed explainer on where to watch the Indiana Jones movies, with the movies currently streaming on Disney+ and Paramount+, and available to rent and buy pretty much everywhere else.

While head here to find out how to watch all five flicks in release order or chronological order.

But to watch them in order of quality, this is the Indiana Jones movies ranked from worst-to-best.

5. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2007)

There might be some debate concerning the order of the top three. But until Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny joins these ranks, there’s no doubt what the worst Indiana Jones movie is.

Article continues after ad

First, the positives: Cate Blanchett is superb as fantastically camp villain Irina Spalko. Harrison Ford and Karen Allen have lost none of their spark in the electric scenes where Indy and Marion passionately bicker. And the action – when it’s practical – is breathtaking.

Article continues after ad

The film got criticized for the nuclear fridge (which – fun fact – is cribbed from an early draft of Back to the Future) and alien subplot. But they aren’t much more far-fetched than the supernatural shenanigans in earlier installments.

But Ray Winstone – and especially John Hurt – are terrible in the movie. Shia LeBeouf just doesn’t work as Indy’s son Mutt, meaning it’s no surprise he’s nowhere to be seen in Indy 5. And the reliance on computer-generated effects ruins some of the film’s most important sequences.

A highlight of Indiana Jones movies are the wild stunts and spectacular action. But here the reliance on digital elements in those scenes means Indy suddenly looks fake, which is catastrophic to the movie. And that’s before they add CG-monkeys to the mix…

4. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023)

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the first film in the franchise to be directed by someone other than Steven Spielberg. With James Mangold taking over the reins. And while the Logan helmer does a solid job, Dial of Destiny does seem to be missing a little of the Spielberg magic that makes the previous entries that much more memorable.

Article continues after ad

Article continues after ad

The film kicks off with some dodgy de-ageing effects bringing 1944 Indiana Jones to life. Then the rest of the film plays out in 1969, with Indy a very different character, living alone in a tiny apartment, drinking too much, and paying the price for the many bones he’s broken and bullets he’s taken.

But an encounter with goddaughter Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) sends him on a new adventure, that in classic Indy-style, means a race against time to beat the Nazis to a potentially magical artefact.

Article continues after ad

Here’s what we said about Dial of Destiny in our 3-star review: “There’s a real irony and poignancy in Indy’s quest to rewind the clock to find this Dial of Destiny and Ford’s grizzled charm, and genuine affection for his character shines through in every scene. He’s also in incredible shape for his age and though he’s running and jumping around less than in previous instalments (at times he’s almost Waller-Bridge’s sidekick), you totally believe that Indy can still duck and dive with the best of them. As Indy himself once growled, ‘It’s not the years, honey, it’s the mileage.’

Article continues after ad

“Then there’s the grandstanding, go-for-broke final act. Without giving any specific spoilers it’s maybe the first time in the whole movie where the story aims for something completely new. It’s a jump that some audiences will hate in the way the Crystal Skull aliens took many people out of that film, and the Indiana Jones world in general – which is strange for a series that had already unleashed the wrath of God, magical stones, and an immortal knight.

Article continues after ad

“For this reviewer, the film’s climax felt original, daring and, ultimately, hugely moving: given the Archimedes theme, it’s a real ‘Eureka!’ moment. For all Dial of Destiny’s flaws, and whether Disney attempts to continue the series with Helena taking on the mantle, this feels like a fitting end (and please, let it be the end this time) to one of the most iconic characters in modern movies and the star who brought him to life.”

3. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)

It gets tricky from here-on-in. Temple of Doom is a sequel that was really a prequel, and divided audiences with its violence and grimly dark tone. Which is saying something when the film’s predecessor included a man’s face melting while the heads around him explode.

Article continues after ad

Temple of Doom features the best Indiana Jones opening sequence, the ‘Anything Goes’ musical number a true classic. And one of the most exciting action sequences in the shape of that cart chase through underground mines.

But the casual racism that underpins proceedings makes it a tough watch. While going from kick-ass heroine Marion drinking her way through Raiders, to damsel in distress Willy screaming her way through Temple was a step backwards for the franchise. Then there’s the heart-ripping, and the child slaves, and did we mention all that racism?

Article continues after ad

Article continues after ad

So while the highs are high in Temple of Doom, the lows are very low, making this the third best Indy movie.

2. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)

Based on current evidence, the third Indiana Jones is also where the franchise should have finished. Pretending the darkness of Doom didn’t happen, Last Crusade gets back to basics, with Indy punching Nazis as he endeavours to stop them drinking from the Holy Grail.

The film kicks off in swashbuckling fashion via an inspired flashback. River Phoenix plays young Indy embarking on an early adventure, and picking up the character’s trademarks in a way that doesn’t seem trite or contrived.

Article continues after ad

Article continues after ad

But what makes Last Crusade sing is the inclusion of the protagonist’s Dad – Dr. Henry Jones Sr. As well as being based on the cliffhanger serials of their youth, Indy was Lucas and Spielberg’s answer to James Bond. So casting Sean Connery in the role of his Dad was inspired; the actor bringing humour and gravitas to the role, all while stealing scenes from Harrison Ford.

The film builds to a memorable climax, and ends with father and son riding off into the sunset in emotionally satisfying fashion. Which is probably where the series should have stopped.

1. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)

Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the all-time great blockbusters, largely because every aspect of the production – both behind-the-scenes and in front of the camera – works in bringing the story of Indiana Jones to life.

Article continues after ad

Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as the archaeology teacher who moonlights as a treasure-hunter; one who is brave and resourceful one minute, and terrified – usually of snakes – the next. The result is a very likeable, very human hero.

Article continues after ad

The script – by Lawrence Kasdan – is filled with sharp dialogue that harks back to the screwball comedies of yesteryear. The story – about a race to locate the lost ark of the covenant – makes for a pulsating, globe-trotting adventure. While the villains are Nazis trying to take over the world, and who doesn’t hate Nazis trying to take over the world?

Raiders is ultimately an action movie however, and on that front it truly excels. From the boulder run at the beginning of the movie, to the bar-fight in Nepal, to that spectacular chase through the streets of Cairo, we’re watching director Steven Spielberg at the height of his powers, collaborating with some of the best stunt-people in the business.

Article continues after ad

Article continues after ad

The result is a film that’s filled with superb action, high adventure, sly humor, and supernatural wonder, all of which makes Raiders of the Lost Ark the best Indiana Jones movie of them all.

2023-06-26 01:38:24-04:00,Film Review: ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Sends Harrison Ford Off on One Last Adventure,"Awards Radar seeks to provide objective, thoughtful, and wide-ranging coverage of the awards season, as well as the entertainment world in general","Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures

It’s kind of crazy that this movie even exists. Just think about it. Indiana Jones has been a big screen character for over 40 years now. Sure, Raiders of the Lost Ark got two good to very good sequels in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom as well as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, but the long in development Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull underwhelmed, seemingly putting the franchise on ice. Now, Indy is back, not so much taking a victory lap as much as attempting to go out with more of a bang. The result is Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which won’t make anyone forget about the first three, but is a welcome step up from the fourth one. Mostly, if you enjoy this character, there’s more fun to be had with him, before hanging up the fedora for good.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a farewell to an all-timer of a cinematic character. At the same time, it’s an adventure fit for our hero. Not all of it works, but in comparison to the wildly uneven nature of his prior outing, this is mostly satisfying. Would it perhaps have been better to just leave Indy be? Maybe, but after continuing on from a really strong trilogy, it made sense to try and course correct here. What we end up with is no modern classic, to be sure, but an entertaining adventure with an old friend.

Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures

We catch up with Indiana Jones (Ford) in Germany during the waning days of World War II. Along with Basil Shaw (Toby Jones), he’s searching for the Lance of Longinus, currently in possession by the Nazis, including scientist Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen). As all involved realize the Lance is a fake, they wind up aboard a speeding train with something else to covet. That something is the Antikythera, the titular dial invented by Greek mathematician Archimedes in the third century B.C., which will become the focus of the film. Half of it is here, the other half a mystery. Basil and Indy escape with it, but its existence will haunt Voller.

Fast-forward to 1969 and Indy is a shell of his former self. Teaching at Hunter College in Manhattan, he lives in a small apartment, drinks, and shows no real interest in anything. That is, until a visit from his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). An archeologist herself, she wants his help in finding the other half of the dial. However, she’s in it to sell at auction to the highest bidder. Voller is in town too, having escaped and become an integral part of NASA pulling off the moon landing. One big chase later and Helena has Indy with her going after the Grafikos, the missing half of the dial. Alongside her young sidekick Teddy (Ethann Isidore), they set off on one last adventure. This one goes from the Big Apple to Tangier, as well as Greece and Sicily, among other spots. All the while, Voller and his goons are never far behind. I won’t spoil the third act, but it does what the franchise has always done, just on a whole other level.

Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures

Harrison Ford is fully engaged here, knowing this is his final ride as the archeologist. As such, it’s more satisfying watching him here than in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Ford shows his age a bit, but the flick doesn’t shy away from it. It’s never a punchline, but just changes the type of journey, to some degree. When the emotional moments arrive, Ford is at the top of his game. As for Phoebe Waller-Bridge, she’s a delight, playing the other side of the adventurer coin. Indy may want the artifacts in the museum, but Helena harkens back to his days of seeking fortune and glory. They have nice chemistry together, while Waller-Bridge shows the evolution of the character quite well. Mads Mikkelsen is a traditional villain for this franchise, colder and almost gentlemanly, but with a deranged side, to be sure. It’s a slightly new spin on the Nazi bad guy, while still remembering who the series is at its best in presenting as villains. Ethann Isidore isn’t bad, but the character is annoying and really doesn’t add much to the proceedings, while Toby Jones doesn’t get a ton to do (though he fits the franchise like a glove). Supporting players here include Antonio Banderas, Mark Killeen, Thomas Kretschmann, Nasser Memarzia, Billy Postlethwaite, Olivier Richters, Shaunette Renée Wilson, and more, including cameos from Karen Allen and John Rhys-Davies. Both of them will make you smile when you see them pop up.

James Mangold takes over for Steven Spielberg and does a very nice job. The camera work isn’t as dynamic as Spielberg’s films (Douglas Slocombe in the original trilogy and Janusz Kamiński last time), but cinematographer Phedon Papamichael is no slouch here. Mangold’s direction leans in to what Ford does well with the character, only occasionally leaning too heavily on CGI action that feels more anonymous than this franchise has as a hallmark. That being said, the CGI used to de-age Harrison Ford in the prologue is pretty good. It’s just his voice that betrays the age, but visually? It works well. There’s also potentially the last John Williams score (though he’s recently rescinded his retirement plans), which is reliably strong and sweeping. The weak link is the screenplay, which is credited to Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, David Koepp, and Mangold. It’s not a bad script, but it gives us things we don’t need, like another child sidekick, alongside a frivolous action sequence or two. Now, they take arguably the biggest swing yet with the third act, though the series never went small with their climaxes. This one might prove divisive, but I got a kick out of it.

Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures

Compared to the rest of the franchise (which I’ll rank later on this week), this one is not a patch on the original trilogy, though it is a course correction from the prior installment. Mangold and company, which includes Spielberg, clearly wanted this to end things on a better note. They certainly managed to accomplish that goal, though I honestly would have been curious to see Spielberg helming this one. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull isn’t particularly good, but individual sequences are great, so had he been on board and into things like Ford is, they could have made one more really strong one.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a solid film that mainly suffers from heightened expectations and the hope that it could have been great. The movie works, gives you what you want from Indy, and says goodbye in a way that feels right for the character. It may not be what you’re expecting (and boy the third act is a big swing), but it does right by Indy. At the end of the day, what more can you ask for here?

SCORE: ★★★

2023-06-29 15:26:41+05:30,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny movie review: Harrison Ford takes both fortune and glory,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny movie review: With Harrison Ford's rakish smile, his distinct old-world charm, his hat and his whip, still intact, we can't grudge Indiana Jones this indulgent goodbye.","As Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) tells Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) in Raiders of the Lost Ark, “It’s not the years, honey, it’s the mileage.”

Boy, does the most famous movie archaeologist tot up miles on this one! He wakes up one day to the first men having just walked on the moon, marking a new future for mankind, and by the end of the film, has gone all the way back to… well, you better watch The Dial of Destiny to figure that one out.

For, James Mangold (Logan, Ford vs Ferrari, both movies that blended action with emotion) gives a fitting send-off to Indy, which in itself is not a mean task given the burden of the franchise and the weight of the giant shoes of Steven Spielberg, who directed all the four previous Indiana Jones (1981, 1984, 1989 and 2008).

Advertisement

Not to forget the creeping years on Ford himself, who at 80 though, still retains enough charm to pull off making an entrance wearing just his boxers, his age written all over his sagging body.

The 15 years between the The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and The Dial of Destiny – in which time not just movie-making but also movie-watching has changed, and a generation has grown up knowing copycat action-archaeologists in Tomb Raider and National Treasure – are covered niftily by harking back to what set us out on this Indiana Jones fandom. So, we return to the Nazis, a falling Berlin, a precious antique, and Hitler’s lust for it – if his men were bringing him the Lost Ark in Raiders…, this time their quest is the Antikythera or the Archimedes’s Dial.



But the Greek mathematician, having figured out the dangers of what the dial he built could do – bring about “fissures in time”, or time travel, as we call it now – broke it into two. The clue to find one hidden half lies in an equally obscurely hidden tablet.

Nothing that is hidden can’t be found by Indy, but he is more than ably helped here by a late friend’s daughter, Helena (Waller-Bridge), and a child sidekick she has taken on, Teddy (Isidore) – with Indy and Helena deploying The Da Vinci Code-like skills. Helena clearly makes up for the sexism of the previous Indiana Jones, with Indy having spent a large part of Raiders…, for example, saving the otherwise resourceful Marion (his love interest) from a series of crises.

Advertisement

Here, Helena saves Indy’s slowing ass once or twice.

There is another course correction. When The Dial of Destiny ventures towards Tangier in Morocco, with a chase through town reminiscent of Raiders… and its dash through Cairo, it isn’t as flippant about the “natives”. Of course, this is the post-colonial era, but even so, the addition of the heroic Teddy from Tangier is a conscious decision. Not to mention, bringing a Tuk Tuk (what we call the humble auto rickshaw) to a memorable car chase.

Where Indy goes, the Nazis led by Voller — Mikkelsen in a characteristically cold, unreadable portrayal — follow. The chase of the missing half of Archimedes’s Dial takes them, and us, through a series of exotic locations, where Indy of course runs into snakes (which he doesn’t like), and skeletons and tombs (which he prefers).

Advertisement

There is a lot of chasing and fighting, plenty of punches are thrown about, and enough bad Nazis killed to warm hearts – through which The Dial of Destiny does tend to overstretch. However, his rakish smile, his distinct old-world charm, his hat and his whip, still intact, we can’t grudge Ford’s Indiana Jones this indulgent goodbye.

Spielberg said of his Indiana Jones that he wanted to make sure the audiences didn’t feel cheated in the action, that end to end, they figured out how it was done. Attached to this fifth and final film as a producer, though not as a director, he would be satisfied with The Dial of Destiny.

Fortune and glory, you take both, Indiana Jones.

2023-07-01 22:30:01-04:00,"REVIEW: New Forbidden Turnover, Adventurer’s Platter, and More Food Offerings at Bengal Barbecue for Release of ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’",A daily-updated resource for news and information on the Disney resort around the world.,"To celebrate the release of “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” new limited time food offerings themed to the iconic adventurer have been added to the menu at Bengal Barbecue.

Watch our video review below and keep scrolling for photos and more information.

Adventurer’s Platter – $18.49

Choice of two skewers with turmeric rice and couscous salad.

The couscous salad is perfectly fine, nothing to write home about, but it has a nice refreshing taste to it, likely from the cucumber.

The rice is quite enjoyable, though it is the same rice that is typically served with everything else.

The lemon chicken was one of the most disgusting pieces of food we’ve gotten from this park. The meat itself is a fine consistency, but the sauce on it tastes the way that lemon Pledge smells.

The lamb kebab was very tough yet tasty. The flavorful sauce complemented the meat nicely and added some spice to the dish.

This would have been a near-perfect item, if the lamb meat was not so difficult to chew.

The Forbidden Turnover – $6.99

Turnover filled with mango, pineapple, and passion fruit.

The turnover is a legitimate “new favorite park snack” contender. The flavors are fantastic and go together very well without clashing in any way.

The pastry is fluffy and thin, balancing well with the filling. This isn’t just a good-looking snack, it’s also a really tasty one.

Vegetable Platter – $12.99

Fresh vegetables with harissa hummus, chermoula, and yogurt dill sauce, served with grilled naan.

The vegetables are very fresh, crisp, and tasty, and the three sauces are all quite good. They’re definitely on the spicier side, though.

The hummus was our favorite. It had a bit of a kick, likely from paprika.

The yogurt is heavy on the dill with a kick on the back end. The chermoula was standard. It was our least favorite sauce, but it wasn’t bad.

2023-06-29 18:06:00+00:00,Does Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Have a Post-Credits Scene?,A friendly PSA for everyone heading to theaters this weekend.,"The fifth Indiana Jones film was always supposed to chronicle Indy's final adventure. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a celebration of one of Harrison Ford's most popular roles—and a grand farewell to our favorite archeologist. More Indy? Who could say no?! After a visit from his old buddy's daughter (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), Indy is roped into another Nazi-punching adventure to save the world—and learn about another one of the universe's greatest mysteries.
With the film focusing on the search for Achimedes dial—a device with the power to travel through time—one may think that Indiana Jones would be entering the complicated world of multiverses. After all, another summer blockbuster, The Flash, just went into multiverse overdrive because of its bizarre time-travel plot. Thankfully, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a fitting end for the character—and one that avoids the need to shoehorn Marvel-level shenanigans into the film.
What we will tell you, however, is that there's no need to sit through the credits for a certain tip of the hat—one that points to another Indy film. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny does not have a post-credits scene. Good for them! When Disney said that this film is Indy's final outing, they really meant it. If the House of Mouse ever chooses to recast a young Indiana Jones for a new round of adventures, they can do that on their own time. Let's all just give the 80-year-old Ford a break before he has to saddle up again in 1923. In the meantime, the last Indiana Jones picture premieres in theaters tonight, June 29. Now go forth, intrepid adventurer—we'll let you discover how the film ends for yourself.

2023-07-01 13:30:00+00:00,Does Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Have a Post-Credits Scene?,"'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' is in theaters now. Here's what you need to know about the movie, including whether it has a post-credits scene.","Harrison Ford is donning the hat and picking up that famous whip one last time in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, a brand new action epic featuring the iconic archaeologist and adventurer whom he first portrayed in 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark.
This time around, Ford shares top billing with Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge as his goddaughter Helena Shaw, who joins him on this final adventure. He is also reunited with John Rhys-Davies as Indy's trusted friend Sallah who last appeared in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The all-star cast additionally includes Antonio Banderas, Mads Mikkelsen, and Toby Jones.
Set partly in 1944 and partly in 1969, Ford appears digitally de-aged in several scenes of the movie, as the narrative bridges the gap between the World War II setting of the early films in the franchise and an older version of the character who more closely resembles the 80-year-old actor now.
The 1940s timeline means fans are likely to be treated to some references to events from Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade, similarly to how the opening scene in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull served essentially as a prolonged homage to the closing scene in Raiders.
These kinds of Easter eggs are par for the course in epic movie franchises these days—as are extra ""secret"" scenes which take place after the credits.
Disney
Does Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny have a post-credits scene?
Unlike pretty much every other blockbuster to hit the multiplex in the last several years, when Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny ends, that's actually the ending. There are no additional scenes during or after the credits, the film is officially over.
This makes sense for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the Indy franchise pre-dates the mid-credit stinger by a couple of decades, and these adventure movies typically end in a much more classical cinematic fashion, with the credits rolling over the film's last lingering shot. Secondly, Dial of Destiny has been touted to be Harrison Ford's final adventure as Indiana Jones, so the function that a post-credit scene usually serves—to set up or tease an upcoming sequel—is moot.

The new Indiana Jones film is being defended from criticism of its “unrealistic” ending following a disappointing result at the box office.
The fifth film in the franchise, titled Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, was released last week, one month after its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival.
Harrison Ford returns as the archaeologist, whom he first played in 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark, for a new adventure alongside Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Mads Mikkelsen.
The film has failed to set the US box office alight after earning $82m (£65.5m) in its first five days, with the global takings so far amounting to $142.50m (£112m). It will need to post a strong showing in the month to come if it’s to make back its budget, which was between $250m (£196m) and $300m (£236m). But it will face stiff competition in the form of blockbusters Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, Barbie and Oppenheimer.
What might help its cause is the fact the film is garnering what seems to be shades of a cult fanbase. While receiving middling reviews, Indiana Jones 5 is being defended after many tore into what has been described as a “big swing” twist.
*Spoilers follow – you have been warned*
The film follows Indiana Jones as he takes on Mikkelsen’s villain Jürgen Voller, a Nazi attempting to rewrite history so that Hitler wins the Second World War.
To do this, Indy wants his team to hunt down a device that will enable him to do this. In doing so, time travel is introduced to the franchise.
The introduction of this concept has been criticised by some viewers, who believe time travel to be one “unrealistic” step too far for the film series. However, many others are pointing out that the Indiana Jones franchise has always been unafraid to make bold swings, and that the twist is in keeping with the spirit of the previous films.
Happy Sad Confused podcast jost Josh Horowitz wrote on Twitter: “Has anyone talking about DIAL OF DESTINY’s ‘big swing’ ending actually seen an Indiana Jones movie before? The ones where the Ark melted people’s faces, a guy pulled hearts out of living people, and an ancient warrior guarded the holy grail for thousands of years? Also, aliens.”

Horowitz’s “aliens” comment was referencing the fact that extra-terrestrials were controversially introduced in 2008 film Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Giancarlo Sopo added: “It’s been funny to see people say the ending of DoD is too fantastical in a franchise where the Ark of the Covenant melts Nazis’ faces off (but you survive if you close your eyes), a guy’s heart is ripped from his chest, and bullet wounds are healed by water from a fictional cup.”
Twitter user @Tidmore waded in: “They’ve always been films that are grounded in reality with a HUGE Dash of the supernatural/Science Fiction.”
Meanwhile, Daniel Brizuela argued: “These films are meant to be silly. Was anyone paying attention to who made the last four.”
This is the first Indiana Jones film that Steven Spielberg did not direct, with the filmmaker stepping away from the project in 2020. However, he remained on board as a producer and, months before the film’s premiere, shared his verdict after it was screened for him.

Yes, even though Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull seemed like a farewell, he’s back. That might well leave you wondering — is Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny the last movie? I’ve got the answer.
The Future of Indiana Jones Movies & Whether Dial of Destiny Is the Last One
Without getting into spoiler territory, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’s ending does tie things up neatly (without requiring post-credits scenes). It leaves Indy in a good place, and while the same could be said of The Crystal Skull, it’s not a bad place to finish.
So is this the last movie in the series? It’s definitely the last Indiana Jones movie to star Harrison Ford. He told Total Film, “This is the final film in the series, and this is the last time I’ll play the character. I anticipate that it will be the last time that he appears in a film.”
Ultimately, it’s not his call as to whether it’s the last movie, but he won’t be making any more. There have been rumblings of an Indiana Jones TV series, as a prequel or a spinoff. My gut instinct is that you just can’t replace Harrison Ford. But when I think back to Solo: A Star Wars Story, the movie’s biggest problem wasn’t that it recast Han Solo. Then again, in May 2022, Lucasfilm chief Kathleen Kennedy told Vanity Fair, “We would never make Indiana Jones without Harrison Ford.”
So the answer to whether Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the last Indiana Jones movie is — yes, probably, and it’s certainly Harrison Ford’s last movie in the role.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzY2FwaXN0bWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2lzLWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnktdGhlLWxhc3QtbW92aWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

,An Archaeologist’s Take on What Indiana Jones Gets Right—and Wrong—About the Field,The movie franchise speaks to ethical issues at the very heart of anthropological thinking,"Pop culture’s most famous archaeologist, Indiana “Indy” Jones, returns to the big screen this summer. In this fifth installment, The Dial of Destiny, Harrison Ford once again stars as the titular character who defined public perceptions of archaeology.
Producers have confirmed this will be the final chapter in Indy’s story. It’s also the first and only film in the series not directed by Steven Spielberg, though he remains an executive producer. Now directed by James Mangold, the flick premiered at the Cannes Film Festival with lackluster initial reviews.
The movie will certainly elicit grumblings from Indy’s real-life colleagues. Many professional archaeologists love to hate on the franchise. Critics often bemoan the unrealistic representation of archaeology and the mystification of historical facts. Some find it demeaning to the serious research undertaken in the field.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny | Official Trailer Watch on
But at the same time, many archaeologists appreciate that Indy raises the profile of archaeology in the popular imagination. As an archaeologist and frequent moviegoer, I want to highlight another merit of the franchise: the cinematic expression of ethical issues at the very heart of anthropological thinking.
Of course, these issues are embellished and reinvented; we’re watching action blockbusters, after all. Nevertheless, the Indy movies reflect fundamental challenges in the field—real concerns to real archaeologists.
As a warning, this essay contains spoilers from the first three Indiana Jones movies. But you have had more than 30 years to watch them.
Archaeology is destructive
From Egyptian tombs to medieval churches, archaeological sites suffer damage throughout the movies. Often, this is the first objection raised when it comes to archaeology’s depiction on screen.
Let us recall Indy’s cinematic debut in 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark. The opening sequence shows Indy in South America, searching for a Golden Idol worshipped and protected by the (fictional) Indigenous Hovitos people. Following in the footsteps of previous expeditions, he reaches a temple hidden in the jungle. After unsuccessfully replacing the idol on an altar with a bag of sand, he has to escape as an ancient trap causes the entire hall to crumble.
Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark - The Golden Idol Watch on
While this is definitely not the proper way to conduct fieldwork, the underlying premise is accurate: Archaeological excavations often destroy the context they seek to understand.
Though not as cinematic as a booby trap’s wreckage, excavations are controlled, systematic destruction. That is why contemporary archaeologists meticulously document sites and use less invasive techniques such as ground-penetrating radar, which probes below ground without digging. Field archaeologists create detailed, written descriptions accompanied by drawings, photography and 3D scanning.
Archaeology’s destructive nature isn’t limited to remains beneath the surface. For instance, since the 19th century, conservators have tried to reconstruct the Athenian Acropolis to its classical Greek style. In the process, they have removed medieval and Ottoman structures, including houses, fortifications such as the so-called Frankish Tower and a mosque inside the Parthenon.
Archaeologists can punch Nazis … metaphorically
In the third movie, The Last Crusade, Indy searches for his kidnapped father, an eccentric medievalist played by Sean Connery. The senior Jones disappeared while looking for the Holy Grail, the cup Christ used during the Last Supper. During the journey, set in 1938, Indy discovers a Nazi lair in a castle and whispers, “Nazis. I hate these guys.” And indeed, brawling with the Nazis becomes a recurring activity for Indy on his pursuits.
As the trailer for Dial of Destiny reveals, these old villains return in a new revanchist form. Mads Mikkelsen’s Nazi character says, “Hitler made mistakes, and with this, I will correct them all.”
INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE | Official Trailer | Paramount Movies Watch on
In reality, historical sites and artifacts are often misused for political purposes. Representations of the past have been manipulated by leaders across political and ideological spectrums. But nationalist and far-right ideologies have been especially active in this regard due to their tendency to idealize an imagined past.
The intellectual and ideological training apparatus in the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (more commonly known as the Nazi Party) contained a specialized group for German prehistory. It was later incorporated into the interior ministry. The notorious SS also had a research and teaching unit for German heritage under the direct supervision of Heinrich Himmler, the man who later oversaw the Holocaust. The unit’s point was to subdue research and cultural policy. (Adolf Hitler himself was not concerned with the wartime destruction of monuments because, in his view, this opened an opportunity to erect new ones.)
The communist regimes in the former Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc are intriguing in this respect. According to the official ideological stance of the party, Marxism was the sole acceptable reading of the past. Archaeology was tasked with the promotion of cultural unity among the communist nations, leading to an explosion of studies into Slavic heritage.
In my home country, Bulgaria, former leaders expected archaeologists to find fodder for nativist propaganda. During the first decades of communism, the government emphasized Bulgaria’s Slavic ethnic background to blend its citizens with other nations under Soviet domination. Archaeologists were tasked with finding evidence that most of the medieval population was Slavic. Then, starting in the 1970s, the leadership reappropriated a nomadic Bulgar heritage. They thought that because Bulgars migrated from the Eastern European steppe, this origin could showcase the close ties between Bulgaria and the USSR.
History was also exploited in the political preparation for Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. Seven months prior to the invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin personally published an essay arguing for the historical unity of Russia and Ukraine.
As even Indy becomes the target of persecution at some point (in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), the films allude to the complex realities of scholarship in unfree societies. To metaphorically punch Nazis and other extremists, archaeology must understand the field’s political implications and expose the biases encoded in representations of the past.
Not everything belongs in a museum
In 1984’s The Temple of Doom, Indy finds himself searching for a sacred stone stolen from the shrine of a village in India. The trio of Indy; his romantic interest, Wilhelmina “Willie” Scott; and his self-appointed assistant, Short Round, must face the evil Thuggee cult to retrieve the valuable item.
Eventually, Indiana returns the Sivalinga stone to the village residents. Their religious leader says, “Now you see the merit of the rock you bring back.”
The protagonist agrees: “Yes. I understand its power now.”
A minute later, Willie asks why he did not keep it, to which Indiana replies, “What for? They’d just put it in a museum, and it’d be another rock collecting dust.”
INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM | Official Trailer | Paramount Movies Watch on
This may seem like quite the step for a character who has said other items considered antiquities belong in museums. His seemingly inconsistent stance reflects the often fraught relationship among archaeologists, museum collections and communities.
Yes, museums are key institutions for heritage management and protection. But protecting and promoting heritage requires the inclusion of broader communities.
This is not a new idea in academic archaeology. In the 1950s, archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler expressed “the moral and academic necessity of sharing scientific work to the fullest possible extent with the man in the street and in the field.”
Considering the problematic origins of many museum collections and the ongoing repatriation requests made by various nations and Indigenous groups, Indy’s realization conveys the fundamental concerns of public archaeology. Controversial collections store sacred objects such as the Mijikenda vigango statues and the human remains of Indigenous ancestors.
The fictional Indian village presents a very real situation. The local community holds the knowledge for the protection of its culture. Archaeologists and anthropologists, being cross-cultural communicators by craft, have a role to play and can support such communal efforts. Indy seems to get this when he returns the Sivalinga. (Though in a more critical take, I, like writer Cathleen Luo, would discuss the underlying white savior trope in the movie.)
There are many nuances to the Indiana Jones story. As I see it, the films express the important role and responsibilities granted to archaeology by the public. Despite some misrepresentations, the movies show that, at its best, archaeology can be community-oriented work that unites people and heritage.
At the very least, the real field and the films can be a lot of fun.

,Why Harrison Ford never uses the word 'hero' to describe his characters,"Sorry to Indiana Jones, Han Solo, and Jack Ryan: Harrison Ford says he doesn't ""use the word hero at all"" to describe the many characters he's played. Here's why.","Indiana Jones can be called a lot of things — professor of archeology, expert on the occult, obtainer of rare antiquities — but hero is not one of them. At least, according to the man who plays him.
""I don't use the word hero at all, because I think it starts us off in the wrong direction,"" Harrison Ford tells EW of how he has approached playing the character. ""For years and years and years, I've been saying I want to play an ordinary person [in] extraordinary circumstances, who happens to behave well for the benefit of others.""
Ford plays the beloved (but not heroic!) fedora-wearing, whip-cracking character for a fifth (and he swears final) time in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, in theaters Friday. It's the first film in the franchise — which also includes 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark, 1984's Temple of Doom, 1989's Last Crusade, and 2008's Kingdom of the Crystal Skull — to not be directed by Steven Spielberg. Ford v Ferrari helmer James Mangold directs instead. Getting to work with the 80-year-old Ford and watch him craft the iconic character was a unique experience for Mangold.
""It's interesting, doing what I do, you meet leading men or movie stars or legends, and for many of them, there's an idea about how their brand works or what their audience wants — and there's a kind of hyper-awareness about being a hero,"" explains the director. ""For Harrison, it's much more like working with a leading man who thinks of himself as a character actor. What I mean by that is, he wants to get under his character's skin and expose as many of his frailties or liabilities or neuroses as much as his capabilities.""
""He's not interested in just creating a kind of hero,"" Mangold adds. ""He's interested in creating a person filled with foibles and tics who just happens to be handsome and dashing and a world globetrotter.""

When EW later asks Ford about his thoughts on his director's words, he jokes, ""Well, I'm good with it, up to the point where you get to the handsome and dashing part."" The rest of it he's okay with, though.
""You look for the details of your character, which may bring further expression and familiarity to the audience. And I don't mean familiarity with the actor, I mean with the character,"" Ford admits. ""But the job of an actor in playing a character is to tell the story through the behavior of his character, and so the more details you can bring to that character, the more full the story is.""

,Harrison Ford on getting older and seeing Indiana Jones ‘rally for one last adventure’,"""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" actor Harrison Ford talks about getting older and more.","Harrison Ford isn’t letting age get in the way.
The actor, 80, who will return as the legendary hero archaeologist in “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” said in an interview with People that he enjoys “making movies more now than I ever did.”
“I saw a lot of great actors having fun, so I thought, ‘Hey, I want some of this!’” he said.

Along with “Dial of Destiny,” Ford has starred in several shows recently, including “Shrinking” and “1923.”
When it comes to his age, Ford says that he embraces the idea of getting older.
“I don’t want to be young again,” he said. “I was young, and now I enjoy being old.”
“You are certainly physically diminished by age but there are wonderful things about age -- richness of experience, the full weight of all the time you’ve been spending getting to being old -- and there's a certain ease in it for me,” he added.

With “Dial of Destiny” out in theaters soon, Ford also reflected on why he wanted to return as Indiana Jones for the franchise’s fifth installment.
“I just wanted to see him rally for one last adventure,” he said.
A synopsis for the film says that the movie will follow Indiana Jones as he races against time to retrieve a legendary artifact that can change the course of destiny.
Ford stars alongside Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Ethann Isidore and Shaunette Renée Wilson in the film.

,Harrison Ford Describes 'Complicated' Experience Making 'The Devil's Own' with Brad Pitt,"Harrison Ford opened up in a new interview about the ""complicated"" experience he had working on The Devil's Own with Brad Pitt","Harrison Ford is recalling why his 1997 thriller The Devil's Own was such a ""complicated"" movie to make.
In a new interview with Esquire, the Star Wars alum revealed that at one point in filming the movie with costar Brad Pitt, they ""didn’t have a script that Brad and I agreed on."" The film centers on an IRA gunman (Pitt) who draws an American family into the crossfire of terrorism.
“Brad developed the script. Then they offered me the part. I saved my comments about the character and the construction of the thing — I admired Brad,"" Ford, 80, said. ""First of all, I admire Brad. I think he’s a wonderful actor. He’s a really decent guy. But we couldn’t agree on a director until we came to Alan Pakula, who I had worked with before but Brad had not.""
Ruven Afanador
""Brad had this complicated character, and I wanted a complication on my side so that it wasn’t just a good-and-evil battle,"" he continued. ""And that’s when I came up with the bad-shooting thing.”
The ""bad-shooting thing"" was a scene in the movie where Ford's police officer character sees his partner participate in an illegal shooting. As Ford explained, he ""worked with a writer"" for the scene, but he and Pitt, 59, couldn't come to an agreement on how things would go.
""Each of us had different ideas about it. I understand why he wanted to stay with his point of view, and I wanted to stay with my point of view—or I was imposing my point of view, and it’s fair to say that that’s what Brad felt,"" Ford shared.
""It was complicated. I like the movie very much. Very much.”
Ruven Afanador
The film itself, which was directed by Alan J. Pakula, ended up earning $140 million worldwide. It also starred Margaret Colin, Treat Williams, Rubén Blades and Natascha McElhone.
Elsewhere in his interview with Esquire, Ford revealed why he hasn't gotten around to writing an autobiography covering his storied career. As he explained, Elton John once asked him why he hadn't written the book yet.
“I said, ‘I thought about it, but I decided I’m not going to do it, because I didn’t want to tell the truth,’ ” Ford said. “And I saw the disappointment on his face—Elton’s a pretty genuine guy, you know. I wanted to mollify him, so I said, ‘But I didn’t want to lie, either.’""
""So that’s the reason I’m not writing a book: because I don’t want to tell the truth, and I don’t want to lie.”
Ruven Afanador
Ford's latest film Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, marks his ""most emotional"" performance, according to some critics. The actor, who first played the role in 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark, opened up about retiring the character during a press conference this month.
""Is it not evident? I need to sit down and rest a little bit. I love to work, and I love this character, and I love what it brought into my life, and that's all I can say,"" he said, adding that he ""wanted to round up the story"" with this new installment.
""Everything has come together to support me in my old age, and I love the work. So I just want to work and I want to tell stories, good stories, and I have been so lucky in my life to have that opportunity.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9oYXJyaXNvbi1mb3JkLW9uLWNvbXBsaWNhdGVkLW1vdmllLWZpbG1pbmctd2l0aC1icmFkLXBpdHQtNzUwNzU2N9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

During an interview with Variety, he explained why he won’t make another Indiana Jones film following Indiana Jones and the Dial of the Destiny.
“I’m not interested,” he explained. “I refuse. I just can’t do it… The amount of lore and Easter eggs and fan service starts to become antithetical to any of this stuff at a certain point. It isn’t storytelling anymore. It’s large-scale advertising.”

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny marks the long-awaited return of Harrison Ford to his now-iconic role. However, it’s unlikely he’ll be back for another film.
“This is the final film in the series, and this is the last time I'll play the character,” said Ford. “I anticipate that it will be the last time that he appears in a film.”
Ford added he is aware Disney and Lucasfilm are exploring an Indiana Jones TV series for Disney+, but stressed he will “not be involved in that if it does come to fruition"".
However, there’s one character who’s already tipped to carry on the franchise, and it’s not Indy — it’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s character, Helena Shaw. Essentially, she’s the catalyst for the events that unfold in The Dial of Destiny and as Indy’s goddaughter, it makes sense to keep the franchise alive with the adventures of one of his kin.
Indiana Jones producer Kathleen Kennedy admitted it’s “entirely possible” a Helena Shaw movie could happen… but not yet. “We’re not having any of those conversations right now,” she added. “We’re just focused on finishing this with Harrison.” Either way, it looks as though both Mangold and Ford won’t be back for another Indy movie.
IGN’s review of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny gave it 4/10 and said: “Earnest final efforts from Harrison Ford and John Williams couldn’t rescue a movie so directionless and haphazard, or action that fails to recapture the swashbuckling joys of the originals. By asking why Indy is on this adventure in the first place, and what the character gains on the other side of it, Dial of Destiny concocts paradoxical answers that fail to meet in the middle.”

2023-06-09 19:33:00+00:00,How to Watch the 'Indiana Jones' Movies in Order,"Here's where you can watch all of the Indiana Jones movies in order, from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' to 'Dial of Destiny'.","Indiana Jones is back for his last crusade—not to be confused with The Last Crusade, which was, in fact, not the last crusade. Forty-two years after the release of the first movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Harrison Ford is picking up Indiana Jones' whip and donning his hat one final time in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which debuts in theaters June 30.
The Dial of Destiny is the fifth Indiana Jones movie in the franchise following 1981's Raiders, 1984's Temple of Doom, 1989's Last Crusade, and 2008's Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Whether you've seen all of the movies and want to catch up before checking out Dial of Destiny or count Indiana Jones as one of your pop culture blindspots, it's a good time to check out these iconic films. (Well, at least the first three were iconic...)
The first four movies are all available to stream online and the fifth is hitting theaters, so all that's left to do is decide where you want to start. Here's where you can watch all five Indiana Jones movies.
Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)
The first Indiana Jones movie follows the archeologist and adventurer as he tries to keep the powerful Ark of the Covenant out of the hands of Nazi forces in the 1930s. The movie also introduces love interest Marion (Karen Allen) and colleague Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), who both went on to appear in future Indiana Jones movies.

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)
Temple of Doom is actually a prequel, set one year before the events in Raiders of the Lost Ark. In this film, Indiana Jones travel to India where his mission is to rescue children who have been put into slavery while also trying to locate sacred stones. Jones' sidekick in his film is a young boy called Short Round, played by recent Oscar winner Ke Huy Quan. Temple of Doom is also the most controversial of the Indiana Jones movies due, in part, to its depiction of Indian culture.
STREAM ON PLUTO TV
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)
The Last Crusade was originally going to be the final Indiana Jones movie. This time, the archeologist sets out to free his father, who has been kidnapped by Nazis while searching for the Holy Grail. Jones' father is played by Sean Connery, while a young version of Jones is portrayed by River Phoenix.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)
Nearly 20 years after The Last Crusade, Indiana Jones returned to the big screen with Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. For this adventure, Jones is once against joined by Marion and also by their son, Mutt (Shia LaBeouf). With this movie being set in the late 1950s during the Cold War, the enemy is now Soviet Russia. Cate Blanchett plays a Soviet villain.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023)
This brings us to the new movie, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Despite the 2008 movie adding Jones' son to the mix, LaBeouf is not part of this final installment. Instead, Jones is joined by his goddaughter, played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge as they search for an ancient dial amid the backdrop of the Vietnam War and Space Race—this one is set in 1969. Directed by James Mangold, it's the first Indiana Jones movie not directed by Steven Spielberg.
But will it be the last? Well, it's much more certain that this is Indy's actual last crusade. ""This is the final film in the series, and this is the last time I’ll play the character,"" 80-year-old Ford told Total Film. ""I anticipate that it will be the last time that he appears in a film."" Can't get much clearer than that!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc21vcG9saXRhbi5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tb3ZpZXMvYTQ0MTM4NjM3L2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtbW92aWVzLWluLW9yZGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-29 16:45:59+00:00,Dune: Part 2 Trailer Sees Zendaya and Timothee Chalamet Prepare for War,The sci-fi sequel is one of a handful of key year-end Warner Bros. theatrical releases,"The second trailer for “Dune: Part Two” arrives presumably in time to play with opening weekend showings of “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” meaning there will absolutely be time for a third sell between now and mid-November. This sweeping, very serious 184-second sell promises mass battle scenes, epic confrontations, new characters played by Austin Butler, Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken as well as plenty of handwringing as to whether Paul Atreides’s destiny is to become a chosen one closer to Harry Potter or Anakin Skywalker.
Legendary’s shot-on-Imax film, opening courtesy of Warner Bros. Discovery on Nov. 3, will be the second half of a two-part theatrical adaptation of Frank Herbert’s first 500-page tome. It will again feature Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya alongside franchise vets who survived the first film, like Javier Bardem, Rebecca Ferguson, Dave Bautista and Josh Brolin.
The film, again directed by Denis Villeneuve and adapted for the screen by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts, will essentially kick off the year-end holiday blitz all the way through New Year’s Day. While the first picture was unofficially anointed as a savior of high-toned, prestige blockbuster cinema in October of 2021, this sequel will face comparatively more competition from Marvel’s “The Marvels” and Lionsgate’s “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,” in November and Warner Bros. and Chalemat’s own “Wonka” and Warner Bros.’ own “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” in December.
The first “Dune” earned rave reviews and won six Oscars while grossing $110 million domestically and $402 million worldwide. Sans COVID-related variables, and whatever lost viewership occurred due to concurrent HBO Max availability in North America, that might have been a disappointing figure for a $165 million sci-fi epic.
However, the film was seen as a commercial success, over the long term, with the hope that the sequel would build on that gross due to the first film’s relative popularity and a return to more conventional theatrical windows. Whether the film would have earned more in non-COVID and non-Project Popcorn times is an open question, as the likes of “The Conjuring 3” ($197 million) and “Godzilla vs. Kong” ($470 million) earned on par with or better than what might have been expected in conventional circumstances.
On the plus side, history shows that the halfway decent “part II” of a well-received “part I” will out-earn its predecessor. Think “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” “The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn” or the last two “Avengers” movies. That’s also good news for the two-part finales, both beginning this summer, of “Fast and the Furious” and “Mission: Impossible.”
However, “Dune Part II” is not the finale of a long-running cinematic saga, but rather just a very long book that was divided into two long movies. There isn’t a lot of cinematic precedent for a franchise beginning with a two-part saga, which will also make this film’s performance a test case for Universal’s two-part, Jon M. Chu-directed “Wicked.”
Considering the extent to which Warner Bros. Discovery is being watched with a microscope at the moment, the theatrical departments have a grand opportunity to end the year on a high note if “Wonka,” “Dune: Part Two,” “The Color Purple” and “Aquaman 2” all deliver something approaching best-case-scenario critical and commercial theatrical receptions.
Heck, if “Barbie” lives up to the hype next month and “The Nun 2” plays closer to “The Conjuring 2” than “The Conjuring 3,” well, the most important message WBD’s theatrical divisions can project is that they are more than just Batman and Harry Potter. Paul Atreides may be as pure a hero for the Fremen as hoped, but he could be one of a handful of saviors for Warner Bros. Discovery.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL2R1bmUtcGFydC10d28tdHJhaWxlci16ZW5kYXlhLXRpbW90aGVlLWNoYWxhbWV0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Harrison Ford has addressed archival footage that shows him stapling his Indiana Jones hat to his head during production for the first 1981 film, Raiders of the Lost Ark.
When asked about the “incredible” clip in a new video interview with GQ, the 80-year-old actor nonchalantly replied: “You do what you need to do.”
Brushing aside the front of his hair, he noted: “I still have the [scar].”
In the behind-the-scenes video, Ford can be seen unflinchingly securing his archaeologist’s iconic pinch-front fedora to his forehead with three staples before saying: “That should do it.”
The actor, who has portrayed the beloved character across all five of the films, stapled the hat to his head to prevent it from flying off while filming action scenes.
Ford went on to discuss the rest of Indy’s costume – a leather jacket and a bullwhip – saying that “it was presented to me as an aspect of character in the first film”.
“My questions about it were many,” he recalled. “Why am I wearing a leather jacket in the jungle? Isn’t it hot here? Why am I carrying a whip? What am I going to do with a f***ing whip? I’m going to whip people?”

The Star Wars actor remembers being told that the getup was “an evocation of a time, a period. A reflection of movies past”.
“I said ‘OK’, and that makes it my own,” Ford explained.
Ford reprises his legendary role for the final time in the film series’s fifth instalment, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
In it, his titular daredevil archaeologist must race against time to retrieve a magical dial with the ability to change the course of history.

Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Mads Mikkelsen make their Indiana Jones debut, respectively, as Indy’s goddaughter Helena Shaw and the dastardly ex-Nazi Jürgen Voller.
Since the movie’s cinematic release in June, several viewers have been left stumped by a “major” plot hole.
In a three-star review of the film for The Independent, Geoffrey Macnab wrote: “Tonally, the film wavers. It pulls in too many different directions at once. On the one hand, this is an exercise in affectionate nostalgia.
“On the other, like its predecessors, it’s an old-fashioned matinee adventure in which characterisation is deliberately broad. Certain episodes are knowing and ironic, while others seem painfully naive.”

Where to Watch: In theaters
Dial of Destiny, set twelve years later, reverses course from Cold War-era Russian antagonists by alluding to Operation Paperclip – the secret program that recruited Nazi scientists to work for the American aerospace industry after WWII. In this way, even though it’s set in the era of the Space Race, Indiana Jones is once again back to punching Nazis.
While some may find it far-fetched watching a 70-year-old man survive bone-cracking jolts in car chases, explosions, and deep-sea dives, it’s important to remember that Indiana Jones is essentially a cartoon character… created by George Lucas in homage to the serialized radio plays of his childhood. In spite of its stylized nature, this film still manages to take the character of Indiana Jones and his age seriously, using the opportunity to lean into his career as a professor and the toll such a life of adventuring has had.
While it would have been easy to lean in to the Hollywood standard of packing the script with every possible reference to past films, the screenwriters had the appropriate amount of restraint and allowed this story to pay homage to Indy’s past while also telling its own narrative not reliant on nostalgia. It’s difficult to say much without spoiling the third act of the film, but needless to say the filmmakers have done a fantastic job of sending off one of the most iconic characters of American cinematic history.

In Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the first Indiana Jones film in fifteen years, the fifth film in the long running action-adventure franchise mostly takes place in the year 1969. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is struggling with approaching retirement and embracing old age.
In 1944, Indy and Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) were able to track down and retrieve a dial that was constructed by Archimedes and allows its user the ability to travel through time.
Half of the dial has been sitting in Indy’s college archives for at least a decade and the other half is hidden away somewhere that the film spends the majority of its 154-minute runtime searching for.
Basil’s daughter, Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) who is also Indy’s goddaughter, is reunited with Indy, but it’s bittersweet. She intends to sell the dial on the black market. Also chasing after the dial is a Nazi named Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen).
Voller eats a giant metal pole to the face in 1944 and re-emerges with a group of Nazi hitmen surprisingly unscathed. Voller intends to use the dial to go back to 1939, kill Hitler, and lead Germany to victory during World War II.
Harrison Ford just turned 81 and was 79 while filming The Dial of Destiny. Ford should be given some credit because he is quite active as an older actor doing far more on screen than you’d likely expect.
The scenes that required Ford to look younger are troublesome though. While Lucasfilm basically used deepfake technology to scour old footage of Ford from previous films, the result is as clunky as it is impressive.
The more you see “young” Indy the more it just looks like a digital face replacement. The shots from the trailer and the shots that don’t have Ford moving his head much are where the effect looks its best, but in standard motion and action sequences the more it just looks like a different head on someone else’s body. The opening sequence in 1944 seriously feels like a deleted scene from one of the Uncharted video games.
The 1969 action sequences are a different breed of ugly animal. Stuntmen for Ford wore Harrison Ford masks during action sequences and while the masks are arguably high quality, they show zero facial expression resulting in Indy looking deathly constipated or heavily confused.
Written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, David Koepp, and director James Mangold, The Dial of Destiny feels like an Indiana Jones film in tone and is this huge time traveling adventure with a thrillingly nostalgic score from score composer John Williams, but the film is overwhelmingly boring. At two and a half hours, the movie is bulky with how much story there is. Nobody ever stops talking and it feels like a chase for a time traveling device is purposely made more complicated.
Jez and John-Henry Butterworth worked with James Mangold on Ford v. Ferrari and co-wrote Edge of Tomorrow while David Koepp co-wrote the first Mission: Impossible, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and the 2017 version of The Mummy that simultaneously started and destroyed Universal’s plans for their Dark Universe.
The script was rewritten once James Mangold took over the reigns as director from Steven Spielberg in 2020. Harrison Ford claimed that they took out all the jokes pertaining to Indy’s old age, but Indy still gripes about being old in the finished product.
He’s dealing with retirement; he’s separated from Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen in the worst “surprise” cameo ever) because Mutt died in the Vietnam War and the two of them never got over it, and he’s coming to terms with the fact that he can’t travel, explore, or be as expeditious as he used to be.
It’s odd that as much as the writers attempted to distance themselves from referencing Indy’s age, The Dial of Destiny still has a prominent aging aspect to it with a heavy emphasis on hindsight.
The only member of the on-screen cast that seems to be enjoying themselves is Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Harrison Ford looks constantly irritated and seems pissed that they’d even want his shell of a body to return.
Mads Mikkelsen, who is normally superb in just about everything, is dull and forgettable as Voller as the character seems like a watered down and less interesting version of Le Chiffre from Casino Royale. The most interesting thing about Voller is his motivation as Mikkelsen’s performance heavily involves him standing or sitting while acting superior to everyone.
There’s also Helena’s little pickpocket sidekick Teddy (Ethann Isidore). While Helena and Teddy seemingly have a basic desire to steal everything from everyone to sell it all and get rich, Teddy mostly feels like a modern yet Wish version of Short Round.
All the humor in the film feels forced and falls flat, especially throwbacks and homage to previous Indiana Jones film entries. Indy and Helena gripe and moan at each other the entire film. Indy hasn’t seen her in years, and she felt abandoned after her father passed, so there’s a lot of bitterness. It’s not unwarranted, but it also isn’t entertaining.
The Verdict
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny feels like the type of sequel that aimed to capture the magic of its predecessors, had worthwhile intentions, and a talented cast, but it just never properly materialized. The film seems to teeter on the sheer annoyance of a main character grappling with the fact that he’s now a crotchety and wrinkly senior citizen and not the young, grizzled, adventurer he used to be.
With an ending that leaves the Indiana Jones character in a satisfying bookend for the franchise, hopefully The Dial of Destiny is the final Indy film. Like Roger Murtaugh in Lethal Weapon, Harrison Ford is literally too old for this sh*t.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL2JvdW5kaW5naW50b2NvbWljcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8xMy9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LXJldmlldy1hLWNhbnRhbmtlcm91cy1zZXF1ZWwtdGhhdC1kcm93bnMtaW4taGluZHNpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,James Mangold's scrapped Boba Fett movie did not include Baby Yoda,James Mangold says the original plan for his scrapped 'borderline rated R' Boba Fett movie did not include Grogu.,"James Mangold is revealing the initial plan for his scrapped Star Wars movie — and everybody's favorite character would not have been in it.
Back in 2018, it was announced that the Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director would be writing and directing a Boba Fett film. While the project later took on a new life and creative team as the Disney+ series The Book of Boba Fett, Mangold previewed his original, much darker pitch during a recent Happy Sad Confused interview.
""At the point I was doing it, I was probably scaring the s--- out of everyone, but I was probably making much more of a borderline rated-R, single-planet, spaghetti western,"" he said. ""The world would never be able to embrace Baby Yoda if I had made that, because he didn't really belong in the world I was kind of envisioning.""
While Mangold may have omitted Grogu from the project to protect the character's big, adorable eyeballs from its more adult-appropriate content, he explained that any forward movement on the film soon came to a halt ""in a moment of corporate realignment after whatever happened with the Han Solo movie,"" a reference to 2018's Solo: A Star Wars Story. He added, ""They just suddenly decided they weren't making pictures like that, and I think the opportunities in streaming presented themselves.""
Instead, Grogu wound up playing a large role in The Book of Boba Fett. The little Force user spent time alongside Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) before ultimately reuniting with his dad, Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal), at the end of the series.
Still, Mangold recalled his time penning the Star Wars script as a ""beautiful period"" in his life. ""I was just listening to Ennio Moricone all day, all night and typing away,"" he said. ""But I'm not sure it ever would've happened. I'm not sure it was in anyone's plans what I was thinking about.""

Although his Boba Fett spaghetti western dreams didn't come true, Mangold is set to return to the galaxy far, far away in the future. Earlier this year, news broke that he will direct an upcoming Star Wars film about the first Jedi to ever wield the Force.
And yes, that requires going even farther back in time than the previous trilogies. ""When I talk[ed] to some of the Star Wars clerics who keep track of all these timelines, I was like, 'So when would this have happened?' And they were like, 'Twenty-five thousand years before episode 1,'"" Mangold said. ""And I was like, 'Oh! I was looking for some distance, but that's distance.' But I'll do it!""
He went on to note that it was ""really important"" to him that the movie have a ""feeling of space"" and separation from past installments. ""Not to get away from, again, fan service or the intricacies of what George [Lucas] had set up or dreamed of,"" he explained, ""but to just have the space to tell a story and not be instantly encumbered with the bases you have to hit.""

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 18. It opened in theaters on June 30.
The MPAA rates the movie PG-13. According to their classification, the rating is due to “sequences of violence and action, language and smoking.” While the rating itself doesn’t add much to what can be expected in the fifth and final film, it is an interesting reminder that the second film of the franchise, “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,” was a main catalyst (alongside “Gremlins”) that led the MPAA to create the PG-13 classification in the first place.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” takes place in 1969, amidst the space race. Indiana Jones will encounter his old enemy, the Nazis, again. The antagonist, Voller, is a villain inspired by Wernher von Braun — a real Nazi who became a NASA engineer.
The teaser trailer and artwork for the film debuted in December. A second teaser for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” premiered during Super Bowl LVII.
Harrison Ford, now 80 years old, stated this will be his last “Indiana Jones” movie.
Before the film’s full title was announced, Empire shared behind-the-scenes photos and interviews with the cast last November.
“It’s full of adventure, full of laughs, full of real emotion. And it’s complex and it’s sneaky,” Ford said at the time. “The shooting of it was tough and long and arduous. But I’m very happy with the film that we have.”
It’s rumored that an Indiana Jones TV series could be in development for Disney+. It remains unclear if the storyline of this series would be a prequel to the films, set somewhere inside the franchise narrative, or following a totally new character rather than Henry Jones Jr. If this series is developed, it would not be the first TV show about Indiana Jones. In 1992-1993, “The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles” aired on ABC. Harrison Ford made a cameo appearance in one episode.

2023-06-23 09:44:52+00:00,Xbox admits Indiana Jones game was going to be on PS5 before Bethesda buyout,"The upcoming Indiana Jones game was meant to be multiplatform, but it was Bethesda that decided to make it Xbox only claims Microsoft.","As a reminder, the game has nothing to do with the newest Indiana Jones movie (Picture: Lucasfilm Ltd.)
The upcoming Indiana Jones game was meant to be multiplatform, but it was Bethesda that decided to make it Xbox only claims Microsoft.
It’s taken a while but the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)’s legal battle to halt the Microsoft Activision Blizzard deal has finally kicked off. Unsurprisingly, Microsoft is using the opportunity to keep presenting itself as a lowly underdog.
However, the court case looks set to reveal info Microsoft would’ve preferred to keep to itself. For starters, Bethesda’s upcoming Indiana Jones game is officially confirmed to be an Xbox exclusive, even though that wasn’t originally the idea.
This may sound obvious given Bethesda’s a Microsoft owned company, but it turns out the game was originally slated to be a multiplatform title and this changed following Microsoft’s buyout of Bethesda’s parent company Zenimax.
Bethesda’s head of publishing Pete Hines admits that Zenimax agreed to a deal with Disney to bring the Indiana Jones game to multiple platforms.
Said platforms aren’t specified, but it’s safe to assume that the PlayStation 5 would’ve been among them. However, post-Microsoft acquisition, the agreement was amended to make the game Xbox and PC only.
‘While it is not in our messaging, I think it is important to highlight that Lucasfilm brought up the issue of platforms because we have a signed agreement with them to develop the game for multiple consoles,’ reads an email between multiple executives, including Hines, Xbox boss Phil Spencer, and Xbox Game Studio head Matt Booty (as shared by IGN).
In January 2021, the same month the Indiana Jones game was announced, Spencer wrote, ‘The upside here is a game coming from Bethesda that everyone will be excited about. This is the most important thing. The downside for Xbox…is that a large percentage of output from Bethesda won’t directly benefit the Xbox community in any way.’
Apparently, Spencer did tell Hines that Bethesda should keep looking at console exclusivity for future titles on a case-by-case basis (something that was promised pre-acquisition). So, why was Indiana Jones made an exclusive?
Hines seems to suggest that this was done to help streamline development and save time since they’d only need to make the game for one console rather than two.
‘You’re dealing with a licensor who is giving a ton of feedback on what you’re making, is going to add a ton of time to your scheduling, these agreements, you don’t get to take as long as you want, you have a window of time in which you’re going to release a game, you immediately have a clock that’s ticking on you,’ he says.
He adds that they also liked the idea of bringing Indiana Jones to Game Pass and seeing how many more players they could reach. Although the idea that they want to reach more players but not releasing it on the biggest format is patently absurd.
It’s clearly not a decision Bethesda would’ve made without being bought by Microsoft – no one leaves out a major format without a financial incentive – and it’s already been admitted that the original agreement with Disney was to make it a normal multiformat game.
Microsoft has repeatedly insisted that it has no interest in taking games away from rival platforms, yet this is clear evidence showing them doing the exact opposite. It isn’t even the first example. Redfall had a PlayStation 5 version in the works too until Microsoft bought Bethesda.
These two clear examples will no doubt be used as ammunition by Sony as to why they feel Microsoft can’t be trusted to keep Call Of Duty and other Activision Blizzard games multiformat, despite agreements to do so.
As for the Indiana Jones game itself, all that anyone knows about it is that it’s in development at Wolfenstein studio MachineGames. You’d think that an unveil to coincide with the new film Dial Of Destiny would make sense, but so far there’s been no clue as to when it will be revealed.

,Harrison Ford Grows Emotional as Indiana Jones Fan Thanks Him for the Franchise: 'Means the World to Me',"As Harrison Ford and his 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' costar Phoebe Waller-Bridge spoke with BBC Radio 1's Ali Plumb recently, the actor appeared to grow emotional as the journalist thanked him for his work on the beloved adventure franchise over the years","Harrison Ford is looking back on Indiana Jones' legacy ahead of his final film in the franchise.
While speaking with BBC Radio 1 during an interview published on Monday, Ford, 80, appeared to momentarily choke up as journalist Ali Plumb thanked the veteran actor for his contributions as the star of the long-running film series.
""Can I just say, on behalf of all the fans, thank you. It's been such an adventure, we love you so much. I don't want to make you blush or anything, but you mean the world to us,"" Plumb told Ford at the conclusion of his interview alongside costar Phoebe Waller-Bridge. ""Thank you, that's all I have to say.
“And I must say to you, thank you, sincerely,"" Ford responded. ""It means the world to me.”
Prior to the exchange, Plumb had asked Ford to speak to why he believes the franchise — which originated with 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark — has remained so successful and loved by fans over the years.
“Because of the talents of the screenwriters and directors and actors that have poured their hearts and souls into it,"" Ford told the outlet. ""And the experience that I had making these five films... the films are peopled with some of the most amazing actors and characters and the stories are so compelling and they mix adventure and humor and heart.”
The actor added that he admires ""the depth and the subtlety of the emotion, and the importance of emotion in these films.""

""As this one concerns age and frailty and changing nature of life, it was especially compelling to me because I am of that age and I wanted it to fell real for the audience,"" Ford said of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which will mark his final turn as the iconic bullwhip-wielding archaeologist. ""I wanted them to see the complexity of that experience with someone they spent 40 years with.”

While speaking with PEOPLE recently, the actor noted that he most often quotes 1997's Air Force One in his own day-to-day life rather than any of his iconic lines from Star Wars or the five Indiana Jones films.

""Because I fly, I probably say why more than I need to, 'Get off my plane!' "" Ford said, reciting his most famous line from the film.
Ford was honored with a Palme d’Or for lifetime achievement at the new Indiana Jones movie's world premiere at Cannes Film Festival last month, where he paused to take in the film industry and fans' affection for his work.
“I was just trying to keep myself composed,” he told PEOPLE recently. “There was very generous applause from the crowd [and] it was positive and humbling and nice.""

,Watch Harrison Ford roast Conan O'Brien on his own podcast,Harrison Ford makes fun of Conan for needing a written reminder that he played Han Solo in 'Star Wars.',"It takes guts to pick a fight with the man behind both Han Solo and Indiana Jones, but maybe it helps if you can't quite remember who he is.
During his guest appearance on Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend, Harrison Ford got into a playful argument with Conan O'Brien about his ancestry. To settle the disagreement, the host tried quoting directly from his research — only to get roasted by the eagle-eyed actor.
""I refer you to this piece of paper right here,"" O'Brien said. ""That says, 'Born and raised in Chicago to an Irish/German father—'""
Ford then interrupted with a brutal observation, pointing to the paper in O'Brien's hand: ""Well if that's a quality of your research, and I imagine it is because right there it says 'Harrison Ford' and then you had to write 'Han Solo.' You can't f---ing remember that?""
The comment earned plenty of laughter in the room from Conan's crew, but the host was quick with a retort of his own.
""No I can't. I can't remember Han Solo,"" O'Brien deadpanned. ""I wrote it down because I heard that you were in some of the Star Wars films and this was news to me because I've seen those films and I don't exactly think that you 'pop.'""
He added, ""I'm sorry. But I mean, I remember Chewbacca, I remember the bad guy with the black helmet and then… there's some people.""
It was Ford who scored the deathblow, however. ""How come you're not still on television?"" he asked.

Their impromptu battle of wits was likely no surprise to O'Brien, who recalled Harrison Ford bringing a very similar energy to prior talk show appearances.
""You came on my show many many times, on the Late Night show,"" O'Brien said at the start of their conversation. ""And over the years people would say, 'Who's one of your favorite guests?' And I would say, 'Harrison Ford, because he's so goddamn funny.'""
O'Brien continued, ""You are so hilariously funny and you tossed me around like a ragdoll, verbally, on these shows and they're some of my favorite segments of all time. You are a hilarious man and I've always loved being around you.""
In response to Conan's earnestness, the Star Wars actor recalled his Late Night appearances with a sarcastic retort: ""You guys wrote some great stuff,"" Ford said of O'Brien's team. ""I don't remember any of it.""

,Did Indiana Jones help or hurt archaeology?,Harrison Ford and archaeologists weigh in on the impact Dr. Jones has had on the discipline for more than 40 years.,"On June 30, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny will mark the final cinematic installment of the saga that began with 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark. Once again, the world’s most famous archaeologist—real or otherwise—may have many of his authentic counterparts rolling their eyes. The question worth asking is how many of the rest will be first in line for tickets?
First, here’s a parallel worth noting. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg has stated that he deeply regrets the demonisation of sharks following his 1975 movie Jaws. Many were hunted, and prejudices born. A 2015 study by academic Christopher Pepin-Neff described the public’s tendency to make impactful, fiction-informed assumptions about that film’s real-life counterpart as “The Jaws Effect.” But it’s a complex legacy: many shark scientists and conservationists credit the film with igniting a more benign fascination.
2:09
Spielberg may have more reasons to be sheepish. Thanks to the public response to his movies, geneticists have had to answer saucer-eyed questions about dinosaurs, DeLorean drivers all sit at the wheel of a time machine—and every archaeologist probably has a hat and a bullwhip tucked away somewhere.
‘Obtainer of rare antiquities’
However reminiscent his style is of early 20th century archaeologists such as Hiram Bingham, Henry Field, and Earl Halstead Morris, Indiana Jones doesn’t hang his hat on one historical figure. Designed in homage to TV action serials beloved of creator George Lucas—and with a lead character named after his dog—the franchise’s brand of roughshackle adventure won audience’s hearts to the tune of almost a billion dollars worldwide. It just so happened that its protagonist was a part-time professor of archaeology with a sideline in chasing ancient artifacts drenched in mystique—often, against a backdrop of brewing war, pursued by others with less museum-centred intentions.
(Related: A look at explorer Hiram Bingham, a real-life Indiana Jones.)
Those artifacts—amongst them the Holy Grail, the Ark of the Covenant, ‘good luck’ rocks crafted by Shiva, crystal skulls and the mysterious Dial of Destiny—occupy a grey area where history, religious mystique and creative license meet. Nevertheless, Indiana Jones accidentally seduced moviegoers to archaeology—and made more than a few think “gee, I’d like to do that.” Some are now all grown up and making discoveries around the world. But in a profession generally free of Nazis, booby traps and inter-dimensional civilizations, but newly awake to its colonial legacy—and with a lead character often likened to a profiteering grave-robber—is that a good thing?
Related: From royal rings to humble rocks, these mystical objects were believed to shape human history.
‘You call this archaeology?’
Indiana Jones himself isn’t convinced. “I… I don’t know. I guess we made archaeology look like fun,” Harrison Ford, 80, tells National Geographic down a bad phoneline when asked how he feels about his character inspiring a generation of archaeologists. “They’re great romps. Great adventures. But—and I mean this in the nicest possible way—I don’t take any personal [credit]. When I’m approached by someone who is an archaeologist, I’m always interested to hear what their experience was. I’m happy people have found work that fulfills them. But I think it’s a little bizarre.”
It's a sensible viewpoint; as an archaeologist “Dr. Jones” is a curious role model. He has questionable excavation methods. Turns up at digs packing a revolver and a whip. He rarely returns with the goods and is habitually caught up in all manner of chaos—from simple tank pileups to the detonation of nuclear weapons—despite his assertion that most archaeology is “done in a library.”
And yet, as Ford well knows, the character he has brought to life onscreen for more than 40 years has become quite the mascot. In 2008, the actor was even honored by the venerable Archaeological Institute of America with the Bandelier Award—with then-president Brian Rose, a professor of archaeology at the University of Pennsylvania, praising Ford’s “significant role in stimulating the public’s interest in archaeological exploration.”
Despite Indiana Jones’s evident real-word resonance, Ford is maybe a little reluctant to place any greater depth on his character than was ever intended. “I think in the original film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, we were working with the notion that we were making a B-movie. It was fun, it was bold. But there wasn’t a terrible sophistication to it all,” he says. “I’ve always said these films are more about movies than they are about anything else. These are adventures, they’re imaginations. What I like most about him is the pleasure we’re able to give the audience.”

Ford admits he does personally “like antiquities, things that inform us of the past, things that are beautifully made.” Of the conversation around artefact restitution, he says he’s “aware of the issues… [that] there have been some inequities [around] how items are collected, and who they belong to. I’m pleased to see the movement now to return these artifacts to their original cultures.”
When asked what the most precious thing he’s ever held is, however, he says simply: “a newborn baby.”
‘X never, ever marks the spot’
As journalist Marilyn Johnson wrote in her book Lives in Ruins, “every archaeologist I interviewed worked Indiana Jones into the conversation, usually with affection, as if mentioning a daredevil older brother.”
However, “there is a real distinction between the archaeologists’ embrace of Indiana Jones’s style—and all the priceless publicity that character gave the profession—and of his methodology,” Johnson tells National Geographic in an email. “It’s astonishing that a profession dedicated to mostly painstaking field and lab work has such a swashbuckling image.”
Thanks to this, modern archaeologists often find themselves shoehorned into an Indiana Jones-shaped frame of reference. Johnson mentions classical archaeologist Joan Breton Connelly, known as ‘Indiana Joan’ at the Explorer’s Club; biomolecular archaeologist Patrick McGovern is ubiquitously known as the ‘Indiana Jones of ancient ales, wines, and extreme beverages.’ There is also an Indiana Jones of the art world, of deep sea exploration, economics and photography—suggesting any occupation can have its “Indiana Jones Effect.”
Plus, as with sharks and Jaws, before people saw a fictional archaeologist in action most didn’t really have an opinion at all.
“When the films were first released there was a disconnect between what the public perceived as the work of archaeologists and the actual work they were undertaking,” says Janina Ramirez, a Research Fellow in history of art at the University of Oxford and presenter of BBC series Raiders of the Lost Past. “I’m sure some students signed up to study the subject thinking it would involve glamorous travel, potential wealth and excitement.”
Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.
Ramirez remembers after seeing the first Indiana Jones movie she “immediately tracked down my local archaeology club, and a lifelong obsession with the past was born,” adding that the influence of the franchise on a generation cannot be underestimated. “The films tapped into the intrinsic thrill that discovery brings,” she says. “I have been fortunate enough to be on digs where major finds are made. That these moments still grab headlines and generate fascination in the public is what underlines the success of Indiana Jones.”
(Related: 13 pictures that capture the wonder and thrill of archaeology.)
But does the association do it any harm? As Ramirez says, “while archaeology attempts to be a scientific and fact-based discipline, it requires imagination, storytelling, and world-building. If a film character can bring the subject to life through similar techniques, then it can't be all bad.”
‘It belongs in a museum!’
That said, what we see of Jones’s work isn’t hugely successful. The idol of the Chachapoyan warriors is pilfered by a rival; the Holy Grail is swallowed by the Earth, the crystal skull disappears back ‘into the space between spaces.’ The Ark of the Covenant, meanwhile, is spirited away by the U.S. government—the ancient relic from a faraway land wheeled into a temple-sized warehouse stockpiled high with anonymous boxes of God-knows-what from who-knows-where. This, the sprawling final shot from 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark hits somewhat differently these days. But still, the colonial-smelling attitude hasn’t aged well in today’s climate of awareness concerning the provenance of antiquities. You could argue that’s down to the period in which the films are set—Johnson says that “setting the [earlier] Indiana Jones movies in the 1930s gave Indy license to be bad.” But as far as the character’s personal fortune and glory goes the results rarely justify the means.
So, if it’s not his methods, or his motivations, is the appeal of Indiana Jones something less obvious—and more portable through changing times?
“Stories through all cultures have profound impacts on how we see the world, and our possibilities,” says Albert Lin, a scientist, explorer and presenter of National Geographic’s Lost Cities with Albert Lin. “For me, growing up with stories like Indiana Jones, or Dances with Wolves, even reading National Geographic… those stories were a window into a bigger world. This belief in wonder, in adventure. That out there’s some hidden city in the jungles, or some story of a mythical land. It wasn’t until I got to my Ph.D and someone said to me ‘hey—there actually is a lot of unknown.’ Ever since then, my life has felt like it’s a weird mirror to Indiana Jones.”
Speaking to National Geographic over Zoom, Lin is covered with bites from his latest expedition to Guatemala, where he found himself climbing into the tomb of an ancient Mayan king and being confronted with ancient glyphs revealing clues to an origin city that has never been found. There were crocodiles and scorpions involved, along with local rumors of a massive anaconda. But his own parallels aside, Lin—whose work with technologies such as Lidar has earned him the moniker ‘Indiana Jones 2.0’—is convinced the appeal resonates beyond the literal. “The fact that Indiana Jones makes anyone who watches it feels like there’s wonder and adventure to be had out there is a very good thing. Because that’s a deep part of who we are as humans. We are explorers. And there is a frontier of exploration that still exists. And as fantastical as those stories may be, there are realities—various tracks of reality—where they can become real.”
Harrison Ford and the climate crusade
For Ford, who in The Dial of Destiny is rounding off one of the longest tenures one actor has played a character on the big screen, becoming Dr. Jones isn’t hard. “I put on the clothes. The character just comes with it,” he says. “It’s an easy fit for me. I understand him, his relationship to the stories that we tell. And I like those stories.”The treasure at the end of Ford’s own adventure story isn’t in doubt. “I found it. It’s nature. With all its mystery and complexity. That’s the thing we should be protecting. Healthy nature is the greatest treasure of all and the one we’re most in danger of losing.”
It’s a sentiment he can back up. Ford has held the position of Vice Chair of Conservation International since 1991—and contributed to the documentary series Years of Living Dangerously, which saw the actor harangue Indonesia’s Minister for Forestry after witnessing illegal palm oil operations. The ‘confrontation’ became a diplomatic incident and the actor was threatened with deportation. In 2018, his thunderous speech at the UN Global Climate Action summit—in which he pleaded the assembled changemakers to ‘stop, for God’s sake, the denigration of science’—practically shook the floor.
“I suppose I did get wound up. I’m passionate about it,” Ford says. Predictably, many articles concerning Ford’s philanthropy on the global stage namechecked a certain unconventional archaeologist—though none took the bait to suggest that the ‘Indiana Jones of conservation’ may actually be Indiana Jones.
“I think there’s a lot of me in every character I play,” Ford says, on whether he feels any kinship with his fictional alter ego. “We have some things in common, Indy and I. An interest in how the world works. A love of puzzles and mysteries. A belief in the goodness of humankind.”

,Explore the world like Indiana Jones at these 11 destinations,"From Petra to Glasgow to a few surprising film locations, Hollywood’s favorite archaeologist inspired a generation of adventurers.","The line that perhaps best sums up Indiana Jones is delivered deadpan, midway through 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark. Battered, bruised, and weary, the archaeologist-adventurer says: “It’s not the years… It’s the mileage.”
Five films and 42 years later, that mileage has seriously racked up. Aside from fedoras and Harrison Ford, one of the franchise’s now iconic visual hallmarks is a map—a red line scrolling across seas and continents as Dr. Jones excavates, romances, and punches his way across the world by boat, plane, bike, or submarine.
The character’s last cinematic crack of the whip, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is now set to inspire a new generation of adventurers—that is, if previous installments are anything to go by.
“Imagine how less wondrous things might be if you didn’t feel like there was a world of adventure and discovery beyond your building or the streets of your city?” says Albert Lin, a National Geographic Explorer, scientist, and presenter of Lost Cities with Albert Lin. “When I was a kid growing up with Indiana Jones, you saw those different worlds. And these places are really out there. There is a city built into the walls of cliffs in Jordan. There are mummies in the mountains of Peru. There are chambers under the desert in Egypt.”
But some of the locations—most, in fact—across the five-film series aren’t quite where they appear. Politics, logistics, and the complications of shooting required some innovative location scouting. The result is a trail of often unlikely destinations across the planet.
Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)
The “jungles of Peru” were actually filmed on United States soil on Kauai, Hawaii. Kalalea Mountain provided the very first shot in the drama. Other locations around Huleia National Wildlife Refuge and the historic Kipu Ranch near Puhi stood in for the territory of the Chachapoyan warriors.

The Egyptian street scenes—including that famous non-starter of a sword fight—were filmed in the Tunisian city of Kairouan (“little Cairo”), famous for its carpet making and historic mosque.

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)
The Club Obi Wan (a nod to Lucasfilm’s other franchise) wasn’t in Shanghai, as billed—nor was it on a studio backlot. The monsoon- and neon-soaked streets that host the opening scenes of Dr. Jones’s sophomore outing were actually in Macau, the island often referred to as the “Las Vegas of Asia.” Resplendent with flamboyant architecture and a glitzy gambling culture, Macau became a Special Administrative Region of China in 1999 after almost 500 years as a Portuguese colony.
Although set in India, The Temple of Doom shifted production south to Sri Lanka, due to sensitivities around potential cultural stereotyping (a criticism upheld by modern viewers). A tea plantation near the island country’s central city of Kandy was transformed into the rural village depicted in the film, which has since become the site of the Ceylon Tea Museum. The climactic rope bridge scene was filmed near the Victoria Dam on the Mahaweli River—a location today very much off the beaten track.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)
First glimpsed, as in the movie, through the Siq—a sandstone gorge—the resplendent Al-Khazneh (The Treasury) in Jordan’s ancient rock city of Petra exudes majesty and mystery. Historians believe this cliff-cut 2,000-year-old architectural triumph has links to the real Crusades, where it may have been used as an outpost in the 12th century. But beyond the door is no vaulted chamber, as in the film: A modest, bare room of uncertain function is all you will see.
Doubling for the Middle East, southern Spain had the infrastructure and arid aesthetic the production team needed for some key action sequences. Locations include the beach at Cala De Monsul and the spectacular Desierto de Tabernas, a dramatic badlands home to tarantulas, eagle owls, and north African hedgehogs. The region was also famously utilized by scores of “spaghetti” Westerns in the 1960s. A preserved Western set called Fort Bravo is now a surreal theme park.

Nowhere can convincingly double for Venice, Italy’s most distinctive city—and nowhere did. Shooting at the height of the tourist season in August, the production crew briefly gained control of the Grand Canal—from “7 a.m. to 1 p.m., on one day,” remembered producer Robert Watts, speaking in 1999.
But if the building hiding the bookish entrance to the rat-infested catacombs “doesn’t look much like a library,” that’s because it isn’t; it’s the church of San Barnaba, in the Dorsoduro district. The site has hosted a church since the ninth century, with the distinctive neoclassical frontage added around 1776.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)
Professor Jones’s work place is a piecemeal of locations. But the wholesome university vibe that forms the backdrop to the motorcycle chase at the beginning of the fourth Indiana Jones movie has some authenticity. “Marshall College” is none other than Yale, the historic Ivy league university in New Haven, Connecticut.
One of America’s oldest cities, the cultural capital of the New England state has a historic harbor, a thriving restaurant scene, and a brace of important institutions—including the Peabody Natural History Museum and the venerable university itself. In the movie, spot the neo-Gothic Old Campus Courtyard, which dates to 1718.
(Did Indiana Jones help or hurt archaeology?)
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023)
In the series ender, the towering architecture of St. Vincent Street in Glasgow, Scotland’s biggest city, convincingly doubles for 1969 New York, where a ticker tape parade celebrating the successful Apollo 11 moon landing makes its way down this grand thoroughfare.
Farther south, England’s North Yorkshire Moors Railway has been recruited for some blistering train-top action. Another balmier location is the medieval city of Cefalù, Sicily, the set piece for a critical scene in The Dial of Destiny. Home to a 13th-century cathedral, dazzling spiaggia (beaches), and archaeological diversions aplenty, it’s an easy fit for Indy’s final bow.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny viewers have been left stumped by a major “plot hole” in the new Harrison Ford sequel.
The film, the fifth entry in the adventure franchise, sees Dr Henry “Indiana” Jones Jr (Ford) come up against an old Nazi adversary (Mads Mikkelsen) in 1969.
Spoilers follow for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny... you have been warned!
Most of the plot of the film revolves around the hunt for the two pieces of Archimedes’ dial, an ancient device that could supposedly be used to “read fissures in time”, potentially allowing the user to travel back in time, by locating the right fissure at the right time.
By the end of the film, the villainous Jürgen Voller (Mikkelsen) has acquired the dial, and follows it towards a wormhole located somewhere in the sky. He flies through the wormhole in an airplane with Indiana Jones on board, expecting to arrive back in Nazi Germany, where he will change the course of history and win the war for the Nazis.
The plane does indeed get transported back in time – but instead arrives in ancient Greece, during the Siege of Syracuse in 213-212 BC.
It is ultimately revealed that the dial was invented by Archimedes to help direct people from the future to his location in the past, during the ancient battle.
However, while the ending clears up some of the questions posed earlier in the film – namely, how Archimedes’ entombed body was wearing a modern-day wristwatch – the nature of the time travel still seemed to leave open a large plot hole.
Given that the dial was simply a device for reading the “fissures” in time, as opposed to creating them, it remains unexplained how Voller was able to locate a portal to Archemedes’ exact time and location, just hours after the device fell into his possession. The most logical explanation would be that the “time portals” are constantly opening up all over the world, round the clock – which poses further questions as to why no one had ever noticed them, or travelled through them.

One person shared his confusion on Reddit. “I’m not sure I really understand the time travel,” they wrote. “So archimedes was working on his dial when the Romans attacked. During the attack, the Nazi plane came out of the sky and murdered the enemy army. So archimedes knew in the future, the dial would be found and this would happen. So he built a device that allowed the user to find a worm hole to that exact moment in time?

“But like why is there a time hole to that exact moment? Are there just time vortexes to any point in history? How did archimedes even know there was a time hole to the time of this attack. Idk maybe I don’t understand it.”
Another viewer wrote that the film featured “plot holes the size of 18-wheelers”.
In a three-star review of the film for The Independent, Geoffrey Macnab wrote: “Tonally, the film wavers. It pulls in too many different directions at once. On the one hand, this is an exercise in affectionate nostalgia.
“On the other, like its predecessors, it’s an old-fashioned matinee adventure in which characterisation is deliberately broad. Certain episodes are knowing and ironic, while others seem painfully naive.”

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 18. It will open in theaters on June 30.
The MPAA rates the movie PG-13. According to their classification, the rating is due to “sequences of violence and action, language and smoking.” While the rating itself doesn’t add much to what can be expected in the fifth and final film, it is an interesting reminder that the second film of the franchise, “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,” was a main catalyst (alongside “Gremlins”) that led the MPAA to create the PG-13 classification in the first place.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” will take place in 1969, amidst the space race. Indiana Jones will encounter his old enemy, the Nazis, again. Voller is a villain inspired by Wernher von Braun, a real Nazi who became a NASA engineer.
The teaser trailer and artwork for the film debuted in December. A second teaser for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” premiered during Super Bowl LVII.
Harrison Ford, now 80 years old, stated this will be the last “Indiana Jones” movie.
Before the film’s full title was announced, Empire shared behind-the-scenes photos and interviews with the cast last November.
“It’s full of adventure, full of laughs, full of real emotion. And it’s complex and it’s sneaky,” Ford said at the time. “The shooting of it was tough and long and arduous. But I’m very happy with the film that we have.”
It’s rumored that an Indiana Jones TV series could be in development for Disney+. It remains unclear if the storyline of this series would be a prequel to the films, set somewhere inside the franchise narrative, or following a totally new character rather than Henry Jones Jr. If this series is developed, it would not be the first TV show about Indiana Jones. In 1992-1993, “The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles” aired on ABC. Harrison Ford made a cameo appearance in one episode.

2023-07-28 15:10:34.270000+00:00,Backpack maker sues ‘Indiana Jones’ filmmakers over bag in film,"Frost River's owner said fans spotted their bag, called the Geologist Pack, in “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.”","DULUTH, Minn. (Northern News Now/Gray News) - A Minnesota company is suing a big filmmaker, claiming one of their bags appeared in the new “Indiana Jones” film.
“It sure is fun to see a bag made right here in Duluth be a giant on the screen and for a big period of the movie,” said Frost River owner Christian Benson.
Frost River officials said fans spotted their bag, called the Geologist Pack, in “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.”
“We saw a big uptick on the Geologist’s webpage, and then we started getting email requests from customers asking for us to remove the logo,” Benson said.
Benson said he is confident the logo-less bag in the film is from their handcrafted collection.
“People say, ‘Well how do you know it’s your bag?’ Well, we are very unique in what we make here,” Benson said. “We do solid brass hardware; very few manufacturers do solid brass.”
Frost River sued Lucasfilm for using their backpack without consulting the company and then engaging in a joint marketing campaign with Filson, a direct competitor to Frost River.
“This isn’t right that we make this bag, and we want people to know that we make this bag. And bringing in the third-party marketing side of things really made it very confusing,” Benson said.
The company hired a team to oversee the legal process, and they said their attorneys are in talks with the movie production company.
“We are the only ones who make that bag. And someone else can go create a bag at some point that looks similar to it, but when they talk about what’s in the movie and what we sell on our website, it’s the authentic Geologist Pack,” Benson said.
The dollar amount of the case would be determined if it makes it to court.
Lucasfilm did not yet respond to a request for comment.

*Spoilers at the bottom for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny*
James Mangold has explained why Shia LaBeouf does not appear in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
In the previous movie, 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Harrison Ford’s Indiana Jones discovered he had a long-lost son, Mutt Williams, played by LaBeouf.
He had been kept a secret by his former love interest Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), who also returned for the fourth outing in the franchise, 27 years after she made her debut in the first film, Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Other popular characters made a return for Indy’s final film, including John Rhys-Davies as his Egyptian excavator friend Sallah, but that was not the case for Mutt.
Dial of Destiny director Mangold has now insisted LaBeouf’s absence had nothing to do with his public criticism of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull after its release.

He appeared alongside Karen Allen as his mother Marion, in a return to the series for her, but director Mangold felt it ‘didn’t work well’ (Picture: Lucasfilm/Paramount Pictures/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock)
‘It’s separate from all past studio, political intrigue on movies I didn’t make,’ the 59-year-old explained.
‘You were either going to make a movie all about the two of them [Indy and Mutt] or you’re going to have to find a way to not have [Mutt] around, because he was too significant a player in the previous film to just pretend he didn’t exist.’
He added to Variety: ‘I didn’t think his whole thing worked that well in the previous film. I just went towards something else because it was what was more interesting to me.’
Two years after Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was released, LaBeouf told the Los Angeles Times at the Cannes Film Festival that the movie ‘dropped the ball’ and that ‘there was a reason it wasn’t universally accepted’.

Although he later said he regretted those comments, the actor told Variety in 2016 that he doesn’t like the movies he made with Steven Spielberg, who directed the first four Indiana Jones films, adding: ‘He’s less a director than he is a f**king company.’
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is often considered the weakest film in the franchise, although it still managed to gross over $790million at the worldwide box office, against an original budget of $185m.
Looking back on the poor reception to the fourth film, producer Kathleen Kennedy admitted to Empire magazine in 2022 that ‘we may not have had as strong a story as we wanted’.

In Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Mutt’s absence in the story is revealed to be down to his shock off-screen death, having signed up for the Vietnam War.
The repercussions of Indy’s grief are shown by Marion having served him divorce papers, with their relationship fracturing in the aftermath of their only son’s tragic death.
Some fans were hoping to see the return of Ke Huy Quan’s Short Round for Dial of Destiny, after the actor appeared in 1984’s Temple of Doom and made a dramatic Hollywood comeback with an Oscar win earlier this year for his turn at Everything Everywhere All at Once.

However, we’ve just had to make do with his and Ford’s wholesome red carpet reunions instead.
Sadly, the box office omens aren’t looking brilliant for the latest Indiana Jones adventure, after it only managed a disappointing $60m at the US box office on opening weekend.
Dial of Destiny is understood to have had a pre-marketing budget of $295m, making it one of the most expensive movies ever made.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is in cinemas now.

Leicester Square is considered the UK's home of film.
Since 2020, Heart of London Business Alliance and Westminster City Council have overseen the Scenes in the Square statue trail in the famous Square, which has fast become one of London’s most popular free tourist attractions.
The trail features some of the world’s most beloved film characters and iconic scenes, brought to life in bronze statue form.
Now, Paddington Bear, Mary Poppins, Charlie Chaplin, Harry Potter, Batman and Bugs Bunny are welcoming a new addition: Indiana Jones.
The bronze effigy of the famed archaeological explorer was unveiled at the UK premiere of the latest film in the franchise, Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny.
The statue, which was welcomed by the legendary Harrison Ford, brings to life the moment the intrepid professor of archaeology and adventurer extraordinaire Dr. Henry Walton “Indiana” Jones Jr. first donned his trademark fedora in Raiders of the Lost Ark.
In true Indy style, the statue was teased before the premiere with a mysterious crate labelled ‘PROPERTY OF DR. H JONES,’ mirroring the wooden case containing the Ark of the Covenant from his first cinematic adventure in 1981.
The Indy statue - unveiling TBD Heart of London Business Alliance
Mark Williams, Director of Destination for Heart of London Business Alliance, stated that they are “beyond thrilled to welcome Indiana Jones to the Scenes in the Square trail, honouring the character’s major part in cinema history since 1981 and cementing Harrison Ford’s status as a movie icon.”
“The dynamic statue trail is a true celebration of entertainment and there are few more worthy inclusions than the legendary Indiana Jones. Taking pride of place on Leicester Square’s bustling north terrace, Indy promises to be a hugely popular addition to the Square, further cementing his legacy in movie history.”

A legacy which has fans hoping that the final chapter in the Indiana Jones saga will live up to its (mostly) stellar reputation. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny premiered at the Cannes Film Festival last month, and it’s our sad duty to inform you that while we were thrilled to be at the premiere, Indy aficionados should brace for disappointment. Harrsion Ford, 80, rises to the challenge and just about manages to keep things afloat. However, the film’s script – signed Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, James Mangold and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull scribe David Koepp (red flag), utterly sinks the final act, and with it destroys the hope that Dr. Jones’ swansong would be a fitting one. You can read our full (non-spoiler) review here.
Safe to say that the rankings now go thusly:
Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) - just because the first half hour is excellent – otherwise, it’s pretty interchangeable ranking-wise with the final spot. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)

,Indiana Jones Wears This Timeless Hamilton Watch for His Final Adventure in 'The Dial of Destiny',"Archaeologist and adventurer, Indiana Jones, returns to the big screen June 30 and wears a watch for the first time ever.","The dream team of George Lucas, Harrison Ford and Steven Spielberg brought us the iconic Indiana Jones franchises in the 1980s. In just about a week, on June 30, Ford is back on the big screen as the legendary hero archeologist Indiana Jones for his fifth and final film. We can barely wait to see what new adventures await Indy in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
While we don't know everything that will happen in the latest action film, we do know that Indy is still sporting his same relaxed, yet stylish, outfits with his leather jacket and fedora — but there's one new addition: a wristwatch. In the previous films, Indy has never worn a watch, but the costume designer, Joanna Johnston of Jurassic World: Dominion, Cast Away, The Sixth Sense and more, nailed his signature style with a timeless Hamilton Boulton wristwatch.
First introduced in 1941, the Boulton was one of Hamilton’s most popular watches from the decade. It was reintroduced in the 1980s and adapted for modern life, but maintained its Art Deco look and captures the essence of Ford's character well.
With a yellow gold PVD coated stainless steel case, quartz movement, and a brown leather strap with alligator finish, the Boulton Quartz merges long-standing Hamilton heritage and cutting-edge Swiss watchmaking precision — perfect for escaping dangers just in the nick of time.
Hamilton
In business for more than 130 years, Hamilton first came onto to the scene making pocket watches that improved railroad accuracy. The innovative brand is no stranger to Hollywood, with timepieces appearing in over 500 movies and television shows, including Interstellar and Men in Black. You can even shop all these famous watches to build out your timepiece collection.
Johnston worked with Vivian Stauffer, Hamilton’s CEO on choosing the perfect watch for Indy. Stauffer explained their final decision to Esquire, ""The choice of the Boulton for the character is based on the era — but not only that,” she said. “It also reflects Indiana Jones’ personality as archaeologist, and it captures both his inquisitive mind and thirst for noble pursuits.”
Hamilton offers a two-year warranty because they believe in their watches. They also deliver watches in 48 to 72 hours, meaning that if you order the American Classic Boulton Quartz watch right now, you could be wearing it during the premiere of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny next week.

Ahead of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny hitting theaters, check out the official trailer below. After Jones is betrayed by his goddaughter — played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge — Jones sets out on a quest to finish the one mission he has had his sights on during his entire career: retrieving the dial of destiny.
Directed by James Mangold, the movie is produced by Kathleen Kennedy, Frank Marshall and Simon Emanuel, with Steven Spielberg and George Lucas serving as executive producers. Joining the cast for the final round is Antonio Banderas, John Rhys-Davies, Shaunette Renée Wilson, Thomas Kretschmann, Toby Jones, Boyd Holbrook, Olivier Richters and Ethann Isidore.

2023-06-30 14:02:44+00:00,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Is a Failure,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a fiasco for two reasons. Admittedly, one reason is purely personal, and so that’s on me.","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a fiasco for two reasons. Admittedly, one reason is purely personal, and so that’s on me. The other, though, is totally the movie’s fault.
Dial of Destiny is the fifth movie in the Indiana Jones franchise, an action-adventure series that began and seemingly ended in the ‘80s as a perfectly self-contained trilogy. The third film was even subtitled The Last Crusade and featured our intrepid, titular hero riding off into the sunset. Nothing else needed to be said, right?
19 years after the “final” 1989 theatrical adventure, the original creative trio–series creator George Lucas, director Steven Spielberg, and star, Harrison Ford–all returned for another Indy adventure only to prove that no, nothing else needed to be said about the character.
So here we are, another 15 years later and another go at an Indy adventure, this time with only minimal involvement from Lucas and Spielberg. I hoped this movie’s existence was based on course correcting from the last adventure, an apology for what went wrong the last time. I mean, Harrison Ford is 80 years old, what else could sway him to once again don Indiana Jones’s iconic fedora, leather jacket, and whip?
Money, probably.
But I’m not that cynical. Harrison Ford has plenty of that (…money, I mean, though a healthy dose of cynicism as well, it seems). Plus, his grouchy demeanor and apparent displeasure at being on movie sets, preclude him from doing something solely for the cash.
My hopes for Dial of Destiny’s course correction were dashed almost immediately, though. The original trilogy of films had muscular action sequences with real stunts: dudes dragged underneath trucks, jumping from a horse to a real tank, actual motorcycles careening off cliffs with stuntpersons freefalling through the air.
Dial of Destiny kicks off with a twenty-minute sequence featuring a (*sigh*) de-aged Harrison Ford. Motionless, the effect is quite good. Lots of details on the face. Once things start moving, though, all bets are off. It looks painfully awkward: a too big head on a normal size body, a weird cg blur over the face. The opening sequence’s main event is a lengthy chase/fight on a train. The entire sequence is accomplished through thoroughly unconvincing CG. Worse, the avalanche of computer graphics completely erases any semblance of danger, which wipes out all hopes for excitement. On the big screen were explosions, gunfights, John Williams’s iconic score blaring in the background; in the auditorium, a dude started vaping. Not a good sign.
Even moving to its present day of the 1960s, the whole movie is shellacked in a thick miasma of CG. But the computer graphics imagery isn’t the movie’s real dilemma. The problem here is the director, James Mangold. He simply doesn’t have a feel for action. As befits an Indiana Jones movie, Dial of Destiny is filled with it–mostly chases on a variety of vehicles both organic and in-, mostly I assume because Harrison Ford is too old to be involved in any other kind of action–but they’re largely pointless endeavors because they lack narrative drive or reason. The chases begin and end seemingly at random. It’s never clear who’s chasing whom and why, and they don’t build to anything. Mostly, they just…end. They’re just there to fill the setpiece quota expected from an Indiana Jones film.
So much of the movie does just that: fill a quota. Since the original Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones is known to hate snakes, and so he had to face a tomb full of them in that first film. So what do we have here? Indiana facing eels under water. In Temple of Doom, Indiana had to face a room infested with bugs, so Dial has to have a sequence with bugs also. And again, like the action sequences, none of these moments are presented with any aplomb. Remember how the bug sequence in Doom kept escalating? The ceiling began lowering, threatening to crush our protagonist while squeezing even more bugs onto him. Then someone had to stick their hand into a hole swarming with even more creepy crawlys to pull a lever and stop the crushing. It built tension, anxiety, and the audience’s gag-reflex. Here, in the fifth film, the bugs show up, crawl on our hero a bit, and just as quickly disappear when he turns a corner. How are the bugs in only one small section of a cave? They read the script, obviously. The same happens with the eel sequence. They show up without build-up, harass only Indiana for some reason and not his diving mates (like Steve Zissou and his leeches), and then just disappear.
Add a painful repetitiveness to the general lackluster presentation and you have yourself one lame-duck adventure movie (Do me a favor, count how many times an innocent person is threatened with a gun to the face during the film’s runtime). What really grinds my gears about the film, though, is that its very existence stands in direct contrast to what the Indiana Jones movies were made for in the first place. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg loved the heroes (square jawed, indestructible) of matinee adventure serials (think Zorro, Lone Ranger…) of their youth. Indiana Jones was their homage to those heroes and movies. They were built to be pure action-adventure escapism. An 80-year-old Indiana Jones, grappling with old age, the death of loved ones, feelings of uselessness and alienation from a society that’s moving on without him is bold, yes, and preferrable to pretending he’s still a spring chicken, but it’s antithetical to what the character of Indiana Jones was created for.
It’s a bait and switch. I’m at the tail end of 45 years on this earth. Every day I’m reminded that I’m getting older. It sucks. I need escapism more than ever. Indiana Jones by its very nature is an explicit promise of that break from reality. Instead, this new “adventure” gives you a dour two plus hours that reminds you with every passing frame of the ravages of age. I would say it’s time for this franchise to hang up its fedora for good, but it never should have picked it back up in first place.

2023-06-30 14:00:00+00:00,"The Long, Strange Story of How Indiana Jones Got His Hat",Film's most famous fedora—back on big screens now—has a blockbuster-worthy origin story.,"Pick your moment: That opening shot against the jungle-mountain skyline of the Peruvian jungle. The shadow thrown up the wall of a Nepalese drinking den. The figure stark against a burning Egyptian sunset.
The silhouette in all these scenes—all from 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark, the movie that introduced Indiana Jones as anti-hero par excellence—belongs to Harrison Ford. But the star, indisputably, is his hat.
The felt fedora had long been movie costume currency amongst gangsters, gumshoes, and government heavies. But this one somehow made its character’s silhouette as reflexive as Darth Vader or Batman. It’s near-mythic qualities have been picked over by fans for decades.

But however iconic, Indiana Jones’s look was actually the unearthing of an archetype. An early cipher to the character can be found on a page torn from a 1976 edition of Lone Star Fictioneer, depicting a gunfighter called Francis Xavier Gordon, in a desert scene drawn by Jim Steranko. On it, Indiana Jones’s creator George Lucas had scribbled: ""Bullwhip instead of gun,"" ""Nazi truck and tank"" to substitute a Bedouin camp—and, in place of the pith helmet Gordon clutches, ""felt hat similar to H. Bogart in Treasures of Sierra Madre.""
In that 1948 movie, Humphrey Bogart’s tattered lid reflects its wearer Fred Dobbs, a down-on-his-luck American treasure hunter on the downslope of a lust for gold. But it was Charlton Heston, in 1954’s Secret of the Incas, that was the true prototype for Dr. Jones— his Harry Steele not only sporting a deftly-angled fedora but a leather jacket and chiseled stubble, navigating a plot juggling romance, treasure hunting and double-crossing. Lucas’s love of pacey 1940s Republic serials blended these aesthetics with Nazis hunting mystical artifacts.
Lucas commissioned Steranko to visualise this in a series of 1979 artworks that would squarely nail the vibe of Indiana Jones—right down to the hat. With Steven Spielberg signed on to direct, now he needed someone to make it real.

""I never saw Jim Steranko’s drawings,” says Deborah Nadoolman Landis, whom Spielberg signed on as costume designer. “In the screening room with Steven, we sat alone and watched China and Secret of the Incas. He said, ‘that’s it—that’s the costume.’ [Basically] here’s Harry Steele, he’s now Indiana Jones. Bring him to life.”
Six weeks before shooting, and parachuted with her leading man into London where production was based, Landis and Harrison Ford set about crafting the character. “I aspire to designing from the inside out. We’re designing the man,” Landis says. “It’s a question of texture and creating a personality. And that is not a decorative pursuit. One of the reasons Indiana Jones has endured is because he’s not a cartoon. He took on Harrison’s native traits.”
And whatever sat on his head needed to reflect that. At the costume department’s basecamp at Camden’s Berman’s & Nathan’s with Ford in tow, Landis went back to the drawing board.

“This is how you find a hat for an actor, always,” says Landis. “You would stand in the fitting room, as Harrison and I did, and boxes and boxes of fedoras will be dumped on the floor. Or Panama hats. Or straw boaters. Because everyone has a different shaped head. And it is almost impossible to find a hat that suits you.”
Hats went on, hats went off. “Harrison has a long narrow face. We came across one that kind of looked OK. So I said, we’re going to lower the crown, and we’re going to shorten up the brim so you don’t have to wear it on the back of your head.”
Seeking a hatters of suitable esteem to make the final product, Landis eschewed iconic milliners Lock & Co, instead walking into Herbert Johnson. Not seeing an equivalent and wanting a wide brim to start from, she spotted a hat she remembers as the ""Australian"" model. “It went up on one side,” Landis remembers. “So I said, I’m going to take this one, I’m going to lower this side, I’m going to cut it to the length that we need it, shorten it.” Armed with measurements and a liking for the ‘sable’ brown felt, Landis briefed the hatters. “I said, please make it to these measurements. Go! They made 10 or 12, bespoke.”
""One of the reasons Indiana Jones has endured is because he’s not a cartoon.""
Bespoke indeed. The item that rolled out of Herbert Johnson’s Old Burlington Street premises wasn’t as dainty as a trilby or as tall as a stovepipe, was more dapper than a cowboy and not as droopy as a bush hat. Indiana Jones’s fedora had elements of all yet resembled none. With the costume in her luggage, Landis shipped out to France for the first days of filming.
Then came the matter of making the getup look like it’d had both years—and mileage. “The first night we were in La Rochelle, after dinner I went down to the pool,” Says Landis. “I had brought sandpaper, Fuller’s Earth, mineral oil, a steel brush. Harrison came and sat with me and we just drank, and I aged the jacket and the hat.”
After much twisting and crushing, the hat’s accidental finishing touch was the ""turn"": the asymmetric sweep of the brim caused by the hat rotating slightly and distorting according to the shape of the wearer’s head. It was certainly singular enough that the character could be identified by his shadow alone. But to Landis, this idea was already old hat.

“I designed The Blues Brothers. You would know [them] in silhouette, in a second,” Landis says with a smile. “The head, the hair, the hat—it gives strength to a costume. John [Belushi] and Danny [Ackroyd] never take their hats off. And I went from one film to the next.”
As the movies rolled on, the fedora gained its own character arc. It risked its owner’s life when it was snatched from beneath a descending door in 1984’s Temple of Doom. In 1989’s The Last Crusade it gained billing (""The man in the hat is back!"") and an origin story, placed on the head of young Indiana Jones (River Phoenix) by an artifact-hunting scoundrel he’d impressed. This almost repeated itself in the closing scene of 2008’s Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, only for Jones Snr to snatch it back from his son (Shia LeBouf) with a grin that said: ""I ain’t done with that."" As this summer’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny proves, he wasn’t.
With individual hats evolving their own character and the design receiving nuanced updates throughout the saga, the quest amongst fans for the most screen-accurate fedora became perilous. Online forums would pick over the merits of felt types, shape, consistency and color. And with the mass-produced ""official"" versions hardly passing muster, cottage manufacturers would attempt to create their own hats to varying degrees of success. The most notable of these was Mississippi-born Steve Delk’s efforts which, in a step-change from Herbert Johnson, saw the hobbyist hatmaker triumphantly supply the production of The Crystal Skull with the hats Ford wore.
At right, Herbert Johnson’s redesigned fedora for this year’s Dial of Destiny—an exact replica of which fans can now order bespoke for around $630.

As the character’s icon status grew, rumors and misinformation amongst fans over where Indy’s paraphernalia originated eventually reached Landis. “I’m so glad I didn’t die. Everyone else would have taken credit for every single thing I ever did in my life,” Landis says with a weary smile. “I don’t own a design patent on the Thriller jacket, for instance. I have no money in the game. And there’s a lot of money to be made.”
Though stating that she generally doesn’t bother getting involved, “as a lark” Landis remembers calling out one-such false claimant—on Indiana Jones’s jacket design. “I wrote: I’m Deborah Nadoolman. I’m the mother of Indiana Jones. He is my child. I’m still alive. And I was there.”
The creation of the hat, too, remains conflicted. The late Herbert Johnson hatter Richard Swales insisted the fedora made for the films was simply a modified version of an existing model, the ""Poet""—with a shallower ribbon and a quarter-inch trimmed off the brim—which Spielberg and Ford chose personally from the store. Brazilian hatters Chapéus Cury also laid claim to the hat, declaring its Cury rabbit fur was the raw material for the ""blanks"" shipped to Herbert Johnson.
In any case, after enduring financial hardship in the 1980s and 1990s, Herbert Johnson are today ensuring their current Poet line reflects the screen hats with commendable accuracy. Models featuring nuances from different movies—scenes, even—are made bespoke, and the hatters claim ""return Herbert Johnson’s in-house craftsmanship to the very highest quality."" Using fur felts sourced from the European food industry, the results aren’t cheap—around $630—but represent perhaps the ultimate tribute. That the hat Ford is wearing for his final 2023 whip-crack is again made by Herbert Johnson—the ""Destiny Poet""—seems a fitting a way as any to close the circle.
“There’s a clear and strong DNA running through Indy’s hats. You can always tell it is his,” says Herbert Johnson’s current Master Hatter Michelle Poyer-Sleeman, who worked with designer Joanna Johnston—who oversaw 1989’s Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade—to develop the last of Ford’s fedoras.“Whilst Joanna was unable to share information on the film script, she was able to let us know we were designing a hat which Indy might have realistically chosen if he had walked into our store at Herbert Johnson in the 1960s,” adds Poyer-Sleeman. “The resulting design is unmistakably Indy’s fedora but it also very much has its own nuance and character.”
""It’s a shaped piece of felt with a ribbon on it. But it does indeed have a magic.""
But for some collectors, even this indisputably screen-correct model won’t quite be the ultimate. In 2018, one of the few original movie hats outside of Lucasfilm’s archive—screen-matched to much of Raiders of the Lost Ark and signed by Harrison Ford—resurfaced in a Propstore auction. “Film props and costumes on one hand can be incredibly simple, but on the other hand the greatest thing in the world. The Raiders fedora is a good example of that,” says Propstore’s Brandon Alinger. With a hammer price of $522,110, the hat was amongst the most valuable items the auctioneer ever handled. “It’s the recognizability that causes it to command such a premium,” says Alinger. “The physical construction is quite humble—it’s a shaped piece of felt with a ribbon on it. But it does indeed have a magic. You can hold it in your hands while watching the film and see that exact hat on screen. It’s a vessel for connection… as close as someone could get to being there on set.”
Deborah Landis, today Director and Emeritus Professor at UCLA’s Copley Center for the Study of Costume Design, admits she is ‘shocked’ at the film’s enduring appeal—but her passion for her creation is clear. “The thing about a fur felt fedora… when they’re born, they have no shape. They’re just flat pieces of felt,” says Landis. ""They respond to touch, because they’re fur. But it’s not until you wear them, you shape them, they have human oil… that they become part of you.”
She adds: “Would I have done anything different with the costume? Not at all. And that’s huge for a designer. I created that costume with a lot of love.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvd25hbmRjb3VudHJ5bWFnLmNvbS9sZWlzdXJlL2FydHMtYW5kLWN1bHR1cmUvYTQ0MzQzNTU4L2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC1oYXQtaGlzdG9yeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

We’re both so old we can barely walk, much less find a priceless ancient object. But fire up the wheelchair!”","Sallah: I miss waking up every morning wondering what wonderful adventure the new day will bring to us. Indiana: Those days have come and gone. Sallah: Perhaps, perhaps not. Indiana: I don’t believe in magic . . . but a few times in my life I’ve seen things . . . things I can’t explain. —From the trailer for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.”
Sallah: Indy, there’s an ancient scroll you need to see.
Indiana: I’ve told you a million times, I’m retired.
Sallah: Perhaps, perhaps not.
Indiana: Look, I’ve seen things, strange things, inside caves, mostly, but that doesn’t mean I have to start missing meals every time you show up with a scroll. Now, where are my damn reading glasses?

2023-06-30 17:31:12+00:00,Indiana Jones and Everything We Know About the Long-Awaited New Video Game,We still don't have a name but here's what we know about the new Indiana Jones game so far.,"There’s a new Indiana Jones movie—Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny—so of course that means there’s also a new Indiana Jones video game, because capitalism would never overlook an opportunity like that (which, hey, at least it’s working out for us for once). So here’s everything we know about the (still!) as yet unnamed Indiana Jones game, which was first announced in 2021.
When will the new Indiana Jones game be released?
We don’t actually have a release date yet for the new Indiana Jones game, either. So watch this space for an update.
Is there a trailer for the Indiana Jones game?
Yes, yes there is (insert Phineas and Ferb gif here). Bethesda released the first trailer for the new Indiana Jones game in January 2021:
Is the Indiana Jones game a tie-in with the new movie?
No. Even though the release of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny would make a companion game an easy financial win, the studio is actually doing something else with it. You’ve got to respect that really, they’re giving us more original Indy content instead of going for the cheap and easy cash grab. Then again, maybe an original game will sell a lot better than one based on the movie (I don’t pretend to be an economist/business type) and it’s still all down to the financials. Either way, it’s a win for us.
What’s the plot?
They’re not giving away too much yet, but we’ve been promised the new Indiana Jones game is a fully standalone adventure set in Rome. A date shown in the trailer says 1937, and if that’s when the plot of the game actually unfolds, then it’s set between the two best films in the franchise: Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Hopefully this means we’ll get to do some vicarious Nazi, or possibly Italian Fascist, punching through Indy as we take him on his adventure. As GamesRadar’s Alyssa Mercante pointed out, 1937 both marked Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini’s return to Rome after formalizing Italy’s 1936 alliance with Nazi Germany in Berlin, and saw Mussolini presented with an artifact known as the Sword of Islam—both key events that Indy would likely be very interested in, and have some very strong negative opinions about.
Whether that’s what the game is going to focus on or whether it will be something else entirely does still remain to be seen.
Indy's also reading up on Ancient Circles and Forbidden Stones, which could tie into ancient stone circles and standing stones all over Italy. There are also 'Giants Tombs' (remember the giant bit). https://t.co/JzA9ScLLpE pic.twitter.com/gfiRTkH0nH — Leon Hurley (@LeonHurley) January 12, 2021
Other clues in the trailer include the books shown on Indy’s desk, especially Ancient Circles and Forbidden Stones, which might refer to the so-called Cyclopean Walls and Giants Tombs—once believed to be built by giants—found across Italy. One Twitter user claims you can see a photograph of one such monument on Indy’s desk, adding weight to this idea. The letter to a priest and blueprints of the Vatican, also on his desk, suggest that at least part of his investigation is taking place in the Holy See, though whether he’ll have the official sanction of the Pope or will be sneaking in under their noses remains a mystery.
There’s also a top secret U.S. government file, implying that he might be working for or with them for this mission—so maybe this game will explain why Indy seemingly breaks his former principles by working directly for a secret U.S. government department in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (I may still be bitter about that).
Which platforms will the Indiana Jones game be available on?
Though it was originally going to be released on multiple different consoles, the Indiana Jones game is now exclusive to Xbox and PC. When asked about the change, a representative from Bethesda said that it was about reducing risk in game development, and apparently switching to Xbox Game Pass from a multi-console approach does so significantly.
Who is behind the new Indiana Jones game?
Published by Bethesda, the game is a collab between Lucasfilm Games and MachineGames, best known for the Wolfenstein franchise—so hopefully that means punching or otherwise taking down Nazis and other fascists in various cool ways is going to be a key part of the game. Bethesda Softworks, along with the other ZeniMax properties, was acquired by Microsoft a few months after the game’s initial announcement. It’s unclear what impact Microsoft’s involvement has had on the game; some sources say the decision to make it an Xbox exclusive happened there, though the company maintains this was an in-house Bethesda decision.

,The Cast of the 'Indiana Jones' Movies: Where Are They Now?,"From ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’ to ‘Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,’ here’s what the cast of the ‘Indiana Jones’ franchise have been up to.","In the years since Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark premiered in 1981, numerous actors have starred alongside Harrison Ford in the Indiana Jones films, including Sean Connery, Cate Blanchett, Ke Huy Quan and River Phoenix.
Over four decades after the film series' debut, Ford will reprise his role as the fearless archaeologist in the fifth and final movie in the series, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
Introducing the trailer at the D23 Expo in 2022, Ford said of the new film, ""Indiana Jones movies are about fantasy and mystery, but they're also about heart. We have a really great story to tell, as well as a movie that will kick your ass.""
Ahead of the film's release in 2023, Ford told PEOPLE, ""I never thought that I would be a leading man."" He added, “I really was just hoping I could make a living as an actor and not have to supplement my income with some other side hustle ... I thought I would be lucky to have a character part on a regular TV show.”
From Raiders of the Lost Ark to Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, here's a look at the franchise's most notable cast members over the years.
Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones

Harrison Ford, 80, plays the series’s titular character, Henry Walton “Indiana” Jones, an archeologist and explorer.
Even before taking on the iconic role, Ford had made a name for himself in Hollywood, having starred in hits like American Graffiti (1973) and Star Wars (1977).
Since the first Indiana Jones film premiered, Ford built his reputation as a leading man in Hollywood. He continued to star in the Star Wars franchise as Han Solo and in 1986, his role in Witness earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. His career continued to thrive throughout the ‘90s and 2000s, starring in massive blockbuster hits like The Fugitive (1994) and What Lies Beneath (2001) alongside Michelle Pfeiffer.
Off-screen, Ford has been married thrice and is a father of five. He shares sons Benjamin and Willard with his first wife, Mary Marquardt, and son Malcolm and daughter Georgia with his second wife, Melissa Mathison. He also adopted his wife Calista Flockhart's son, Liam.
Following Indiana Jones, Ford will join the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, previously played by the late William Hurt, in 2024’s Captain America: New World Order and again in an upcoming Thunderbolts standalone film.
Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood

In Raiders of the Lost Ark, Karen Allen, 71, played Marion Ravenwood, a former lover of Jones whom he enlists to help him find the Ark of the Covenant. Allen would later reprise her role in 2008’s Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
In 2021, while celebrating the 40th anniversary of Indiana Jones, Allen recalled how much she loved playing Ravenwood. “I feel like she's who I aspire to be,” she told PEOPLE. “She walked that edge of being tough, but not being heartless.”
Before joining the cast, Allen was best known for starring as Katy in the 1978 comedy Animal House. Allen has also starred in other blockbuster hits like Scrooged (1988) and The Perfect Storm (2000).
After returning to the franchise in 2008, Allen turned her sights to television with guest spots on shows like Blue Bloods (2014) and 50 States of Fright (2020).
From 1988 to 1998, Allen was married to actor Kale Browne. The couple share a son, Nicholas Browne, a chef who won an episode of Chopped in 2016.

Freeman is also a prominent theater actor, having performed at the U.K.’s Royal Shakespeare Company and Royal National Theatre. Throughout the years, Freeman has starred in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Hamlet and Glengarry Glen Ross, among others.

On top of his role in Indiana Jones, Rhys-Davies has had a very successful career in Hollywood, starring in everything from the popular sci-fi series Sliders (1995–1997) to the Lord of the Rings trilogy as Gimli (2001–2003). He’s also known for his voice roles in numerous video games, including those based on LOTR and the popular Wing Commander series (1994–1996), also starring Mark Hamill.
Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody

In Raiders of the Lost Ark, Denholm Elliott played Marcus Brody, a museum curator and good friend to Jones. His character was a fan favorite and returned for The Last Crusade.
Elliott had a flourishing career on stage and screen, starring in hits like Trading Places (1983) and earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for A Room with a View in 1985.
In 1986, he told the New York Times of his career: ""I'm often given parts that aren't as big as they are colorful, but people remember them. When it's a minor or supporting role, you learn to make the most of what you're given. I can make two lines seem like Hamlet.""
Just three years after The Last Crusade, Elliott died from AIDS-related tuberculosis at the age of 70.
Kate Capshaw as Willie Scott

Kate Capshaw, 69, joined the Indiana Jones franchise for the sequel Temple of Doom in 1984. In the film, she played Willie Scott, a lounge singer in Shanghai who gets wrapped up in Jones' adventure.
Temple of Doom was Capshaw’s first major film role, and she went on to have starring roles in movies like SpaceCamp (1986) and Just Cause (1995).
From 1976 to 1980, she was married to Robert Capshaw. Their daughter, Jessica Capshaw, is best known for portraying Arizona Robbins on Grey’s Anatomy.
Capshaw later married Temple of Doom director Steven Spielberg in 1990. Their blended family now includes daughters Jessica, Sasha, Mikaela and Destry, and sons Max, Theo and Sawyer.
Capshaw and Spielberg often work on projects together, with their most recent being the music video for “Cannibal” by Marcus Mumford. Spielberg filmed the entire video in one shot on his iPhone, while Capshaw served as producer and art director. The couple were also joined by Mumford’s wife, Carey Mulligan, who did hair, makeup and wardrobe.
Ke Huy Quan as Short Round

Ke Huy Quan, 51, played Short Round, Jones' 11-year-old getaway driver who tags along for the adventure, in Temple of Doom.
Right after Quan starred in Temple of Doom, he landed another leading role in The Goonies (1985) as Richard “Data” Wang. Despite starring in two massive blockbuster hits, Quan found it difficult to get cast. In 2022, he told PEOPLE how Hollywood had very few roles for Asian actors. ​​""It was tough,” he recalled. “I was waiting for the phone to ring, and it rarely did.""
But in 2022, the actor starred in one of the year's most acclaimed films: Everything Everywhere All at Once. Premiering at SXSW that March, the movie quickly built momentum, garnering rave reviews and expanding from a small limited release to a wide release, ultimately earning almost $140 million at the box office. Quan, Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis all won Oscars for their performances and the film also took home Best Director and Best Picture.
Harrison Ford presented his Oscar, creating an emotional Indiana Jones reunion when Quan took the stage to receive the award. After accepting his Oscar, Quan said, ""They say stories like this only happen in the movies. I cannot believe it's happening to me. This is the American dream!""
Next up, Quan has starring roles in two upcoming Disney+ series. He’ll reunite with his Everything Everywhere All at Once costars Yeoh and Stephanie Hsu in the action series American Born Chinese and star in the second season of the superhero series Loki.
Sean Connery as Henry Jones Sr.

In the third film, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), Sean Connery joined the cast as Jones' father, who often cared more about having adventures than raising his son.
Even before starring in The Last Crusade, Connery was already a massive star. Just a few years prior, he won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role in The Untouchables (1987) and for two decades, he starred as James Bond in hits like Goldfinger (1964).
After his role in The Last Crusade, Connery continued acting in blockbuster hits, including The Hunt for Red October (1990) and The Rock (1996). His final major acting role came in 2003 when he starred in and produced The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.
In his personal life, Connery married actress Diane Cilento in 1962. Together they had a son, actor Jason Connery, who appeared in movies like Shanghai Noon (2000) and had a recurring role in Smallville (2001–2003). Connery and Cilento divorced in 1974.
The following year he married artist Micheline Roquebrune and the two remained together until his death in 2020. The actor died in his sleep when vacationing in the Bahamas with his wife. After his death, Roquebrune shared that Connery had dementia in his later years, telling Mail on Sunday, “It was no life for him. He was not able to express himself latterly. ... It took its toll on him.”
River Phoenix as Young Indiana Jones
LUCASFILM LTD/PARAMOUNT ; Darlene Hammond/Getty
When River Phoenix was 19, he played a young Indiana Jones in The Last Crusade’s flashback scenes.
Even before Indiana Jones, Phoenix was already a rising star in Hollywood, having his first breakout role in Stand by Me in 1986. Two years later, Phoenix earned a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the Oscars for his role in Running on Empty. After The Last Crusade, Phoenix had a few more major roles, including the indie hit My Own Private Idaho (1991) and the caper film Sneakers (1992).
Phoenix lived with a cocaine and heroin addiction, and on Halloween 1993, he died from a drug overdose outside the Viper Room club in West Hollywood, California, at the age of 23.
River is just one of many famous siblings in the Phoenix family. His brother, Joaquin Phoenix has been nominated for four Oscars throughout his career and won Best Actor in 2020 for Joker.
River’s other famous siblings include actress Rain, designer Liberty and actress Summer.
Alison Doody as Elsa Schneider

Alison Doody, 57, played Elsa Schneider, a secret Nazi sympathizer helping Jones find the Holy Grail in The Last Crusade.
Before making her Indiana Jones debut, Doody was best known for her villainous role in the Bond film A View to a Kill (1985). After The Last Crusade, Doody landed a few more major roles, including Major League II (1994) and RRR (2022).
From 1994 to 2006, Doody was married to business mogul Gavin O’Reilly, with whom she had two daughters.
Cate Blanchett as Irina Spalko
Cinematic Collection / Alamy ; Karwai Tang/WireImage
After almost 20 years, the Indiana Jones franchise returned to the screen with Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in 2008. Cate Blanchett, 53, took on the role of KGB agent Irina Spalko, the film’s antagonist who wishes to obtain the power of the crystal skull.
Blanchett was already a huge name in Hollywood before joining the Crystal Skull cast. She had been nominated for five Academy Awards, including for Elizabeth (1998), Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007) and I’m Not There (2007), and won Best Supporting Actress for The Aviator (2004).
She continued her Oscar dominance after her role in Indiana Jones, winning Best Actress in 2014 for Blue Jasmine and receiving two more Best Actress nominations in 2015 and 2022 for Carol and Tár.
Off-screen, Blanchett has been married to Australian playwright Andrew Upton since 1997. They have four children: sons Dashiell John, Roman Robert and Ignatius Martin, and daughter Edith Vivian.
Next up, Blanchett will be starring in the movie adaptation of Borderlands. She’ll be joined by an all-star cast that includes Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Jamie Lee Curtis and Cheyenne Jackson, directed by horror aficionado Eli Roth.
Shia LaBeouf as Mutt Williams
Cinematic Collection / Alamy ; Mike Marsland/WireImage
Shia LaBeouf, 36, played Mutt Williams, the estranged son of Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood, in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull came at a time when LaBeouf was making a new name for himself as a Hollywood star after being known as a child actor on Disney’s Even Stevens from 2000 to 2003. In 2007, he starred in blockbuster hits like Transformers and Disturbia.
After Indiana Jones, LaBeouf had a few more hits, including the Transformers sequels Revenge of the Fallen (2009) and Dark of the Moon (2011). He also starred alongside Michael Douglas in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010).
By 2013, the actor had begun piling up a series of controversies and legal troubles and he was arrested multiple times between 2013 and 2017.
In 2020, musician FKA Twigs filed a lawsuit against LaBeouf, claiming physical and mental assault and battery. The two met in 2018 while filming Honey Boy and began a relationship. Though LaBeouf denied her claims of assault, he responded: “My failings with Twigs are fundamental and real, but they are not the narrative that has been presented. There is a time and a place to deal with such things, and I am trying to navigate a nuanced situation with respect for her and the truth, hence my silence.""
The letter also addressed his departure from the 2022 movie Don’t Worry Darling. Director Olivia Wilde said she fired LaBeouf from the film, but he claimed that he quit.
He is currently married to wife Mia Goth and the two share one child.
LaBeouf’s next project will be a supporting role in Francis Ford Coppola’s ensemble film Megalopolis, which is expected to premiere in 2024.
Sir John Hurt as Harold Oxley
Paramount ; Karwai Tang/WireImage
In Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, legendary British actor John Hurt played Harold “Ox” Oxley, Mutt’s surrogate father who goes missing after discovering the crystal skull.
Before joining the Indiana Jones cast, Hurt had already been nominated for two Oscars for his roles in Midnight Express (1978) and The Elephant Man (1980). He also starred in numerous blockbuster hits throughout the years, including Alien (1979), Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (2001) and V for Vendetta (2006).
After Indiana Jones, Hurt continued starring in high-profile projects, most notably reprising his role as Garrick Ollivander in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 (2010) and Part 2 (2011). He also appeared in films like Snowpiercer (2013) and Jackie (2016).

2023-06-21 17:40:00+01:00,Indiana Jones loses eye in old age and fans wonder if it'll happen in new movie,"Indiana Jones wears an eye patch in his old age, but Harrison Ford's character still has both intact in the new Dial of Destiny movie's trailers. Nevertheless, will he lose it in his latest adventure?","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is set in 1969 when Indy, played by the 80-year-old Harrison Ford, is supposed to be around 70.
The upcoming blockbuster is the fifth and final outing in the franchise, but did you know we’ve seen Indy when he’s even older?
Back in the early 1990s, the Young Indiana Jones TV show aired starring Sean Patrick Flanery.
The actor portrayed Indy during his service in the First World War and its aftermath ahead of the 1930s set original trilogy of movies.
But the Young Indy series was also bookended with scenes set in the then present-day setting of 1992-1993.

Harrison Ford has addressed the 15-year gap between the fourth and fifth Indiana Jones films.
The actor last portrayed the daring archealogist in 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. He is returning to the role of Dr Henry “Indiana” Jones Jr for a final time in the forthcoming Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
Speaking to Digital Spy ahead of the new film’s release, Ford was asked about the long delay for fans awaiting a fifth Indiana Jones.
“Well, it wasn’t as though we sat around for 10 years waiting to come up with an idea,” he responded. “When we finished the last film, I don’t think anybody thought about going and doing another film for some time.
“And then there were some interesting ideas that were floated. But they didn’t quite gel over a period of time. And then we found an idea, and a script, and a strong story that we wanted to tell.
The actor, 80, added that he was “very happy” with the story of Dial of Destiny.
“We’re coming to the end of Indiana Jones’ time on the planet, and I wanted to see a conclusion of his story that accommodated the reality of his age, and what that effect has on this person that we’ve come to know over the years,” he said.
Ford stars in the film alongside Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Mads Mikkelsen.

Describing his final day on set, Ford recalled: “The feeling I had is the feeling you have when you’ve made something, and you can look at it, or you can remember having made it, [and having] the satisfaction of putting work in, and getting something worthy out of it.
“I felt a sense of peace, a sense of contentment, that this particular job that [director James Mangold] and I and all the other people involved had done together, was concluded in a way that really felt satisfying to me. It is my hope that others find it as satisfying as I did.”

2023-06-26 19:52:15+00:00,Why Director James Mangold Was Chosen As Steven Spielberg’s Successor for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny”,,"If you’re anything like me, you’ve been wondering why exactly Steven Spielberg chose to step down from the role of director for the fifth and final Indiana Jones movie, which is due out this Friday from Disney and Lucasfilm. And while the answer to that question may remain mostly unclear, what we do have information about is why filmmaker James Mangold, who had previously helmed the acclaimed releases Logan, Ford v. Ferrari, and Walk the Line (among others), was chosen as Spielberg’s successor for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
“Mangold had extensive experience telling emotionally satisfying stories about historical figures from Johnny Cash to Carroll Shelby, and he was equally adept with dramatic tales about outsider figures,” said Lucasfilm in a press release. “His movies, which often centered on captivating, conflicted protagonists, were always expertly crafted, uniquely thought-provoking, and keenly entertaining.” “I think all of us involved have recognized for a long time that Jim is an exceptional filmmaker,” added Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy. “He’s also one of those rare filmmakers who really studies movies. He is a scholar when it comes to talking about movies. The minute Jim’s name came up, [Indiana Jones star Harrison Ford] was already 100 percent on board. That meant a lot to me. It meant a lot to Steven. It meant a lot to [producer and Kennedy’s husband Frank Marshall].”
Ford himself also provided some thoughts on why Mangold was a good fit for the task. “There are a lot of aspects of Jim Mangold’s filmmaking skill that I admire. But as a storyteller, he’s got a particular perception, born of his own experience, understanding, and his ambition is consistent with the ambition that we’ve had all the way through this series of films to create large-scale entertainment with a kind of wry humor and an emotional reality that engages the audience.” And Steven Spielberg, who directed all four of the previous Indiana Jones films, gave his thoughts as well. ““He was a director who shared my sensibilities about editing, pacing, character development, balancing scenes. I thought, ‘If I don’t do another Indiana Jones movie, James Mangold should.’”
“Jim was so knowledgeable about the character of Indiana Jones and the series and what makes it work,” said the above-mentioned Frank Marshall. “Based on the work he had already done and the movies he had made, we really felt confident that he was the right person to do this.” And Mangold had the opportunity to speak for himself, saying that he’s never forgotten the experience of watching the first Indiana Jones film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, as a 17-year-old at the Orange County Mall in upstate New York on opening day—June 12, 1981. He was riveted by the rollicking spirit of the classic adventure, which borrowed styles and techniques from the early decades of the cinematic artform. It was an equal mix of chases, cliffhangers, fisticuffs, romance, and wit, with a uniquely modern sensibility.
“Indiana Jones is a character that always surprises us,” says Mangold, who also co-wrote Dial of Destiny. “He can be selfish, he can be empathic, he can be brave, he can be a coward. And Harrison holds all these contradictory elements together. Indiana Jones is not a Greek hero on Mount Olympus, he’s a very human character. I think all his eccentricities and anxieties and neuroses and foibles are part of his appeal. But he does have a superpower, and it’s that he’s incredibly lucky.” The director went on to explain how he and co-screenwriter Jez Butterworth decided to kick off this new adventure for everyone’s favorite archaeologist. “I wanted to start Harrison’s character as far from being Indy as we could, so that the audience would feel the elation when circumstances force him to pull that hat on again. 1969 is a time where no one really believes in heroes like Indiana Jones anymore. In many ways, the adventure we’ve concocted is a reckoning between an old-school hero and an ambivalent and ever more cynical modern world.”
Mangold also talked about the sought-after ancient relic in this movie, which is (SPOILER ALERT) Archimedes’ dial, a mechanical device thought to be used in ancient Greece to calculate and display information about astronomical phenomena. “The moment I knew the movie was about time, opportunities missed, opportunities lost, choices made, irrevocable mistakes, then the question [became], ‘What would be the only thing that would allow me to fix time itself?’ The research that I found about the Antikythera, rumored to be an invention by Archimedes, has been speculated to be a kind of time compass.” And the writer/director also worked in a way to see Indiana Jones fighting Nazis in the 1940s at the beginning of the film, as well. “Doing a sequence—and a really elaborate one—with Indiana at his prime fighting Nazis would be a kind of miracle. It would allow the audience to remember something they might not have seen for a while. I felt like I wanted the chance to make a movie with a young Harrison. The ambition in me wanted a crack at it, so we wrote a sequence, a kind of elaborate adventure that opens the film.”
And what about James Mangold’s working relationship with Executive Producer Steven Spielberg during the development of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny? “His instincts and eye for story and staging are incredible,” Mangold says of Spielberg, adding, “The biggest thing Steven said that resonated with me every day was about pace—that effectively making an Indiana Jones movie is like making a feature-length trailer. And that simple aphorism, that simple idea stayed with me. The movie can only stop so long because the whole movie itself is almost like a coming attraction trailer that just goes for two hours.”
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny will be released this Friday, June 30th, in theaters nationwide.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYXVnaGluZ3BsYWNlLmNvbS93L2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMvMDYvMjYvd2h5LWRpcmVjdG9yLWphbWVzLW1hbmdvbGQtd2FzLWNob3Nlbi1hcy1zdGV2ZW4tc3BpZWxiZXJncy1zdWNjZXNzb3ItZm9yLWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3Rpbnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-22 15:11:42+00:00,Mads Mikkelsen met Indiana Jones before he met Harrison Ford,EXCLUSIVE: Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’s villain tells us about his first meeting with the Hollywood legend,"There are few movie characters as legendary as Indiana Jones. So we can imagine that seeing Harrison Ford in the costume is quite a moment, even for an actor who has worked on Bond, Star Wars, and Marvel.
Mads Mikkelsen tells GamesRadar+ that this was exactly what happened when he first saw Ford in the iconic get-up on the set of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Speaking at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, he also reveals that this was the first time he met Ford too.
""I got confused,"" Mikkelsen recalls. ""I was supposed to meet Harrison. We had to read through the script. I was just jumping into my trailer, we had a costume fitting. I went out and he came out of his trailer – hat, whip, jacket. I was meeting Indiana Jones instead of Harrison. That was it! Standing there, grumpy, 'What am I doing here?' With the whip. Dan-da-dan! I was smiling all over.""
It certainly made an impression on the actor who plays villain Jürgen Voller in the movie, a former Nazi scientist working on the 1969 Apollo program. Mikkelsen was thrilled with the opportunity to work with Ford too and adds that he doesn’t think another actor could take on the iconic role after the character's swansong.
""The only thing that reminds me a little of Indiana Jones was way back in the '40s, '50s with Burt Lancaster and the pirate films he did,"" he explains. ""I was glued to the screen… it was charming. Harrison and Indiana Jones take it to a completely different level. So yeah, you can’t copy it. You can get inspired and find something else that makes us fly off into our imaginations.""

2023-06-26 01:38:24-04:00,Film Review: ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Sends Harrison Ford Off on One Last Adventure,"Awards Radar seeks to provide objective, thoughtful, and wide-ranging coverage of the awards season, as well as the entertainment world in general","Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures
It’s kind of crazy that this movie even exists. Just think about it. Indiana Jones has been a big screen character for over 40 years now. Sure, Raiders of the Lost Ark got two good to very good sequels in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom as well as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, but the long in development Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull underwhelmed, seemingly putting the franchise on ice. Now, Indy is back, not so much taking a victory lap as much as attempting to go out with more of a bang. The result is Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which won’t make anyone forget about the first three, but is a welcome step up from the fourth one. Mostly, if you enjoy this character, there’s more fun to be had with him, before hanging up the fedora for good.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a farewell to an all-timer of a cinematic character. At the same time, it’s an adventure fit for our hero. Not all of it works, but in comparison to the wildly uneven nature of his prior outing, this is mostly satisfying. Would it perhaps have been better to just leave Indy be? Maybe, but after continuing on from a really strong trilogy, it made sense to try and course correct here. What we end up with is no modern classic, to be sure, but an entertaining adventure with an old friend.
Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures
We catch up with Indiana Jones (Ford) in Germany during the waning days of World War II. Along with Basil Shaw (Toby Jones), he’s searching for the Lance of Longinus, currently in possession by the Nazis, including scientist Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen). As all involved realize the Lance is a fake, they wind up aboard a speeding train with something else to covet. That something is the Antikythera, the titular dial invented by Greek mathematician Archimedes in the third century B.C., which will become the focus of the film. Half of it is here, the other half a mystery. Basil and Indy escape with it, but its existence will haunt Voller.
Fast-forward to 1969 and Indy is a shell of his former self. Teaching at Hunter College in Manhattan, he lives in a small apartment, drinks, and shows no real interest in anything. That is, until a visit from his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). An archeologist herself, she wants his help in finding the other half of the dial. However, she’s in it to sell at auction to the highest bidder. Voller is in town too, having escaped and become an integral part of NASA pulling off the moon landing. One big chase later and Helena has Indy with her going after the Grafikos, the missing half of the dial. Alongside her young sidekick Teddy (Ethann Isidore), they set off on one last adventure. This one goes from the Big Apple to Tangier, as well as Greece and Sicily, among other spots. All the while, Voller and his goons are never far behind. I won’t spoil the third act, but it does what the franchise has always done, just on a whole other level.
Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures
Harrison Ford is fully engaged here, knowing this is his final ride as the archeologist. As such, it’s more satisfying watching him here than in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Ford shows his age a bit, but the flick doesn’t shy away from it. It’s never a punchline, but just changes the type of journey, to some degree. When the emotional moments arrive, Ford is at the top of his game. As for Phoebe Waller-Bridge, she’s a delight, playing the other side of the adventurer coin. Indy may want the artifacts in the museum, but Helena harkens back to his days of seeking fortune and glory. They have nice chemistry together, while Waller-Bridge shows the evolution of the character quite well. Mads Mikkelsen is a traditional villain for this franchise, colder and almost gentlemanly, but with a deranged side, to be sure. It’s a slightly new spin on the Nazi bad guy, while still remembering who the series is at its best in presenting as villains. Ethann Isidore isn’t bad, but the character is annoying and really doesn’t add much to the proceedings, while Toby Jones doesn’t get a ton to do (though he fits the franchise like a glove). Supporting players here include Antonio Banderas, Mark Killeen, Thomas Kretschmann, Nasser Memarzia, Billy Postlethwaite, Olivier Richters, Shaunette Renée Wilson, and more, including cameos from Karen Allen and John Rhys-Davies. Both of them will make you smile when you see them pop up.
James Mangold takes over for Steven Spielberg and does a very nice job. The camera work isn’t as dynamic as Spielberg’s films (Douglas Slocombe in the original trilogy and Janusz Kamiński last time), but cinematographer Phedon Papamichael is no slouch here. Mangold’s direction leans in to what Ford does well with the character, only occasionally leaning too heavily on CGI action that feels more anonymous than this franchise has as a hallmark. That being said, the CGI used to de-age Harrison Ford in the prologue is pretty good. It’s just his voice that betrays the age, but visually? It works well. There’s also potentially the last John Williams score (though he’s recently rescinded his retirement plans), which is reliably strong and sweeping. The weak link is the screenplay, which is credited to Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, David Koepp, and Mangold. It’s not a bad script, but it gives us things we don’t need, like another child sidekick, alongside a frivolous action sequence or two. Now, they take arguably the biggest swing yet with the third act, though the series never went small with their climaxes. This one might prove divisive, but I got a kick out of it.
Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures
Compared to the rest of the franchise (which I’ll rank later on this week), this one is not a patch on the original trilogy, though it is a course correction from the prior installment. Mangold and company, which includes Spielberg, clearly wanted this to end things on a better note. They certainly managed to accomplish that goal, though I honestly would have been curious to see Spielberg helming this one. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull isn’t particularly good, but individual sequences are great, so had he been on board and into things like Ford is, they could have made one more really strong one.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a solid film that mainly suffers from heightened expectations and the hope that it could have been great. The movie works, gives you what you want from Indy, and says goodbye in a way that feels right for the character. It may not be what you’re expecting (and boy the third act is a big swing), but it does right by Indy. At the end of the day, what more can you ask for here?

One year later, she and Harrison met at the 59th Golden Globe Awards in 2002.
Calista was nominated for a best actress award for her role in Ally McBeal.
Harrison was there to receive the Cecil B DeMille Award from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.
The couple kept their relationship quiet until they decided to go public, stepping out together at the Venice Film Festival in September of that year.
The pair lived together for nearly a decade before tying the knot in 2010 in New Mexico, where the action star was working on the film Cowboys and Aliens.
Liam was about nine when his parents married. Harrison was 67 at the time.
'I've got five kids in total, so it's not my first rodeo,' the Star Wars star told The Independent.
Yeah, obviously, I'm getting older but I don't relate to it very much. It doesn't interest me as something to dwell on. I have a 9-year-old kid at home. I feel like the father of a 9-year-old.'

'My older children have taught me a lot about parenting. My first child was born when I was 25. I reckon I'm a little better at it now.'
The actor has four older children from his prior marriages.
Ben, 56, and Willard, 54, are his sons from his first marriage to illustrator Mary Marquardt, 78. He shares Malcolm, 35, and daughter Georgia, 32, with his second wife, ET: the Extra-Terrestrial screenwriter Melissa Mathison, 65.
Neither Harrison nor Calista keeps a strong social media presence.
An Instagram page attributed to Liam reads, 'My parents are Calista Flockhart & Harrison Ford My parents say I can't take selfies becuz I need a private life #annoyingactorparents #single.'
Harrison and Calista recently returned from Cannes where Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny debuted. The actor received a five minute standing ovation for what could be his final portrayal of the beloved character who helped make him a superstar.
When asked at a news conference what it was like for him receiving such an accolade, he got teary and answered, 'Indescribable.'
'I can’t even tell you,' he added. 'The welcome is unimaginable and it makes me feel good.'

,"Harrison Ford reflects on replacing Tom Selleck as Indiana Jones, first impression of 'Raiders' and his 'Dial of Destiny' farewell",Legendary actor says he never imagined playing iconic archaeologist for 40-plus years.,"What if Tom Selleck hadn’t turned down the role of swashbuckling, Nazi-slugging archeologist Indiana Jones in 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark?
Such is one of Hollywood’s great sliding-door moments. Selleck was the first choice for the adventure film helmed by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. Selleck wanted the part. Unfortunately, he had to give it up because he was contractually obligated to a new drama that CBS just picked up for series, Magnum, P.I. — a show that would eventually catapult him to stardom.
Harrison Ford had no idea at the time.
The actor had recently completed The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Star Wars boss Lucas, who conceived the character of Jones in 1973, asked his Han Solo to read the Raiders script.
“I didn’t know that it was a script that someone else had read and was unable to take the job of Indiana Jones because of a contract, Tom Selleck,” Ford, 80, tells us in a new interview. (Selleck would eventually get his shot as a big-screen action hero in 1983’s High Road to China, one of the many Indy-inspired films that flooded theaters following the blockbuster success of Raiders.)
Ford says he was “enthusiastic” about the Lawrence Kasdan-penned screenplay and excited to work with director Spielberg — but he also couldn’t have imagined that he’d be donning Indy’s famed fedora and cracking that signature whip for four decades. After Raiders became an instant classic in ’81, there have been four sequels: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), and this week’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which marks Ford’s swan song in the series.
“As far as I knew, it was a one-off,” Ford says now about Raiders. “I mean, I didn’t really have my head around anything but that job at work right there. I never thought of continuing on to make a four films over 42 years now. But the opportunity came because the films were so satisfying for an audience, and they were made with such skill and ambition, and so I was delighted to be along for the ride.”
Set primarily in 1969, Dial of Destiny finds Indy on the brink of retiring from his day job as a college professor when he’s lured back into action by his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). She’s in a race against an ex-Nazi scientist (Mads Mikkelsen’s Jürgen Voller) to recover the mythical Archimedes Dial, a device thought to be capable of time travel.

“One thing I asked for in each of them was to further embrace a complication of the character,” Ford says of his evolution as Indy. “I wanted to know more about Indiana Jones. I wanted the things that he did to be generated out of his character, out of his nature, out of his experience. I didn’t want it just to be pinned on like a merit badge.
“I wanted these films to inspire people, to make them laugh, to make them cry. And so for me it’s been just an unbelievable experience to have this opportunity. And the last one, I wanted to be about character. I wanted it to be about what it's like to be an older archeologist.”
Dial of Destiny is written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, David Koepp and James Mangold, the Oscar-nominated filmmaker behind Walk the Line, Logan and Ford v. Ferrari. Like seemingly every other major director who came of age with 1980s movies, Mangold was deeply influenced by Raiders, particularly for its boldness.
“There’s so many risks in that movie,” he says of the original film. “It’s such a wild anachronism. It’s screwball, it’s kind of comedic. It’s about an archeologist who carries a whip, who is brilliant, but also scared of snakes, who can take on action, but kind of gets freaked out in social environments. It’s such a bunch of contradictions that no one would go, ‘That smells like a hit, George.’ It’s such an amalgam of wonderfully eccentric things that, in the alchemy of [Ford] in the role and [Spielberg] directing and Larry Kasdan writing and George producing and guiding, something happened, which was bigger than the sum of the parts.
“And that thing is something that can instruct all of us who make movies now. And for me, there was the opportunity to be part of this world and try to understand that alchemy. But it’s also an inspiration for the projects I do beyond the world of this franchise, which is that you can take these swings. They don’t have to always make sense by the standard rules of the day of what a hero is or what a protagonist does.”
One thing’s for sure about the Indiana Jones franchise. There are few 80-year-old action stars out there that can still do what Harrison Ford — or “the bionic man,” as franchise producer and Lucasfilm President Kathryn Kennedy called him — does in Dial of Destiny.

“Harrison said to me quite early on, he was like, ‘You are just doing all the [action] that I used to do ’cause I can’t do them anymore,’” Waller-Bridge recalls. “But then every time I was doing anything, Harrison was always there, on the wall next to me or in the boat [or] jumping out the plane. Like he did all the same stuff as me.
She adds laughing, “I was like, ‘This is not a passing of the baton. This is a war over it.’ He does not let go. It was amazing.”
Recalls Shaunette Renée Wilson, who plays a government agent caught in the middle of Jones’s battle with Voller: “He’d just be jumping on a horse and galloping away. … My mind was just like, ‘What is happening?’ It was like the Indiana Jones [of old].”
“Yeah, try to get off the floor with hands cuffed and not touch the ground,” adds Boyd Holbrook, who plays Klaber, Voller’s lead henchman. “Harrison’s got the body of a 40-year-old, it’s just bizarre. Unfortunate for me. Good for him.”
“Obviously his age has been mentioned a lot,” says Mikkelsen. “But I think we underplay the talent we’re dealing with. He’s just a tremendously talented person and you don’t think about [his age] one second when you’re working with him. He’s just a very talented man.”
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny opens Friday, June 30.

2023-06-29 10:01:49-07:00,Han Solo vs. Indiana Jones: Which one is Harrison Ford’s greatest role?,"Harrison Ford has had two iconic roles over the course of his career, but which one comes out on top: Han Solo or Indiana Jones? We investigate and pick a winner!","Few actors have given more to popular culture than Harrison Ford. Over the course of his decades in Hollywood, Ford has starred in everything from high-minded prestige movies to some of the most well-known blockbusters in the history of movies. In that career, Harrison has given us two different all-time great blockbuster characters.
First, he was Han Solo in the Star Wars films, and then, a few years later, he introduced us to Indiana Jones. Both franchises have had long legacies that extended all the way into the present, but the question of which character is Ford’s greatest role is still hotly debated. Thankfully, we’ve come up with a foolproof way to arrive at an answer.
Recommended Videos
Which character is more central to the franchise?
Perhaps the first method we should use for considering which role is which character is more essential to the movies he’s featured in. Han Solo is critical to what Star Wars is. Without him, there would be no skeptic or cynic in this story, no regular guy who is thrown into a world beyond his imagination.
In spite of that central role, though, Han is not the hero of that franchise. Indiana Jones has much of the same wit that Han does, but he’s the essential character of his franchise. Without him, the franchise wouldn’t even exist.
Winner: Indiana Jones
Which character has a better pop culture legacy?
Although Indiana Jones has lasted for decades and made a massive impact, Star Wars has a bigger legacy than any other franchise on the planet. It essentially launched the blockbuster movie era in its current form, and a broad array of stories are still being told in this universe decades later.
Indiana Jones is a franchise built around a single character that is likely to disappear as soon as that character does. Star Wars may well live on forever, whether Harrison is involved in any future projects or not.
Winner: Han Solo
Which character is smarter?
Both Han and Indy have gotten out of the kinds of scrapes that suggest they have plenty of wit. Han is definitely much more working-class than Indy, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he’s less intelligent. Han is the kind of guy who knows how to survive, and that kind of knowledge is invaluable in a world as dangerous as the one he lives in.
Still, we have to go with Indy in this category, both because of his knowledge of various rare artifacts, and because so much of his work involves solving intricate puzzles on the road to his next quest.
Winner: Indiana Jones
Which character has a better crew supporting him?
Although Ford can certainly do plenty on his own, it always helps to have great supporting actors working around you. The Indiana Jones ensemble changes pretty wildly from movie to movie, and as a result, the quality of the supporting casts also shifts substantially. Raiders of the Lost Ark has a wonderful ensemble, while Temple of Doom is much more of a mixed bag. (Sorry, Short Round!)
Star Wars, meanwhile, features tons of British acting legends in supporting roles, as well as the always-reliable Carrie Fisher. Some people hate on Mark Hamill’s performance, but if he was as bad as everyone claims, these movies would not be the major motion pictures they’ve become.
Winner: Han Solo
Which character presents more acting challenges?
Especially in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, Ford gets a few moments to genuinely emote. For the most part, though, Han’s role is to be the cool skeptic and occasionally the comic relief. He gets genuine movie star moments, but not tons of them.
Indy is, by contrast, a character tailor-made to play to all of Ford’s strengths. He’s charismatic and cool, but also much less put together than his roguish looks may suggest. He gets moments of genuine wonder and amazement, and some that are genuinely moving. He may be a serial character, but Indy has also been an opportunity for Harrison to turn in a genuinely great performance.
Winner: Indiana Jones
Which is Harrison Ford’s greatest role: Han Solo or Indiana Jones?
By a hair, Ford’s great role is Indiana Jones. Few actors in the history of motion pictures have left a more indelible impact than Ford. Han and Indy are both parts that will put him in the movie star pantheon, but in the end, it’s Indy we’re likely to remember first when we think about his career.
Indy is the character that seems to have been tailor-made for him, and for all of his strengths as Han, we’ve already seen that Star Wars can exist without him. Indiana Jones, by contrast, seems likely to fade away along with Harrison.

,Harrison Ford says the new Indiana Jones film serves as a splendid goodbye,"In a recent press conference that Yahoo Life Singapore attended, Harrison Ford shared that reprising the role of Indiana Jones again doesn't feel different, but it feels good.

If you're here for the first time and have no idea how the franchise of Indiana Jones first begin, let me tell you a story: the first Indiana Jones film entitled Raiders of The Lost Ark starring lead actor Harrison Ford, began in 1981 and soon after, four films were spun including Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom (1984); Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade (1989); Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008); and finally, this year's Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Hollywood's beloved film director Steven Spielberg helmed the first four Indy films before passing the torch to James Mangold, who's done a marvelous job with The Wolverine and Ford vs. Ferrari films.
To get you up to speed, it's been 42 years since the 80-year-old Ford took the reign as the whip-smart archaeologist who's always up for a thrilling, globe-trotting adventure seeking answers and artifacts. In the fifth and last Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny film, Ford has left behind his swashbuckling adventure for a quiet and peaceful teaching job as a professor of archaeology and is preparing to retire to his modest apartment where, these days, he lives alone.

Things change after a surprise visit from his estranged goddaughter Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), who is seeking a rare artifact that her father entrusted to Indy years earlier—the infamous Archimedes Dial, a device that purportedly holds the power to locate fissures in time.
An accomplished con-artist, Helena steals the Dial and swiftly departs the country to sell the artifact to the highest bidder. Left with no choice but to go after her, Indy dusts off his fedora and leather jacket for one final ride. Meanwhile, Indy’s old nemesis, Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), a former Nazi now working as a physicist in the U.S. space program, has his own plans for the Dial, a horrifying scheme that could change the course of world history.

Saying goodbye to a beloved character
In a recent press conference that Yahoo Life Singapore attended, Ford shared that reprising the role of Indiana Jones again doesn't feel different, but feels good: ""It feels good to me because I feel that we've made a really satisfying film for the audience. We've taken our concern, our interest in the character, and tried to shape a story that would bring this character back into their lives with an interesting story. And I think given the people that were involved in the character and nature of the story that Jim (director James Mangold) has created for us, it's a splendid goodbye.""
Director James Mangold then chimed in with his version of finishing this last Indy film: ""Look, when I've worked within the world of franchises, the thing that scares me most is I don't want to be making just a chapter in the middle of a kind of, mega expensive series. I'm pretty old-fashioned myself, and I kind of like the idea of a beginning, middle, and end to this particular story, and all the other ways it routes and connects to what's come before are wonderful but still there's this very old-fashioned idea of the kind of integrity of the thing itself.""
He added: So, one reason I said that is 'cause in both cases of Logan and this movie, what I'm trying to figure out is what is the story that we could tell that is unique to this film, this moment, these two hours. And in Logan, I knew we were making the last one, but it was a character who had spent almost all of his life tortured, a kind of Frankenstein living in a world where his choices were to be a weapon or to somehow try and hide himself from everybody. And so, death seemed, in a way, to be a kind of salvation for him. And in the way we tried to write it and stage, it was for the last 30 seconds of his life were probably the best 30 seconds of his life. That was not part of this movie. Indiana Jones is one of the most beautiful aspects of all the Indiana Jones films and I think led by Harrison's performance all these years.""

The best advice someone has shared with the cast members
Waller-Bridge credits writer and director Jay Walker for being her mentor. ""I think of it all the time, and it's by a brilliant writer and director called Jay Walker and he was a mentor for me when I was coming out of drama school, and everyone else thought I was such a waste of space. And he was really like, ""No, you got something weird and don't keep going for it."" [laugh] I was doing a play, and he says, ""You have to bleep this play up the bleep.""
Ford recalled a piece of advice given to another actor and shared, ""Actually, my advice was usurped by Phoebe’s story, but beautifully told. But I'm told that Marlon Brando offered a piece of advice to a fellow actor, and it came in this form, he's said to have said, ""You can't care or they'll see it on your face,"" which I guess is the same thing. And I think that maybe people that don't have any experience similar to us may misunderstand what that means. It means [laugh], you've got to care. You got to care deeply but you can't care for success. You just got to care about being there.""

,Harrison Ford Opens Up About Embracing Indiana Jones' 'Final Chapter' in 'Dial of Destiny' (Exclusive),"The iconic explorer is headed out on one last adventure in 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,' out June 30.","Harrison Ford is ready to say goodbye to Indiana Jones -- but first, one last adventure!
""That music follows me everywhere I go,"" Ford joked of composer John Williams' iconic theme music for the beloved franchise. ""They were playing it over speakers in the operating room when I did my last colonoscopy!""
Ford and director James Mangold sat down with ET's Nischelle Turner this week to discuss the fifth and final installment in the Indiana Jones franchise, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
For Mangold, taking over the franchise from legendary director Steven Spielberg was intimidating, not only as a fan of Ford's, but also as a filmmaker who grew up being inspired by Spielberg and George Lucas, who created the beloved films and franchises that the actor is best known for.
""To find myself, not only being lucky enough to be a movie director, but to be a movie director who's collaborating with his heroes on a personal level, yes, feels like an honor,"" he marveled. ""And to have it be so warm, and such a wonderful experience, was really one of the thrills of my life.""
""And mine, because I've always wanted to do this. A final chapter,"" Ford agreed. ""For Indiana Jones, I wanted to see him at the end of his career, at the end of the road that we've established. We've taken him part of the way, I wanted to take us all the way.""
Both Ford and Mangold admit that sending a octogenarian Indy on another adventure was ""a big gamble,"" but the actor was happy to ""embrace"" the challenge.
""I wanted him to not run away from the age of the character, but to embrace it, to tell the story of a man who's spent his life this particular way, and what it comes to,"" Ford shared. ""That ride wouldn't have come if he hadn't fallen so low. It wouldn't have been the ride that it is and wouldn't have ended the way that it does. And it ends in a beautiful way.""
One of the biggest challenges in Dial of Destiny actually came in creating the younger version of Indy -- who is seen in flashbacks and created with the use of archival footage. However, Ford also performed all of the scenes in order to add his live-action mannerisms to the CGI-generated flashback.
""It's also him, meaning the guy doing all that is him,"" Mangold shared. ""I think that a lot of the credit goes to the fact that we're using the real guy, you know, it's not anyone who can just drive this technology and just produce a character. What's most clear to me is watching how particular the expressions and vernacular the language of Indiana Jones is developed by Harrison. No one does all that stuff quite that way.""

""It was gratifying to know that we were doing something that we both believed in, that we had a passion for,"" Ford agreed. ""And that we did. We did it. Really, we've really worked hard... Completing the job itself was like completing the character.""

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is in theaters June 30.

Despite having a “small role,” a London teacher got the opportunity of a lifetime, landing a gig as an actor in the new film “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.”

Mohammed Kamel, 46, was “one of the bad guys” who had the honor of being struck with a booze bottle by none other than “Fleabag” actress Phoebe Waller-Bridge.

And the six-week stint, he revealed, earned him a bigger paycheck than his role as an educator.

“What you make in a month teaching, you do that in a week or five days of acting,” Kamal, who comes from “humble beginnings,” told Metro UK. “It’s four times or five times as good. And, you know, I’m in a small role. I’m not one of the big stars.”

He even got to meet Harrison Ford, 80, the adventure flick’s titular character and Kamal’s self-proclaimed “hero.”

5 “What you make in a month teaching, you do that in a week or five days of acting,” he said. Jack Dredd/Shutterstock

But after roles in Netflix‘s “The Crown,” Apple TV‘s “Liaison” and now “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” Kamel came back to London with a spiffy Hollywood reputation, which he said is “overwhelming.”

His proud students insisted on taking selfies with their beloved instructor, and Kamal said his pupils were “excited” to be reunited.

“It’s like London buses, you’re waiting for an acting role to come along since the COVID lockdown, and three come at once,” the aspiring screen actor said.

“It was the best weeks of my professional life, and my life in general.”

While it seemed to be glitz and glam, the school teacher dished that the food wasn’t much better than a grade-school cafeteria.

“It was a bit better than school dinners, but not much,” he said.

But he didn’t have much to complain about — he said he snagged the role when “Indiana Jones” producers scouted him after seeing “The Crown.”

“I hardly had to audition for ‘Indiana Jones,'” he admitted, though when he was hired, Kamal was forced to sign an NDA before even knowing “what the film was.”

In fact, when he showed up to set, he “figured it out” by taking note of the set design, props and overhearing conversations.

“I didn’t want to tell them I didn’t know what it was, you know,” he said.

“I could just tell from the props, from hanging around Pinewood [Studios],” he recalled. “I could overhear the costume department talking about ‘Harrison.'”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2LzMwL2ltLWEtdGVhY2hlci10aGUtcGF5Y2hlY2staS1nb3QtZm9yLWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtc2hvY2tlZC1tZS_SAV9odHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8zMC9pbS1hLXRlYWNoZXItdGhlLXBheWNoZWNrLWktZ290LWZvci1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLXNob2NrZWQtbWUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director James Mangold has explained why beloved character Short Round doesn’t appear in the franchise’s latest flick.

The action adventure movie hit screens this week, and sees Harrison Ford, 80, return to his famous role which he first played all the way back in 1981.

While there’s plenty of new faces in the fifth and final instalment, including Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen and Antonio Banderas, Short Round has not returned.

Seen in 1984’s Temple of Doom, the character was played by Ke Huy Quan, who took an acting hiatus before coming back with a bang in the blockbuster 2022 movie Everything Everywhere All at Once.

His performance was praised, with the actor, 51, picking up a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild Award and an Academy Award for his role.

When the movie also won Best Picture at the Oscars, he was reunited with Ford, who presented the award after which they embraced in a tearful hug.

While some people may have though there might be a chance Ke could be seen in the final Indiana Jones movie, it’s not the case, and now James has explained exactly why.

When asked whether he had considered revisiting the character, he said it hadn’t crossed his mind.

‘I already had my two grown-ups in the movie, so I was kind of… it didn’t occur to me,’ he said.

Even if he had wanted to, it likely would have proved difficult as Ke was filming at the time.

‘Certainly Ke was, I think, shooting Everything Everywhere All at Once while we were making this movie, so I kind of hadn’t anything to kind of call out to me and go, “This is who you should bring back”,’ Mangold said.

However he added that he was’ ‘thrilled when I saw that movie and saw [Ke] finding a voice in movies again as a grown-up actor – and in one obviously that was so profoundly successful, and talked to so many people,’ he added when speaking to Radio Times.

As a child actor Ke rose to fame for his role in Indiana Jones, going on to play Data in 1985’s The Goonies.

Following some roles in the 1990s, he took an almost 20-year acting hiatus during which he worked as a stunt choreographer and assistant director.

While Harrison is hanging up his iconic hat, he recently said he had no plans to retire from acting.

Instead he explained he wanted to keep working because it helped him feel ‘useful’.

He also claimed he didn’t ‘do well’ when he hadn’t got any projects on the horizon.

When asked about the possibility of retirement, he admitted: ‘I don’t do well when I don’t have work. I love to work… I love to feel useful. It’s my Jones, I want to be helpful.’

The actor also said he loved the ‘intensity and intimacy of collaboration’ of working on a film set, he added when speaking to CNN host Chris Wallace, via Deadline.

6/30/2023 23:01,‘Indiana Jones’ Director ’Refuses’ to Make a Spinoff Movie,Don’t expect an Indiana Jones spinoff from James Mangold.,"James Mangold recently made it clear that while he’s happy to be involved with the new Indiana Jones movie, he’s not interested in making spinoffs. Specifically, he's not interested in telling a story centered around Helena Shaw, played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.

Helena is a new character, but she does have some important connections to the older entries in the franchise. She's Indy’s goddaughter, and the son of one of his best friends, Basil Shaw. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny centers around something Basil Shaw spent a lot of his life obsessing over, the Dial of Destiny. Indy and Helena come together to hunt for it before it falls into the hands of Jürgen Voller, played by Mads Mikkelsen.

Since news of Waller-Bridge’s prominence in the film emerged, rumors began to swirl about Helena becoming the new face of the franchise moving forward. Given the fact that Harrison Ford has said that this will be the very last time he shows up as Indiana Jones, clearly any future movies would not center around him.

When the director of the new film, James Mangold was asked about the possibility of a spin-off about Helena, he seemed pretty steadfast in his answer.

I’m not interested. I refuse. I just can’t do it ... The amount of lore and Easter eggs and fan service starts to become antithetical to any of this stuff at a certain point. It isn’t storytelling anymore. It’s large-scale advertising.

While this take makes sense, these sequels can quickly lend themselves to just becoming a nostalgic easter-egg fest instead of telling an actual story... It seems kind of contradictory. If Indiana Jones and the Dial Of Destiny is completely devoid of fan service, fans will feel cheated. If there's too much, people are going to check out. There's a very fine line to be walked here.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny will open in theaters on June 30.

,What Parents Need To Know Before Seeing The New Indiana Jones Movie With Your Kids,"'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' is sure to be action-packed, but should kids watch it? Here's everything parents need to know.","Indiana Jones is coming back for a fifth, and final time. Just watching the trailer for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is enough to get those of us who grew up watching Indy on the big screen excited, especially once that iconic theme song starts up. After the critically panned fourth installment Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull failed to impress, this new adventure looks like it’s really getting back to the roots of what made the franchise great. Including some gritty action sequences, of course, that could prove a bit too much for younger kids. Here’s what else parents need to know.

Indy gets pulled out of retirement to stop the Nazis yet again in the fifth movie.

“Finding himself in a new era, approaching retirement, Indy wrestles with fitting into a world that seems to have outgrown him,” the official synopsis of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny reads. “But as the tentacles of an all-too-familiar evil return in the form of an old rival, Indy must don his hat and pick up his whip once more to make sure an ancient and powerful artifact doesn't fall into the wrong hands.”

Harrison Ford reprises his role as Indiana Jones, of course, while Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge plays his new sidekick/goddaughter and Mads Mikkelson plays bad guy Jürgen Voller as only he can. Longtime fans of the franchise will be happy to see Jonathan Rhys-Davies reprise his role as Indy’s friend Soller, while Karen Allen comes back as the archaeologist’s first love Marion Ravenwood.

Indiana Jones gets older (and younger).

The trailer for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny sees the archaeologist looking hilariously uncomfortable trying to make his way as a teacher in the late ‘60s where he feels irrelavent. He is comforted by his goddaughter who has an ulterior motive for bring Jones out of his retirement; she wants him to help her find the Dial of Destiny which could “change the course of history.” Unfortunately Nazi Voller is also hoping to get his hands on it to go back and correct Hitler’s “mistakes.” Through flashbacks to his time as a daredevil archaeologist in the ‘40s, we get to see a de-aged Ford as well as an older Indy. It’s quite something.

What is Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny rated?

Much like earlier movies in the franchise, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is rated PG-13 for scenes of violence and action, language and smoking. Common Sense Media recommended Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark for kids over the age of 11 years old due to its high body count and genuinely frightening scenes. The same held true for the following three movies, and will most likely hold true for this one. Kids over the age of 11 will get a kick out of it, but it’s probably not great for younger kids.

When can you watch Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny?

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny premieres in theaters on June 30. This will be the last one, so grab your older kids and get ready to go on one final adventure with Indy.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbXBlci5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LWFnZS1yYXRpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-15 13:43:34+00:00,Phoebe Waller-Bridge On Her ‘Indiana Jones’ Future: “First I’ve Ever Heard Of It!”,"Will Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Helena Shaw lead the 'Indiana Jones' franchise in the future? Says the actress: ""First I've ever heard of it!""","20 SHARES Facebook Twitter

“Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny” got the red carpet treatment in with its Disney premiere in LA yesterday (and an additional press screening in NYC). And the cast of the new “Indy” installment was there to help promote the film, Phoebe Waller-Bridge among them. So does the actress have any scoop on the franchise’s future and whether or not she’s part of it? Deadline reports they asked Waller-Bridge about that, and her answer may surprise fans.

So, will the “Fleabag” actress be the one to don Indy’s fedora after Harrison Ford retires? “First I’ve ever heard of it!” she responded when asked that question. In “Dial Of Destiny,” Waller-Bridge plays Helena Shaw, Indy’s goddaughter, a whip-smart but slippery young woman trying to track down this film’s prized artifact, the Antikythera mechanism. As Indy’s primary protege in the new film, it’s widely speculated that Helena would take over as the franchise lead from here on out, much like fans expected Shai LaBeouf to do so after “Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Cyrstal Skull.”

Thankfully, that didn’t happen with LaBeouf’s Mutt. And now, according to Waller-Bridge, it probably won’t happen with Helena either. In fact, the actress sounds like she’s happy she even starred in one “Indiana Jones” film. “It’s not something I’d ever imagine I’d be a part of,” the actress continued, “so every single day felt like a dream.” Waller-Bridge also said “Dial Of Destiny” is a “beautiful closing chapter” for Indiana Jones, which ostensibly means the franchise will end here.

But of course, Lucasfilm and Disney love to milk their franchises for all their worth. There’s talk of an “Indiana Jones” series for Disney+, which would continue the brand in some capacity. And “The Dial Of Destiny” hit theaters fifteen years after the last “Indy” film in 2008, so it’s not as if time is of the essence for the franchise to carry on. But bear in mind that Ford is now 80: it’s safe to say this new film is the last time he’ll carry Indy’s whip.

As for Waller-Bridge’s future, she’s on an overall deal with Amazon thanks to the success of “Fleabag.” The first thing the actress works on after that award-winning series will be a series adaptation of the Claudia Lux novel “Sign Here,” currently in development. But don’t expect that out for a while, given the WGA writers’ strike. And Waller-Bridge hinted at another project she’s working on, too. “It’s all very much the Writers Strike at the moment, so, we’re all taking a break,” said the actress. “But if that all gets sorted, I’m working on “Tomb Raider.””

So even if “Dial Of Destiny” ends up the last “Indiana Jones” film, Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s adventuring days are far from over. “Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny” hits theaters in two weeks on June 30.

2023-07-02 15:12:00+00:00,‘Indiana Jones’ & The Box Office Of Doom: Why ‘Dial Of Destiny’ At $60M Opening Isn’t Setting Records For Franchise Finale – Updated Box Office,'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' is looking at a box office opening weekend of $60 million to $65 million in the U.S.,"SUNDAY AM Writethru Final after Saturday AM Update: Even though Disney/Lucasfilm‘s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is looking to hit the bottom rung of its tracking projection of $60M Sunday morning, there’s no question this is a disastrous result for the finale to a historically beloved franchise film. C’mon, Indiana Jones is one of the reasons Disney shelled out $4 billion for Lucasfilm. Global start here at $130M, is $10M less than what we were seeing; Nancy will have more. The fan-loathed Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had a $272.1M global start, unadjusted for inflation/currency swings back in 2008.
A few things to stomach: Not only did 2018’s Star Wars spinoff bomb Solo open higher than Dial of Destiny, with $84.4M 3-day/$103M 4-day, but so did Paramount’s seventhquel Transformers: Rise of the Beasts ($61M) in May.
How could Disney and Lucasfilm mess this up?
On Saturday, I learned from a key source that Indiana Jones and the Dial Destiny, before $100M in estimated P&A, cost a mindboggling $300M-plus. Much higher than the $250M-$295M that’s been leaked out there. Disney doesn’t comment on budgets, and I’m getting some pushback. But the high price tag here is due to the start and stops of production during Covid; Harrison Ford‘s $20M fee; Steven Spielberg reaping a huge producing fee, which is standard; and I’m told director James Mangold got a pretty penny. All that said, it stands to reason that Disney would invest greatly here to revive a franchise; its spent $259M on The Force Awakens in 2015. The point is, for what the studio spent, it’s not getting anywhere near Star Wars box office results.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has been destined to live in a Temple of Box Office Doom since world premiering at Cannes to lackluster reviews. This resulted in landing like a wet towel on tracking three weeks ago, with projections not budgeting. This despite the fact that Dial of Destiny had a marketing and publicity global campaign louder than The Flash, with$90M in promotional partners and the cast doing several interviews.
It’s baffling that a storied franchise can end on a downer note at the box office in its finale. I found the movie out of Cannes to be too plug-and-play, laden in tropes of the franchise, from the kid sidekick to videogame-like action to it’s his goddaughter (not his dad) as his other sidekick. It completely lacked the breadth and nuance that Spielberg provided in action scenes of the older films. And I’m a James Mangold fan! He knows how to make a styled and dramatically charged movie just like Spielberg, whether it’s Ford v. Ferrari, Logan or Walk the Line.
I’m not too far off in my take on the film: CinemaScore audiences gave Dial of Destiny a B+, which isn’t that far from the previous unloved 2008 installment, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which landed a B.
So what the hell went wrong here with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny?
Lucasfilm is so precious and fastidious when it comes to developing Star Wars properties, and the legend with Indiana Jones is that these movies could never be made unless George Lucas and Spielberg (and Harrison Ford) saw eye-to-eye on the script. Remember all the TLC that J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kadsan took in hatching Force Awakens? There were stories of them walking down NYC streets, going back and forth on storylines. Given the black eye that Lucasfilm took from fans on The Last Jedi, The Rise of Skywalker and Solo, it is careful not to just rush and dump sequels nowadays (thus, the safety of building out the franchise on Disney+), which is why it’s taken them so long to bake the next Star Wars sequels. All of this makes the misfire with Dial of Destiny so concerning.

The biggest problem with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is that there were no efforts here to cast-it-up and make it appealing to an under-40, diverse crowd, like Paramount did with Top Gun: Maverick. Dial of Destiny was conceived for the hardcore Indy fans, which are dudes over 50. This is evident in the B- that Dial of Destiny received from 18-24 moviegoers. Disney reports that 42% of the audience was under 35 for Dial of Destiny.
I’m told from a few insiders that this movie did not have the behind-the-scenes calamity melodrama of such Lucasfilm titles as Rogue One (which had Tony Gilroy doing reshoots and rewrites on the Gareth Edwards-directed film) and Solo: A Star Wars Story (which had the ungracious firing of Lord & Miller and Ron Howard rescue), installments that required major surgery during production. No melodrama meaning everyone got along, with Mangold calling the production and Lucasfilm boss/Indy producer Kathleen Kennedy and producer Frank Marshall “family” at Cannes. Spielberg loved and signed off on the script by Mangold and his Ford v. Ferrari scribes, Jez and John Henry Butterworth, and that’s a challenging bar to clear.
On Saturday I heard that several editors were brought in to get this one right. It’s unfortunately apparent here that the sublime which Mangold delivered to the X-Men franchise with the R-rated Logan did not translate to Indiana Jones.
To date, Indy co-franchise architect Lucas has remained silent about his thoughts on Dial of Destiny.
I’ve gotten clarity on the whole thing about inflated test scores. While Disney typically uses a “friends and family” testing system so that no spoilers are leaked in advance, I’m now told Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny never tested. Take what you will from that.
Still, it’s so not like Disney to stick its head out there on a chopping block by launching so-so movies on a global stage when they’re not ready. The studio plots the marketing campaigns for their tentpoles like D-Day. Both of these planned tentpoles’ commercial potential went out the window the minute Disney took them to Cannes. Why did Elemental and Dial of Destiny go to the Croisette? To eventize them to overseas audiences, who aren’t as cynical as U.S. auds when it comes to sizing up a blockbuster. Plus, after Pixar was imprisoned on Disney+ during Covid, Disney had to show the world that family toon brand was truly back on the big screen. True, had both titles skipped Cannes, the Band-Aid would have been ripped off at some point in time. However, perhaps keeping the lid longer on these lukewarm movies and away from the press would have increased some box office revenue here on this crazy-expensive sequel.
But here’s the consistent problem Indiana Jones has had at the box office and with critics, and that is, he’s always been in competition with himself. Raiders of the Lost Ark really blew audiences away back in 1981, bringing new life to the old adventure serial movies. The pic grossed more than $212M in its initial release and had multiple reissues making its way to $248.1M. That’s been the gold standard against which all Indy sequels have been compared, and well, he generally comes up short. Read on.

I think to this day that Part 2, 1984’s Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, remains the best sequel; it’s as edgy as hell. C’mon, it has a villain who pulls hearts of people and makes human sacrifices! It’s a PG movie that prompted the MPA to create a PG-13 rating because it scared the heck out of kids. However, I’ll never forget back then in the whip-and-buggy days before Rotten Tomatoes that critics loathed the movie. Variety’s then-critic — and Deadline’s current — Todd McCarthy, slammed Temple of Doom, writing, “The pic comes on like a sledgehammer, and there’s even a taste of vulgarity and senseless excess not apparent in Raiders.” That sentiment played out at the box office, where Temple of Doom saw its final domestic gross of $179.1M off 15% from Raiders of the Lost Ark‘s first-run gross. Temple of Doom didn’t receive the rereleases at the box office like Raiders did, as it has its fans and nonfans. Spielberg and Lucas were able to please fans with the Sean Connery-fueled Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which landed an A CinemaScore in 1989 (during the exit-poll firm’s early days) and boost domestic box office by 10% to $197.1M.

So why did the critically not-loved Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (77% on RT, just like Temple of Doom), wind up being the franchise’s highest-grossing film, with a massive $100M-plus opening, and 3x leg-out to $317M stateside? Because it was coming off of Last Crusade, which was quite beloved, and there was an appetite from moviegoers to see the sequel because there hadn’t been an Indiana Jones film in close to two decades. But despite its blockbuster success in a vibrant, stadium-seating exhibition era, not many people liked Crystal Skull — hello, B CinemaScore. And that sequel, too, also doted and joked around about Indy going gray. Unlike 007, the same actor has always played Indiana Jones. The franchise’s legacy with Ford has prevented it from being rebooted with a new leading actor.
Which leads us to Dial of Destiny‘s blah results. Why so low? Because it’s coming off of a sequel not many loved, and it’s playing the same game of Indiana Jones getting older. Couple that with sour reviews coming out of Cannes, plus the finale’s older skewing audience (42% over 45) who are slow to come to cinemas, and here we are with a less-than-stellar box office result.
While Comscore/Screen Engine’s PostTrak exits show a 93% recommending Dial of Destiny (combined from the yes or probably recommend category) and 8% not recommending, dig further in morning’s report and you’ll find a more-telling stat about how no one is rushing to Dial of Destiny: Only 9% heard it was good from friends and family.
Paramount’s ‘Transformers: Rise of the Beasts’ (Everett Collection) Paramount
Here’s the box office surprise no one was expecting this summer: At an opening of $61M, Paramount’s long-in-the-tooth franchise sequel Transformers: Rise of the Beasts opened higher than high-gloss pics including Dial of Destiny and The Flash. The latter DC film counts a running total at end of Weekend 3 of $99.2M; that’s 19% behind the running total of Rise of the Beasts at the same point in time. OMG. Rise of the Beasts currently a running total of $136.1M at end of Weekend 4. Can Dial of Destiny even outgross Rise of the Beasts by the end of the summer? Who the hell knew we’d be having this conversation??
Dial of Destiny‘s problems, to a certain degree, aren’t that different from The Flash‘s: More than Ezra Miller’s lack of publicity on that DC film and tabloid dilemmas, that DC movie at the end of the day was a B CinemaScore film and way too long at 2 hours and 24 minutes. Dial of Destiny has a similar grade and is also too long at 2 hours and 34 minutes.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Harrison Ford were hoping to discover big bucks this weekend Disney
More diagnostics on Dial of Destiny:
PostTrak’s audience is 79% and four stars. The leading guy 25+ ticket buyers at 43% are giving it a 77% grade. That’s not good. Overall, men are giving a 74% grade on a 58% turnout.
Here’s what’s interesting: Even though just 10% came to see Phoebe Waller-Bridge as the female lead in the movie, women like Dial of Destiny better than men with a 85% grade. Women over 25, who showed up at 35%, give it an 86%.
The older Dial of Destiny‘s audience gets, the better the grades with the 45-55 sect (19% turnout) giving it 83% and the over-55 people (at 23%) giving it 89%.
Diversity demos weren’t that diverse with 54% Caucasian (79% grade), 18% Latino and Hispanic (80%), Black at 10% (73%) and Asian 13% (80%).
Dial of Destiny played best in the West, Mountain and Midwest, with PLF, Imax, Screen Box, D box driving 35% of the weekend. Broken down that’s 21% from PLF, 11% from Imax, 3% from combined 4D, D-box and Screen X. Disney’s El Capitan in Los Angeles is the top-grossing theater with $114K running cume through end of Friday.
All tickets sales for movies are at $125M off 34% from a year ago, per Comscore, which was led by Universal/Illumination’s Minions: The Rise of Gru with $140.6M over its holiday Friday-Tuesday (July 4th fell on a Monday). Indiana Jones is expected to be around $82M over its five days, around -40% less Minions take last year — who’da thunk?

Yikes, this movie is opened lower than Paws of Fury last summer. The results here make Strange World‘s 3-day of $12M look like a blockbuster. Just kidding. But seriously, we can’t take potshots at Pixar and ignore the fact here that a DreamWorks movie which cost $70M before P&A tanked. What’s the lesson here? Don’t make animated movies that have unknown protags in the title, and animation that looks like Strange World. Ruby Gillman‘s few moviegoers gave it a surprising A- CinemaScore, the same as last summer’s Paws of Fury. For the record, it’s higher than the B which Strange World got. PostTrak exits, which are always harder than CinemaScore, at 68% positive, however, kids under 12 said 91%. Moms leading, of course at 52% females, 64% between 18-34, biggest demo being 18-24 at 42%.

FRIDAY AFTERNOON UPDATE: Harrison Ford’s swan song as the man in the hat, the guy with the whip, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (read the review), is looking very similar to a pair of other older-leaning franchise pics aimed at guys, 2021’s No Time to Die and 2018’s Mission: Impossible – Fallout, with a Friday of $24M. That’s around the neighborhood of the first Friday of those two movies.
That means last night’s previews repped 30% of today’s gross. The $250M installment directed by James Mangold and produced by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas still is on track for a $60M-$65M 3-day and, rolling in Monday and July 4th Tuesday, should see around $85M for the 5-day. The Disney/Lucasfilm finale sequel is booked at 4,600 theaters.
Universal/DreamWorks Animation’s Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken (read the review) isn’t wowing as expected with a $2.5M Friday (including Thursday previews of $725K) and $6M Friday-Sunday take outside the top five.
We’ll have more as it comes. Here’s the chart:
1.) Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (Dis) 4,600 theaters, Fri $24M, 3-day $60M-$65M/Wk 1
2.) Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Sony) 3,405 theaters, Fri $3.6M (-37%), 3-day $12.4M (-35%)/Total $340.7M /Wk 5

UPDATED after EXCLUSIVE: Disney/Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny came in at $7.2 million in previews Thursday, per Disney. We heard last night that the pic was heading for $6 million-$7.5 million. That’s where previous older-skewing action-guy comps live.
RELATED: Harrison Ford: Deadline’s How They Reached The Top
We’re specifically referencing the Thursday night starts of No Time to Die, which grossed $6.3M (started at 4 p.m.) before its $55.2M opening weekend in October 2021, and Mission: Impossible – Fallout, which made $6M before its $61.2M weekend start in 2018. Dial of Destiny, which started previews at 3 p.m. Thursday, is expected to gross between $60M-$65M at 4,500 theaters, making is the second-highest stateside opening for the Steven Spielberg-George Lucas franchise after 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which posted a five-day opening of $151.9M, after a 3-day of $100.1M.
Crystal Skull didn’t have previews but opened fully on the Thursday before Memorial Day weekend with $25M at 4,260 theaters.
Dial of Destiny‘s Thursday night is below recent dude movies John Wick 4 ($8.9M, $74M 3-day) and Fast X ($7.5M, $67M).

Also previewing last night was Universal/DreamWorks Animation’s Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, with $725,000 from 2,700 theaters that started at 2 p.m. yesterday. No one is expecting this movie, which looks like it used the same animation style as Disney’s bomb Strange World, to do well, with an outlook in the single digits. Yes, original animation is hard to launch, but parents will see that 65% Rotten Tomatoes critics score and not waste their time. The pic’s Thursday is higher than the previews for Paramount’s toon misfire last July Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank, which did $505K from previews that started at 3 p.m.; that pic opened to $6.3M and finaled at $17.8M.

Why aren’t weekend projections for Dial of Destiny up to the same level as the previous chapter? It’s twofold: Part of that has to do with this Indy getting the worst reviews ever at 66% coming out of its Cannes Film Festival world premiere, but also, its audience is graying and on par with 007 franchise. You can’t say that Mission: Impossible is getting older just yet because a franchise-best start is expected for Dead Reckoning, with more than $100M over five days starting July 12. That sixth sequel should nab a Top Gun: Maverick halo effect.

Hopefully audiences are better on Dial of Destiny. Crystal Skull was slammed with a B CinemaScore after 1989’s Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with Sean Connery landed an A. Dial of Destiny is OK so far: 88% with Rotten Tomatoes audiences. Screen Engine/Comscore’s PostTrak shows 78% with general audiences and 3½ stars and a 59% definite recommend, while parents and kids under 12 are slightly better at 4 stars apiece and 82%. Turnout on Thursday night was 59% guys to 41% women.

What’s social media saying about Dial of Destiny? RelishMix reports: “Chatter on Indy 5 runs mixed-leaning-positive with fans who think ‘this will be a masterpiece, filled with heart-pounding action’ and that Ford as Indy will be missed as one the best heroes ever — along with adoration for John Williams’ historic contribution and career. Plus, there’s excitement for James Mangold at the helm as fans talk about their lives over the 39 years [of the] franchise and wish there had been more episodes. Hecklers are taking pot shots at everything from the story, throwback elements and cliché comments about sequels, but are nowhere as loud as lovers of the franchise.”

Social media universe for Dial of Destiny counts 296.4M across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube views “predominately on Lucas channels and cross-promoted on several Disney movie channels with brand tie-in spots which are also well integrated into the push,” says RelishMix. That figure is above Fallout‘s SMU of 234M but well below that of No Time to Die (692.5M), Top Gun: Maverick (401M) and Hobbs and Shaw (961.4M).
No Time to Die‘s Thursday previews repped 27% of its $23.3M first Friday, while Fallout‘s previews repped 26% of its $22.8M Friday. Indy here will, of course, have the extra legroom of the Monday and Tuesday in the extended holiday, though July 4th is always a downer day for moviegoing. No Time to Die, released in October 2021, drew 64% guys, 57% over 35, and Fallout pulled in 58% men, 41% of that demo over 25, and 17% under 25. Crystal Skull skewed 66% over 25 and with a third of its audience comprised of kids under 12 and parents.

Dial of Destiny will have the exhibition treasures of 400 Imax auditoriums, 900 PLF screens, 280 D-Box theaters and 85 Screen X hubs in its theater swath.
Logan filmmaker Mangold took over directing the finale from longtime franchise architect Spielberg. In this latest installment, Indy teams with his goddaughter (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) and is on the search for a device which, as Cher has always sung, “can turn back time.” If you thought Indy was old in Crystal Skull, he’s even older here, with the action taking place in 1969. That said, he’s still dealing with Nazis, one of them played by Mads Mikkelsen.
The rest of Thursday and this week:
Sony Animation’s Spider-Man: Across the Universe (read the review) wins the week with an estimated $30.6M at 3,785 in Week 4 after a Thursday of $2.38M, -16% from Wednesday and a running total of $328.3M.
Disney/Pixar’s Elemental (read the review) is second with a Week 2 of $30.4M, a Thursday of $2.4M and running total of $77.4M, 22% behind last summer’s Lightyear at the same point in time. The pic is booked at 4,035 theaters.
Sony’s No Hard Feelings (read the review) at 3,028 theaters ends Week 1 with a hearty $21.8M. While The Flash‘s second weekend edged out No Hard Feelings, $15.1M to $15M, Flash‘s second week ends with $21.8M as well after a $1.1M Thursday, -29% from Wednesday at 4,256 theaters. No Hard Feelings‘ Thursday was $1.37M, -13%.

The first half of 2023 comes to a close as the long Fourth of July weekend sees one last ride at the box office for one of film history’s most iconic characters.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny
Disney / Lucasfilm
June 30, 2023 (WIDE)
3-Day Opening Weekend Range: $60M-$77M
5-Day Opening Weekend Range: $80M-$103M
PROS:
Harrison Ford’s final performance as one of cinema’s most iconic heroes amps up the nostalgia factor for Dial of Destiny. The addition of co-star/co-writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge to the 42-year-old franchise may boost the film’s appeal among adult women.
Pre-sales have been a mixed bag. On the upside, Dial of Destiny‘s first 36 hours of sales are out-pacing Fast X and John Wick: Chapter 4 by 64 percent and 20 percent in key sample markets, respectively, as we approach the mid-week point.
Notable is the relative strength of pre-sales beyond coastal cities and across middle America. Friday pre-sales have also started outpacing Thursday’s previews as of Wednesday morning, with additional spread across the long weekend offering optimism.
Despite negative early reviews out of Cannes, Dial‘s Rotten Tomatoes score has climbed into “fresh” territory with a 66 percent mark as of Wednesday.
With a lack of significant competition for those wanting big-screen spectacle over the holiday weekend—no openers or holdovers reached $20 million last weekend—timing could be on Indy’s side. The film’s relatively open runway could also make it less front-loaded than the likes of comic book tentpoles or fellow Lucasfilm IP Star Wars.
While competition for the adult male audience will ramp up heavily in mid-July, Indiana Jones has a week-and-half window to capitalize on premium format screens and could still serve as the more family-friendly summer adventure option even after Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One and Oppenheimer arrive next month.
CONS:
On the other side of the pre-sale coin, Dial is lagging well behind the preview trends of other non-superhero tentpoles like Avatar: The Way of Water (by 50 percent), Jurassic World Dominion (44 percent), and Top Gun: Maverick (57 percent).
As noted in prior forecasts, franchise goodwill wasn’t exactly left at its peak 15 years ago when Kingdom of the Crystal Skull divided audiences. If early word of mouth isn’t predominately positive for Dial, its staying power could be stunted—especially given the aforementioned competition hitting the big screen in July.
The moviegoing audience has continued to trend younger, and Indiana Jones has not been at the forefront of pop culture in quite some time. Appealing to the under-25 crowd could be a struggle, as it doesn’t appear from marketing that the film has added any major elements for that consumer base.
To some extent, recent criticisms over how Disney has creatively handled Marvel, Star Wars, and other properties in recent years could have some negative splash effect on Indiana Jones as they share similar demographics and crossover fan circles.

Universal / DreamWorks Animation
June 30, 2023 (WIDE)
3-Day Opening Weekend Range: $6M-$9M
5-Day Opening Weekend Range: $8.5M-$12.5M
PROS:
Families with young daughters could be attracted to this option over the holiday period as a counter-programmer to the male-driven Indiana Jones sequel.
CONS:
In addition to Dial of Destiny swallowing up premium screen space, competition for family audiences could prove somewhat challenging, with Across the Spider-Verse, Elemental, and The Little Mermaid remaining significant players in the market.
Current projection ranges call for a 23% to 33% percent decrease from last weekend’s $106 million top ten aggregate.

2023-07-02 15:28:16+00:00,Box Office: ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Cursed With $60M Domestic Opening,Harrison Ford's 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' opened to a so-so $60 million at the U.,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny dug up an estimated $60 million in its domestic debut, a troubled start for the fifth and final installment in the famed adventure-action series starring Harrison Ford.
The hope now is that the Disney and Lucasfilm tentpole will hold in well, beginning this week as Americans celebrate the July Fourth holiday. The movie, directed by James Mangold, should finish Tuesday with a domestic total of $82 million.
Overseas, the movie launched to $70 million for a lackluster global start of $130 million. The U.K. led with $8.9 million. France — where Dial of Destiny made its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival — was No. 2, followed by Japan ($4.7 million), South Korea ($4.1 million) and Germany ($4.1 million). The pic bombed in China, however, with $2.3 million.
For Dial of Destiny, the challenge has always been about attracting new, younger fans in addition to those who grew up on the franchise. The movie, which suffered a series of delays, cost a hefty $295 million to make before marketing.
As it stood, the movie’s opening weekend audience skewed notably older, with 42 percent of tickets going to people 45 and up, including 23 percent 55 and older. That’s a breakdown rarely seen when it comes to a Hollywood summer tentpole. Even before the pandemic, older moviegoers weren’t known for rushing out to see a movie on opening weekend. The pic also skewed notably male (58 percent). On Saturday, families started turning up.
The filmmakers had hoped for a domestic launch closer to $65 million, but a B+ CinemaScore and tepid reviews are likely hampering word of mouth. One bright spot is the 88 percent positive audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.
Dial of Destiny is a sequel to 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which posted an impressive three-day debut of $100 million. Crystal Skull, like the first three Indy films, was directed by Steven Spielberg.
The Indiana Jones movie series once again sees Harrison Ford as the swashbuckling archeologist. The 80-year-old actor stars opposite Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Antonio Banderas, John Rhys-Davies, Toby Jones, Boyd Holbrook, Ethann Isidore and Mads Mikkelsen. (Spielberg helmed each of the previous four Indy films.)
Keeping the film series’ ongoing Nazi theme alive, Dial of Destiny’s storyline revolves around an ancient device being chased by Jones and a villain played by Mikkelsen.
Also opening over the pre-July Fourth weekend is DreamWorks Animation and Universal’s Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, which bombed with an estimated $5.2 million. The family pic came in No. 6. Overseas, Teenage Kraken opened to $7.6 million for a global start of $12.8 million.
Among holdovers, Sony’s Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse swung past the $600 million mark worldwide. The animated superhero pic placed No. 2 domestically with $11.5 million for a domestic total of $339.9 million. Overseas, it hit $267.4 million for a global total of $607.3 million.
Pixar and Disney’s Elemental continued to show legs after a troubled start, placing No. 3 domestically with $11.3 million for a North American total of $88.8 million. Overseas, where it continues to roll out, earned $29.8 million for a foreign tally of $98 million and $186.8 million worldwide.

2023-07-04 18:00:00+00:00,Box Office: ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Only Cracking $82 Million Through Fourth of July,"Harrison Ford's finale in ""The Dial of Destiny"" is still on track for an $82 million opening over the five-day frame.","“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is staying in line with some tempered box office expectations, still tracking to fall in line with estimates that had pegged the film with an opening between $80 million and $85 million through the Fourth of July holiday.
The Harrison Ford finale earned $11.8 million on Monday, pushing its domestic total to $71 million. Unlike some other holidays, Independence Day isn’t exactly the largest box office booster — with families hitting the beach, barbecuing red meat and waiting for fireworks, filmgoing isn’t exactly at the top of the agenda for most Americans. Rather, it’s the time off around the Fourth that can offer some extra lift to studio tentpoles.
And “Indiana Jones 5” needs all the lift it can get. An $82 million gross through the first five days of release shouldn’t be shabby for a legacy sequel from a more-than-40-year-old franchise, but “Dial of Destiny” is one of the most expensive films ever produced by Disney and Lucasfilm. The finale carries a production budget of $295 million. Along with an underwhelming debut overseas and upcoming July releases like “Oppenheimer” and “Mission: Impossible 7” that also look to target older viewers, things aren’t looking bright for “Indiana Jones.” $295 million. Why’d it have to be $295 million?
Whether it turned out to be a hit or a flop, “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” was always billed as the final entry in the globe-trotting action series. Ford reprises his role as the whip-cracking archeologist, teaming up with his goddaughter (played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge) to protect a powerful artifact from the hands of Nazis during the Space Age. James Mangold helmed the feature, taking over after franchise director Steven Spielberg exited the project during development.
The remainder of the top five remained steady through the weekend. Along with the top slot, Disney also claimed third with the Pixar romance “Elemental.” The animated adventure added $3 million on Monday to push its domestic total to $92 million, inching closer to surpassing the $100 million mark. It’d be a cause for celebration if it weren’t for the film’s $200 million production budget.
“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” added $3 million on Monday. The Sony release has now earned $343 million in North America, honing in on surpassing “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” ($355 million) to become the second highest-grossing domestic release of the year.
Sony also took fourth place with the Jennifer Lawrence comedy “No Hard Feelings,” which added $1.89 million on Monday. Domestic total is at $31 million.

2023-07-02 22:12:19+00:00,'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' opens with underwhelming $60m US box office,"Harrison Ford brought the legendary titular character Indiana Jones back to the big screen this weekend with “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” but its opening box office showing was lower than advance estimates.","CNN —
Harrison Ford brought the legendary titular character Indiana Jones back to the big screen this weekend with “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” but its opening box office showing was lower than advance estimates.
The movie grossed $60 million in the United States and $70 million internationally, bringing the fifth and final installment of the storied franchise’s global box office to $130 million on its 3-day opening.
“Dial of Destiny” reportedly cost nearly $300 million to make, which makes the open weekend box office numbers underwhelming and a tall hurdle for the movie to clear in order to profit.
The movie did open at number one despite mediocre reviews for Indy’s final chapter, and is projected to earn $82 million in its 5-day opening through the July 4 holiday weekend.
“Dial of Destiny” also appears to have been better received by fans than the franchise’s fourth installment, “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” although that film still grossed $100 million during its 2008 opening weekend.

Ford, who first portrayed Jones in 1981’s “Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark,” told CNN’s Chris Wallace in a June interview that he wanted to give fans, and the character, an ending that felt conclusive.
“I wanted it to be character driven and I wanted it to confront the question of age straight on – not to hide my age, but to take advantage of it in the telling of the story,” Ford said, adding he felt “very strongly” that they achieved that goal.
As for saying goodbye to the character that he’s played for over 40 years? “It’s time for me to grow up,” he joked.
The opening is one of several disappointing showings for big-budget movies at the box office this summer, with Warner Bros.’ “The Flash” and Pixar’s animated “Elemental” both falling well short of expectations. (Warner Bros., like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.)

,Indy 5's box office haul a disaster for Disney's Bob Iger,Dial of Destiny could end up with just half the receipts its panned predecessor earned 15 years ago and rival John Carter as Disney's biggest bomb.,"Lucasfilm’s fifth Indiana Jones installment is shaping up to be a disaster of epic proportions for parent company Disney and its veteran CEO, Bob Iger.
Released on June 30, Dial of Destiny earned a disappointing $60 million in its opening weekend in the domestic theaters, and interest dropped off sharply ever since. Just one week later, it surrendered the top spot at the box office, despite being one of the most expensive movies ever made, and now it has sunk to a distant fourth in the table.
The new entry could no longer rely on the goodwill built up by the first three films after the critical disappointment of its predecessor, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Poor reviews and dreadful word of mouth look to now sink Lucasfilm’s first theatrical release since 2019.
Its $302 million global take has only matched roughly the reported costs of its production budget, which suffered from expensive reshoots after test screenings indicated audiences were less than thrilled with the initial ending.
Marketing and promotion are expected to have added easily another $100 million to that bill and Disney still has to pay the theaters their share of the receipts.
“It looks certain to fall short of the global total for 2008’s Crystal Skull: $786.6 million,” wrote Box Office Pro on Sunday.
The situation is far more dire, according to The Hollywood Handle. Dial Of Destiny is not expected to even cross the $400 million mark in global box office receipts—half of what the fourth installment made 15 years ago when a dollar went a lot further than today.
This seems a safe bet given the stiff competition it now faces in the form of spy thriller Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning, Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s biopic Oppenheimer. In reality, the Indy sequel needed to haul in around $800 million just to break even.
Should the grim predictions prove true, the Lucasfilm production could potentially rival John Carter as the Mouse House’s worst-ever live-action commercial bomb and call into question the future of studio boss Kathleen Kennedy, a former Fortune Most Powerful Woman.
Iger has made it clear financial responsibility now goes hand in hand with creative decision-makers.
But it may have consequences for Disney, as well. The share price has been trading near nine-year lows when excluding the 2020 pandemic dip, and speculation continues over whether Iger may be forced to sell the company to Apple.
Disney and Lucasfilm did not respond to a request from Fortune for comment.
Hulu cash call
Iger, who had his original two-year boomerang CEO contract extended last week by two more, can ill afford any box office flops.
He’ll need billions in cash next year to complete the buyout of Comcast’s minority stake in streaming platform Hulu.
The problem is that Disney’s lineup this year, with the possible exception of Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume Three, has so far been middling at best.
Commercial disappointments include Marvel’s Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania, the live-action remake of its animated classic The Little Mermaid, Pixar’s Elemental and now Dial of Destiny.
The upcoming slate looks little better: November’s The Marvels has little positive buzz going for it, especially after a recent string of superhero movies failing to make a profit, including Warner Bros. Discovery’s The Flash.
To drum up cash for Hulu, Iger is now exploring the potential sale of some of his linear networks—whether free-to-air or cable. The Disney CEO has said that the business model that has historically underpinned their distribution of content is ‘definitely broken’ thanks to direct-to-consumer streaming.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8xOS9kaXNuZXktaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1kaWFsLWRlc3RpbnktYm94LW9mZmljZS1ib21iLWx1Y2FzZmlsbS_SAV9odHRwczovL2ZvcnR1bmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTkvZGlzbmV5LWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtZGlhbC1kZXN0aW55LWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYm9tYi1sdWNhc2ZpbG0vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-10 10:56:00+00:00,Indiana Jones 5 box office,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny hasn't sent Harrison Ford's Indy out on a high, but why has it been a disappointment at the box office?","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny was meant to be a glorious send-off for Harrison Ford's iconic character, but it hasn't exactly turned out that way.
Following a disappointing US box-office debut that came in below expectations, Indiana Jones 5 couldn't rebound in its second weekend and was overtaken by surprise chart-topper Insidious: The Red Door.
It's the latest blockbuster to disappoint at the box office and leaves Hollywood in need of Tom Cruise to save it again with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. Equally, its saviour could come with Barbie and/or Oppenheimer, but wherever it comes, it won't be from a miraculous Indy recovery.
But why has Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny been a box-office flop? Let's investigate.
Disney
Before we get into the reasons why, here's where Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny stands at the end of its second weekend of release.
In the US, the movie dropped 56% from its opening weekend to add $26.5 million for $121.2 million to date. Including its overseas haul of $126.7 million, Indiana Jones 5 has grossed $247.9 million so far.
A sign of how poorly it's done so far is that it's still ranking as the lowest-grossing Indiana Jones movie of the series, even though the original trilogy was released in the 1980s and no adjustment for inflation has been taken into account.
By the end of its run, Indiana Jones 5 should have overtaken Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom ($333.1 million), but Raiders of the Lost Ark ($389.9 million) isn't guaranteed to be surpassed by the new movie. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade ($474.2 million) and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull ($790.7 million) are too far ahead.
If there's comfort to be had, it's that the new Indy movie will at least overtake fellow flop The Flash, currently at $261.6 million worldwide. Whatever happens in the coming weeks though, it will still remain a box-office failure.
Disney
Assuming Indiana Jones 5 ends up around $350 million to $400 million, it's a final result that some other 2023 blockbusters, like The Flash, would happily take. But a key part of why it's being viewed as such a flop is that it cost a lot of money.
The reported budget for the movie is around $300 million and, typically, a movie would need to make 2.5 times its budget before it starts hitting profit. That factors in a marketing spend that, for Indy 5, was reported by Deadline to be roughly $100 million. It means the movie would have to make at least $750 million before it would become profitable.
It's safe to say now that figure won't be hit and while the movie might rebound on home entertainment and streaming, it's certain to be a failure at the cinema. The same budgetary issue hit the likes of The Flash (estimated $200 million budget) and Fast X (estimated $340 million budget).
Put simply, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny was just too expensive to make, and its appeal was greatly overestimated. But it's also possible that Disney's marketing strategy just didn't work out in that case either, kneecapping the movie before it even started its release.
Disney+
More than a month before its cinema release, Indiana Jones 5 received a splashy world premiere at Cannes Film Festival. It worked for Top Gun: Maverick in 2022, hyping up the release, but for Indy 5, it did anything-but.
The movie debuted with the worst reviews of the series to date, even lower than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It's rebounded in the month since and now stands at a respectable 69% on Rotten Tomatoes, but still ranks as the lowest-rated movie of the series.
Rather than hyping it up as a must-see blockbuster, these initial reactions likely heightened fan fears that we had another Crystal Skull on our hands (even though that movie has had a reappraisal in years since). When the more positive reviews did land, they still weren't exactly lauding it as a must-see.
Dedicated Indiana Jones fans wouldn't have been put off, but the wider audience that might go and see a new blockbuster would have been. Adding in the 'it'll be on soon' belief, it's not really a surprise that the movie failed to uncover gold at the box office.
Disney
Significant blockbuster competition arrives this week with the new Mission: Impossible movie, before a much-talked about double bill of Barbie and Oppenheimer on July 21. Indiana Jones 5 needed to make hay when it was the only blockbuster in town, and it couldn't do that.
Even without the massive budget, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny would have still been seen as a box-office disappointment given the numbers, yet it certainly heightens the feeling of failure.
Indy deserved a big send-off, but he'll end up getting buried among other notable high-profile 2023 flops.

Fifteen years after its last installment, the Indiana Jones franchise returns to theaters on June 30 with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Sharing a release date with the film is Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, the latest from animation studio DreamWorks. Early analysis and forecasts for those two films, as well as the latest forecasting updates on June’s releases, are below.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny
Disney / Lucasfilm
June 30, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $81M-$111M
Domestic Total Range: $225M-$380M
PROS:
The prospect of a new chapter in the Indiana Jones saga has ignited fan excitement in the years since Lucasfilm announced they’d pursue the film; Harrison Ford returning to one of his most iconic roles is a big plus, as is the presence of director James Mangold (Ford v Ferrari, Logan) behind the camera.
Social media chatter has been mostly positive throughout the movie’s long production history.
A wave of nostalgia helped Top Gun: Maverick surpass $126M over the first three days of its Memorial Day weekend opening last year; if Dial of Destiny manages to appeal to adult audiences, it could get a similar bump.
If those adult audiences show up with families in tow, as happened with Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in 2008, Dial of Destiny could end up more back-loaded than the typical franchise film.
The fourth of July comes the Tuesday following Dial‘s release—meaning Disney could, essentially, be viewing the Friday-Tuesday window as a five-day opening weekend.
Early pre-sales are respectable when given proper context, i.e. the glut of male- and fan-driven films opening before Dial of Destiny hits theaters in June. The film is currently pacing ahead of John Wick: Chapter 4 and Fast X.
CONS:
A monkey on Dial of Destiny‘s back is the mixed reputation of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the only other Indiana Jones film to come out this century. It’s no secret that Kingdom divided Indiana Jones fans upon its release in 2008, becoming the target of numerous memes and drawing comparisons to the Star Wars prequels.
Early critics’ reviews from the film’s Cannes Film Festival premiere have been mixed; the film currently stands at 49% approval on Rotten Tomatoes.
A mixed critical reception doesn’t always mean family audiences will stay at home—see The Super Mario Bros. Movie—but if families do stay away from Dial of Destiny, Indy’s final adventure could prove more front-loaded than Kingdom.
A gauntlet of summer competition lies ahead of Dial of Destiny, with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning: Part One, Barbie, and Oppenheimer, among others, coming to cinemas in July.
Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken
Universal / DreamWorks Animation
June 30, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $13M-$18M
Domestic Total Range: $38M-$66M
PROS:
The female-leaning animated comedy/adventure could serve as a solid counter-programmer against the more male-focused Dial of Destiny.
Ruby Gillman opens in the third weekend of release for Elemental, the latest from Pixar. That film is currently generating mixed critics’ reviews, which could help Ruby Gillman‘s chances as a potential sleeper hit.
CONS:
Though family audiences have definitely returned to theaters—see the success of The Bad Guys, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie—DreamWorks’ original animated films are challenging to forecast in an era when Illumination has taken over as the dominant brand and films like Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse offer cutting-edge animation that appeals strongly to today’s younger audiences.
The aforementioned Across the Spider-Verse, if it enjoys good word of mouth like its 2018 predecessor, could still be drawing in family audiences a month after its June 2 release.

2023-06-23 16:00:00+00:00,How Much Money Will Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny Make At The Box Office? Not Enough,"Fortune and glory, kid.","How Much Money Will Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny Make At The Box Office? Not Enough
Virtually ever since Disney purchased Lucasfilm for more than $4 billion in 2012, they have been trying to get Harrison Ford back for one more go-around as Indiana Jones. It took a whole lot longer than anyone expected, but ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is set to hit theaters at the end of June as one of this summer's biggest blockbusters. The question is, will it send the cinematic icon out on a high note? Early box office tracking suggests that won't be the case. And, frankly, even in a best-case scenario right now, the movie won't make nearly enough to turn it into a hit.
The latest estimates from Box Office Pro have the fifth ""Indiana Jones"" movie taking in anywhere between $68 and $102 million on its opening weekend. That's a broad range, but most tracking has the film landing in the $60 to $70 million range. That having been said, tracking for big blockbusters has been way off in the post-pandemic landscape, so it's probably worth looking at a wider range when discussing a movie of this size. Given that ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" opened to $100.1 million en route to $790 million worldwide 15 years ago — a movie that is very much maligned by fans, mind you — Disney is certainly hoping for a number closer to the high end of those projections.
Unfortunately, there is much working against director James Mangold's send-off for Ford's beloved adventurer. This is the first time that Steven Spielberg has not been in the director's chair for an ""Indy"" movie, and that is no small thing. Thus far, reviews have been pretty mixed, though /Film's Lex Briscuso called it ""blazingly fun"" in her review following the Cannes screening. But mixed reviews aren't the big issue here — it's the film's inexcusably large budget.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTMyMTAzMi9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LWJveC1vZmZpY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,‘Mission: Impossible’ and Tom Cruise dominate box office but come in shy of industry expectations,"“Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One"" launched with a franchise-best $80 million over five days.","After a globe-trotting publicity blitz by star Tom Cruise, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” launched with a franchise-best $80 million over five days, though it came in shy of industry expectations with a $56.2 million haul over the three-day weekend.
The Paramount Pictures debut was boosted by strong overseas sales of $155 million from 70 markets. But while a $235 million worldwide launch marked one of the best global openings of the year, “Dead Reckoning” couldn’t approach the high-speed velocity of last summer’s top film, “Top Gun: Maverick.”
“Dead Reckoning Part One,” the seventh film in the 27-year-old series, had been forecast to better the franchise high of the previous installment, “Fallout,” which opened with $61 million domestically in 2018. Instead, it also fell short of the $57.8 million “Mission: Impossible II” debuted with in 2000.
That puts the film’s opening-weekend tally very close to the tepid launch of Disney’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which opened in U.S. and Canadian theaters with $82 million over five days and $60 million over the three-day weekend. Paramount and Skydance had higher hopes for the action extravaganza of “Dead Reckoning,” which cost $290 million to make, not counting marketing expenses.
Those costs were inflated, in part, by the pandemic. “Dead Reckoning,” directed by Christopher McQuarrie, was among the first major productions shut down by COVID-19. It was preparing to shoot in Italy in March 2020. When the film got back on track, McQuarrie and Cruise helped lead the industry-wide recovery back to film sets – albeit with some well-publicized friction over protocols along the way.
Still, “Dead Reckoning” was hailed as a high point in the franchise. Critics (96% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and fans (an “A” CinemaScore) alike came away awed by the stunts and chases of the latest “Mission: Impossible” film. Though the coming competition of “Barbenheimer” — the much-anticipated debuts of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” — looms, “Mission: Impossible” should play well for weeks to come.
Cruise, the so-called savior of movie theaters last year, traveled tirelessly to again pump life back into a summer box office that’s been sluggish. After a splashy world premiere in Rome with a red-carpet on the Spanish Steps, Cruise and McQuarrie toured through theaters in Atlanta, Miami, Toronto and Washington D.C. in the days ahead of opening.
“Dead Reckoning” hit theaters at a crucial mid-summer period for Hollywood, and not just because of the SAG-AFTRA strike which began Thursday. “Mission: Impossible” launched a week before one of the biggest box-office showdowns of the year.
Though “Dead Reckoning” and “Oppenheimer” have vied for some of the same IMAX screens, each film has publicly endorsed the idea that a rising tide lifts all blockbusters. Cruise and McQuarrie in early July even bought opening-weekend tickets to both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.” “Barbie” director Greta Gerwig and “Oppenheimer” filmmaker Christopher Nolan returned with their own gestures of support.
However that trio of films performs over the next few weeks will do a lot to determine the fate of the summer box office.
No other new wide release challenged “Mission: Impossible” over the weekend. Second place went to Angel Studios’ faith-based political thriller “Sound of Freedom” which increased 37% in its second with $27 million. Jim Caveziel stars in the child trafficking drama.
Last week’s top film, “ Insidious: The Red Door ” slid to third with $13 million in its second weekend. “Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny” is dropping quickly with $12 million its third weekend, with a domestical total so far of $145.4 million.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8xNi9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtdG9tLWNydWlzZS1kb21pbmF0ZS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWJ1dC1jb21lLWluLXNoeS1vZi1pbmR1c3RyeS1leHBlY3RhdGlvbnMv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly9mb3J0dW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3LzE2L21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS10b20tY3J1aXNlLWRvbWluYXRlLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYnV0LWNvbWUtaW4tc2h5LW9mLWluZHVzdHJ5LWV4cGVjdGF0aW9ucy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

James Mangold Derides Fans As “Divisive” For Not Liking His Deconstruction Of Indiana Jones In ‘Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny’

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director James Mangold decided to deride fans for not liking his deconstruction of Indiana Jones.
Speaking with The Hollywood Reporter, Mangold was asked by Brian Davids, “Life is filled with peaks and valleys, and I appreciate when my fictional heroes, such as Indy, have their own ups and downs. So why does a segment of the audience seem to want these legacy characters to be infallible? I just can’t figure out why anyone would want such little drama.”
Mangold replied, “Well, there’s a point where these characters become symbols more than characters, and so there becomes this anxiety that if you examine the humanity of a hero, you somehow weaken them.”

He continued, “And honestly, I can’t speak for how fans relate and wrestle with these questions in relation to other movies, but certainly in relation to mine, I think your question almost has my answer built into it. I mean, I think you’re in a sense already addressing it. Good drama gives a hero a problem. If a movie is about a beautiful hero who is capable of anything and is virtually indestructible and is without any personal issues or concerns, then you just have a fashion video with action.”
“I am a fan of starting a character in one place to go to another,” Mangold elaborated. “Movies are a continuum. By definition, in drama, a character starts in one place and ends up in another.”
Mangold then accused critics of his deconstruction of being divisive when it was his and Lucasfilm’s choice to deconstruct Indiana Jones in the first place.
He said, “So, if people want to be divisive [in the age of social media], they can focus on where a character starts, as opposed to where they end, or they can focus on where they end, as opposed to where they start.”
“In reality, for Harrison who’s playing this character, he’s tracing an arc and he’s changing through the whole picture. So it all depends on where you’re landing and where you’re pointing your finger on that timeline,” he concluded.

Ironically, Mangold previously admitted he was deconstructing Indiana Jones and that moviegoers would have to “readjust and retool their brains for this guy.”
In a previous interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he explained how the film would transition from Indiana Jones in his prime to a much older Indiana Jones, “It reminds the audience of the contrast between a hero in his physical prime and a hero at 70. We’re not relying solely on the audience’s memory of the previous films. It reminds everyone what he’s done, what he’s survived, what he’s accomplished.”
“By showing him in his most hearty and then finding him at 70 in New York City, it produces for the audience a kind of wonderful whiplash of how they’re going to have to readjust and retool their brains for this guy,” he asserted.
“His past is a live memory for the audience, hanging over a man who is now living with anonymity in a world that no longer cares or recognizes the things he felt so deeply about,” Mangold elaborated.
He then concluded, “You’re left with a multilayered perception of his character, both what he was and what he is, and how the world is different between the first 20 minutes of the movie.”

This is not the first time Mangold has lashed out and made accusations against Indiana Jones fans expressing their concerns.
Mangold infamously threw a temper tantrum when YouTuber Matthew Kadish shared his concerns about Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny back in June 2021.
Kadish wrote on Twitter, “To anyone thinking Indiana Jones 5 might be good, just let me point out… 1. Steven Spielberg is not directing. 2. Kathleen Kennedy is producing. 3. Harrison Ford is 78 years old. 4. It’s written by Jonathan Kasdan, who wrote SOLO.”
Mangold took exception to the tweet and responded by insulting him, “Thanks, Matt! 1) Keep making the world a better place crapping on things in the 1st week of production from your basement. 2) Never seen a script by Jon. Nothing against him. Just reality. Butterworths & I started from a blank page. 3) 1-3 r hugely talented & all at my side.”
Mangold would continue to deride and Kadish and his podcast team, The Salty Nerd.
The Salty Nerd tweeted, “We don’t have basements. But we do have a kick ass studio with a Batman statue.”

Mangold replied, “Yeah. That’s a kick ass studio. Congrats on the Batman statue. And the jar of corks. So how about you let me finish my film and then b**** all you want in front of your vinyl bricks lit by your fancy bounce light. And maybe don’t call opinion ‘news’..”
He would also describe Kadish as a “click baiter” and “night crawler.”
Mangold tweeted in response to a user encouraging him, “Thanks, Ax. I don’t mind people griping & prognosticating. But, on my watch, false info, agism & snark from so-called ‘journalists’ is gonna be confronted directly & forcefully.”
Mangold added, “IMO, these click baiters like to dish it out, but like night crawlers, can’t stand the light.”

James Mangold’s film received an awful B+ Cinema Score and a mediocre 6.9 out of 10 on IMDb. One report indicates that only 9% of people who saw the film recommended it to their friends and family.
The film had an abysmal opening weekend only bringing in $60.3 million domestically. So far the film has only grossed $102.3 million domestically and another $69.5 million internationally for a global gross of $171.8 million.
The film is expected to lose The Walt Disney Company and Lucasfilm more than $250 million due to its massive $300 million budget.

2023-07-05 18:20:46+00:00,"Disney’s Harsh New Reality: Costly Film Flops, Creative Struggles and a Shrinking Global Box Office","Disney, once the theatrical gold standard, is experiencing a turn in box office fortunes.","For the past decade, Disney has been the Teflon movie studio, remarkably adept at withstanding the tectonic changes impacting the film industry, and well fortified by its arsenal of key properties such as Marvel, Lucasfilm and Pixar.
But this year, the long-reigning titan of the box office has shown cracks as four of its biggest releases from those brands and others have struggled in theaters. There was the dispiriting release of “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” a rare Marvel movie to likely lose tens of millions in its theatrical run; “The Little Mermaid,” a remake of the 1989 animated classic that fell drastically short of expectations; “Elemental,” an original story that tried and failed to recapture Pixar’s magic; and most recently “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” a nearly $300 million investment in one of cinemas’ most venerable franchises, which no longer appears to have the same hold on today’s audiences. On paper, these films seemed like they had all of the makings of huge hits, but somehow the Disney sparkle was lacking this time, in terms of filling movie theater seats.
Barring a miracle –- or a sudden surge of interest in all things “Haunted Mansion” — “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” looks like it’ll be the studio’s biggest earner of the year with $835 million. It’s the first time since 2014 (except for the pandemic-stricken years of 2020 and 2021) that Disney won’t have a movie that reaches $1 billion. It also marks a shift from 2022, which saw the studio release not only hits like “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” and “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” but also “Avatar: The Way of Water,” the third-highest grossing film in history.
Even if that’s the case, Disney still far outranks the competition in terms of market share in 2023, commanding 37% of the industry’s revenues (Universal is close behind at 31%). But ticket sales for the films it has produced have been more Earth-bound, especially compared to the last pre-COVID year, when Disney fielded a record seven movies that crossed the billion-dollar mark in 2019. In many cases, reviews for recent releases haven’t been standout, with critics being particularly scathing about “Quantumania” and openly questioning the need for a fifth “Indy” adventure. Audiences have been kinder, giving these movies respectable ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and CinemaScore.
There are other issues bedeviling the Magic Kingdom these days. Because of its all-tentpole, all-the-time strategy, Disney’s movies each require production budgets of at least $200 million — plus marketing costs of roughly $100 million. That means the studio’s films have a higher benchmark than its rivals to break even at the box office. In the past, those budgets were justified with movies that crossed $1 billion worldwide with ease. Those price tags are riskier in today’s box office landscape, with China’s dollars no longer a guarantee due to tensions with the West and changing tastes. Russia, another major market, is entirely cut off from Hollywood movies after its invasion of Ukraine. As a result, the international box office has diminished to a shadow of its former self, and that has major consequences for Disney’s profitability. To be fair, every studio is grappling with these punishing realities as the box office remains down roughly 20% from pre-pandemic times, but Disney has historically enjoyed such a track record of success and its issues are casting a pall over the movie business.
“Anything Disney threw out in 2019 made $1 billion,” says Jeff Bock, an analyst with Exhibitor Relations. “Now, it’s more difficult than ever to release a film worldwide. The international landscape has changed. It’s not close to back.”
The problem is that getting these costs under control will take time. Major movies take at least three to four years to develop, produce and distribute — a lifetime in a fast-changing industry. Even if Disney is serious about tightening its belt, it may not make a noticeable difference until 2026 or beyond.
“It takes a long time for a big ship like Disney to change course,” says Paul Verna, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence.
Some of these bloated budgets on 2023 releases reflect the tens of millions that were racked up from pandemic delays and enhanced COVID testing. That should ease as the pandemic becomes a less disruptive force, which should be a key source of cost savings. Beyond that, there are questions about where else Disney may save money — will it be in marketing the movies it produces or in cutting back on special effects and other cinematic set-pieces?
“If you cut costs, do you degrade the quality of the product?” says Brandon Nispel, an equity research analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets. “If you spend less, do people like the movies you are making less? And how much and how fast can you start cutting?”
The turn in fortunes isn’t only due to market conditions, but also a mix of creative shortfalls and outsized attention on streaming. Disney’s banner year in 2019, with the releases of “Avengers: Endgame,” “The Lion King,” “Frozen II” and more, came before Disney+ launched and squashed the need for repeat viewings in theaters. With “Endgame,” for example, people went to the movies three, four, even five times to watch the epic blockbuster that bid adieu to some of Marvel’s biggest heroes. Now, there’s less of a need to make multiple trips to the multiplex. Moviegoers can wait a matter of months (or less) for a film to land on streaming and satisfy the need for a rewatch.
“People have become conditioned to expect that things will quickly appear on Disney+,” says Neil Macker, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar Research Services. “The theatrical movie business has been in decline for awhile and the pandemic accelerated that.”
Pixar has suffered the most from that mindset, analysts believe. The animation empire has been struggling since the onset of COVID, when several of its titles were sent directly to Disney+ and trained family audiences to watch its movies at home. It’s re-entering the theatrical ring with heightened competition in the animation space from Illumination (“The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” “Minions: The Rise of Gru”), DreamWorks (“Puss in Boots: The Last Wish”) and Sony Pictures Animation (“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”). And those companies spend a fraction of Pixar’s budget to bring its animated adventures to life. Universal’s “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” which is expected to be the year’s highest-grossing film with more than $1.3 billion in revenues, cost $100 million to bring to life. That’s roughly half of what Pixar shelled out for “Elemental,” which has yet to crack $200 million globally. Rival studios believe that Disney’s animated efforts have become too twee and lack the more populist edge of “Mario” or Paramount’s upcoming “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” reboot.
“Pixar is becoming an anemic brand,” notes Verna. “It’s fallen so far from the days in in which anything it released would blow the doors off.”
“Star Wars,” too, has lost its luster in theaters as the franchise set in a galaxy far, far away has found repeated success on Disney+ with series like “The Mandalorian” and “Andor.” But following the 2019 release of “The Rise of Skywalker,” Lucasfilm’s efforts to get another trilogy off the ground have proceeded in fits and starts, with several high-profile projects being announced only to disappear into development limbo. Disney has planted three “Star Wars” films on the release calendar in 2026 and 2027, but hasn’t revealed any details about those movies.
“I’ll believe there’s a new ‘Star Wars’ movie when I’m seated in the theater and seeing the opening crawl,” says Josh Spiegel, a freelance film critic who specializes in Disney. “There have been so many false starts.”
As a sprawling media conglomerate, Disney is facing issues on all fronts. Bob Iger, who returned as CEO after a brief hiatus and displaced his successor Bob Chapek, is simultaneously battling Wall Street’s unrest over the unprofitability of Disney+, concerns that Disney’s parks business may have alienated customers with its higher prices, and a rise in cord cutting that’s imperiling its cable properties like ESPN. These are all doing more to depress Disney’s share price (which is down nearly 7% year-over-year) than the struggles with its latest movies.
“Streaming was positioned as the greatest business ever, and it didn’t live up to the hype,” says Nispel. “Disney’s losing more money than people thought it would, and the market became saturated more quickly than people expected. At the same time, the ground is shifting under linear TV and the parks business that had been a cash cow hasn’t fully recovered from the pandemic. Those are far bigger problems.”
And yet, Disney’s film business has long been an important stabilizing force, with the studio dwarfing the competition. And there’s been a very successful formula that Disney has deployed — not so much leaning into nostalgia as diving in head first — which may no longer be as effective. Live-action remakes of classics such as “Aladdin,” “Beauty and the Beast” and “The Jungle Book” were theatrical goldmines, even as those films were criticized by some as shot-for-shot remakes of the originals. At that time, the Disney name alone was enough to cut the noise in a crowded market. But the lackluster global turnout for “The Little Mermaid” is a sign that brand familiarity is no longer the ticket to get people to go to theaters. And the failure of the latest “Ant-Man” indicates the studio may need to be more judicious in the sequels it decides to back. That’s an issue because the studio has found less success in launching new original franchises, other than “Frozen.”
“Disney desperately needs to create something new,” Spiegel says. “It does a good job at cannibalizing itself. They remake their movies and echo what they’ve done in the past. At a certain point, there won’t be a whole lot for them to echo.”
More than its competitors, Disney can withstand some of its movies functioning as loss leaders. In addition to racking up ticket sales, the studio’s films are designed to boost interest in toys and theme parks. So although “The Little Mermaid” barely floated past the $500 million mark, the return of Ariel is helping to sell themed Legos, backpacks, dolls, bedding and nail polish. The same goes for underperforming Marvel adventures like “Ant-Man,” which brings an influx of interest to Avengers Campus, a Marvel Cinematic Universe–themed area at the Disney California Adventure park.
“They may not make it at the box office, but Disney will make up for it in merchandise sales and the longevity of the property,” says Bock. “That’s a lot different than Paramount or Sony, who needs to make all their money back at the box office.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvZGlzbmV5LWJveC1vZmZpY2UtZmFpbHVyZXMtaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1lbGVtZW50YWwtYW50LW1hbi0xMjM1NjYwNDA5L9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvZGlzbmV5LWJveC1vZmZpY2UtZmFpbHVyZXMtaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1lbGVtZW50YWwtYW50LW1hbi0xMjM1NjYwNDA5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Indiana Jones may have had his Cannes world premiere, but Disney saved something special for the Hollywood splash of the alleged final chapter in the franchise, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
Before light hit the projector, the pic’s 5x Oscar winning composer, John Williams, took the stage with a full orchestra to perform various movements from the movie including the main title theme and new heroine track, “Helena’s Theme:, which he wrote specifically for Phoebe Waller Bridge’s new character in the pic, Indy’s goddaughter. The surprise performance, introduced by franchise architect and Dial of Destiny EP Steven Spielberg, received a roaring standing ovation.

“We have a tradition with Indiana Jones which is that Indy has his music in all the various moves that he has, and his action scenes and comedy, and so many modes, the music is always there,” Williams told the Dolby Theatre crowd.
“The other part of the tradition is that we usually have a theme for the heroine or leading lady. In this film we have Phoebe Waller Bridge,” the composer continued.
“You’ll see the most brilliant duet between Harrison and Phoebe as they do their wonderful witty dialogue and action and comedy and jeopardy which they do so wonderfully,” said Williams.
“Phoebe will be represented musically by a lyrical piece, reminiscent of the ’40s and ’50s and old Hollywood,” said Williams, “This is ‘Helena’s Theme’. It’s all about Phoebe, not all parts of her, but a lot of it.”

Earlier on the red carpet, Harrison Ford admitted that it’s definitely his last Indiana Jones movie.
“I always wanted to do a film about Indiana Jones towards the end of his life, and Jim Mangold developed a script that got us to a point where I really had the best time making this film, it’s really been fun,” Ford told Deadline.

Waller-Bridge said that “the beautiful closing chapter” was “something I’d never imagined I’d be a part of, so every single day felt like a dream.”
Whether she’s poised to take over the lead in the franchise, the Fleabag multi-award winner retorted, “First, I ever heard of it!”

John Rhys-Davies, who plays Indy’s sidekick Sallah, was more hopeful about the future, “Do I believe great franchises like this will willing die? No.”
“Do I believe that Harrison could be tricked out of retirement to do another one? Yeah, well, there’s nothing like somebody else having a go at it to make you get out of your retirement.”

That local success came as Hollywood tentpole “Indiana Jones: The Dial of Destiny” failed to land a top five place in the Middle Kingdom on its debut weekend.
“Indiana Jones” earned just $2.4 million in China, according to estimates from local data providers. It played some 25,000 screenings per day on Friday but earned less than $900,000. Exhibitors then slashed the number of sessions by half on Saturday. They further trimmed the number of playdates on Sunday when it slipped to seventh place. Consultancy, Artisan Gateway did not provide confirmed data for “Indiana Jones” in China.
“Lost in the Stars” earned $117 million, according to Artisan Gateway. That was significantly up from its opening weekend of $70.7 million (RMB502 million) a week earlier and enough to make it the second biggest film on the planet, behind “Indiana Jones,” which was more successful in other territories. After two weekends on release, “Lost in the Stars” has accumulated $320 million.
“Lost in the Stars” is a Chinese adaptation of a 1990 Russian movie “A Trap for the Lonely Man,” which itself was adapted from a Robert Thomas stage play. It sees a woman disappear while on an overseas trip with her husband. Just as mysteriously, she reappears at the moment that the search for her is running out of steam. But the man refuses to accept that she is the same woman and believes that she is an imposter.
The Chinese adaptation was scripted by hitmaker Chen Sicheng (“Detective Chinatown” franchise) and co-directed by Liu Xiang (“Knock Knock”) and Cui Rui. The cast is headed by Zhu Yilong, Ni Ni, Janice Man and Du Jiang.
“Never Say Never,” written and directed by actor Wang Baoqiang (“Lost in Thailand,” “Detective Chinatown””) does not officially release in China until July 6. Nevertheless, its previews were strong enough to earn it $25.6 million and take second place over the weekend. Earnings to date add up to $38.9 million.
Chinese romance film “Love Never Ends” earned $10.7 million. With a five-day opening a week earlier, the film now has a cumulative score of $45 million.
“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” was the top Hollywood title in China, earning $3.8 million in fourth position. Its cumulative total is $85.4 million.
Previews for Lightchaser animation “Chang An” earned the film fifth place and $3.2 million of advanced revenue. It releases officially on July 8.
The strong performances of the top two films, in particular, made it a big weekend. Nationwide gross revenue was $170 million. Artisan Gateway calculates that the year-to-date total is $3.77 billion. That is 56% ahead of the same point last year and 14% behind the equivalent in 2019.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvY2hpbmEtYm94LW9mZmljZS1sb3N0LWluLXRoZS1zdGFycy1zZWNvbmQtd2Vla2VuZC0xMjM1NjYwMjE4L9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvY2hpbmEtYm94LW9mZmljZS1sb3N0LWluLXRoZS1zdGFycy1zZWNvbmQtd2Vla2VuZC0xMjM1NjYwMjE4L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

“Elemental” debuted with £3.049 million ($3.876 million), according to numbers from Comscore. In its second weekend, “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” whipped up £3.046 million ($3.873 million) for a close second and now has a total of £13.1 million.
If looking at weekend numbers alone, Harrison Ford’s last adventure as the man in the hat won the race as the “Elemental” numbers include “limited secret sneak previews from across the market,” according to Disney.
Sony’s “Insidious: The Red Door” scared up £2.2 million in a third place debut. In its sixth weekend, Sony’s “Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse” swung to £964,566 in fourth position for a total of £27.7 million.
Rounding off the top five was Disney’s “The Little Mermaid,” which splashed to £490,836 for a total of £25.9 million.
There were no other debuts in the top 10.
Monday, July 10 saw the release of potential juggernaut “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” starring Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Esai Morales, Vanessa Kirby, Pom Klementieff and Henry Czerny. The Paramount release has opened wide and is almost certain to be the top film in the territory come the weekend.
Given the mighty presence of Ethan Hunt and Indiana Jones, the films releasing in the more traditional weekend slot are mostly limited openings.

In a sentiment that can only be borne out of an unhealthy obsession with identity politics and story subversion, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny star Phoebe Waller-Bridge has declared that the scene in which her character punches out the franchise’s namesake “was glorious because it was so funny.”

By now, whether through leaks or having seen the film themselves, audiences are more than well-aware of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s textbook ‘girl boss’ moment in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
If you’re unfamiliar with it and wish to experience it for yourself, consider this your official spoiler warning for the following two paragraphs.
At the climax of the film, finding himself wounded and at his wit’s end in 212 BC thanks to the time travel hijinks provided by the film’s titular maguffin, Harrison Ford’s Indiana Jones surrenders to his despair and begs his goddaughter, Waller-Bridge’s Helena Shaw, to leave him to die in the past.
Unwilling to let his actions cause a potentially universe-ending time paradox, Shaw ignores the pleas of the elder hero and instead decks him in the face, knocking him out cold. With Jones unable to fight back, Shaw forcefully drags him back to the present.
Awakening in his own apartment, Jones is met by a number of his allies, including Shaw, John Rhys-Davies’ Sallah, and, most surprising of all his ex-wife, Karen Allen’s Marion Ravenwood.
With a new lease on life, the hero closes out his story be rekindling his romance with Ravenwood – an opportunity ultimately granted to him by the ‘quick thinking’ of his god daughter.

Speaking to EW on this moment of blatant character assassination – it’s insulting to imply that Jones would ever even consider making such a selfish decision, much less ever succumb to a sense of defeat – Waller-Bridge praised, “It’s such a brilliant cut, and it’s such an excellently scripted moment.”
“And particularly because there’s so much fighting and left hooks and all that stuff all the way through the film, when she’s just fighting the bad guys,” she continued. “But to have to level a punch to the hero of the film… It was glorious, because it was so funny.”
Informed by the entertainment news outlet that audiences at two separate screenings supposedly “loudly cheered at that moment”, the Fleabag star laughed before clarifying that, “Underneath, it really had heart and emotion.”
“And that’s really a testament to Jim [Mangold, director] and the Butterworths [Jez and John-Henry] for writing a moment like that,” she explained. “I hope the audience understands why she does it.”
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is now limping its way through theaters.
Per reports, the film only brought in $7.2 million in Thursday previews, falling short of both Fast X ($7.5 million) and The Flash’s ($9.7 million) performance in the same period.

2023-06-18 16:15:00+00:00,"After Pandemic Box Office Slump, Europe Expects Strong Comeback With ‘Barbie,’ ‘Oppenheimer’ and ‘Indiana Jones’","European movie theaters are expecting a strong box office comeback thanks to ‘Barbie,’ ‘Indiana Jones’ and ‘Oppenheimer.’","
The walls of Barcelona’s international convention center might soon rattle once the 4,000 European exhibitors, suppliers and service providers in town for the CineEurope trade show breathe out a collective sigh of relief. At the root of such succor are Europe’s more than encouraging box-office admissions, which saw a marked uptick in late 2022 and have continued to rise into the new year.
“I think this edition will be very much about celebrating because 2022 was a much better year than 2021,” says Laura Houlgatte, CEO of the Intl. Union of Cinemas (UNIC), which tends to the needs of cinema trade associations and exhibitors across the old continent. “[What’s more] the numbers for the first quarter of 2023 have left everyone in a very good mood.”
Organized by the Film Expo Group, and running from June 19 – 22, the Barcelona-based trade show will bring together operators and exhibitors from a diverse set of territories all lifted by the same rising tide. Whereas early 2023 admissions in Germany, Norway and Finland have come within percentage points of equivalent pre-pandemic figures, receipts in France, Austria and the Netherlands have all bested those 2017-2019 numbers by at least 2%.
While the robust performances of blockbusters like “Avatar: The Way of Water” and “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” certainly played a role — not least by pushing analysts from Gower Street to amend their 2023 global box office forecast by 10% this past April — Houlgatte also credits strong domestic slates in France, Germany and Finland as key drivers. “It is imperative to have a constant flow of content coming into our cinemas,” she adds. “We must make sure to avoid any empty months.”
Summer slate presentations from Studiocanal, Warner Bros., Sony Pictures, Universal, Paramount and Disney will hopefully see to that, alongside a handful of feature screenings still to be confirmed. Houlgatte tells Variety that from those upcoming slates, Universal’s “Oppenheimer,” Disney’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” and Paramount’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” have all got UNIC members buzzing, while another summer title has operators teetering on edge.
“Everyone is extremely excited about ‘Barbie,’” she says. “There’s huge hype.”
With pandemic shutdowns fading into the rear-view mirror, with international travel restrictions lifted, and with local exhibitors no longer qualifying their optimism as “cautious,” this year’s CineEurope promises both significantly higher attendance than in previous editions and a more far-reaching view.
Conferences and case studies will focus on national Cinema Days and pricing mechanisms as ways to eventize new releases and lure audiences back, while another panel will consider the new technologies – including AI – as possible tools to improve user experience and marketing.
Moreover, questions of sustainability will prove especially pertinent, as exhibitors consider both the wider environmental impact of concession-driven businesses that trade in so much disposable material alongside the larger regulatory ramifications of next year’s European parliamentary elections.
“The industry needs to address these concerns from a wider operational perspective,” Houlgatte explains. “This is prompted by a number of national laws that are coming into force, which ask all businesses to be more sustainable. [And] we need to address those policy issues that could potentially have an impact on the way cinemas operate.”
“I wish we could leave the word ‘recovery’ behind us, and I hope that we will by next year,” Houlgatte continues. “But we’ve been building on and getting better in terms of admissions and in terms of content flow [and now] it’s time to look forward, to ask how best to adapt, invest and innovate so to provided cinemagoers with the best experience possible?”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2dsb2JhbC9ldXJvcGUtYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy0xMjM1NjQ1NDY1L9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2dsb2JhbC9ldXJvcGUtYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy0xMjM1NjQ1NDY1L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Ford has led an iconic career, starring as both Han Solo in Star Wars and Indiana Jones in Steven Spielberg's adventure film series. Indiana Jones 5, directed by James Mangold, releases next week in the UK, but Ford has no plans to slow down work.
In a new interview with CNN's Chris Wallace, Ford said he will not be retiring: ""I don’t do well when I don’t have work. I love to work… I love to feel useful. It’s my Jones, I want to be helpful.""

Wallace asked Ford what it was he liked so much about acting that keeps him going, to which Ford said: ""It is the people that you get to work with.""
""The intensity and the intimacy of collaboration… it’s the combined ambition, somehow forged from words on a page. I don’t plan what I want to do in a scene and I don’t feel obliged to do anything but I am naturally affected by the things that I work on,"" Ford said.
While Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is Ford's final film as the character, he still has plenty more work to come.

2023-06-30 14:00:00+00:00,Barbie: Impossible and Indiana Oppenheimer: July Box Office Needs a Hero,"Whether it's Tom Cruise, Margot Robbie, or Harrison Ford, July needs a box office hero.","July, the season of fireworks, vacations, and light-hearted blockbusters, represents this summer’s last shot at a $100 million opening. It will also determine if box office has a shot at improving on last year’s $3.4 billion total.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” (Disney) opens tomorrow, “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” (Paramount) is July 12, and “Barbie” (Warner Bros. Discovery) and “Oppenheimer” (Universal) are July 19. All are expected to open to at least $50 million; $100 million is not entirely unrealistic, but it may be unlikely. All told, the month could represent anywhere from $1 billion to as much as $1.4 billion.
Going in, the hope was a $4 billion summer — an 18 percent improvement above the 2022 total of just under $3.4 billion. So far, the improvement is 3.5 percent, on track for $3.5 billion. Even that isn’t guaranteed, although there’s hope that August will represent a significant improvement over a very weak 2022.
The June estimate is slightly over $1 billion, a four percent uptick from last year. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” (Sony) contributed about a third of this, followed at some distance by “The Little Mermaid” (Disney) and “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” (Paramount), both of which grossed over $100 million in June. “The Flash” (WBD) and “Elemental” (Disney) will both reach $100 million, but their sluggish trajectories hurt the month’s performance.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” Jonathan Olley / Lucasfilm Ltd.
Opening-day grosses for “Indiana Jones” will go on the June ledger, with the bulk of its run in July. At this point, opening projections are no better than $70 million. That would be disappointing: Its production budget is $100 million more than “The Flash,” which opened to an underwhelming $55 million.
“Mission: Impossible” should be the month’s best performer as well as the best long-term bet. However, current tracking places its opening under $100 million. At this point, it may not challenge “Spider-Verse” for the summer’s #1 title; it’s headed toward $400 million domestic.
“Oppenheimer” will not open to $100 million and “Barbie” is a longshot, but they’re non-franchise titles without clear multi-quadrant appeal; it’s more important to consider their longer-term prospects.
Both have intense interest, although “Oppenheimer” could suffer from the same premium-screen syndrome that depressed initial grosses for “Avatar: The Way of Water” last December. Marketing emphasizes the superiority of the biggest-possible screens, particularly IMAX. That limits seating, as does three-hour running time.
“Barbie” has particularly strong female appeal, perhaps skewing a bit older. It’s unclear what it will offer other audiences, although its marketing promises that “If you love Barbie, this movie is for you… if you hate Barbie, this movie is for you.” (No word on what it does for those who don’t have strong feelings either way.)

The guess is “Barbie” will have the bigger opening that is more likely to top $50 million. Both films have budgets around $100 million, far below “Mission: Impossible” — yet another pegged around $300 million.
Other wide openings include “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken” (Universal) tomorrow, “Insidious: The Red Door” (Sony) and “Joy Ride” (Lionsgate) July 7, then at the end of the month Disney’s “Haunted Mansion” and A24’s horror title “Talk to Me,” both July 28.
We figure the holdovers will add $225 million to the month’s total; all other new films, perhaps another $75 million. July last year took in $1.133 billion, the best month post-COVID. There’s a strong chance this July won’t improve on that, although the potential should be there for at least $1.2 billion. That would be only six percent over 2022 and raise the season to about five percent ahead.
It’s a tall order to hope that the top titles and other new releases will gross reach $900 million in July. It will take everything working at full tilt for this to happen.
With the prospects of production delays due to the WGA and potential SAG strikes, a summer release schedule that has fallen short, and general concern around the viability of comic-book movies, a lot is at stake. At this point, we know theaters are central to achieving all-platform success; what’s in question is whether the high expense of making and launching these titles makes financial sense.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL2p1bHktYm94LW9mZmljZS1wcmV2aWV3LWJhcmJpZS1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWluZGlhbmEtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItMTIzNDg3OTI2OS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-21 18:43:37+00:00,‘Indiana Jones 5’ Director James Mangold on ‘Pinch-Hitting’ for Spielberg and Refusing Fan Service: Franchises Have Become ‘Large-Scale Advertising’,"""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" director James Mangold also discusses taking on ""Swamp Thing"" and ""Star Wars.""","Before Indiana Jones entered director James Mangold’s life, Harrison Ford told him he was worried Indy was looking too old.
It was the fall of 2019, and Mangold had joined the team working on the film adaptation of “The Call of the Wild,” in which Ford plays a rugged frontiersman, to help with reshoots. In their downtime, Ford began confiding in Mangold about the fifth “Indiana Jones” movie, which had been bouncing around in development for the better part of three years. Steven Spielberg and screenwriter David Koepp had conceived a roughly five-minute opening sequence set during World War II, in which Ford would be digitally de-aged. Ford wasn’t sure it was a good idea.
“Harrison told me he was nervous, because he felt like if people saw him younger, when they confronted Indiana in his 70s they’d be disappointed,” Mangold says, sitting on a cream-colored couch inside his sunlit office on the Fox lot in early June.
At the time, the filmmaker had no reason to think he was auditioning to be the guy to solve Ford’s dilemma. But Mangold impressed the actor. “He seemed to have a keen perception of what was required,” Ford says. “I just found it very easy and comfortable to work with him.” So much so that when Spielberg decided later that year that it was time to bequeath Indy’s signature whip and fedora to someone else, Ford recommended Mangold.
Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, who has produced every “Indy” film since serving as Spielberg’s assistant on “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” recalls, “It was pretty much immediate that Steven said, ‘Oh, he would be fantastic. Let’s do that.’”
It’s easy to understand why. Starting with his feature debut, the 1995 Sundance hit “Heavy,” Mangold has built a career steeped in the old-school Spielbergian classicism that is embedded in the DNA of the “Indiana Jones” movies. “I’ve always been a little behind the curve of what’s happening in the moment,” Mangold says. “I mean, I made a wordless film about a fat guy in a diner when everyone else was trying to emulate Quentin — when the hot thing was clove cigarettes and rock-’n’-roll soundtracks.”
For decades, that approach has served Mangold well, as he has turned out a procession of quite disparate studio features, from the psychological drama “Girl, Interrupted” and Johnny Cash biopic “Walk the Line” to the Western thriller “3:10 to Yuma” and the historical entertainment “Ford v Ferrari.” In the 2010s, he even stepped inside the Marvel sandbox and brought a brutal humanism to the comic book adaptations “The Wolverine” and “Logan,” the highest-grossing movies in his filmography.
Increasingly, though, Mangold has been feeling out of step with the franchise-building imperatives of a modern film industry fixated on sustaining an ongoing series of interconnected movies. “I am interested in making something that works from beginning to end — to curtain,” he says. “Otherwise, I’m working on the world’s most expensive television show.”
Lucasfilm Ltd.
So when Kennedy approached Mangold in late 2019 about directing the fifth and final “Indiana Jones” movie, Mangold was not an instant yes.
“Oh, he was incredibly intimidated,” Kennedy recalls with a laugh. “He was immediately excited by the potential of it, but he was very daunted by stepping into Steven’s shoes.”
Still, Mangold was captivated by what was by any measure a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, even as he was acutely aware that it came with the singular hazards inherent in taking over a franchise that has meant so much to so many for so long. “There are a million land mines,” Mangold says. “But the idea that I would get a chance to play not just in the backyard of my heroes, but with Harrison, with Steven — it was so profoundly moving to me. How many people get a chance to make a movie with these people?”
Mangold spent a year with his “Ford v Ferrari” screenwriters Jez and John-Henry Butterworth to craft the screenplay for what would become “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.” Mangold’s goal was to make a film worthy of the iconic hero and the movie star embodying him — and, perhaps, explicate his own feelings about the world passing him by. Because while the 59-year-old filmmaker’s success has brought him into the orbit of two other marquee franchises, “Swamp Thing” for DC Studios and a new “Star Wars” movie for Lucasfilm, he remains ambivalent about being seen as a franchise filmmaker at all.
As Mangold talks with me in his office, I can’t help noticing the 22 framed index cards filling the wall just above his head, each with a handwritten rule for cinematic storytelling. For example: “Self-expression (talk without action) is BORING!” And: “What is happening NOW is not as exciting as what may or may not HAPPEN NEXT.”
All of the rules were created by the late filmmaker Alexander “Sandy” Mackendrick (“Sweet Smell of Success”), who mentored Mangold as the dean of the CalArts School of Film in the early 1980s. Mackendrick had the cards hanging in his own office, and, Mangold explains, “he would point at these different rules as he was analyzing your eight-page screenplay.”
When I ask Mangold how often he’s turned to his mentor’s directives over the course of his career, he smiles wistfully. “Every day,” he says. “I’ve lived with these all my life.”
From the office walls of my greatly missed first mentor, Alexander Mackendrick. pic.twitter.com/CKdE5i5eoN — Mangold (@mang0ld) December 9, 2018
As we converse, I begin to grasp just how much these rules have provided Mangold with the intellectual scaffolding to build a story that feels at once exciting and emotionally connected. Take that WWII prologue that had so concerned Ford. Mangold thought it was a brilliant idea, because it tackled one of his biggest issues with 2008’s “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull”: That film barely acknowledges that Indy is not only older but has aged out of the 1930s and ’40s era that he’s meant to embody.
“What’s so beautiful about the best of the ‘Indiana Jones’ movies is that thematically they know what they’re about,” Mangold says. “I didn’t feel like I knew what ‘Crystal Skull’ was about. He’s living in a world that has overtaken him — a world that has found new heroes in John Glenn or Elvis Presley. No one in the film is really thinking about the past; everyone’s focused on the future.”
Mangold says he “spoke plainly” about these feelings in early discussions with Spielberg and Kennedy about what he’d want to do with “Indy 5,” which he felt was at risk of making many of the same mistakes as “Crystal Skull.” The MacGuffin at the center of the early script, for example, “was just another relic with power, similar to the relics we had seen,” with no clear connection to Indy or what he was going through. So he changed it to the Antikythera, an ancient mechanical device invented, in the new script’s conception, by the Greek mathematician Archimedes to allow its user to manipulate time.
“Indy had spent his entire life exploring time,” Kennedy says. “Once Jim seized upon that as a theme, it emotionally resonated, frankly, with all of us, who have in excess of 40 years invested in this storytelling.”
Mangold also understood, however, that audiences would show up with an image of Indiana Jones in his prime fixed in their memories. So rather than cut the prologue, he expanded it to a 25-minute sequence set in 1944, when Indy encounters the Antikythera for the first time on a Nazi loot train. Effectively, Mangold wanted viewers to be disappointed by the shock of cutting from Indy as a younger man to Indy in his late 70s. “It might be a really good opening gambit for the present-tense part of the movie — that much about growing older in life is disappointing,” he says.
In spite of his trepidation, Ford applied himself to the sequence with his typical aplomb. “I tried to raise my voice into a higher register, which seemed to be appropriate for the age, and physically tried to move with all the grace and youthfulness that my old ass could muster,” he says. “I had not anticipated that the process of de-aging, if you will call it that, would be so successful.”
Neither did Mangold. The director knew Ford would need to be de-aged with a level of verisimilitude that has proven elusive to filmmakers so far. The process involved drawing from hundreds of hours of archived footage of Ford as a younger man and mapping that onto the older actor’s face. But when I ask Mangold how he ensured the technology was up to snuff before he started filming, he just shrugs. He hadn’t.
“You have to believe that they’re going to be able to do something better, but you don’t know,” he says. “Every movie is a leap of faith. People are like, ‘Can Joaquin Phoenix sing?’ And you go, ‘Yeah, absolutely. He’s incredible.’ And you don’t know. You’re just believing in the people around you delivering.”
Lucasfilm Ltd.
Spielberg never told Mangold why he decided to relinquish the “Indiana Jones” director’s chair, and Mangold never asked. “I never went there,” Mangold says. “I mean, it wasn’t my business. I knew he had a personal movie he had been working on, so I assumed that he wanted to make ‘The Fabelmans.’ But I didn’t grill him about it.”
The two did talk frequently throughout the making of “The Dial of Destiny,” shot from from June 2021 to February 2022, most often about the “mechanics of things” and how an “Indy” movie should feel and move. “Steven told me, ‘Think of shooting an “Indiana Jones” movie like you’re shooting a trailer — no scene can ever last too long,’” he says.
When I ask how Mangold approached making the film his own, however, he corrects me. “I wasn’t looking to make the movie my own,” he says. “I would say I was looking to have a voice.” More than practically any other film franchise in cinema history, “Indiana Jones” is inextricably associated with one filmmaker, and Mangold had no interest in changing that.
“You don’t want me doing a knockoff Steven, but I want to be playing from the same hymnal, using the same tools,” he says. “I mean, I’m pinch-hitting for Babe Ruth. I at least have to use my own swing some of the time. But the reality is, every day I’m thinking of what he would do, how he would do it. In any way I could, I wanted to do the movie in his style. It didn’t feel threatening to me at all.”
Mangold knew comparisons were inevitable, so he wasn’t exactly shocked when the premiere of “The Dial of Destiny” at the Cannes Film Festival in May drew a muted reaction from critics. “When you’re in franchise land, it’s very hard for critical thinkers” — meaning journalists — “to overlook what I’m sure their editors want, which is this business prism of how does it rate to the other ones?” he says. “I always thought if I were second or third best to one of the greatest films of all time, I’d be good. I mean, it all vaporizes later. Either the movie will live or it won’t.”
Mangold talks about this with the kind of good-natured forbearance built up over decades in the studio trenches, so I’m surprised by how animated he gets when I bring up the future of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s character, Helena Shaw, Indy’s goddaughter. Mangold and the Butterworths wrote Helena specifically for Waller-Bridge, seeing in her the same kind of pluck and resourcefulness that made Karen Allen’s Marion Ravenwood a perfect foil for Indy in “Raiders.” I ask if he has talked with Disney and Lucasfilm about the potential for Waller-Bridge to carry on the franchise. Mangold smiles and waves his hand dismissively.
“I’m not interested,” he says. “I refuse. I just can’t do it.” He gestures to the rules hovering just over his shoulder. “The amount of lore and Easter eggs and fan service starts to become antithetical to any of this stuff at a certain point. It isn’t storytelling anymore. It’s large-scale advertising.” (For her part, Kennedy says that while it’s “entirely possible” that a Helena Shaw movie could happen, “we’re not having any of those conversations right now. We’re just focused on finishing this with Harrison.”)
Lucasfilm Ltd.
At the same time, Mangold seems resigned to the inevitability of the franchise economy. For instance, Hugh Jackman will return in 2024 as Wolverine in a Marvel Studios film with Ryan Reynolds’ Deadpool, seven years after Jackman retired the character in “Logan” — the film that earned Mangold his first Oscar nomination (for adapted screenplay). “I can’t say that there’s a part of me that doesn’t wish that we’d let it be,” he says. “But there was always going to be another Wolverine. There could be a baby Wolverine and a cartoon Wolverine. As much liquid as they can squeeze out of that rag, they’re going to try to. I don’t measure my success on a movie like ‘Logan’ with whether we ended the conversation. I ended my conversation.”
The great irony is that Mangold is attached to make a DC movie and a “Star Wars” movie — he’s just choosing not to see them that way. “While I’m sure DC views ‘Swamp Thing’ as a franchise, I would be viewing it as a very simple, clean, Gothic horror movie about this man/monster,” he says. Mangold had been “toying for years with the idea of making a kind of Frankenstein movie,” he adds, so when James Gunn and Peter Safran took the reins at DC last fall, Mangold “put in a friendly call” to suggest himself. “Just doing my own thing with this, just a standalone.”
With “Star Wars,” Mangold had “more than flirted” years earlier with making a Boba Fett movie that would have been a one-off spaghetti Western in the vein of Sergio Leone. (Lucasfilm turned it into the Disney+ series “The Book of Boba Fett” instead.) So while in production on “The Dial of Destiny,” Kennedy asked him if he was still interested in exploring a galaxy far, far away. “I said, ‘Yes, but it seems like everything you’re developing is continuing forward,’” he says. He pitched “a ‘Ten Commandments’ about the dawning of the Force,” he says. “It is basically, for fans, a kind of religion. What is it to have found this power and not even understand what it is?” Kennedy pounced.
“Jim’s pretty fast — he’s already got the basic treatment laid out in his head,” she says. Once the writers strike is over, she adds, “He has every intention of wanting to move this forward very aggressively, and we want to support that.”
Before either project goes anywhere, though, Mangold intends to begin shooting the relatively small-scale Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown” with Timothée Chalamet in August. It’s the film Mangold was working on in 2019 when Kennedy approached him about “Indy,” and he’s been itching to get back to it. But the looming prospect of an actors strike in July could scuttle the movie before it starts. If a strike goes on too long, Chalamet’s commitments to promote “Dune: Part Two” and “Wonka” in the fall and winter could prevent the film from happening. When I ask Mangold about that possibility, he grimaces.
“I get asked this question,” he says. “All we do is keep moving. Just keep trying to prep the movie and hope that the two sides will resolve things. I don’t know what else I can do.”
The only thing Mangold is certain of is that he never wants to get too comfortable making anything. “I don’t put myself in one bin in the record shop,” he says. “Is he country and western or jazz? Is he rock ’n’ roll or is he soundtracks? What the fuck is he?” He laughs. “To me, sticking within one lane, I don’t know whether I’d keep learning.”
I make note of another Mackendrick rule of cinema — and, it seems, of life — hanging just out of Mangold’s view: “Drama is EXPECTATION mingled with UNCERTAINTY.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LWphbWVzLW1hbmdvbGQtaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC0xMjM1NjUwODk0L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LWphbWVzLW1hbmdvbGQtaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC0xMjM1NjUwODk0L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) has fallen short of expectations. The newest installment of the Indiana Jones film series, directed by James Mangold and starring Harrison Ford as the titular character, Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Helena Shaw, and Mads Mikkelsen as Jürgen Voller, is one of the most expensive movies ever made. But the Walt Disney World Company and Lucasfilm hoped the fifth Indiana Jones film would pay off.

Indiana Jones and The Box Office of Doom
However, the performance of Indiana Jones 5 at the box office has been lukewarm at best. In addition to receiving a poor response at its Cannes Film Festival premiere, it has failed to make much in theaters and may go down as one of the biggest flops of 2023.
But despite the disappointing ticket sales, the Indiana Jones franchise may have bigger problems than a floundering box office.

Lucasfilm Lawsuit
There is currently a lawsuit regarding props used by Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) and marketed by Lucasfilm.
In the lawsuit, Frost River, an American clothing company, claims that the Indiana Jones film featured their trademarked “Geologist Pack.” In fact, it is used by Harrison Ford’s Indiana Jones. At the same time, Lucasfilm had teamed up with the clothing company’s competitor (Filson) to promote a series of backpacks and other outdoor products. Frost River also claims that Disney/Lucasfilm removed all identifying marks on the bag in the movie, violating federal trademark law.
Frost River also claims that Lucasfilm and Filson teamed up to produce ads featuring the trademarked “Geologist Pack” and advertising it as a Filson product.

In other words, Disney/Lucasfilm is accused of showing a branded bag in the film, removing its trademarks, and then working with a third party retailer to sell a different bag, implying (intentionally or not) that the two items were the same.

Devin McRae, a lawyer of Frost River, made the following statement:
“Lucasfilm and Filson produced a 60-second commercial prominently featuring video clips from the Indiana Jones 5 film intertwined with video clips of actors using Filson’s own products. Shockingly, one of the intertwined video clips was one from Indiana Jones 5 featuring Frost River’s Geologist Pack.”
This is not the first, and probably won’t be the last time, that a film studio has a lawsuit regarding trademarked props. However, it puts another thorn in the side of Disney – or nail in the coffin of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023).

2023-07-02 23:58:04+00:00,"Korea Box Office: ‘Elemental’ Expands in Third Weekend, Whips ‘Indiana Jones’",'Elemental' expanded in its third weekend of release in South Korea and easily dominated newcomers 'Indiana Jones' and 'Asteroid City.',"Pixar animation film “Elemental” expanded at the South Korean box office in its third weekend of release and easily bested new release title “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.”
“Elemental” earned $5.27 million between Friday and Sunday, according to data from Kobis, the box office tracking service operated by the Korean Film Council (Kofic).
That represented a 38% increase on its previous weekend performance and was the best of its three weekends so far. It also increased its market share to 39%, also its strongest market position, despite only adding a handful of additional screens. After 19 days on release, “Elemental” has amassed $16.9 million from 2.25 million spectators.
The film’s third week holdover performance compared favorably with new release “Indiana Jones,” which had a $2.86 million weekend session. Over its full five-day opening period, “Indiana Jones” whipped up $3.98 million. The film’s slightly disappointing numbers were matched elsewhere in the world. It earned $60 million in North America and a further $70 million from international territories.
Korean box office phenomenon, “The Roundup: No Way Out” slipped to third place with a $2.13 million haul. On Saturday, the film became the first this year to achieve ten million ticket sales, the symbolic milestone that is considered the mark of a blockbuster hit in Korea. Its cumulative total since releasing in late May, now stands at $76.3 million, earned from 10.2 million spectators.
“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” earned $1.14 million in fourth place and has accumulated $4.87 million after 12 days in Korean cinemas.
Korea’s “The Childe” also dropped one place in the chart and took fifth place in its second weekend. It earned $842,000 for a 12-day cumulative of $4.27 million.
Concert film, “2022 Youngtak Concert: The Movie” earned $310,000 over the weekend and $594,000 in sixth place.
Re-released Chinese film “My Love” earned seventh place on the Korean weekend chart with $236,000.
Japanese animation title, “Detective Conan: The Story of Ai Haibara Balack Iron Mystery Train” earned $125,000 on its second weekend for a cumulative of $547,000.
“The Flash” earned $121,000 in its third weekend of release, for a cumulative of $5.04 million.
(Korean box office charts show films ranked by ticket sales, not revenues, and place “Youngtak Concert” in seventh position due to its smaller number of higher priced tickets. They also show “The Flash” in eighth position ahead of “Detective Conan”.)
Tenth place over the latest weekend belonged to Wes Anderson’s new release “Asteroid City,” with $105,000.

2023-06-30 10:00:01+00:00,"Indiana Jones hits theaters for one last adventure, but box office prospects look shaky","Box office analysts predict Disney's ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" will open to between $60 million and $65 million at the domestic box office.","It's Harrison Ford's final bow as the boulder-dodging, whip-wielding, Nazi-punching Indiana Jones.
On Friday, ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" arrives in theaters, marking the fifth and likely final chapter in the Lucasfilm movie franchise.
Disney spared no expense in bringing the film to the big screen, starting with a nearly $300 million production budget. Factor in marketing costs, which are typically equal to half the production budget, and a swanky premiere and after-party at the Cannes Film Festival, and ""Dial of Destiny"" has quite a hole to dig itself out of.
Box office analysts are predicting the film will capture between $60 million and $65 million during its first three days in theaters and around $90 million for the five-day holiday weekend. That would mark the latest mediocre opening in the summer blockbuster season, following disappointing bows for ""The Flash,"" ""Elemental"" and ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" earlier this month.
It would also fall well short of the $100 million ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" secured during its first three days in theaters in 2008. Previous Indiana Jones installments, released in the 1980s, saw significantly lower box office openings because tickets were significantly less expensive at that time and the films were released in fewer theaters.
For instance, ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was released in more than 4,200 theaters, while 1989's ""The Last Crusade"" was released in 2,300 cinemas, according to Comscore data. In 2023, blockbuster features are generally opening in 4,200 locations, with some films, such as Marvel's ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3,"" opening in as many as 4,450 locations.
""Dial of Destiny"" also marks the first time Steven Spielberg hasn't directed an Indy movie, although the musical score was written by franchise stalwart John Williams. James Mangold, who helmed ""Logan"" and ""Ford v Ferrari,"" directed the new one.
The sequel comes 15 years after the ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" which ended up with a 77% ""Fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes but was widely panned by audiences. Despite a solid opening, the fourth Indiana Jones film tallied only $317 million domestically. It did manage to reach $786 million globally, according to data from Comscore.
The lackluster audience response resulted in a pause in future films, including the potential for a spinoff featuring Shia LaBeouf as Indiana Jones' son Mutt Williams. In 2012, Disney bought Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion, eventually taking the franchise away from its previous studio partner Paramount Pictures. Disney kept the character on ice while it worked on new Star Wars and Willow content — two other franchises that came from Lucasfilm.
Now, in 2023, the fifth installment in the swashbuckling archaeologist's movie adventures has generated a 67% ""Fresh"" score as of Friday morning, with critics saying ""Dial of Destiny"" doesn't quite capture the thrill of earlier adventures. Still, with Ford donning his iconic hat and whip combo, the film gives audiences a nostalgic rush, according to the critical consensus.
It's unclear whether that will result in a ton of ticket sales, however.
""The target audience of men over 35, who grew up on the entire series, will need to show up with their families and, perhaps, introduce the iconic character to their little ones who weren't even around for the previous movie,"" said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. ""The franchise has overcome stalled pop culture relevance before, but this time it also has to face that added challenge of winning back viewers who weren't as keen on 'Crystal Skull' as they were for the original films.""
Hollywood has had mixed results with nostalgia plays in recent years. While ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" and ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" captured healthy box office sales, others have floundered on the big screen. ""Blade Runner 2049,"" ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" and ""Terminator Genisys"" came up short with old fans and new audiences in North America.
""Dial of Destiny"" could benefit from audiences keen to see Ford, who will turn 81 next month, hang up his fedora and potentially even pass off the torch to a new generation.
Even with tepid reviews heading into Friday's release, Robbins notes that critics and audiences don't always agree.
""Indiana Jones' nature as a traditionally less front-loaded franchise compared to the comic book blockbusters we're used to seeing play with a short fuse also means a sizable portion of its audience could opt to see the film after the initial fan-driven previews and opening day,"" he said.

,How 'Dial of Destiny' explains the absence of Shia LaBeouf's Mutt,"Here's how 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' explains the absence of Indy's son, Mutt, played by Shia LaBeouf in 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.'","Warning: This article contains spoilers for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
When audiences sit down to watch Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny this weekend, one character will be noticeably absent from the big screen: Shia LaBeouf's Mutt Williams, a.k.a. Henry Jones III.
This in and of itself should come as no surprise — screenwriter David Koepp revealed way back in 2017 that Mutt wouldn't be in the fifth installment. This was welcome news for some fans, particularly ones miffed by the introduction of the cocky greaser in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and the implication at the time that he was heir apparent to the Indiana Jones franchise moving forward.
Still, Mutt's absence in Dial of Destiny couldn't be ignored, what with his prominent role in Crystal Skull and an ending that saw Mutt's mother, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), marrying his father, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford).
Dial of Destiny deals with Mutt in a way that also explains why Marion isn't a bigger part of the narrative. Near the beginning, we glimpse divorce papers and Indy himself angrily covers up a picture of Marion, indicating an estrangement between the pair. Later, in one of the film's most emotional moments, Indy tells his goddaughter, Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), that if he could go back in time he'd tell his son not to enlist to fight in the Vietnam War. He says he'd tell his son that he's going to die, and the resulting grief would so consume his mother and impact his father's ability to be there for her that it would end both their happiness and their marriage.

It's not all sad news for the Jones family, however. Though the film makes it clear it's the end of the road for Mutt's character, it's insinuated that Marion and Indy might still get their happily ever after. After the daredevil archaeologist nearly loses his life in the film's climax, he awakens to find that Marion has returned to look after him. After recreating their romantic ""where does it hurt"" moment from Raiders of the Lost Ark, the two share a tender embrace in the film's final moments. Allen spoke to EW all about the ""emotional"" scene.

2023-07-01 15:32:08+00:00,Box Office: ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Whips Up $24 Million Opening Day,"""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is still projecting a $60 million debut weekend for the Harrison Ford finale.","Indiana Jones has begun his last box office crusade, with the fifth franchise entry earning $24 million on its opening day from 4,600 theaters. It’s a figure that includes $7.2 million in Thursday previews.
The release from Disney and Lucasfilm is expected to debut near the bottom of projections, with a three-day opening of $60 million or so. It’ll be more than enough for the Harrison Ford action-adventure film to land in the top spot on domestic charts, setting itself up to draw crowds through the Fourth of July holiday — but it’s not exactly the victorious tone-setter for one of the most expensive American blockbusters ever made. With a whopping $295 million production budget, “Indiana Jones 5” faces quite the trek to theatrical profitability.
The skies have been cloudy for “Dial of Destiny” for some weeks now, ever since the franchise finale made a splashy debut at the Cannes Film Festival and earned reviews that could kindly be described as mixed. After weathering that mediocre buzz for more than a month, the film has balanced out at a 58% approval rating from top critics on Rotten Tomatoes. In Variety‘s review, chief film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote that “James Mangold’s action epic is made in the style of Steven Spielberg, but the exhilaration is gone.”
The first round of ticket buyers are more positive, as indicated by the “B+” grade through research firm Cinema Score, but that’s still not a level of excitement that’s appropriate for a beloved franchise homecoming, especially one of this scale.
The last feather in Indy’s cap was “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” which opened to $100 million over the Memorial Day holiday in 2008 and legged out a $790 million worldwide gross. That film drew its own middling reception, which may have taken away some of the thrill of the franchise for audiences. It’ll be difficult for “Dial of Destiny” to match the final gross of its predecessor.
James Mangold took the director’s seat for this outing after franchise co-creator Steven Spielberg bowed out during a lengthy development process. “Dial of Destiny” sees a weathered Indiana Jones searching for a mystical artifact with the power to change the course of history. The professorial globe-trotter is accompanied by his goddaughter, Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), in a race against a former Nazi (Mads Mikkelsen) for the treasure.
While Disney is facing an underwhelming arrival for “Indiana Jones,” it can take some solace in the fact that it’s not laying the biggest box office egg this weekend. Universal’s “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken” is likely opening outside of the top five after earning $2.3 million from 3,400 theaters on Friday. A finish around $6 million over the three-day frame seems to be where things are headed.
Nobody in the industry has been projecting good numbers for the DreamWorks Animation film and this pin-drop opening represents the proverbial Band-Aid getting ripped off. Facing strong competition for family audiences in “Indiana Jones” and animated holdovers “Elemental” and “Across the Spider-Verse,” “Ruby Gillman” doesn’t have any hope to recoup its $70 million production budget. For what it’s worth, ticket buyers have been positive, as indicated by the “A-” grade on Cinema Score.
Sony looks to take silver with “Across the Spider-Verse,” projecting an $11.7 million gross for its fifth weekend of release. The “Spider-Man” sequel is looking at another soft drop around 40% or so; arachnids have eight legs and this movie is using all of them to keep its numbers climbing. Total domestic gross should push to $340 million through Sunday.
Disney and Pixar’s “Elemental” is looking at third place. The animated romance added $3.4 million on Friday to push its North American total to $80 million. “Elemental” still won’t be able to justify its $200 million production budget after debuting with the worst opening numbers in Pixar’s history, but it’s held well since then. The film will almost certainly push beyond a $100 million domestic gross — a milestone that seemed beyond reach two weeks ago.
Sony’s “No Hard Feelings” is projecting $7.1 million through the weekend, which would push its domestic total to $28 million. That would be a modest 51% drop from its opening numbers, but the Jennifer Lawrence comedy still cost $45 million to produce.
“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” looks to round out the top five, projecting a 43% drop in its fourth weekend of release. The Paramount sequel should reach a $135 million domestic gross through the three-day frame.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LW9wZW5pbmctZGF5LWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS0xMjM1NjU5NjEyL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LW9wZW5pbmctZGF5LWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS0xMjM1NjU5NjEyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Harrison Ford has addressed the long wait fans have faced in getting the fifth and final film, ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.""
The film, set to be released in theaters on June 30, marks Ford's final farewell to the franchise and comes 15 years after ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.""
Speaking to Digital Spy, Ford addressed the 15-year gap between the fourth and fifth ""Indiana Jones"" films, revealing that there weren't immediate plans for a followup after ""Crystal Skull"" was released in 2008.
""Well, it wasn't as though we sat around for 10 years waiting to come up with an idea,"" he said.

""When we finished the last film, I don't think anybody thought about going and doing another film for some time.""
""Crystal Skull"" is considered by many to be the worst film in the franchise and currently holds a 53% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. Adjusted for inflation, it has the lowest box office gross of any movie in the franchise, according to Box Office Mojo.

""And then we found an idea, and a script, and a strong story that we wanted to tell,"" he said of ""Dial of Destiny"" which is directed by James Mangold and cowritten by Mangold, Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and David Koepp.

Ford said that he was ""very happy"" with the story of the new film in which the archaeologist adventurer is joined by his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), in a race against time to retrieve a legendary dial that can change the course of history.
Taking place against the backdrop of the 1960s space race, the sequel sees Indy going head-to-head with a former Nazi scientist (Mads Mikkelsen) and also stars ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" alumni John Rhys-Davies and Karen Allen.

He added that when it came time to hang up Indy's iconic fedora and whip for the last time, he ""felt a sense of peace, a sense of contentment.""

2023-07-25 19:52:39+00:00,The visual effects of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Take a look at the visual effects of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.,"It might not be raiding the box office as voraciously as hoped, but don’t be surprised if Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny steals a few Oscars including a rare 21st century one for Industrial Light & Magic in the VFX category for it’s incredible work on creating and perfecting ILM Faceswap, which allowed Harrison Ford to once again appear as he would have back in 1997 (Indy would have been 45 in 1944, Harrison is a decade older than Indy so 1942+45+10=1997*)
Lucasfilm spoke with ILM Visual Effects Supervisor Andrew Whitehurst about the process in not only de-ageing Indy but also taking him back 2000 years to the Battle of Syracuse.
As a fan of the original Indy movies, Whitehurst was well aware of their visual style. The gritty feel, stunts, the real-world quality, all augmented by ILM’s most cutting-edge effects techniques of the day. It was important to him that Dial of Destiny honor that legacy while still allowing for creative freedom. “You definitely have to be respectful. Looking at the previous films, the way [cinematographer] Douglas Slocombe shot the first three has a very certain look to it. And I don’t think that’s necessarily what Phedon and Jim were shooting for when they were coming up with a visual style for this film. But again, particularly in the opening sequence, because it does have that more historical aspect to it, we were certainly riffing on those ideas,” he says. “I think it’s more being respectful towards the ethos of the movies rather than a very particular aesthetic.” Still, Whitehurst did take steps to ensure a certain visual continuity. “All of our cameras are grounded in reality. Even if it’s a full CG shot, I will sit down with an artist and go, ‘Well, look, if we were going to shoot this for real, it would be a camera on a stabilized head on a crane arm attached to a car. So when we’re animating the camera, we can’t do some super smooth, flying through space kind of camera move because that’s not part of this world.’ And it’s that kind of aspect of grounding things that I think was really important for us to respect. But then also, the franchise has always had this wonderful, magical, slightly fantastical element of the supernatural aspect, which happens within them. And so that gives you a little bit more license to play.”

The actor recently opened up about the roles that he likes to play opting to play “losers” on-screen versus “cutie pie” characters.
“To combine it — to do something real and also be a cutie pie — I don’t really find it interesting,” Mikkelsen told GQ in a recent interview. “I’m not into the ‘hair falling in your eyes, be cute in a corner.’ Not me. The losers are fun. Because we know them. You might have been in that situation yourself sometimes.”

The Danish actor has made a name for himself in the U.S. playing villains. Other notable performances include Hannibal Lecter in the Hannibal series, the evil wizard in Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore and the accountant in Rihanna’s “Bitch Better Have My Money.”
“If there’s nothing else, I’ll definitely do this, because it’s fun,” he said of playing villains. “And then I can do whatever I want back in Europe.”

Indiana Jones director James Mangold praised Mikkelsen’s acting skills saying that the actor “inhabits whatever character he plays with a hundred percent commitment to their perspective.”
“This takes a certain kind of artistic bravery, a fearlessness that Mads possesses,” Mangold added. “In all honesty, I think he has been offered the roles of ‘villains’ in movies simply because he is so fearless about taking them on and humanizing them”

2023-06-13 23:25:17+00:00,Harrison Ford Reacts to Indiana Jones De-Aging (Video),Harrison Ford is happy with how the de-aging technology worked in his latest “Indiana Jones” film.,"Harrison Ford is happy with how the de-aging technology worked in his latest “Indiana Jones” film.
The 80-year-old actor, director James Mangold and “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” costars Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, Shaunette Renée Wilson, and Boyd Holbrook sat with SiriusXM’s Jess Cagle in an interview posted Tuesday in which they were asked about the de-aged sequence towards the start of the film.
“Well it was fun for me to see how well it worked because I feel very strongly that it’s the best example of de-aging, if you will, that we’ve seen yet,” Ford told the SiriusXM host. “It’s not a photoshopping kind of thing, it really is my face from 40 years ago.”
The actor added that he was “gratified that it worked” because it was an impactful narrative device for his fifth and final outing as Indiana Jones.
“I’m very happy about it as a dramatic device because of where we’re going to go with this character, I thought it was a great way to start,” he said.
Elsewhere in the interview, Mangold recalled the gamble he and the film’s creative team took by banking on the potential for better de-aging technology when they included the sequence in the film. He made the process sound simpler than one may envision.
“It wasn’t complicated to shoot in the sense that we just shot it. Harrison put on the outfit and played younger and I shot him, and we fixed it,” he said. “One of the nice things about the way that technology has progressed is I didn’t have to — everything wasn’t 100 dots and levers and 35 takes with 19 cameras. We wanted to give the audience a blast right at the start, a taste of what I think we cherish about those early films before we pull the rug out from under you, in a way. We wanted to feel like you dropped into one of the older pictures. That was it.”
The filmmaker also emphasized the multiple advantages they had with this experiment: Ford’s acting, his comparatively similar build to 40 years ago and the past films’ showcase of Ford at the younger age “Dial of Destiny” was aiming to capture.

2023-07-23 19:04:00+00:00,‘Barbie’ takes the box office crown and ‘Oppenheimer’ soars in a historic weekend,"Warner Bros.’ “Barbie” claimed the top spot with a massive $155 million in ticket sales from North American theaters from 4,243 locations, surpassing “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” (as well as every Marvel movie this year) as the biggest opening of the year and breaking the first weekend record for a film directed by a woman.","The social media-fueled fusion of Greta Gerwig’s “ Barbie ” and Christopher Nolan’s “ Oppenheimer ” brought moviegoers back to the theaters in record numbers this weekend, vastly outperforming projections.
Warner Bros.’ “Barbie” claimed the top spot with a massive $155 million in ticket sales from North American theaters from 4,243 locations, surpassing “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” (as well as every Marvel movie this year) as the biggest opening of the year and breaking the first weekend record for a film directed by a woman. Universal’s “Oppenheimer” also soared past expectations, taking in $80.5 million from 3,610 theaters in the U.S. and Canada, marking Nolan’s biggest non-Batman debut and one of the best-ever starts for an R-rated biographical drama.
It’s also the first time that one movie opened to more than $100 million and another movie opened to more than $80 million in the same weekend. When all is settled, it will likely turn out to be the fourth biggest box office weekend of all time with over $300 million industrywide. And all this in a marketplace that increasingly curved towards intellectual property-driven winner takes all.
The “Barbenheimer” phenomenon may have started out as good-natured competition between two aesthetic opposites, but, as many hoped, both movies benefitted in the end. Internationally, “Barbie” earned $182 million from 69 territories, fueling a $337 million global weekend. “Oppenheimer” did $93.7 million from 78 territories, ranking above “Barbie” in India, for a $174.2 million global total.
The only real casualty was “Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part I,” which despite strong reviews and a healthy opening weekend fell 64% in weekend two. Overshadowed by the “Barbenheimer” glow as well as the blow of losing its IMAX screens to “Oppenheimer,” the Tom Cruise vehicle added $19.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $118.8 million.
“Barbenheimer” is not merely counterprogramming either. But while a certain section of enthusiastic moviegoers overlapped, in aggregate the audiences were distinct.
Women drove the historic “Barbie” opening, making up 65% of the audience, according to PostTrak, and 40% of ticket buyers were under the age of 25 for the PG-13 rated movie.
“It’s just a joyous time in the world. This is history in so many ways,” said Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros.’ president of domestic distribution. “I think this marketing campaign is one for the ages that people will be talking about forever.”
“Oppenheimer” audiences meanwhile were 62% male and 63% over the age of 25, with a somewhat surprising 32% that were between the ages of 18 and 24.
Both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” scored well with critics with 90% and 94% on Rotten Tomatoes, respectively, and audiences who gave both films an A CinemaScore. And social media has been awash with reactions and “takes” all weekend – good, bad, problematic and everywhere in between – the kind of organic, event cinema, watercooler debate that no marketing budget can buy.
“The ‘Barbenheimer’ thing was a real boost for both movies,” Goldstein said. “It is a crowning achievement for all of us.”
“Oppenheimer” had the vast majority (80%) of premium large format screens at its disposal. Some 25 theaters in North America boasted IMAX 70mm screenings ( Nolan’s preferred format ), most of which were completely sold out all weekend — accounting for 2% of the total gross. Theaters even scrambled to add more to accommodate the demand including 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. screenings, which also sold out.
“Nolan’s films are truly cinematic events,” said Jim Orr, Universal’s president of domestic distribution.
IMAX showings alone made up 26% of the domestic gross (or $21.1 million) from only 411 screens and 20% of the global gross, and “Oppenheimer” will have at least a three-week run on those high-demand screens.
“This is a phenomenon beyond compare,” said Rich Gelfond, the CEO of IMAX, in a statement. “Around the world, we’ve seen sellouts at 4:00 a.m. shows and people travelling hours across borders to see ‘Oppenheimer’ in IMAX 70mm.”
This is the comeback weekend Hollywood has been dreaming of since the pandemic. There have been big openings and successes – “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” “Top Gun: Maverick,” “Avatar: The Way of Water” among them, but the fact that two movies are succeeding at the same time is notable.
“It was a truly historic weekend and continues the positive box office momentum of 2023,” said Michael O’Leary, President & CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. “People recognized that something special was happening and they wanted to be a part of it.”
And yet in the background looms disaster as Hollywood studios continue to squabble with striking actors and writers over a fair contract.
“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” were the last films on the 2023 calendar to get a massive, global press tour. Both went right up to the 11th hour, squeezing in every last moment with their movie stars. “Oppenheimer” even pushed up its London premiere by an hour, knowing that Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy would have to leave to symbolically join the picket lines by the time the movie began.
Without movie stars to promote their films, studios have started pushing some falls releases, including the high-profile Zendaya tennis drama “Challengers.”
But for now, it’s simply a positive story that could even continue for weeks to come.
“There could be a sequel next weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “The FOMO factor will rachet up because of this monumental box office event centered around the movie theater experience.”
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.
1. “Barbie,” $155 million.
2. “Oppenheimer,” $80.5 million.
3. “Sound of Freedom,” $20.1 million.

Disney titles went head-to-head at the UK-Ireland box office this weekend after Pixar animation Elemental narrowly missed out on knocking Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny off the top spot.
While previews helped push the Elemental over the £3m mark, its three-day total of £2.9m was not quite enough to match the Harrison Ford franchise which made £3m in its second weekend.
Elemental, which centres around the four elements (earth, wind, fire and air) co-existing together, opened in 625 sites – dropping unexpectedly after cinema chain Empire announced the immediate closure of its 14 locations on Friday (July 7). Directed by Peter Sohn, the title is down on previous Pixar film Lightyear which opened with £3.7m in 2022 and ended on £7.6m.
Meanwhile, The Dial Of Destiny dropped 43% in its second week and stands at £13.2m in total. Its box office has only just overtaken the opening figures of its predecessor The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull which debuted with £12m back in 2008.
In third place is the latest edition in the paranormal horror franchise, Insidious: The Red Door, which opened strong on £2.3m for Sony. Opening in 485 sites, the fifth instalment is just shy of Insidious: Chapter Two which debuted with £2.9m, and remains the highest opener of the series, but is up on the fourth film - 2018’s The Last Key - which opened on £1.8m in 2018.
Actor Patrick Wilson makes his directorial debut with The Red Door and returns to star alongside Rose Byrne and Ty Simpkins.
Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse dropped just 36% in the sixth weekend as the Sony animation added a further £964,646 to bring its total to £27.7m.
In its seventh weekend, Disney’s The Little Mermaid added £490,133 and is now just shy of £26m.
Gone in a Flash
For Universal, Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City nabbed £460,880 in its third session to bring its total to £3.8m.
Jennifer Lawrence comedy No Hard Feelings made £348,815 for Sony and stands at £3.2m after three weeks of play.

Paramount’s Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts dropped just 39% in its fifth weekend to add another £284,000 to its £7.7m total.
The Flash dropped another 61% in its fourth weekend with takings of £241,260. The Warner Bros superhero title now stands at £8.6m.
After 14 weeks, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is still going strong as the Universal animation added £40,016 to its £53.8m takings.
Disney’s Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 made £39,602 and is now on £36.6m after 10 weeks of play.
Also for Disney is horror The Boogeyman which collected £26,972 in its sixth session for a £18m cume.

The fifth Indiana Jones instalment had its world premiere at Cannes Film Festival on May 18, but it seems the critics in attendance weren't impressed by the film, which currently sits at 49% on Rotten Tomatoes from 43 reviews.
Given the critic scores for previous films in the franchise (93% for Raiders of the Lost Ark, 84% for Last Crusade, 77% for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and 76% for Temple of Doom), this makes it the lowest Tomatometer rating of the series to date by a large margin.

This score is likely to fluctuate as more critics get to watch James Mangold's film over the coming weeks, while audiences will be able to share their own thoughts on Indy's final adventure from next month.
Dial of Destiny will see Harrison Ford reprise his role as the legendary archaeologist for the fifth and final time, though Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy recently teased that the franchise could continue on TV in the future.
""It's Harrison's last entry. That's how we look at the Indy franchise,"" she told .

The actress, who has also appeared in Black Panther and Billions, described the series as ""special"" in an exclusive interview with Digital Spy last month, explaining why the films appeal to such a wide audience.
“It's the humanity of this character,"" she said. ""We all kind of see ourselves in him, in some respect, whether it's the naughty side, the antihero, the curmudgeon, the humour, the sexy guy – whatever it is. To kind of track his journey in this world, I think is just really special.""

""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"" the fifth movie following Harrison Ford as everyone's favorite archaeologist adventurer, had its US premiere on Wednesday.
The film is set to be released in US theaters on June 30 and marks Ford's final farewell to the franchise. Taking place against the backdrop of the 1960s space race, the sequel sees Indy going head-to-head with a former-Nazi scientist, played by Mads Mikkelsen, with the help of his ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" alumni John Rhys-Davies and Karen Allen.
However, the director James Mangold said there was one major character who wouldn't be making an appearance in the film.
Speaking to Variety on the red carpet, Mangold said that Shia LeBeouf, who played the titular hero's son in 2008's ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" was not brought back for the film.

""I think the point I had was that when I came on, I wanted to capture that wonderful energy between Indy and an intrepid female character,"" he said, referencing the fact that this time around, Indy is joined by Phoebe Waller-Bridge as his goddaughter, Helena Shaw.
""So that was my first goal, and there's only so many people you can edge into a picture,"" he added.
In ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" which was released 19 years after the third installment, LaBeouf was introduced to audiences as Mutt Williams, a motorcycle-riding greaser who tagged along with Indy when he became entangled in a Soviet plot to uncover the secrets behind mysterious artifacts.
Unbeknownst to the archaeologist adventurer at the beginning of the film, Mutt is later revealed to be the son he fathered with Marion Ravenwood, Allen's character and his love interest in the first installment, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""

Mangold told Entertainment Weekly that moviegoers would get an update on Mutt's whereabouts and ""find out what happened to him"" in the new film but said that LaBeouf's character would not appear in the movie.

""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is considered by many to be the worst film in the franchise and currently holds a 53% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. Adjusted for inflation, it has the lowest-grossing total of any movie in the franchise, according to Box Office Mojo.
Reflecting on the movie in 2010, LaBeouf told the Los Angeles Times that he ""dropped the ball on the legacy that people loved and cherished"" with his performance as Mutt.

2023-07-01 11:00:00+00:00,The true story behind Indiana Jones 5's dial of destiny,"Like other Indiana Jones movies, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is inspired by a real-life artefact, so what is the Antikythera and what did it do?","If you want to be like Indiana Jones, it's not enough simply to get yourself a fedora, a whip, and an affectionately surly attitude. You'll also need to beef up your knowledge of ancient civilisations.
A small, but somewhat underappreciated, part of these movies is how frequently they draw from the real, academic hunt for legendary artefacts and lost cities. Dr Henry Walton Jones, Jr is a (part-time) teacher, after all, often found pre-adventure in the classroom mapping out ruins on a chalkboard.
In Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the titular MacGuffin, the mechanism that every character – Jones, his duplicitous goddaughter Helena Shaw and the villainous Nazi Jürgen Voller included – is after, is a real piece called the Antikythera, which now resides in the collection of the National Archaeological Museum in Athens.
In Indy's world, the Antikythera holds a powerful secret linked to Archimedes, the Ancient Greek mathematician, astronomer, inventor, and all-around very smart guy.
Disney
Of course, the real Antikythera isn't magical, and won't lend its possessor the power to control time (so you can chill on the Ocean's Eleven-style museum heist). But archaeologists do still consider it to be one of the most mysterious, and quite wondrous, discoveries of the ancient world.
And – if you're ready for some minor spoilers – it isn't the only link The Dial of Destiny has to real history.
Is the Dial of Destiny real?

As (correctly) alluded to in the movie, the Antikythera was retrieved by divers from a shipwreck off the coast of Greece in 1901. It isn't two halves of a working mechanism, but three lumps of corroded bronze now divided by conservationists into 82 separate fragments, which offer a partial (but not complete) picture of how it may have functioned.
Some of these pieces are gears; another is a ring divided into degrees – technology that has led it to be described as the first ""analogue computer"", appearing more than a millennium before 13-century Europeans invented the first mechanical clocks.
The Antikythera, about the size of a mantel clock, would have sat in a wooden case. And, much like a clock, it would have featured a circular face with rotating hands, plus a handle on the side in order to wind the mechanism forward or backwards.
The hands showed the position of the Sun, the Moon, and each of the planets visible to the naked eye – Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. It also would have featured a calendar and a way to predict lunar and solar eclipses.

Now, the movie directly credits Archimedes with its creation, which wouldn't have been possible since it was made several centuries after his death.
That said, the Roman writer Cicero does mention him having constructed a machine that sounds vaguely similar to the Antikythera, so he may have come up with the general idea of representing celestial movements by mechanical means.
Scholars think the Antikythera was headed north from Rhodes, and may have actually been produced by the workshop of a different mathematician named Posidonius.
While the ""graphikos"" pointing to the location of the rest of the dial and Archimedes's tomb is fictional (the rest of the Antikythera is definitely still at the bottom of the ocean), Helena references two ""codes"", concealing clues to trick more amateur tomb raiders. Both are real.
Polybius square is a complicated device that turned letters into numbers, used by fire signallers to send coded transmissions (think ""the beacons are lit!"" scene from The Two Towers). Linear B is not actually a code, but a syllabic script found on clay tablets on Crete, argued by some to be the earliest form of written Greek.
Was the Siege of Syracuse real?
Lucasfilm // Disney
Absolutely. Not only did the siege depicted in the movie's finale happen (in 213 BC), but the various contraptions invented by Archimedes and used to fend off the Roman attack also have some (slightly dubious) basis in history.
Various writers from the ancient period, and slightly later, describe machines referred to now as Archimedes's Claw and Archimedes's Death Ray (no, really).
The former were huge beams which swung out over the city walls, in order to drop weights onto attacking ships or somehow hook into them and lift them out of the water. The latter was some kind of curved, reflective shield that could focus sunlight onto the ships and cause them to burst into flames, much like ants under a magnifying glass.
Now, as any academic will tell you, these ancient writers loved their hyperbole, and it's unlikely Archimedes's inventions were exactly as described. But there's enough evidence to suggest that he did contribute to the defence of Syracuse in some way, since the city was able to repel its attackers and force them into a siege.
And that blockade only ended when the Roman leader, Marcellus, took advantage of the lax surveillance during a festival to the goddess Artemis and managed to breach the walls in 212 BC. Archimedes was killed by a Roman soldier in the subsequent invasion, supposedly so lost in his equations that he didn't even see it coming. Poor guy.
Is the Lance of Longinus real?
Disney
Considering we've already seen Indy chase after the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail, it's about time the Lance of Longinus, another major, sacred relic of the Christian world, made its appearance. (It was actually already the subject of a 1995 comic book titled Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny.)
It's the little chunk of spear that our famed archaeologist and his ally Basil Shaw are after in the opening flashback to 1944. It was first mentioned in the Gospel of John, though the connection to a Roman centurion named Longinus comes much later, and is alleged to have been the lance that pierced Jesus's side as he hung on the cross.
Ironically, since Basil claims the lance ""has no power"", the Lance of Longinus is said to imbue its possessor with the ability to conquer kingdoms with ease.
Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor, is said to have wielded the spear while he marched across Europe in the 8th and 9th centuries. He dropped the lance one day and immediately died on the spot.
Of more significance to The Dial of Destiny, the lance also attracted the attention of Adolf Hitler, who saw it on display in Vienna as a young man. On October 13, 1938, under his orders, the lance was placed on a train and taken to Nuremberg. It was then located and seized by American forces on April 30, 1945, two hours before Hitler died by suicide.
Recent tests have revealed that the spear was made not at the time of Christ's death, but in the 7th century AD.
Where is the Tomb of Archimedes?
Disney
Cicero (him again) writes about tracking down Archimedes's grave in Syracuse which was ""hidden by bushes of brambles and thorns"".
So, it's definitely not in a cave as seen in the movie, surrounded by intricate puzzles, though the cave is a real place: The Ear of Dionysus cavern (or Orecchio di Dionisio) in Syracuse.
Named by the Italian painter Caravaggio after the Syracuse tyrant, Dionysius I, it's known for its remarkable echo, which can amplify even the quietest of sounds.
Caravaggio was convinced Dionysius had used the cave as a prison, taking advantage of the echo to spy on them. It was, in fact, dug during the ancient period to store water. But, as the Indy franchise has proven, sometimes it's a little more fun to believe in the legend.

2023-07-03 21:29:28+00:00,"Midsummer Box Office Hitting $1.88 Billion, -2% From 2022","Box Office: Mid-Summer At $1.88 Billion, Led by 'Guardians of the Galaxy'","From left: Summer 2023's top 3 movies to date: 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,' 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' and 'The Little Mermaid'
We’ve had a couple of tentpole missteps here this summer, read Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny this weekend with $60M, The Flash and Elemental; putting the running summer box office at $1.88 billion for May 1-July 2.
That’s close to -2% off from the $1.91 billion reached over the same frame last year. All these figures come from Comscore.
While the pacing isn’t terrible, the overall industry always likes to exceed year-over-year, especially after that disastrous pandemic that forced theaters to close in 2020 through early March 2021. Summer 2020 for the May 1-July 2 period only grossed $47.3M.
Next to the pre-pandemic summer 2019, which was on Viagra and steroids led by Disney/Marvel Studios’ Avengers: Endgame (delivering $416.7M for that May 1-July 2 play period), summer 2023 is 17% behind that midsummer, which accumulated $2.27 billion.
Still, there’s a lot of hope in July with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One set to open to a franchise-record $100M over 5 days, and the Barbie-and-Oppenheimer weekend fueling what could be a near-$200M weekend over July 21-23 for all films.
Comscore Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian points out, “The fortunes of the summer can be perceived as rich or fallow depending on which week is being examined and with many weeks and numerous potential high-profile blockbusters on the way in July and August, it’s way too early to characterize the overall summer box office performance as a hit or a miss.”
Even though we’re slightly behind 2022, we could be ahead ultimately, as Dergarabedian says, “August could be the unexpected savior and take the summer out with a bang instead of a whimper as happened last year.” Remember, Sony’s Bullet Train was the last huzzah last summer before studio movies went dry to the post-pandemic logjam in post-production. This August we have marquee fare in Paramount’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (August 2), Warner Bros’ The Meg 2 (August 4), Universal’s The Last Voyage of the Demeter (August 11), Sony’s Gran Turismo (August 11), Universal’s raunchy R-rated talking-animals comedy Strays (August 18), Warner Bros/DC’s Blue Beetle (August 18) and Sony’s The Equalizer 3 (September 1).
Disney, despite stumbling with Dial of Destiny and Elemental, is leading all studios at the summer box office thus far with an estimated $811M, per Deadline calculations, and from a diverse slate that includes 20th Century Studios fare and tentpoles. That’s more than the combined $620M that Universal and Sony have pulled in for the beach season. Disney is providing a diverse slate of theatrical releases to cinemas post-pandemic, and it’s largely being very good about long windows (none of this 17-days-to-Disney+ stuff); all this despite the beating the studio took for going theatrical day-and-date on their streaming service back in summer 2021 under the CEO Bob Chapek era.
Summer currently reps 42% of the $4.5M running domestic box office cume this year for January 1-July 2. Overall, 2023 is 18% ahead of 2022 and 21% behind 2019.
Currently Disney owns five of the top 10 movies in summer; here is the list for May 1-July 2:
1.) Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (Dis) – $354.8M
2.) Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Sony) – $339.8M
3.) The Little Mermaid (Dis) – $281M
4.) Fast X (Uni) – $145.4M
5.) Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (Par) – $136.1M
6.) The Flash (WB) – $99.2M
7.) Elemental (Dis) – $88.7M
8.) The Super Mario Bros. Movie (Ill/Uni) – $82.6M (of a total cume that is $573.4M)
9.) Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (Dis) – $60M

Calista Flockhart took a walk down memory lane at the Los Angeles premiere of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny on Wednesday.
The actress attended the premiere to support husband Harrison Ford’s fifth and final performance as the iconic character in the film, which is set to hit theaters June 30. But that didn’t stop Flockhart from having her moment in the same golden yellow Ralph Lauren Skirt that she initially wore to the Emmy Awards in 1999.
Elizabeth Stewart, Flockhart’s longtime stylist, also took to Instagram to show off the memorable outfit, which included a black off-the-shoulder top to coincide with the shining skirt. The actress previously finished off the look in a white button-down shirt.
“#CalistaFlockhart heading to the Los Angeles premiere of #IndianaJones in the same golden yellow @ralphlauren skirt she wore to the Emmys in 1999!” Stewart wrote in the post’s caption. “Cherish and rewear your clothes people! (and yes we’ve worked together that long!).”
Twenty-four years prior, Flockhart attended the 51st Emmys, where she was nominated for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series for her role in the hit series Ally McBeal. Although she didn’t win, the show did take home an Emmy that year for outstanding comedy series, as well as awards in two other categories.
A few years later, Ford and Flockhart met in 2002. But it wasn’t until 2010 that the couple tied the knot after seven years of dating.

PREVIOUS: Angels Studios’ Jim Caviezel thriller Sound of Freedom, came on strong Tuesday and gave Disney/Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny a run for its money at the domestic box office. However, until actuals are reported, it remains to be seen who won on July 4th, with both distributors reporting $11.5 million.
More from Deadline
Rival distributors off their own calculations see Sound of Freedom as a clear No. 2 in its opening yesterday with $11M at 2,634 theaters, with Indy winning the day.
Nonetheless, all industry eyes are watching the anomaly of this non-major-studio independent title that has faith-based elements. Some pre-release projections had Sound of Freedom doing $11M-$15M over six days, not one. We also heard a six-day total of $20M. The movie nabbed an A+ CinemaScore yesterday, which is standard for a faith-based-fueled title.
RELATED: Jim Caviezel Anti-Child-Trafficking Thriller ‘Sound Of Freedom’ Notches $10M Presales Before July 4th Opening
Angel Studios is a using a crowdfunding platform to spur its ticket sales. Known as Pay It Forward, the patent-pending technology from the distributor is billed as empowering moviegoers to purchase tickets for other people. It was first launched in March with the release of His Only Son, about the prophet Abraham; the movie opened to $5.5M and finaled stateside at $12M.
Story continues
Angels Studios reports this morning that an additional $2.6M has been raised by crowdfunding, bringing the gross for Sound of Freedom to $14M. We were told Monday that crowdfunded presales reached $10M for the movie, which is based on the true story of homeland security officer Tim Ballard, who took rescuing abducted children around the globe into his own hands.
What’s going on here? I hear from theater owners that some of them were allowed to screen the movie as early as Monday. Also, there’s a big right-wing fueling of grosses here, many tell me.
Passion of the Christ star Caviezel was a guest on Steve Bannon’s War Room show, where the host was urging viewers to turn out for the opening. I’m hearing whispers that many right-wing groups snapped up tickets and are giving them out for free.
Appropriate comps for Sound of Freedom are faith-based titles based on true stories or are part of a thriller genre, but it’s even blowing those titles away: examples like 2011’s Soul Surfer, which had a first Friday of $3.6M, 3-day opening of $10.6M, and final of $43.8M; and 2008’s Fireproof, which opened to $6.8M over three days and grossed over $33M stateside.
Meanwhile, Dial of Destiny‘s better-than-expected July 4th — a day not always known for moviegoing — was only off 3% from Monday’s $11.8M, putting its five-day haul at $83.6M. If the movie follows the second-weekend path of other older-guy-skewing titles like No Time to Die and posts a 57%-60% decline, it’s looking at around $24M-$25M this coming weekend. Indy‘s advantage is that he’ll keep all the PLFs and Imax in weekend 2.
Some believe it will be a close call this coming weekend between Indy and Sony/Screen Gems/Stage 6 Films/Blumhouse’s Insidious: The Red Door, directed by the franchise’s star Patrick Wilson and also starring series actress Rose Byrne. While Sony is only spotting $18M-$20M at 3,150 theaters on the movie that cost a thrifty $16M, others see it higher with tracking at $23M. Under 25 women are tracking the best for the fifthquel. No review score recorded yet by Rotten Tomatoes. Previews start Thursday at 4 p.m. at 2,700 theaters.
The highest opening for an Insidious movie belongs to the 2013 sequel Insidious Chapter 2, which saw $40.2M. That’s also the highest-grossing installment in the horror series in the U.S./Canada at $83.5M. The previous installment, Insidious: The Last Key, did well off its $10M production cost with a $29.5M opening, $67.7M domestic take and overall global gross of $167.8M, making in the highest-grossing chapter for the horror franchise. Through four movies, the Insidious films have minted $542.7M worldwide.
Lionsgate has the R-rated raunchy Asian-American female comedy, Joy Ride, which is looking at $7M-$9M at 2,800 locations over four days. The movie directed and co-written by Crazy Rich Asians scribe Adele Lim made its world premiere at SXSW and currently counts a 91% fresh Rotten Tomatoes critics score from 53 reviews at the time of this post. Previews begin today at 6 p.m. The comedy is a co-production between Seth Rogen’s Point Grey and Red Mysterious Hippo.
The last Asian American comedy, Easter Sunday from stand-up Jo Koy, opened to $5.4M in August 2022 and finaled at $13M.

2023-07-09 18:01:13+00:00,"‘Indiana Jones 5’ and ‘Insidious: The Red Door’ Tie at International Box Office, ‘Transformers’ Hits $400 Million Globally","""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is facing an unexpectedly close race with ""Insidious: The Red Door"" on international box office charts.","Disney’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is barely winning an unexpectedly close race with “Insidious: The Red Door” on international box office charts, with each film collecting roughly $31 million over the weekend.
Based on Sunday’s estimates, “Indiana Jones 5” is ever-so-slightly ahead of “Insidious 5” with $31.8 million for Harrison Ford’s swashbuckling adventure and $31.4 million for Sony’s paranormal horror story.
“The Red Door” easily took town “Dial of Destiny” at the domestic box office, with the former earning $32.6 million in its debut. It marked the second-best opening weekend of the franchise behind 2013’s “Insidious: Chapter 2” ($40 million).
Overseas, the newest “Insidious” movie managed to secure the best start for a horror film in pandemic times, as well as the biggest start of the supernatural-horror series in comparable markets. Top markets include Mexico ($5.8 million) the Philippines ($3.7 million) and the U.K. ($2.8 million).
With $64 million in global ticket sales to date, the $16-million budgeted “Insidious 5” is already reaping big rewards in its box office run. “The Red Door,” which is positioned as the conclusion to the horror franchise, brings back original cast members Patrick Wilson (who also directed the film) Ty Simpkins, Andrew Astor and Rose Byrne.
Meanwhile, “Dial of Destiny” has collected $127 million internationally so far, boosting its global tally to $248 million. For Disney and Lucasfilm, which shelled out an eye-popping $300 million to make the latest globe-trotting adventure, it’s catastrophic that ticket sales have yet to cross $250 million.
Disney and Pixar’s “Elemental” trailed “Dial of Destiny” and “Insidious 5” on international charts, bringing in $30 million from 48 markets. That takes its total to $142 million overseas and $250.9 million globally. The animated family film got off to a rocky start on the big screen, but it’s remained a draw for families in subsequent weeks. It cost $200 million, so it’ll need to keep playing in theaters to justify that price tag.
Also this weekend, Paramount’s “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” crossed the $400 million mark globally. With another $7.6 million over the weekend, the seventh “Transformers” installment has earned $261 million overseas and $407 million worldwide to date. “Rise of the Beasts,” which cost $200 million, has stuck around on movie theater marquees despite an unremarkable start at the box office.
Elsewhere, Warner Bros. and DC’s comic book adventure “The Flash” is running out of steam with $5 million from 78 markets in its fourth weekend of release. This weekend’s ticket sales take the international tally to $156 million and the worldwide total to $261 million. It’s a catastrophic result given the film’s $200 million price tag.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LWluc2lkaW91cy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtdGllLTEyMzU2NjQ4MjUv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vYm94LW9mZmljZS9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLTUtaW5zaWRpb3VzLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYm94LW9mZmljZS10aWUtMTIzNTY2NDgyNS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Movie and the new Spider Man movie.,"The continuing box office recovery was evident at Imax in its Q2 earnings report, showing substantial revenue growth both year over year and quarter to quarter, as well as a notable increase in profits.
Imax had revenue of $98 million in Q2, up 38 percent from a year ago and up from $87 million in Q1, with profits of $8.4 million, compared to a $2.9 million loss a year ago, and a $2.5 million profit in Q1.
The company succeeded thanks in part to The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Spider Man: Across the Spider-Verse, which were released in Q2 and quickly became the No. 1 and 2 most watched animated movies of all time on Imax screens.
“Imax continues to be a winner in a dynamic global marketplace for entertainment, as demonstrated by our strong results in the second quarter,” said Imax CEO Richard Gelfond in a statement. “We again proved that Imax can drive results in virtually any business environment thanks to our global scale, asset-lite model, and diversified revenue mix across technology licensing and Hollywood and local language global box office.”
Gross box office from Imax locations in Q2 2023 was $268.3 million, up 8 percent from a year ago.
And Imax’s Q2 performance is without any boost from two big movies that seem tailor-made for Imax screens: Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One. Those films were released in what will be Imax’s Q3.
In fact, Imax said that this past weekend was one of the best it has ever seen.
“This past weekend demonstrates the paradigm shift at hand in moviegoing, as Imax drove strong double-digit market share with a trio of Hollywood and local releases — led by the stunning performance of Oppenheimer — lifting the Company to one of its best weekends of all time at the global box office,” Gelfond said.
Oppenheimer indexed to a 20 percent share of Imax screens, the company said, marking a new record. Through the end of June, Imax had 3.3 percent market share of global box office.
“What a weekend. And what a quarter,” Gelfond said to open the company’s earnings call, adding that Imax “demonstrated its ever-strengthening position at the vanguard of cinema.”
And the company had other positive news suggesting that there will be further growth, including that its system signings have hit 84 so far this year, well more than the company delivered in all of 2022 (when it had 47 system signings).
The company also noted upcoming releases like Dune 2 and the upcoming Aquaman sequel, which were both filmed for Imax, as well as Apple’s Napoleon from Ridley Scott and Killers of the Flower Moon from Martin Scorsese.
Gelfond noted that the WGA and SAG strikes do bring some uncertainty to the upcoming theatrical slates.
“While there is some concern about release dates shifting due to the labor strikes, we believe nearly all of our second half slate has wrapped shooting,” Gelfond said. “Additionally, given our surging indexing, we believe studios will be reluctant to move films on our slate — and potentially sacrifice an already agreed to Imax window.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ltYXgtcTItMjAyMy1lYXJuaW5ncy0xMjM1NTQ1NzQzL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ltYXgtcTItMjAyMy1lYXJuaW5ncy0xMjM1NTQ1NzQzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-06 14:24:31.302000+00:00,"Barbie, Bombs, Blockbusters! Box Office Wars Return as a Spectator Sport","This summer, Hollywood needs to make $4 billion from movies like 'Barbie,' 'Mission: Impossible,' and 'Oppenheimer' to be truly in the pink.","Tom Cruise knows how to sell tickets—even to other people’s movies. “This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,” the Mission: Impossible star wrote on Instagram recently, while he and director Christopher McQuarrie posed with tickets in front of posters for rival films. Cruise congratulated Harrison Ford for “creating one of the most iconic characters in cinema history” with Indiana Jones, and identified himself as one of the many people who’d make a double feature out of Oppenheimer and Barbie, which will go head-to-head in theaters as of July 21. His act of goodwill proved to be contagious, as he must have hoped it would. A few days later, Barbie director Greta Gerwig and star Margot Robbie tweeted their own photo shoot, in which they also waved tickets to their rivals: “Mission: Accepted!”
Summer box office used to be the ultimate showbiz blood sport. Now, publicly at least, it’s all kumbaya and collegiality, which says a lot about the industry’s enduring post-pandemic fears. Beneath the gracious social media shoutouts is a pervasive sense that if the public doesn’t fall back in love with in-person moviegoing for good now, the bottom will continue to fall out of the studio system and take stars down in the process. So far, summer 2023 has proven to be a bumpy ride. Sure-things have struggled, surprise sleepers have failed to emerge, and pressure is mounting on a handful of July titles to save the season.
Box office watchers are still predicting that movies like Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One and Barbie can help summer ticket sales in the US and Canada hit $4 billion, which would be taken as a sign that the industry has indeed recovered from an anemic three years. But a trail of early underperformers—including DC’s The Flash, Pixar’s Elemental, and Indy’s fifth and final outing, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny—has only stoked worries. With his cheerleading post, Cruise, the man who “saved Hollywood’s ass” last summer with Top Gun: Maverick, is attempting to stage a rescue mission again. This time he’ll have some help from Barbie and the atomic bomb.
Hollywood power brokers are watching all this closely, to say the least. “I was very excited after Super Mario Bros., and then I got a little more concerned after the last four weeks,” says producer Jason Blum, best known for low-cost horror hits Paranormal Activity, Insidious, and M3GAN. “The movie business has in no way bounced back like the live events business has, but I really think that it’s a matter of time.” Few expect earnings to surpass summer 2019 levels—when 32 films brought in $4.34 billion—but anything close will be a win. The industry is used to absorbing bad news—and hoping for last-minute salvation. “Not everything works,” says another studio executive poring over summer ticket sales, “but that’s just the movie business.”
There are reasons to be at least optimism-adjacent. Moviegoers still want to see spectacle—and they are willing to pay extra to see it on premium large-format screens. “2023 has definitely been a much fuller slate than pre-pandemic times,” says IMAX CEO Richard Gelfond. “And for us, it’s even a little more intense because the audience has shifted more to premium on a global basis. IMAX’s market share went up by 50% in North America and it’s gone up by about 40% globally. So it’s not only more competition within the industry, it’s more competition for IMAX screens. We think our box office will be similar to 2019.”
Similar is the new amazing.
Moviegoers signaled that they were ready to return to theaters last summer when they showed up in droves for Top Gun: Maverick, the top performer of the year with a staggering $719 million in US ticket sales, and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which outperformed 2016’s Doctor Strange. But the robust performance of a handful of titles belied ongoing challenges. Last winter, as one Oscar contender after another died gasping at the box office, a senior awards strategist told Vanity Fair, “the audience is just not there anymore for these sorts of movies.” One obstacle was simply a volume problem: Even though tentpoles like Avatar: The Way of Water were dominating the weekend, there just weren’t enough movies in theaters.
This summer, every weekend offers multiple options, and they’re often aimed at disparate demographics, as with the showdown referred to in some quarters as “Barbenheimer.” Since May 5, when Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 dropped, there’s been a steady beat of new releases, among them The Little Mermaid, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts. The major studios are expected to release 42 films widely across the country by Labor Day weekend. One studio executive moans about all this in a way that sounds almost nostalgic: “It’s such a crowded summer.”
Before Cruise began his goodwill campaign, the actor was involved in a behind-the-scenes fight for IMAX screens, according to Puck. His latest Mission: Impossible outing will play on IMAX screens for about a week, but then must give them up for Oppenheimer, which debuts a week later on July 21 and has all the screens exclusively booked for three weeks. That has little to do with earnings expectations, and everything to do with relationships. Nolan, a longtime IMAX champion, had struck a deal long before with the exhibitor to guarantee that his movie would play on those screens, regardless of who else parachuted into the market on a motorcycle.
IMAX’s Gelfond tells VF that he worked closely with Nolan and Universal on Oppenheimer’s release date more than a year ago. He visited the Mission: Impossible set and is “a huge fan of Tom’s,” he says, but this is the bottom line: “We made a commitment to Chris. Obviously, I think the movie’s going to be great, but irrespective, we honor our commitments.”
Executives worried about a crowded schedule are one sign that movies are back, baby. “We’ve had really big films since reopening from the pandemic, like Avatar and Top Gun and Spider-Man, but now we’re talking about many titles,” says Elizabeth Frank, the executive in charge of programming AMC Entertainment’s more than 10,000 screens. “People are saying, ‘Well, which one do you want to see first?’ And that’s a different level of excitement. In an industry where momentum is really important, it’s an opportunity for us to build back habitual moviegoing.”
In Hollywood, the weekend box office is treated with the same seriousness as the World Series. “I have a group of friends, we get together at the beginning of the year and we have a draft, we pick all the movies for the year, and points are awarded based on Metacritic score, based on box office, based on awards, and based on profitability,” says Blum, whose company, Blumhouse, has Insidious: The Red Door out on July 7. “We text each other every Thursday or Friday. I’m currently in second place.”
Guys like Blum no doubt pay closer attention to movie ticket sales than the average American, but even he has noticed that more people are following the money as they did years ago. “The box office derby is one of those things that everyone can be a part of,” says Paul Dergarabedian, an entertainment industry analyst for Comscore. “Not everyone has played professional sports or ridden a horse professionally or driven a race car, but we can all sit in a movie theater.”
More scrutiny, of course, means more headlines when movies stumble. For every winner like Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (with its $356 million in domestic grosses) or Spider Man: Across the Spider-Verse ($346 million), there’s something like The Flash, which has pulled a meager $102 million in the US in spite of its reported $200 million budget, or Elemental, whose $29.6 million debut was considered a major flop for Disney’s Pixar. Meanwhile, Dial of Destiny, which reportedly cost $295 million, arguably needed to make a lot more over Fourth of July than it did. One bright spot? Studios are focusing more on profitability, which Blum contends, “everyone forgot about for about five years.” Now, he says, there’s more pressure to rein in costs: “The budget conversation was the last conversation when you were introducing new projects to buyers. Now it’s the first, which makes me happy because I think less expensive movies are often better and more interesting.”
Even before June gloom hit the box office, Hollywood had largely put its faith in Mission: Impossible, Barbie, and Oppenheimer to carry ticket sales. Now it’s even more imperative that all three titles find their audiences. Early tracking—which pegs the Mission: Impossible opening at around $90 million, Barbie somewhere north of $70 million, and Oppenheimer around $40 million—suggests that they will. Though Ethan Hunt will likely be the biggest star of the summer, media attention has focused squarely on the matchup between Barbie and Oppenheimer.
“I do think a rising tide lifts all boats,” says a top film agent. “When we have pictures in theaters that start to feel like they’re ‘watercooler’—which I really think the Barbie-Oppenheimer thing is becoming—it’s incredibly healthy for the box office, because what we’re doing is delivering an experience that people feel like was worth their time and money.”
AMC has been preparing for the summer movie season by extending operating hours at its theaters, hiring more staff, and making sure its Icee dispensers are full. “Increasingly, fans of different films are also looking for movie-themed merchandise and movie-themed drinks,” says Frank. “It makes the moviegoing experience that much more engaging and dynamic. It’s a little complicated, though, to be moving in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle cups while you’re figuring out whether you’ve still got a bunch of people who want the Mission: Impossible ones or the Barbie ones.”
Predicting the box office has always been like reading tea leaves or tarot cards. Even IMAX’s Gelfond admits to fixating on the returns—from the first night to the last. “Like a junkie,” he says. “I hate to admit it, but yes. Most of our movies open on Thursday nights because they’re big blockbusters. So by Friday morning, I’m on the phone with our distribution and marketing teams trying to understand what the weekend’s going to look like and what’s working and not working and why and why not.”

54:13.2,‘Sound of Freedom’ outperforms ‘Indiana Jones’ and ‘The Flash’ on 4th of July,Sound of freedom beats Indiana Jones. Sound of freedom box office. Sound of freedom gross sales. Has the sound of freedom been released? Sex trafficking movie 2023. Indiana Jones 5 box office.,"The unassuming, anti-child trafficking film “Sound of Freedom” outperformed “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” and “The Flash” on the Fourth of July. “Sound of Freedom” boldly hit theaters on a holiday typically celebrated around the barbecue — not the movie theater — but still impressed at the box office.
“The Sound of Freedom” raked in more than $14 million on Tuesday, while the fifth “Indiana Jones” movie brought in more than $11 million and “The Flash” made just $1 million per Box Office Mojo.
Despite “The Sound of Freedom’s” impressive holiday run, the latest “Indiana Jones” installment, which hit theaters on June 30, is outperforming the anti-child trafficking film overall. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” has made more than $83 million domestically and more than $154 million worldwide during its first six days on screen, per Box Office Mojo.
The last Indy movie, “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” which landed in theaters in May 2008, made nearly $800 million worldwide at the box office.
“The Flash,” which hit theaters on June 16, is also outperforming “The Sound of Freedom” overall. The superhero movie has made more than $101 million domestically and $247 million worldwide at the box office so far, according to Box Office Mojo.
The majority of “The Sound of Freedom” opening day profits came from pre-sales. In a press release sent to the Deseret News, Angel Studios revealed that ‘The Sound of Freedom” topped $10 million in pre-sales ahead of its July 4 theatrical release.
Angel Studios is using a crowdfunding platform known as Pay it Forward to sell more tickets. Those with expendable income can purchase tickets in advance for those who wish to see the film, but cannot afford a ticket. According to a press release from Angel Studios, $2.6 million of opening day sales came through the Pay it Forward program.
Filmmakers behind “Sound of Freedom” hope to see 2 million tickets to “symbolize our commitment to the 2 million trafficked children around the world,” per Angel Studios. Nearly 1.5 million tickets have been sold so far.
“Sound of Freedom” has already outperformed Angel Studios’ “His Only Son” which made $5.5 million at its domestic opening in March and just over $12 million worldwide overall.
What is ‘Sound of Freedom’ rated?
“Sound of Freedom” is rated PG-13. The movie is set around child sex trafficking. Although there is no graphic imagery, it is a dark theme. There is mild language use and some violence, including weapon use. Smoking and drinking is seen throughout.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2VyZXQuY29tLzIwMjMvNy82LzIzNzU4NjMzL3NvdW5kLW9mLWZyZWVkb20taW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1ib3gtb2ZmaWNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-14 10:00:00+00:00,INDIANA JONES AND THE DIAL OF DESTINY,"It has been 15 years since famed archeologist/ adventurer Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) was onscreen in “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” and even longer since he was onscreen in a decent movie. Fans were worried if that creative flop would be the last they’d ever see of Indy, but now","It has been 15 years since famed archeologist/ adventurer Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) was onscreen in “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” and even longer since he was onscreen in a decent movie. Fans were worried if that creative flop would be the last they’d ever see of Indy, but now he has a second chance to make a last impression. With new director James Mangold at the helm, I suppose there was a chance that this franchise could have dug itself even deeper into the hole, but I’m pleased to say that this entry is not an embarrassment. It’s too bad I can’t say anything better than that, but it’s more than I could say for the last movie.
AN opening sequence sees a younger Indy (using not-perfect but not-distracting digital de-aging effects on Ford) rescue an artifact from Nazis at the tail end of World War II with the help of bumbling colleague Basil (Toby Jones). This sequence takes place on a moving train, so there are seemingly endless opportunities to throw bad guys off screaming. It’s fun, if a bit overlong, which can be said of all the action sequences in this movie.
Flash forward to 1969. Indy is in his twilight years, and it seems the world has left him behind. His wife Marion (Karen Allen) has left him, his neighbors wake him up with loud rock music, he can’t keep his students’ attention in class, and the university is forcing him into retirement. The only pleasant surprise in his day is a visit from Helena (Pheobe Waller-Bridge), the late Basil’s daughter and his goddaughter. She has a proposal involving the Dial of Destiny, the artifact Indy and her father rescued from the Nazis. He’s not up for another adventure, but he can help her in simple fashion, and this ironically gets him pulled into an even bigger adventure.
It turns out that the duplicitous Helena just wants to steal the Dial and sell it. She’s being tailed by the CIA and renowned scientist Jurgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), a Nazi leftover who knows the Dial’s true power. Indy just wants the Dial to be safe, and if that includes protecting Helena and her kid sidekick Teddy (Ethann Isodore) and stopping the bad guys, then so be it.
The rest of the movie is mostly just an elaborate treasure hunt where Indy and Helena navigate clues, booby traps, and conflicting loyalties in various cities, with Voller usually showing up to get everyone into an action sequence. Old friend Sallah (Jonathan Rhys-Davies) shows up along the way, as does Renaldo (Antonio Banderas), a diver Indy enlists for an underwater mission. The film’s climax sees Voller try to exploit the time-travel capabilities of the Dial. As evil as he is, I had a laugh at the idea that Voller’s master plan is technically the same thing that every time traveler wants to do.
Until the time-travel conclusion (which is at least handled with more dignity than those aliens from “Crystal Skull”), “Dial of Destiny” is just perfectly average for Indiana Jones. Certain visual components look a little too polished to be natural, but otherwise a familiar sense of fun is still in play. Indy’s wit is as quick as ever, and of course any character played by Waller-Bridge is going to be pretty sharp too. The charm of 1981’s “Raiders of the Lost Ark” is never quite matched, but that may be too high a standard. Some will say that putting a character as iconic as Indiana Jones in a just-okay movie is a disservice to his cinematic legacy, but I choose to focus on the upside of this movie being a satisfactory end note for the character compared to what it would have been otherwise.
Grade: B-
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is rated PG-13 for sequences of violence and action, language and smoking. Its running time is 154 minutes.
`Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Opens with $60M for Top Spot
LOS ANGELES (CNS) – “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” opened with $60 million this weekend to claim the top spot at North American theaters, according to industry estimates released today.
The fifth film in the long-running franchise that began with 1981’s “Raiders of the Lost Ark” easily beat out “Spider-Man: Across the Spider- Verse,” which grossed $11.5 million Friday through Sunday in its fifth week of release, Comscore reported.
Disney’s “Elemental” was third with $11.3 million in its third week.
Fourth place went to the sex comedy “No Hard Feelings,’’ which took in $7.5 million in its second week, followed by “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts’’ with $7 million in its fourth week.
Rounding out the top 10 domestic releases, as estimated by Comscore, were “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken’’ ($5.2 million), “The Little Mermaid’’ ($5.1 million), “The Flash” ($5 million), “Asteroid City’’ ($3.8 million) and “Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3’’ ($1.8 million).
This weekend’s overall three-day box office haul was estimated at $125.1 million. The year-to-date total is $4.538 billion — an increase of 18% over the figure at this time last year, according to Comscore.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaWNvdW50eXNlbnRyeS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1hbmQtdGhlLWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-01 15:21:27+00:00,"Movie review: Nostalgic, yes, but ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ lacks adventure",This dose of “Indiana Jones” is a disappointingly diluted version of this favorite hero.,"It’s been 15 years since we last encountered Indiana Jones, the whip-cracking archaeologist made iconic by star Harrison Ford, director Steven Spielberg, and George Lucas, who conceived of the story while seeking to update the classic adventure serial. Audiences fell for the brainy, blunt and brave Indy in his globe-trotting adventures explored in the original trilogy, which started with “Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark” in 1981. Even the fourth installment, arriving in 2008, “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” was profitable, and warmly received despite its goofy story.
It’s no surprise that in a filmmaking landscape where legacy sequels, or “legasequels,” roam the box office, the powers that be would take ol’ Indy out for another spin. Ford had returned to both “Star Wars” and “Blade Runner” to positive notices, so it made sense to get the band back together for one more gig, to see if there’s any juice left to squeeze. Enter “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” in which James Mangold takes the reins from Spielberg.
Mangold also co-wrote the script with Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and David Koepp, and, true to the spirit of the legasequel, it’s about time travel — the story reflecting the nostalgic desire of both filmmakers and audiences to utilize movies as vehicles to revisit the emotions we felt when we were young. Lucas and Spielberg used “Indiana Jones” to recreate the feeling of their favorite childhood serials, and Mangold is tasked with delivering a film that brings us back to that feeling of falling in love with “Raiders of the Lost Ark” back in the ‘80s. He approaches the task so literally that he seems to have overlooked the goal of simply making a great adventure movie.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” hits the nostalgia button from minute one, with an almost creepy, fetishistic reanimation of Indy’s appeal. These reminders of what was are like constant jabs in the ribs, as if the filmmakers are saying, “Remember this? You like this.” It’s cameos from beloved characters, reminders of Indy’s well-known idiosyncrasies (he hates snakes and enjoys punching Nazis), and do-overs of famous bits from the previous films. They try so hard to recapture the original charm but haven’t actually thought about what made it charming in the first place, and the result is a sloggy, dull sequel that’s more “Bogus Journey” than “Excellent Adventure.”
It opens with a sequence that takes place toward the end of World War II, as Jones and fellow archaeologist Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) sneak around piles of treasure looted by Nazis, trying to liberate a few historically significant — and potentially powerful — baubles. Fast forward to the late ‘60s, where Indy is a grumpy professor in New York City. He has no groupies, no wife and no child when a strange woman, Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), ambushes him at a dive bar. She’s Indy’s goddaughter, the daughter of dear departed Bas, and she wants a mysterious dial crafted by Greek mathematician Archimedes that her pop pilfered from the Nazi loot train. Can Indy help her?
He doesn’t have much of a choice when they’re suddenly pursued through the city by two bloodthirsty blondes with buzz cuts (Boyd Holbrook and Olivier Richters). These menaces are in the employ of Dr. Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), a shadowy figure from Indy’s past and a rocket scientist/former Nazi who needs the dial to “fix Hitler’s mistakes.” Yes, the plot itself is a rather hackneyed pop culture meme.
Mangold is a slick filmmaker, and in “Dial of Destiny,” he alternates the nostalgia bumps and surprise cameos with extremely fast set pieces; the entire film feels like one long car (horse, boat, tuk-tuk) chase. All of the action sequences are capably crafted, and a total snooze. As Indy and Helena — and a precocious poppet (Ethann Isidore) they pick up in Morocco — dart around the globe retrieving various items, the bad guys chase them and relieve them of said items. Helena quips annoyingly, Indy grumbles predictably, and Mangold stuns us into a stupor with his perfectly competent filmmaking. It is a crushingly dull film until it becomes jaw-droppingly cartoonish.
Perhaps a swig of something familiar in an air-conditioned theater will be just the ticket for a summer weekend. However, this dose of “Indiana Jones” is a disappointingly diluted version of this favorite hero that has the power to put a fan off the franchise forever.

2023-07-10 15:00:00+00:00,Where Does Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny Rank Against Rest Of Franchise?,Where does Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny rank against the rest of the franchise? That's what I'll be exploring in this article.,"I finally managed to catch Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny this Saturday and I wrote this article the day after on Sunday. One question I wanted to explore as a big Indy fan was, where does Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny rank against the rest of the franchise. I’ll also review the movie myself as I discuss where I see it fitting and why.
I’ll start with my current rankings, movies only, and take it from there. This won’t be everyone’s list, but it is mine.
Raiders of the Lost Ark (In my all time top five)
The Last Crusade
Temple of Doom
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
However, it would be fair to say that there’s a sizable gap for me between Temple of Doom and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. I should therefore start by saying I’m not a fan of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. I don’t think it’s an awful movie, but it is not a great movie either and I think that is true for the first three movies.
Some of my issues with KOTCS were the silliness and a plot that didn’t seem to…matter. However, you’re here to read about the new movie.
There will be plot SPOILERS here folks, this is not SPOILER free so bear that in mind going in.
The Dial of Destiny
Honestly, there are a lot of things I liked about Dial of Destiny. The movie loses a lot of silliness that was present in KOTCS, which for me was the right way to go tonally. By that I mean, the tone of DoD is more in tune with that of Raiders or Temple of Doom. Dial of Destiny doesn’t have any of the comedy present in Last Crusade and neither it should. I feel like that movie was the outlier (until KOTCS went even harder) and therefore I’m pleased this goes a bit more serious.
Unlike Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the plot of this story seemed to matter. You could actually argue like Raiders, the same events would have happened had Indy not intervened. However, when people level that as a criticism I always say it’s irrelevant. The fact the characters think it will matter is what is important. Now, unless you think going back in time to help the Nazi’s win the war isn’t an important thing to stop, you may well agree with me that the plot matters here.
Does it Work?
Yet, was that a good and convincing plot when all laid out? Erm, not really.
Just to get this right, the film’s baddie Voller blames Hitler for losing the War. Is his plan to go back and give Hitler the information he needs to right his wrongs and ensure a Nazi victory? No, instead his plan is to assassinate Hitler in 1939.
Really? Isn’t that the plot of many other time travel stories where the good guys are trying to kill off Hitler. Does Voller believe after that he won’t just be shot immediately and therefore unable to explain the future events to anyone of importance? Does he believe that Himmler or someone like that would do a better job? That’s how it would have worked. I guess he may have made Hitler a martyr, which may have done something? However, you can I think, see my frustration.
Character arcs
As of right now I’ve given some good and some bad and this will continue when we get to character arcs. We’ll start with the main man himself. I like Indy’s character arc here, however I don’t think it was executed as well as it could have been. Cutting it short, Indy’s arc is that he is learning to deal with his grief over the loss of his son in war. The loss has caused he and his wife Marion to split. Indy is old and he’s also lonely and drinking too much.
Retirement is here finally and whilst he get’s a good send off from his former colleagues, Indy simply doesn’t care and has nothing to look forward to. Its a bold choice for how this went and it also allows us to finally see Ford delivering something akin to his younger days for the first time in a while. Clearly Ford cares about this story and he sells this Indy to you. There’s a reluctance to have an adventure here that we haven’t seen yet with Indy.
Suggestions
Honestly, Ford is the best thing in this movie, which may not come as a huge surprise, but I didn’t feel that way about the return of Han Solo. However, whilst a character arc may seems good on paper, it;s about how we as an audience feel a part of that arc and this is where Dial of Destiny doesn’t quite cut it for me.
We end with Indy and Marion getting back together and him realizing he still has a family and friends to live for. As I said, this is a cool arc on paper, but I never felt it was executed well. The movie should have been a journey of reluctance on Indy’s part to end up with some sense of enjoyment and a him coming to the realization he wants Marion back on his own. Instead, we get Indy staying roughly the same and then being forcibly stopped from throwing his life away. Only to wake up and find his family there.
Why not have Indy come to this decision himself throughout the course of the movie?
You could even have had the bad guy tempt Indy with allowing him to stop his son from dying if he helped them. There are so many missed opportunities to add these elements into the story, so that Indy makes the choice that messing with time is wrong and he has to accept his fate. Have him skirt with the idea of staying in the past at the end (not 1939), but a word from Helena to remind him of some deep conversation they had earlier brings him back home on his own.
As things stand the emotional pay off does not feel earned throughout the movie. That’s perhaps what frustrated me most about Dial of Destiny.
Indy 5 Bad?
Actually, there really is a good damned movie here under the hood. However that’s never seen by the writer/director. Not once after Indy first talks about Mutt’s death does Helena try and get inside his head. Instead it’s always Indy playing the life coach to ‘Wombat’ for her character arc. Don’t get me wrong, Helena’s arc is fine, it’s the same one Indy has in Temple of Doom. Yet, when things change for Helena they just, change, I’m not sure we saw that change coming in anyway before the underwater scene. Let’s see some doubt or indecision prior for example Mr. Mangold.
Ultimately I’m just gonna say it, James Mangold is not all that. I felt like Logan touched upon some of these areas and also failed to fully pull the drama that could be from the canvass in front of him. I never got the universal praise for that movie and I feel the same here. Good ideas, which needed a good director to come in and say, ‘this is the movie, not this, let’s focus on this emotional side more’. If I can spot these opportunities watching a finished cut of the movie once, then a good director should be seeing this at the dailies stages and imagining the finished cut in his head. Dial of Destiny feels like they shot the script page for page and then went home.
Bad Guys
Ah, the bad guys were a bit weak for me, I have to say. Using the Nazi’s again, good idea. Basic plot to rewrite history was decent, whilst also completely unoriginal.
Yet, when you see the bad guys on screen and see the plan on film, it’s a bit crap. There are like three bad guys. Voller and his two Nazi converts one of which seems to be a mute and was just chosen because he’s a big guy and every Indy movie has a big guy. Indy doesn’t even get to off the big guy in a creative way, which totally defeats the purpose of having the big guy in the movie, but okay. Holbrook’s character is just so one dimensional they could have spent less by hiring someone less famous. His character is, ‘I am evil and will kill anyone or anything if my boss tells me’, end of story.
His name in the movie is Klaber, very German. Yet, for all intents and purposes he appeared to be very American heritage and a convert rather than one of Voller’s old Nazi buddies. There are other henchman, but they annoyingly only multiply when needed. Need Indy and co to kill a few people? The crew magically grows by one or two people. Then, it’s back to the core three bad guys, then it randomly ramps up again when required. This is of course despite them trotting all over the globe.
Suggestions
Here’s an idea, have Voller be in charge of a large fourth Reich conspiracy group who hopes to take over America. This would give Voller the resources he needs. Instead, he works with the CIA, until he ditches them when they no longer prove useful. Oh, and they simply don’t appear back in the movie after that. I almost feel like they were cared to go down that route because of current real world implications.
The main bad guy Voller is fine and Mikkelsen does a good job. However, they really should have had Indy make fun of him when he reveals his plot is to kill Hitler and have Indy point out how he’s not thought it through (he’s not). This would have helped if done just before Indy discovers they are not going where Voller thinks they are. Both as a double whammy, boom, bad guy’s whole plan in bits because he rushed into it.
That would have felt completely in toe with an Indy film. Have Indy laugh at him and point out the holes, then immediately go into his part about continental drift. We could see Voller growing more frustrated through the conversation until that moment when he tells the pilot (too late) to turn around.
Conclusion
So far we have a plot that almost makes sense but needs some tweaks, some character arcs which work in theory but are poorly executed and some bad guys which almost work but were poorly executed. I think it’s fair to say I don’t love Dial of Destiny. Instead I am more frustrated that there is an A movie in there under more capable hands. I just don’t see those hands being shaped like James Mangold. It took me less than 24 hours to think of five or six great additions to this script which c be easily pulled off prior to shooting. Imagine what any decent script doctor could do if given the script prior to shooting? Lucasfilm, you have my contact details.
That’s what I see from Dial of Destiny, a script with untapped potential and a finished movie to match. I don’t rate Mangold for his writing or direction in this movie, because to me he got the basics right and nothing more.
No Magic
Dial of Destiny still has some good, namely Harrison Ford’s performance and some decent stunt’s and chases. However, it feels like someone else has taken over (they did) and I’m not sure I like the new guy. This is overall a better movie than KOTCS because you won’t be cringing during this like you were when Mutt was swinging like Tarzan, or Indy was being pulled out quicksand by the most rubber snake ever seen on screen.
You won’t cringe watching Dial of Destiny, but you also won’t feel any of the magic that made you fall in love with Indiana Jones. It’s a more emotionally complete bookend than KOTCS was. However, ultimately I’d watch any of the first three before the final two. Also, I guess Indy does act like an old man in this movie, whereas in KOTCS he acted like he was in his late 40’s. That part actually works and provides some humor.
Dial of Destiny sits 4th on my list now. However, there is still a sizable gap between Temple and Dial of Destiny for me.
GRADE: B-
Where does Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny rank against the rest of the franchise. For me it’s the fourth best out of five and yet still nowhere near the first three. If that sounds good enough for you, then you’ll like this movie. If not, then it may be touch and go. Unlike some other Indy movies Dial of Destiny is not an action blockbuster for all ages. a father and his young son, left the movie after thirty minutes when we saw it, and honestly I might have felt the same as an under 7 year old.
So far the movie has performed poorly at the box office and it does not surprise me. This is not a summer blockbuster but a film more designed for the mature Indy fans of the past. Sadly, it does not quite hit that target audience either for me, but I appreciate the shoutout anyway.

,“Sound Of Freedom” Continues To Top Box Offices; Beats Indiana Jones Over July 4th Weekend,"WAUSAU, WI (WSAU) - According to the most recent predictions from Angel Studios, the movie ""Sound of Freedom,""...","WAUSAU, WI (WSAU) – According to the most recent predictions from Angel Studios, the movie “Sound of Freedom,” featuring actor Jim Caviezel, has officially grossed over $40 million in total ticket sales.
The film premiered on July 4 and swiftly rose to the top of the box office. The true story follows former federal agent Tim Ballard who, after saving a boy who was being trafficked, quits his job to find and rescue the boy’s sister in South America.
“As with our July 4th numbers, today’s numbers exceed our expectations, and we’re going to continue this momentum. SOUND of FREEDOM has taken on a life of its own. We’re getting messages from all over the country telling us about packed theaters, sold-out theaters, and spontaneous standing ovations for the film in numerous locations. Seeing this film has become a must thanks to incredible word-of-mouth,” Brandon Purdie, Head of Theatrical Distribution at Angel Studios, said in Sunday’s press release.
The movie, which is playing in 2,850 theaters, is expected to earn close to $20 million over the week, bringing the overall box office total to $40 million, according to the release.
Similar figures were provided by Box Office Mojo, who estimated that “Sound of Freedom” had made just over $18 million domestically over the weekend and slightly more than $40 million overall.
UFC President Dana White also announced over the weekend that the company would be paying for all of his employees to see the popular film.
The movie “Sound of Freedom” outperformed “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which was seen in roughly 2,000 more theaters and had a whopping $295 million budget. The franchise’s follow-up earned $11 million and came in second over the July 4th weekend.
Sound Of Freedom currently holds a 76% tomato-meter from critics and a 99% audience score on the rating website Rotten Tomatoes further indicating the film’s strong performance.
Currently, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny as well as the newly released horror film Insidious: The Red Door have passed the Sound Of Freedom in ticket sales over this past weekend, but many insiders believe the film’s momentum is showing no signs of slowing down.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3NhdS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8xMC9zb3VuZC1vZi1mcmVlZG9tLWJlY29tZXMtdG9wLWdyb3NzaW5nLXUtcy1tb3ZpZS1iZWF0cy1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Alleged Alternate Ending Details For ‘Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny’ Emerge, Claim Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Character Takes Indy’s Hat

A new rumor provides details about an aborted ending for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny that depicted Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s character taking Indy’s hat and taking over for him.
This new rumor comes courtesy of scooper WDW Pro, but comes in the wake of numerous rumors that Lucasfilm and The Walt Disney Company planned to have Waller-Bridge’s character take over the Indiana Jones franchise.
RELATED: ‘Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny’ Bombs At The Box Office, Only 9% Of Moviegoers Heard It Was Good From Friends And Family
Back in June 2021, YouTuber Overlord DVD shared that a number of sources informed him that “two endings are supposedly being considered in this script. I guess they’ve been written and they are going to shoot both of them. Both endings allegedly have old Indiana Jones dying at the end of this movie.”
“But in one of the rumored endings, young Indiana Jones dies alongside old Indiana Jones and Phoebe Waller-Bridge swoops in like a vulture, picks the hat up, and takes his place moving forward,” he adds.
A separate rumor from The Daily Mail in September 2021 claimed, “Phoebe Waller-Bridge is being tipped to replace the veteran actor as a female version of the fictional professor of archaeology in the adventure movie franchise.”
An anonymous source told The Daily Mail’s Showbusiness Editor Katie Hind about the rumor, “It would be a huge statement, and a great role for Phoebe.”
Another source stated, “The gossip on the set is that this character will slot into the leading role.”

Overlord DVD would follow-up his initial rumor claiming that the film actually had six endings in November, “We’ve been told out of the six endings they tested the best one gets a 35% approval from test audiences.”
“We’ve been told that Bridge put the hat on in every ending,” he added.
Overlord DVD then clarified, “All my spies actually said was Phoebe Waller-Bridge puts on Indy’s hat, takes Indy’s whip, and in a brave and stunning display of girl power she becomes the besest Indy evar at the end of all six version of the movie.”
Now, this new rumor from WDW Pro shares highly specific details about the ending and how Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s character would take Indiana Jones’ hat and seemingly the franchise.

The scooper explained, “Indiana Jones was going to be lying on the grass with Archimedes there … but he was going to convince Phoebe Waller-Bridge to leave him there, and save Teddy and the others, go back through time. They could not take him with them and he would give her his hat, tell her it’s time for her adventures, yadda, yadda, yadda.”
“She, and Teddy, and the other gentlemen that are there then attempt to escape through a very significant action sequence and they go through the time rift,” he continued. “And then you find that she after going back to the original date that she would have learned her lesson in the final scene where she is no longer out to make money off of these artifacts, but instead she is working to get them to museums where they belong.”
“And then there was going to be a second appearance where after that fades out, Indiana Jones is back with Archimedes in the past and it turns out that he had a clever plan an entire time,” he relayed.
“And that was that he tells Archimedes that he will explain the Dial of Destiny to him and tell him all kinds of secrets if only he will write one special message on there,” WDW Pro said. “And he has him do so in a language Indy knows. The message is something to the effect of tell her you love her and tell him he’ll die if he goes to war.”

“And then it was going to go for the very last scene to Indy when he takes the Dial of Destiny from Basil. It goes to where Indy takes the Dial of Destiny away from him when he’s supposed to destroy it and then he sees that message in a language that he understands and he gets kind of wide-eyed and shocked and that was going to be the end of the film,” he shared.
WDW Pro finished, “It left the audience hanging as to whether or not he was successful in saving his marriage and saving Mutt based on the message that was sent.”

This new rumor comes amid Harrison Ford admitting to Spanish-language outlet Espinof that the last thing he shot was the film’s ending with Karen Allen, which led many observers to believe that the ending was indeed reshot.
He said, “We did a little work on the ending, which is the last thing I shot — with Karen Allen, who has been in a substantial part of the whole thing, but appears in this story only briefly, at the end, but with a very strong, emotional hook. I felt nostalgia, a sense of accomplishment. I’m proud of the film, happy with the film.”
“Every good thing, you know, there comes a right time to go on to something else. I really enjoyed the process of making this film. I’m very happy with it. So I left the set that day content,” Ford concluded.

On top of Ford’s comments, the film’s composer John Williams also admitted that he would be returning to the set to shoot a new ending.
Williams said during a concert appearance, “So, we have just about completed the film. We have maybe another ending to shoot and to record. Maybe in a couple weeks.”

This rumor also comes after Karen Allen spoke to Variety about how many days she shot and what her experience was like on the set.
She said, “I think I was [shooting] for two days. But they wanted me to come out early and have plenty of time to play with the costume designer. We had decided to put me in a gray wig that had been built for me, but James and I hadn’t seen it.”
“So I came out about two weeks early,” Allen relayed. “It was nice, because I hung out on the set a bit and got to watch them shooting and got to meet everyone. You know, Phoebe was there, and John Rhys-Davies, and Harrison, and that lovely young man, Ethann [Isidore]. It just gave me a chance to move back into that world a little bit without just jumping onto the set to shoot.”
Of note, is the fact that Allen noted they built a wig for her, but neither she nor the film’s director James Mangold had seen it.
Wigs are a labor and time intensive process to create. Outfitter Wigs, which describes itself as “one of the oldest wig shops in Hollywood,” notes their custom wigs can take 5-10 days to create. However the shop also notes “if there’s a deadline you need to meet, we can expedite the order.”

2023-06-27 14:00:00+00:00,"James Mangold Believes in Indiana Jones, but His Real Hero Is Steven Spielberg","The ""Logan"" director took on Indiana Jones because his real hero is Steven Spielberg.","The walls of James Mangold‘s spacious office on the Fox lot are covered with posters, many of which are for his own films: “Ford v. Ferrari,” “3:10 to Yuma,” “Walk the Line,” “Cop Land,” and “Logan.” It’s a reminder that this week’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is not the first time he’s steered a vintage franchise into port.
“Logan” tracked a similar arc, as an aging Wolverine makes peace with his daughter while facing his own mortality. It gave Mangold confidence that dealing with Indiana Jones’ seniority was not a problem. “In both cases,” he said, slouching on a sofa in his office, “you’re faced with a hero in a twilight of their life having a reckoning with who and what they are.”
There are reasons, many of which are good, why an established filmmaker should avoid a high-profile sequel. Sky-high expectations; inevitable comparisons to master director Steven Spielberg; multiple power players in the kitchen. It took Mangold some time before he agreed to take on the fourth and final Indiana Jones sequel, the first not directed by Steven Spielberg or written by producer George Lucas. In 2019, Mangold received separate (and coordinated) pitches from producers Kathleen Kennedy and Spielberg, and from star Harrison Ford.
“That was very disarming,” he said.
Mangold knew Kennedy and Ford, and had a superficial relationship with Spielberg, whom he admired and felt kinship as a fellow cinephile. “We share a healthy reluctance to adapt to a new, more aggressive style of filmmaking,” said Mangold.

Spielberg was building sets in pre-production, but Mangold read the script and felt he needed more time to bring the project into focus. “There were some good ideas in it,” said Mangold. “But the biggest reason to say ‘no’ was the date. I would be jumping on a moving train.”

So the director requested a delay. The producers came back with six months. “That’s not enough,” he said. “The script doesn’t show me that there’s a reason to make this movie.”

Mangold moved to the pursuit of his Bob Dylan ’60s folk-scene film “A Complete Unknown” starring Timothée Chalamet, until the pandemic shut that down. Then Kennedy made him an offer he couldn’t refuse: a year to figure out “Dial of Destiny.”

He also had a generous studio budget (hefty development charges, plus extra pandemic costs: $295 million. “They met my terms,” said Mangold. “I had to screw my head on to the idea that I was essentially a pinch hitter for Babe Ruth. I had to understand my job was to move the batters, the men on base, and to play the game as well as I could, but not to try to rethink the whole thing. I didn’t feel like I had to play out some sort of rejection of his aesthetic. I’m a profound admirer.”

Mads Mikkelsen, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and Harrison Ford in “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” Lucasfilm Ltd.

Mangold said he wanted to work with this “Mount Rushmore of historically important film figures. I had admired all these cool potential collaborators all my life. And despite warning signs of this kind of a movie being a bear to manage and to launch, and expectations would run in all sorts of directions, and not all of them could ever be met, the thing that was most seductive was the personal opportunity to work with Harrison, Steven, Kathy, George, and John Williams. It was impossible to say ‘no’ to what was essentially the personal opportunity of a lifetime because you don’t ever get close to people unless you do something together.”

Mangold talked to the creative team about facing Ford’s age. “You can’t make this one of those movies where the leading man is pretending he’s 40,” he said. “But it’s also a chance to figure out what the movie is about. Why can’t it be about, in some sense, what it is to be a hero in such different times, as well as in a body that’s getting older, and in a life that has both its triumphs and its regrets?”

Character is the driving force for Mangold’s movies, including Indiana Jones. “From the moment George first conceived of this character, it was built on so many wonderful character contradictions,” he said. “The bookish, nerdish character who was also an adventurer, almost like a Superman/Clark Kent relationship in his life, and he’s such an avid historian and secularist who believes in science, and is yet repeatedly confronted with miracles.”

Mangold and his “Ford v. Ferrari” screenwriters Jez and John-Henry Butterworth spent six to eight months hammering out a new script. “It needed to be entertaining, fast-moving, and have action,” said Mangold. “It needed to be a family film that introduced a wide array of charming and different eccentric characters, all the things that typify an Indiana Jones film.”

But first, they had to confront the “Crystal Skull” problem. “I had to make something that was going to have a dialogue with a contemporary audience,” Mangold said. “I thought the reason ‘Crystal Skull’ had a rougher ride than the previous three movies was a challenge that I was faced with as well.”

“When the first three movies were made, they all took place in the ’30s or ’40s, they all existed in harmony with their setting,” he continued. “You had a movie that was shot in Technicolor noir, high shadow, deep focus, blocking, and style. You have John Williams doing [composer Erich Wolfgang] Korngold. You have Harrison Ford in his fedora, channeling ‘The Treasure of the Sierra Madre’ and 19 other things all at once. You have George and Steven who are in love with Golden Age filmmaking and you have this tremendous unity of style.”

“Crystal Skull” disrupted all that when it jumped to the mid-’50s, Mangold said. “It was not just that Harrison’s older, but that the movie had now entered a period of modernism. The world was no longer a world of black-and-white villains. The adversaries were going to be inevitably more shaded with gray as we had entered a period of realpolitik and changing values. This made it more challenging if you look like some guy with a bow tie walking around. You have to make a movie about the idea of the character being a little out of time.”

The writers decided to run with the idea of starting the movie in 1944, at the height of Indiana Jones’ powers. “I thought there would be a way to carry the audience through Harrison’s present-day age by greeting them first with an energetic homage to the previous films,” said Mangold. “You confront the audience with a young Indy in full flower and full action, and then make a sharp turn. Take everything away and let the audience confront the difference between now and then in a brazen way. That was the cut I was most excited about for the movie.”

The 1944 Indy had to be digitally de-aged by VFX. Mangold had more to work with than most: There’s plenty of footage of Ford as Indy at different ages and the actor stayed exactly the same size today as he was at age 38. (They had to make do with Ford’s 79-year-old voice.) “Because this is a wrap that goes around the actor, it means that there’s no distortion,” said Mangold, “because their shape hasn’t changed.”

Williams was a huge help to Mangold as he sought the right tone. “[I told Williams], ‘John, in the first reel you’re just letting the horses out of the barn, you do what you do, and let it rip. And then on this cut to 1969, we suddenly shift gears. And I’m not sure when we hear BUM BA BUM BUM again. You’re then doing the score to a ’70s movie.'” (Williams said, “I can do that.”)

“The flow of the movie was falling off this cliff into Indy’s current reality,” said Mangold. “And then as he begins to gather himself, steel himself, and heads onto the road. By the time he and Phoebe [Waller-Bridge] are in full mode racing around Morocco with Mads Mikkelsen, the music found itself back and by the time they get out at sea, in Greece, it’s full-on an Indiana Jones movie with an old Indy.”

Writing Indy’s British goddaughter, con-artist Helen Shaw, was another challenge. The character was inspired by another “comedic yet diabolical” con artist, Barbara Stanwyck in “The Lady Eve,” and Mangold eventually convinced the “Fleabag” auteur to play the role that was tailored for her.

“There was no one else I could possibly imagine who would be more fresh, bring more of a bag of challenges to Harrison as an actor,” he said. “There are actors who are really good on skis, cutting this way and that and yet holding you to the core of their character. You sense about her immediately that there’s so much intelligence and capability in this woman that she could cut the skis.”

Spielberg checked in every week or two with notes on pages and dailies, which Mangold described as “extremely liberating and instructive.”

Said Mangold, “Every shot has a purpose in Steven’s work. A methodology has evolved to just shoot the shit out of it from every direction and figure it out later [and] that basic difference is a big deal in terms of how the process works. Single-camera filmmakers who are building sequences out of shots with a purpose has gotten quite rare. It’s all built on a powerful connection to the movies he grew up with. You see the roots in classical Hollywood filmmaking and you see this effort to keep that dialogue and that vernacular alive. That’s something I’m connected to.”

Next up: Mangold is back in prep for “A Complete Unknown.” Chalamet and the cast are in the studio recording and readying for a fall shoot, assuming the unions have settled by then.

Being part of the Lucasfilm family has yielded a possible “Star Wars” prequel, which Mangold was in the process of mapping out when the WGA strike hit. The movie is set 25,000 years before the other films, at the moment when The Force is discovered. “I pitched to Kathy a religious epic, a Ten Commandments of where this came from, and how it was found, and those who discovered it and how they reacted to it. And the miracle of it,” he said.

Another script, still to be written, is an adaptation of the DC Comic “Swamp Thing,” which Mangold pitched to James Gunn and Peter Safran. “It’s a Gothic horror film about this character,” he said. “It’s a great comic book, but it is also a really interesting character predicament in which this creature is trying to figure out what happened to him. And who did this. It’s kind of a vengeful Frankenstein story. This person had been set up, and somehow poisoned, and turned into this thing in which he had lost all that he had loved, including his own humanity. I find it a resonant, modern theme.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvaW50ZXJ2aWV3cy9qYW1lcy1tYW5nb2xkLWludGVydmlldy1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LTEyMzQ4Nzg2MTQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

One of the most hotly debated head-to-head box office match-ups of the year is just four weeks away. While much could change over the next month, here’s how Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer are shaping up in preliminary tracking.

Barbie

Warner Bros. Pictures

July 21, 2023 (WIDE)

Opening Weekend Range: $55M-$85M

Domestic Total Range: $120M-$226M

PROS:

Barbie has been a remarkable performer across the social media spectrum thanks to a vocal fan base and meme-driven activity across TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and other platforms.

As a generational brand, Barbie has strong appeal to women of various ages and should benefit from the voice of director and co-writer Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women) and the presence of A-Listers Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the leads.

Outside of The Little Mermaid, very few of this summer’s tentpole films are catering so directly to women, leaving Barbie positioned for a strong performance courting an under-served audience. Early sales reflect this with, with Barbie’s day-one pre-sales coming in 46 percent higher than Mermaid‘s comparable period.

CONS:

It’s challenging at this stage to determine to what extent online and fandom buzz will translate to real world interest. That’s especially true given the film’s seemingly more mature focus; its satirical comedy bent could put a ceiling on family turnout relative to the broader multi-generational appeal of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.

Premium screen footprints will be very low for Barbie, with other films dominating that space throughout July. That not only lowers Barbie‘s potential average ticket prices, but—as audiences increasingly favor a premium viewing experience—could have a negative impact on attendance.

While early pre-sales are strong for previews on Wednesday and Thursday, it remains to be seen whether or not the film will be able to gain traction outside the die-hard fan base in the weeks ahead.

Oppenheimer

Universal Pictures

July 21, 2023 (WIDE)

Opening Weekend Range: $40M-$55M

Domestic Total Range: $137M-$187M

PROS:

Director Christopher Nolan himself is a reliable box office draw, as shown in the post-Dark Knight era of his career with the success of Dunkirk, Interstellar, and Inception.

Counter-programming potential is strong, with Oppenheimer being one of the few thrillers aimed squarely at adults to receiving a massive marketing push in this day and age.

There’s minimal direct competition moving into the late summer, with most of the wide releases coming to theaters in Oppenheimer‘s first few holdover frames being family-friendly movies.

Pre-sales are popping at this stage, with initial models pointing to preview results ahead of last summer’s Nope and Nolan’s own Dunkirk. General moviegoer interest prompted by strong word of mouth from preview audiences could create long-term backloading weeks into the film’s theatrical run—particularly as many seek out IMAX and other PLFs for this particular film.

CONS:

Oppenheimer‘s three-hour runtime puts even more emphasis on word of mouth—especially given the fact that, while containing a spectacle component, it looks to be Nolan’s most strictly narrative-driven film since The Prestige in 2006.

Men over the age of 25 will be the primary crowd here, and that’s a source of crossover competition with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, opening one week earlier.

Nolan’s Tenet, released under abnormal pandemic-era circumstances, was one of the more divisive films of his career, earning a 76 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.

,"Blockbusters are failing spectacularly, but how that changes Hollywood is anyone's guess","The Flash, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Shazam! Fury of the Gods were all big-budget offerings at the cinema this year. The fact that they failed could be a sign that audiences are fed up with remakes and superhero movies, but that doesn't mean studios will stop making them.","When describing this year's box office offerings, ""excitement,"" ""anticipation"" or ""interest"" would probably be the wrong words to use. Instead, think ""schadenfreude.""

Most recently, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny — reportedly, the most expensive movie of the franchise — utterly failed to excite audiences with the once-reliable promise of further adventures of a beloved character. Instead, the $300 million US film did so poorly it's unlikely to earn its studio even half the money it spent making it.

Elsewhere, Dreamworks saw its worst opening weekend of all time with Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken — as the lack of a media campaign tanked any interest generated by its fairly positive critical reviews.

And The Flash bombed so spectacularly it gained the unfortunate title of biggest comic-book movie flop of all time .

WATCH | Summer blockbusters are supposed to be back, but so far it's a season of flops: Summer blockbusters are supposed to be back, but so far it's a season of flops Duration 2:06 Featured Video This year is supposed mark the post-COVID return of the summer blockbuster at the movies, but many big titles with inflated budgets have underperformed. Experts speculate this could change what Hollywood produces in the future.

""Just the amount of consecutive disappointments that are coming out from these major movies with these very inflated budgets,"" said Nicholas Janzen, a film commentator and content creator in Toronto. ""I think that's what's making it so jarring.""

It's a string of flops continuing off of last year's, including everything from Shazam! Fury of the Gods to Dungeons and Dragons and — to a degree — Pixar's Elemental, which saw the studio's second-worst opening weekend of all time. These busts come at the same time as two concurrent strikes. Writers walked off the job in May, followed by actors this week. Both groups say streaming and growing risks from AI threaten their livelihoods.

That's not to say that the film industry itself is tanking — far from it. As of this week, Cineplex reported its earnings have nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels, with box office revenues reaching 98 per cent of 2019 numbers. Meanwhile, upcoming heavyweights Barbie and Oppenheimer have already lit a fire under fans: in an email to CBC News, the theatre chain reported over 130,000 presale tickets sold, earning both films over $1 million already.

And other movies have found, sometimes surprising, success: Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One set a franchise record for its preview screenings, Asteroid City beat Grand Budapest Hotel as Wes Anderson's highest -grossing weekend , and the independently distributed Sound of Freedom astounded by crossing the $50-million mark earlier this week, more than tripling its budget .

When it comes to what succeeds and fails, the movie industry has never been more unpredictable, Janzen noted in a video he made after noticing the trend.

""My video was kind of just like, 'What's going on here?'"" he said. ""It's these movies that seemed like surefire hits kind of tripped out of the gate.""

Bloated summer schedules

The reason behind Hollywood's strategy for success coming undone could partially lie in bloated expectations. The concept of blockbusters originated in the 1940s, with the term originally used by newspaper reporters to describe ""the new, large, 4,000-pound bombs dropped by Allied forces on enemy cities,"" wrote Canadian pop culture researcher Charles R. Acland.

In the Hollywood context, the jargon became a marketing device used to turn the once-dismal summer months into a draw for audiences and make a film seem worth seeing — regardless of how good it was.

The idea of marketing movies as big-budget events grew in the 1950s, during what University of Bologna associate professor Marco Cucco called Hollywood's ""worst crisis."" In the post-war years, a baby boom, reluctance to spend money on luxuries such as movie tickets and the invention of a new, easier way to watch media — television — kept audiences out of theatres.

Investing in big, expensive productions separated studio films from TV, and a relatively large number of epic-historical dramas capitalized on that.

""Everything revolves around the idea that a big production gives a better performance at the box office,"" Cucco wrote.

Duration 1:39 Featured Video Martin Katz, a Canadian producer and frequent collaborator of director David Cronenberg, spoke with CBC News to shed light on how the SAG-AFTRA strike will impact your favourite TV shows in Canada and abroad.

But after Spielberg's 1975 film Jaws and George Lucas's Star Wars in 1977 proved how successful adventure and science fiction could be, blockbusters began to slowly transform into releases based around spectacle.

That, film critic Rachel Ho explained, eventually led us to where we are today — with studios relying almost solely on franchises such as Fast and Furious, Mission Impossible and the, until recently, indomitable Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The recent string of failures, however, seems to suggest audiences aren't willing to subsidize that strategy anymore. Disney CEO Bob Iger recently blamed the high output of shows saturating its streaming service for poor box office numbers .

Meanwhile, the expectation that the studio releases a billion-dollar movie once a year — something it has accomplished since 2014, except during the COVID-19 pandemic — means otherwise moderately successful releases such as The Little Mermaid are seen as failures.

""It will be the first year that they don't have a billion-dollar movie at the box office, most likely. That's what the projections are saying,"" Ho said of Disney's performance in 2023. ""And it's kind of astounding to think that a billion dollars has become,'Is it a success or is it a flop?'""

Silver lining of the flop

Historically though, flops have had one obvious silver lining: revealing to studios what audiences don't want. Take the infamous Heaven's Gate. The 1980 $40-million US epic (roughly $150 million adjusted for inflation) by Deer Hunter director Michael Cimino performed so apocalyptically poorly it effectively ended the era of big-budget art films.

More recently, 2012's John Carter — re-titled from the original John Carter of Mars in hopes to sever any implied connection to 2011's box-office bomb Mars Needs Moms — failed so breathtakingly that Disney turned full-face toward the then-sure bets of existing intellectual property, pop culture journalist Richard Newby has argued.

At the same time, the studio also turned away from traditional — yet expensive — 2D animation after the abysmally poor showings of movies such as Treasure Planet and Home on the Range.

Predictions about the current slate of failures and their effect on the fate of the industry have been around for years. Almost exactly 10 years ago , both Steven Spielberg and George Lucas predicted the ""implosion"" of the film industry, ""whereby,"" in Spielberg's words, ""a half dozen or so $250 million US movies flop at the box office and alter the industry forever.""

And back in 2015, New Yorker journalist James Surowiecki predicted Hollywood's clustering of blockbusters in the summer months would lead to what we have now — too many big-budget offerings for theatre-goers to support or care about, leading to a gradual sinking of the industry.

But like with the advent of TV in the 1950s, the growing supremacy of streamers is making the modern-day situation more difficult to navigate.

While traditional studios evolved without the ability to hide box-office revenues and audience numbers, streamers can decide how, and whether, to reveal a movie or show's poor performance, says Aaron Michael, a St. John's film expert who researches and documents box office flops ,

When studios can say that a movie succeeded on a streaming platform without an independent way to verify the claim, it makes it impossible to identify the true failures.

""'Big flop' as a term, or 'bomb,' doesn't mean anything,"" Michael said. ""They keep those numbers to themselves, and there's no clear metric like a ticket sale.

""If a studio has a choice, they're not going to set up a second paradigm where they have to constantly announce that these plans backfire or these embarrassing flops.""

Streaming vs. box office

Treating streaming shows and movies differently than those on traditional screens has other benefits. As the New Yorker recently reported, it has allowed Netflix to pay the stars of Orange is the New Black virtually nothing in residuals , the payments that normally flow to actors after a work first airs as it continues to be distributed.

Residual payments, which are calculated differently in streaming than broadcast and amount to much less, are a key point of contention in the current actors and writers strike.

""The entire business model has been changed by streaming, digital, AI,"" SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said when announcing the actors' strike on Thursday. ""If we don't stand tall right now, we are all going to be in trouble, we are all going to be in jeopardy of being replaced by machines.""

Andor showrunner Tony Gilroy told IndieWire this week that the fact that actors can no longer rely on residual payments means those costs are often front-loaded onto productions, distorting the usual financing models and coming close to ""ruining this amazing industry.""

""The obscurity of data doesn't help anyone,"" he told IndieWire. ""I think it looks like low-hanging fruit and easy profitability for certain corporations, but in the end, it just crushes any kind of free market. It crushes the economics of the business. It means people are being overpaid and underpaid and never properly paid.""

The highly-anticipated film, which is set to be the swansong for Harrison Ford as he put an end to a more than 40-year run as Dr. Henry Jones Jr., began premiering in theaters on Thursday. The fifth installment of the franchise follows Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008).

Though there won’t be any Shia LaBeouf (Mutt Williams) this time, there is a cast of talented entertainers who will join Harrison Ford on the big screen. These include Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Helena Shaw, the goddaughter of Indy), and Mads Mikkelsen (Jurgen Voller, the main antagonist). While there’s plenty of anticipation surrounding the film, it has also been met with backlash from many fans who have seen the trailers and critics alike.

Many fans on social media have vowed not to watch the movie due to scenes released in which they accuse Disney and Lucasfilm of “turning the franchise woke.” In addition, the critical consensus for the movie could have been better. Rotten Tomatoes gives the movie a 66% approval rating, which is below the rating given for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.

In recent updates shared on social media, many users have posted empty theaters for the premiere of the movie.

Currently, the box office projections for the opening weekend are set at around $65 million in the U.S. While this would be a nice number, the film boasts a massive budget of more than $295 million, which means it will take quite a number to offset its costs. This, of course, does not include marketing costs, and much more.

Ultimately, while the verdict is still out on how the film will perform, it will be interesting to see what the movie is able to do at the box office and how much the final installment with Harrison Ford makes when it’s all said and done. For now, the jury is still out.

During the Los Angeles premiere for Indiana Jones & The Dial of Destiny, Mikkelsen explained that it’s all about the timing.

“Of course, we’re running out of time. We can’t wait 20 years, but in the next couple of years, if somebody finds a home, I think we are all ready to take it up again,” he said.

Audiences are well aware by now that Mikkelsen excels at playing the bad guy on screen. He wouldn’t give much away about his character in the new Indiana Jones flick, other than to say “he’s after a certain item, that unfortunately Harrison Ford is after as well. So, we will clash eventually.”

In the film, he plays former Nazi turned scientist and mathematician Jürgen Voller. As for where he is on the adversary scale against Indy, Mikkelsen says Voller is “a badass,” but he doesn’t think his character would consider himself to be “a baddie.”

“Nobody starts out in the morning saying, ‘I’m going to be the baddie.’ They see themselves as good people in their own world,” he said.

Well, it looks like director James Mangold thinks Voller is pretty bad, and Mikkelsen was the perfect person for the role. While introducing the film, Mangold told the audience on Wednesday night that Mikkelsen’s skills as a villain are apparent on screen.

“They always ask him why he likes playing bad guys but I think you’ll see the answer on the screen — because he is damn good at it,” he said.

Another Rumor Claims Kathleen Kennedy “Is Now Gone From Lucasfilm”

Another rumor is making the rounds that Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy “is now gone from Lucasfilm.”

This latest rumor comes from Twitter scooper ThwipT_ who writes, “I’m hearing Kathleen Kennedy is now gone from Lucasfilm.’

RELATED: ‘Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny’ Thursday Box Office Haul Worse Than ‘The Flash,’ ‘Fast X,’ And ‘Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts’

The scooper has been right on a number of previous scoops including Nicolas Cage appearing as Superman in The Flash film, that a Harry Potter TV series was in development at HBO Max, Andy Serkis would appear in Andor, and more.

Following this rumor, That Park Place investigative journalist Jonas J. Campbell relayed on the WDW Pro that sources informed him that “the word from Burbank is that it was very late night there. And that there are factions forming underneath Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, the head of Disney Studios, to say that there are two factions forming that are fighting over this exact issue whether it is marketing or the quality of the film.”

WDW Pro then posited, “It is our understanding based on this source and other sources that we have that Alan Bergman’s camp, they are no fan of Lucasfilm as it is currently constituted. The Bergman camp is not a fan of Kathleen Kennedy and is pushing potentially for Kathleen Kennedy to leave and leave soon.”

He continued, “We believe that Dana Walden is potentially in favor of Kennedy staying and in favor of this marketing be damned kind of approach where they say, ‘It was the commercials. It was the trailers. They did not do a good enough job explaining what this film was.'”

At the end of the video, WDW Pro did hedge, “We are waiting to see what happens. We do not have concrete evidence that Kathleen Kennedy is gone. But there is smoke. There is growing billows of smoke. And don’t be surprised, folks, if in a month, two months things are beginning to happen at a rapid pace. This cannot continue.”

RELATED: New Rumor Claims To Reveal Key Details About A Severance Deal For Kathleen Kennedy To Leave Lucasfilm And Star Wars

These scoops or rumors come on the heels of YouTuber John Campea who claimed in November 2022 that a source informed him that Kennedy would be removed following the release of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.

Campea said, “This is what I have heard: I have heard that the decision to remove Kathy Kennedy has already been made and that she will be gone either sometime before or very, very, very shortly thereafter the release of Indiana Jones 5…”

He added, “Now, I want to be very, very clear here: I cannot independently say to you and confirm that this is a fact. I will say that one of the two people that have contacted me has a 1000% average on the things they’ve informed me of.”

WDW Pro at That Park Place had previously claimed in July 2022 that Kennedy would exit the company in late 2023 after the release of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.

He wrote, “What I had been hearing for years is that Kathleen Kennedy wants to finish Indiana Jones 5 and she wants to continue having Star Wars influence.”

He later noted, “I think that Kathleen Kennedy may finally sunset her obligations at that point. It will likely be late 2023, and of course plenty can change between now and then.”

Making Star Wars’ Jason Ward also claimed Kennedy would exit the company following the fifth Indiana Jones film. A recap of Ward’s paywalled podcast was shared to Reddit by user Sidon_Ithano and it read in part, “Jason heard that Kathleen Kennedy will step down as LucasFilm president after Indiana Jones 5 but will still produce movies. Kevin Feige will run LucasFilm but will have separate divisions run by other people.”

What do you make of these new rumors that Kathleen Kennedy is gone from Lucasfilm and that Disney executives are splitting into factions to lay a blame game over the box office results for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny?

2023-07-06 18:22:52+00:00,"Disney Almost Went Too Far, 'Indiana Jones 5' Fixed ""Problematic"" Scene - Inside the Magic",Indiana Jones almost created a troubling scene that almost sparked a huge problem for disney that required one actress to beg for a revision.,"James Mangold nearly caused an uproar from fans over one scene that required one actress to beg for a revision in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023).

Harrison Ford’s Indiana Jones always ends up facing the same enemy. Nazis. While Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Crystal Skull (2008) pitted the legendary archaeologist against the Soviets, all the other movies involved some form of Nazis. Sadly, each adventure ends in misfortune for the enemy, but one scene almost went too far.

Now that the archaeologist is almost 80, Indiana Jones isn’t a spry young man. He’s old, and his age definitely shows. Some have claimed the movie is too depressing seeing an older Indy, but the adventure with his god-daughter Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) pits him against Mads Mikkelsen’s Jurgen Voller, a Nazi scientist who worked in NASA. After helping America win the Space Race, Voller goes all in on finding a lost artifact he once held in World War II.

Sadly, the movie isn’t bringing back the magic for every fan. The box office numbers have been troublesome, with Disney potentially not making enough and creating another failure in the process. The movie isn’t perfect either, but it could have been a lot worse, according to Variety, if Shaunette Renée Wilson didn’t demand a revision for one scene she felt was too problematic:

“Well, I don’t want to spoil too much, but my character had a particular way of exiting the film and initially I found it to be a little bit problematic and offensive. I was like we probably don’t need to say these words or have it done this way, and this something I am uncomfortable with.”

This led to Mangold revising the script to make her final scene different, and the film still doesn’t do enough. Without spoiling the scene, it’s clear that Wilson’s character is a vocal black woman in the script, and she is dealing with Nazis working for the American government. Most likely, the original script included more racist comments about the Aryan race, or had Wilson made another comment about how racist Nazis could be. These moments aren’t necessary, and funny enough, Wilson’s character still throws a racial slur earlier in the movie.

This scene didn’t ruin Indy 5, but it could’ve been avoided, as the movie’s first act could’ve followed a different set of events to place Indiana Jones on his final adventure. Sadly, this is it for the iconic hero, and fans might one day enjoy Indy’s final ride, but most will wish the character’s legend was left alone.

The collection was born out of the minds of Melissa Morris, co-founder and creative director of Métier, and Academy Award-nominated English costume designer Joanna Johnston, who worked as an assistant designer on the 1984 Indiana Jones sequel Temple of Doom and was hired by director Steven Spielberg to design the wardrobe for 1989’s Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.

“I found Melissa on social media and just by chance, she made a reference to Indiana Jones, and I was just starting [my work on the movie],” Johnston says of their coming together. “I was looking at her product, and I thought it looked great. It was as simple and as straightforward as that. But I’m a great believer in everything happens for a reason.”

Initially, Johnston sought out Morris to create a bag in the film for Phoebe Waller-Bridge‘s character Helena Shaw. Using Métier’s Vagabond Duffle as inspiration, they began sewing swatches of fabric Johnston sourced from various countries to the inside of the bag to create hidden pockets for concealing various items. The bag then went through a detailed aging process to show “It’s had a life,” Johnston explains. The overall design, Morris adds, reflects the fact that Helena is “a mover and a shaker and a bit of a gypsy.”

Johnston then brought a messenger bag that she’d procured for Shaw to Morris with a new idea. “She said, ‘How about instead of taking one of your pieces and creating it into Indy like we’ve done with the Vagabond, why don’t we take this piece and recreate it back?’” Morris recalls. “So, then we had a new challenge where we sort of took this very vintage, very rough hunting bag and had to reinterpret that for a Métier bag and something that’s very usable for the modern-day man and woman.”

To do that, Morris and her team of artisans in Italy swapped out the spaces in the interior that were made to hold gun cartridges, for example, and replaced them with pockets that could secure a laptop and a passport. After seeing the final transformation, Johnston sent Morris two large boxes of materials that she’d used to make all of the clothes on set.

“Inside were all of these fabrics with manila tags and words written on them with a Sharpie like Indy suit jacket, trousers, leather jacket, all of it. it was so cool,” says Morris.

Using a similar patchworking process as was used to make the first two bags, the artisans then began crafting new pieces using actual materials from the movie set. “We created 10 unique combinations. They’re all one-of-a-kind patchworks,” explains Morris.

The resulting creations now make up two Indiana Jones | Métier collections ($195-$5,650). The Collector’s Edition set, which includes the Vagabond Duffle, Vagabond Messenger and Runaway bags, is designed with Marrakech suede and features rust trimming. Each piece made from its own distinct combination of materials also comes with a unique serial number and packaging, which details the exact fabrics from the movie that were used in its making.

The main Indiana Jones | Métier collection, meanwhile, features a Hunter Messenger inspired by the bag Waller-Bridge wears in the movie, as well as a Vagabond Duffle, Vagabond Messenger and Runaway bags made with chocolate suede. There’s also a basket bag made of salt netting that comes with either rust or cacao leather trim and an assortment of leather goods such as a luggage tag, notebook cover and travel wallet, which have a distinct feature of their own.

“Joanna had the idea of taking the silhouette of Indiana Jones from the Raiders of the Lost Ark and printing them on some of the small leather goods so it’s like an imprint,” explains Morris, who adds that the collection is a true collaboration in every sense of the word.

“It’s not about just taking something obvious and smacking it on a bag. It was really about a meeting of two minds. Joanna’s expertise is depth of character and backstory and detail and the heart and soul of the person. Mine is creating pieces that are usable and solve problems for the way we move through our lives today. Being able to fuse that together and create something that has all of these little hidden bits on the inside to signal all these special touches of the depth of character that Joanna has championed and created in her looks, that’s where the real magic was,” says Morris.

While fashion collections, such as this, have become commonplace in the film industry, it’s rare for costume designers to have a hand in their formation or promotion, Johnston says.

“I wish that, to be honest, the post-production situation and the stories having to do with the influences of clothing on the film was more harmonious,” Johnston admits. “Somehow, it all just sort of chops, and once you finish filming, you’re kind of parked apart from publicity.”

Having the opportunity to co-create this collection is much more the exception than the rule, Johnston adds. “Métier and Lucasfilm were very kind actually. I was involved with some discussions about marketing, and I asked about the possibility that we could do a sort of leather goods thing with Métier and that they could have the license, and they very kindly agreed.”

Morris, on the other hand, says she can’t imagine creating the collection without Johnston. “I’m so proud of what we’ve put together. It was a real challenge, and it was really scary when she first approached me because you want to pay huge respect to the history and the legacy of this franchise. And then also be able to figure out how to merge the two worlds — creating something that’s right for what I do and also what’s right for the film in a way that doesn’t feel like merch but feels like an authentic design,” she says. “It would have been impossible without Joanna’s thorough involvement. We were hands-on together in every single session. I can’t imagine how you could ever do such a collaboration without working so closely with her or any other designer.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc3R5bGUvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1tZXRpZXItbGVhdGhlci1iYWctY29sbGVjdGlvbi0xMjM1NTE4NDY2L9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc3R5bGUvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1tZXRpZXItbGVhdGhlci1iYWctY29sbGVjdGlvbi0xMjM1NTE4NDY2L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Early Domestic Box Office Prediction Claims ‘Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny’ Will Outperform ‘Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania’

An early box office prediction for Lucasfilm’s upcoming Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny movie claims it will outperform Ant-man and the Wasp: Quantumania.

According to The-Numbers, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is currently the fourth highest grossing film of 2023 at the domestic box office with a gross of $214.4 million and 20.5 million tickets sold.

The film currently sits behind current top grossing film The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which has grossed $562.3 million domestically and sold 53.8 million tickets. It’s also behind Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, which is still in theaters but has already raked in $310.8 million and sold 29.7 million tickets. Finally, Avatar: The Way of Water has grossed $258.5 million and sold 24.7 million tickets.

Looking at the Indiana Jones franchise, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had an opening weekend of $100.1 million in 2008 and went on to earn $317.1 million in its domestic run. It had a worldwide gross of $786.6 million.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade had an opening weekend of $37 million and went on to gross $197.1 million domestically. It grossed $474.1 million globally back in 1989.

Temple of Doom had an opening weekend of $25.3 million and went on to earn $179.8 million domestically. It grossed $333 million globally in 1984.

And Raiders of the Lost Ark had an opening weekend of $8.3 million, but surged to a $225.6 million domestically. It grossed a worldwide total of $367.4 million globally in 1981.

Box Office Pro is predicting that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny will top Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania at the domestic box office predicting the film will on the low end bring in $225 million. On the high end they predict the film could earn up to $380 million and surpass Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.

Interestingly, they don’t expect the film to have long legs as they predict the film make a significant portion of its entire gross in its opening weekend predicting it will earn anywhere between $81 million and $111 million.

On the low end if it makes $81 million in its opening weekend and goes on to earn $225 million, the opening weekend gross amounts to 36% of the entire domestic gross. On the high end if it makes $111 million in its opening weekend and goes on to earn $380 million, the opening weekend gross is just shy of 30% of its predicted domestic gross.

As for their reasoning on why they believe the film could become the second highest grossing film of North America behind The Super Mario Bros. Movie, the outlet details, “The prospect of a new chapter in the Indiana Jones saga has ignited fan excitement in the years since Lucasfilm announced they’d pursue the film.”

They specifically believe that Harrison Ford returning to the character and James Mangold as the director will bring people to theaters. They also believe “a wave of nostalgia” that the film promises could drive adult audiences to theaters. The outlet goes on to claim that if families are brought to see the film it could have longer legs.

Box Office Pro also claims that “early pre-sales are respectable when given proper context, i.e. the glut of male- and fan-driven films opening before Dial of Destiny hits theaters in June.”

However, the outlet also notes that there are some factors going against the film specifically the most recent Indiana Jones film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull divided fans of the franchise.

They also point to poor critical reaction coming out of Cannes Film Festival and note “the film currently stands at 49% approval on Rotten Tomatoes.” Finally, they point out the film faces stiff competition from Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning: Part One, Barbie, Oppenheimer, and others.

It’s hard to imagine the film will even hit these lower marks given alleged leaks for the film claim that Indiana Jones’ heroism is supplanted by Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s character.

Not only do leaks indicate that Jones’ character will be undermined by Waller-Bridge’s, but in interviews Ford and Mangold have made it clear that they are not providing audiences with the Indiana Jones they know and love.

In February, Mangold told The Hollywood Reporter, “We can’t hide from where we are in our lives — none of us can — and neither can Indiana Jones.”

He elaborated, “I wanted to follow Harrison’s own lead and simply deal with it straight on. It’s not just a movie about a hero in his twilight years who is called back into action.”

“It’s more than just that his bones might ache, it’s that his soul might ache, or that some of his optimism or sense fitting into the world might have evaporated,” he detailed.

He then justified the decision saying, “The mistake you can make in movies — and we’ve all seen movies like this — is where someone is of a ripe age, but the entire movie is continuing this charade along with them that they’re not that old.”

Mangold went on to reveal his film is eschewing the tried and true action adventure formula of the first three films, “The first three Indiana Jones movies took place in roughly the same period. They all easily fit with the serialized, theatrical, almost screwball-action style of the movies that were being released in the period they’re set in.”

Mangold then posited, “The challenge for [director Steven Spielberg] on [Crystal Skull], and for me on this one, is: How do you move forward into new decades where the world is no longer seen in such clear demarcations of black and white and good and evil? Where the whole concept of raiding tombs and fighting over relics is looked at in a different way?”

“It’s not about changing the story but allowing the character to experience how the world has changed around him,” Mangold explained.

RELATED: New Rumor Claims To Reveal Why Indiana Jones Will Be Depressed In ‘Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny’

He also made it clear that film does not clearly delineate who the villains and the good guys are, ”

And our perception of politics is more gray. Who’s a villain? Who are we working with? Who are we fighting against? Proxy wars, all of that. It’s not as simple as the era around World War II.”

“What happens to a hero built for a black-and-white world, when he finds himself in one that is gray? It’s a problem that produces humor, produces contradictions, produces adjustments that this character’s going have to make,” Mangold claims.

While discussing Ford being de-aged, Mangold relayed, “It reminds the audience of the contrast between a hero in his physical prime and a hero at 70.”

“We’re not relying solely on the audience’s memory of the previous films. It reminds everyone what he’s done, what he’s survived, what he’s accomplished,” he said. “By showing him in his most hearty and then finding him at 70 in New York City, it produces for the audience a kind of wonderful whiplash of how they’re going to have to readjust and retool their brains for this guy.”

“His past is a live memory for the audience, hanging over a man who is now living with anonymity in a world that no longer cares or recognizes the things he felt so deeply about,” Mangold declared. “You’re left with a multilayered perception of his character, both what he was and what he is, and how the world is different between the first 20 minutes of the movie.”

RELATED: Harrison Ford Admits Indiana Jones Is “Not So Strong, Not So Brave, Not So Attentive” In ‘Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny’

Ford echoed much of Mangold’s points in an interview with Fandango telling the outlet about who Indiana Jones is in this film, “I think he has been teaching for however many years. He’s a bit dispirited with teaching. His students are not keen with archaeology necessary. And they’re kind of loafing through his classes and I suppose he is as well. And he’s now forced to retire by I suppose the rules at Hunter College and they are bringing somebody else in to be the head of the Archaeology Department, and he has no real future in mind for himself.”

He went on to describe Indiana Jones, “There’s great joy in playing the character. I’m familiar with the character. I’ve enjoyed playing the character. I’ve had great writing to support the character’s behavior and the sense of who he is.”

“But now we are taking him into the twilight of his life and his career,” Ford continued. “We’re seeing him not so strong, not so brave, not so attentive, but about to go on a grand adventure with a very fascinating set of compatriots and adversaries.”

What do you make of this early box office prediction? How much money do you think Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny will gross in its opening weekend and its entire theatrical run?

""It’s the humanity of this character,"" Wilson said. ""We all kind of see ourselves in him, in some respect, whether it’s the naughty side, the antihero, the curmudgeon, the humour, the sexy guy – whatever it is. To kind of track his journey in this world, I think is just really special.""

Holbrook added: ""He’s the pinnacle of masculinity, and a type of hero. You said it really well: he’s not perfect. He lies. He steals and cheats to get his way. He’s kind of a bit of a pirate, in a way. He’s a renegade.""

Mangold, meanwhile, went on to praise those who have been involved in the series over the decades, saying: ""The films have represented the combined talents of some of the best actors and filmmakers who have made movies ever. So there’s just that.

""But then there’s something very specific, which is just that unlike many of the tentpole or summer movies, these are charming films. They’re brawny, and have action and athleticism and cinematic choices. They’re in love with movies but they are, first and foremost, charming.""

He also noted that the characters are ""eccentric and interesting, and not just kind of a god in an outfit slaying villains. But much more a man with all his foibles and eccentricities and passions and obsessions that make him unusual.""

""It’s about a guy who’s just like you or me, and is somehow put into extraordinary circumstances.""

Marcus Theatres surveyed more than 1,200 of its Magical Movie Rewards members in 17 states to find out what summer movies made their must-see list.

While Indiana Jones grabbed the top spot, participants also selected family films, action adventures, and a new biopic as what they’re most looking forward to seeing this summer:

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (June 30) Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (July 12) Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (in cinemas now) Oppenheimer (July 21) The Flash (in cinemas now) The Little Mermaid (in cinemas now) Fast X (in cinemas now) Barbie (July 21) Haunted Mansion (July 28) Blue Beetle (August 18)

Though male and female respondents agreed on putting Indiana Jones at #1, they differed on what else they were most looking forward to seeing.

Disney’s The Little Mermaid took the #2 spot with women, who rounded out their top five with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, and Oppenheimer.

In comparison, men preferred Ethan Hunt to Ariel and prioritized seeing Oppenheimer and The Flash as their third and fourth, before ranking Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse fifth.

Survey respondents were from Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Ohio, and Wisconsin.

Ninety-nine percent of surveyed moviegoers plan to head to the cinema between May 19 and September 4. Only 11% of those surveyed see movies on opening weekend, but they split on whether to see the film during the first week or first month of release, with the first week just barely pulling off the win, 45% to 44%.

“Just like consumers, we’re excited for an action-packed summer of movies,” Marcus Theatres’ President Mark Gramz said in a press release. “There’s nothing quite like experiencing those thrilling car chases, stand-offs, and explosive scenes on a SuperScreen DLX or in UltraScreen DLX auditorium complete with massive screens and Dolby Atmos multidimensional sound. Not to mention, programs like Marcus Theatres’ Magical Movie Rewards and Value Tuesdays make multiple trips to the movies fun and affordable.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJveG9mZmljZXByby5jb20vbWFyY3VzLXRoZWF0cmVzLXN1cnZleS1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS1tb3N0LWFudGljaXBhdGVkLW1vdmllLXN1bW1lci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

New York City Subway Riders Not Happy With Latest ‘Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny’ Marketing Stunt

New York City subway riders are expressing their frustration with the latest Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny marketing stunt that takes over screens that display train times.

YouTuber Price of Reason picked up on the backlash and shared numerous examples of subway writers sharing their dissatisfaction with the ads.

Howard Sherman tweeted, “I just heard a short ad for the new Indiana Jones movie played over the loudspeakers at my subway stop. I realize the MTA is struggling financially, but audio commercials inserted into my commute is not a positive development — with rate increases on their way too.”

Daniel Welch reacted, “Seriously MTA is selling audio ads now? Way to train the public to intentionally ignore loudspeakers announcements.”

He then asked, “What’s next? Speakers on the sidewalks forcing us to listen to ads?”

One user questioned on whether listening to the ads will preclude them from a fair hike.

Bossy Kielbasa tweeted, “Does the surround sound Indiana Jones ad I just heard in the Bowery station preclude us from a subway hike this year? ?”

Jason Yarn wrote, “Am I late to the party in realizing that the MTA itself is advertising shit now? An ad for Indiana Jones came over the loudspeakers at my stop just now and a ticker for the film scrolled by on the train arrival monitors. I know I shouldn’t be surprised, but still, ugh.”

Twitter user playsbyme tweeted, “Wtf is this Indiana Jones ad playing in the NYCT Subway stations???? MTA can’t provide updates over the intercom but they can advertise a freaking movie?????”

Pennyfore wrote, “Ok NO MTA we do NOT want audio ads for Indiana Jones blasting through multiple subway stations.”

As highlighted by Price of Reason, Pat Kiernan the morning news anchor for NY1 was none too happy about the ads.

During a segment of the show he said, “When I’m on the subway platform I do not want to hear advertisements blasting over the public address system and I definitely don’t want to see you take away the next train clock to put an Indiana Jones ad up on the screen.”

The advertisement and how it works can be seen below.

One user also shared how the the advertisement took over the entire screen from showing arrival times for trains.

Kiernan would also share, “I know the MTA is hard up for cash, I get it. I’m happy to have advertising intrude in the subway in many different ways. You can wrap the cars, you can do all that. This is too far.”

He then opined, “Next time they give them extra funding from Albany or extra funding from Washington it should say, ‘As long as you stop the Indiana Jones ads.'”

Reacting to New Yorkers not liking these new ads on their subway commute, Price of Reason said, “What is most interesting to me is how aggressive this marketing push is. And it’s obvious that Disney and Lucasfilm had to pay a hefty fee for this last minute marketing campaign. So it looks like they are going to great lengths to prevent his movie from flopping.”

“For me though, this subway campaign seems like nothing more than a frantic last-ditch effort, a Hail Mary pass that ironically may even deter people from actually seeing this movie,” he continued.

“I believe this shows how once again both Disney CEO Bob Iger and Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy keep avoiding the real issue here,” Price of Reason said. “If this movie’s screenigs, trailers, and press were positive until now then audiences would have probably bought tickets for it. And if they haven’t bought tickets it’s probably not because they haven’t heard about the movie.

“The truth is that many people just aren’t interested in seeing Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” he declared.

Interestingly, the subway campaign is not the only gimmick Lucasfilm is rolling out. They have partnered with restaurant chain Applebees as well to provide a free ticket to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny if you spend over $35 at the restaurant either dining in, carrying out, or getting delivery.

What do you make of New Yorkers sharing their distaste for these Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny ads? What do you make of the ads?

That’s this weekend’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which, analyzed by the same measuring stick — particularly given the pic’s U.S./Canada 5-day of $78M — is well-below the $90M tracking Paramount was hoping for. Three-day here is $54.2M.

But here is the root of the root, and the bud of the bud, and that is Dead Reckoning and Dial of Destiny are not the same. Already, in its running global take of $122.2M through yesterday, Dead Reckoning is on the verge of overtaking the $130M global start of Indy.

In fact, Dead Reckoning is bound to have the upper hand in the long-run, particularly on a global basis.

Yes, I just said that.

Dead Reckoning‘s demos are very similar to Dial of Destiny: 55+ was both their largest quad (Mission at 22%, Indy at 25%), Men over 25 are dominant in the turnout (respectively 46%, 43%), the prime moviegoing demo of 18-34 is just over a third for both (37%, 36%), and so on.

Hang on for one great weekend with Hayley Atwell and Tom Cruise in ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’ Paramount/Everett Collection

However, the reviews and audiences exits on Dead Reckoning bury Dial of Destiny. In updated Friday night PostTrak exits, Dead Reckoning gets 5 stars and 90% from audiences (Indy only received 4 stars and 79%), with men/women at 62% / 38% grading it 90% / 89% (Indy‘s grades for both were 74% and 85%). Deal with it, Disney: The ball was dropped quality wise on Dial of Destiny, and the sequel is suffering with critics and fans. We expect more from Lucasfilm, especially on a legacy finale.

Grosses went down between Indiana Jones movies, while grosses went up on Mission movies: Dead Reckoning could see a 5-day franchise record still, besting Mission: Imposible II’s $78.8M. The Cruise feature is still in its prime; keep reading.

Said one rival studio executive source this AM, “With these reviews and PostTrak numbers, I would expect this one to leg out through summer — these are strong numbers.”

If anything, the Tom Cruise sequel has all the mojo to not only outstrip Indy domestically, but the potential to make significantly more overseas — even if China doesn’t pull in a $100M+ gross like it did on Mission: Impossible – Fallout, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.

Cruise’s previous three Mission movies generated over 70% of their global box office abroad. Indy is not going to do that. As we told you yesterday, the global outlook for Dead Reckoning is still around $240M; As of last weekend, Indy‘s global was slightly more domestic than foreign, 51% to 49%.

But wait a second, wait a second — wasn’t Dead Reckoning suppose to open to $90M over five days? This is surely an upset, no? The reality of the situation here stateside is that there isn’t any Top Gun: Maverick halo effect. That long-awaited sequel brought out non-moviegoers, people who haven’t been to the movies in years. Dead Reckoning is bringing its finite, older-skewing fanbase. As a Mission movie, Dead Reckoning‘s start here isn’t below its franchise expectations.

Hold on again – doesn’t Dead Reckoning stand to lose as much money as Dial of Destiny? Both cost about the same. What’s clear is that the industry is still releasing over-budgeted movies that were challenged by Covid stops; Dead Reckoning being one of the first movies to shut down because of the pandemic in Italy back in early 2020. The box office to profit measure for some of these tentpoles is still a hurdle, and will continue to be for a while. These movies weren’t made under normal circumstances, and Disney and Paramount both invested heavily in prime IP under the notion that they would deliver, and it’s better to perfect and avoid scaling back costs. Who doesn’t want to invest more on a trusted franchise sequel, especially a global star who delivered one of the highest-grossing movies of last year in Top Gun: Maverick?

However, as we said above — the word of mouth on Dead Reckoning will empower it, even with Barbie next weekend potentially posting Little Mermaid numbers ($95M+ 3-day) and adult-leaning Oppenheimer in the mix, and that buzz will carry the Cruise film through all ancillaries.

Let’s step back again and assess — Dead Reckoning is posting a lower 3-day and 5-day next to Dial of Destiny. Why is that? The notion is that with Dead Reckoning having all the goods in great reviews and audience exits, there was no reason for it to debut on a Wednesday stateside. The movie could have gone on Friday and saw a $78M 3-day, which would have been a record opening for the Cruise series. I was under the impression that the movie, at a long running time of 2 hours and 43 minutes, would benefit from a 5-day launch, given that there’s fewer showtimes at cinemas, and it would propel word of mouth. However, another source splashed water in my face and reminded me that the exhibition infrastructure as it is has the capacity and the power to deliver enormous box office grosses: Hello, Avengers: Endgame was a three-hour movie and holds the opening domestic box office record opening with $357.1M.

Like Indy, could Mission have expanded to a younger audience? Of course, and Cruise might want to consider hiring some popular YA stars for future sequels. Imagine the juiced gross on a Mission: Impossible if Harry Styles or Zendaya were part of the ensemble.

The Cruise sequel is playing strongest in the East, West & Mountain. Meanwhile, red state fave Sound of Freedom is throwing off those percentages, as it’s so strong in the middle of the country. Meanwhile, 53% of Sound of Freedom‘s $23.6M second weekend (up a massive 20%) is coming from the South, South Central, and Midwest (parts of the country that do very well with Cruise movies).

PLFs and Imax screens are driving 42% of Dead Reckoning‘s business to date.

In 13 days, Sound of Freedom, with $82M, will have made more than Everything Everywhere All at Once‘s lifetime domestic of $77.1M. Of course, both movies appeal to polar opposites. But it’s interesting to note their comparison, as both movies were unexpected outliers that were unforeseen in their success at the B.O.

This movie is stoking the Fox News Channel crowd to get out to the movies, and is appealing to them in its subject of child-trafficking, something which some right wingers believe is the fault of the left. The movie’s success is a testament to its star, title, and release date: It headlines Jesus (Jim Caviezel from Passion of the Christ), and the distributor, Angels Studios, was adamant that the movie open on July 4. Why? The picture has the word “Freedom” in the title, and that says something to the red state crowd, especially on the Day of Independence.

Total weekend box office is an estimated $130.3M from all titles, off 2% from a year ago, when Thor: Love and Thunder led the box office in its second weekend, and +3% from pre-pandemic 2019, when Spider-Man: Far From Home held No. 1 in its second frame.

UPDATE FRIDAY PM: As we told you, it’s all about global when it comes to the opening of Paramount/Skydance’s Tom Cruise sequel Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One and we hear a $240 million global start is being forecasted right now. Stateside, the 5-day is $76M after what is expected to be a $16M Friday and $52.2M 3-day at 4,327 theaters. Offshore opening will be $164M.

Anything north of a $78.8M 5-day domestic is an opening record for the franchise stateside; currently, that benchmark is owned by the Wednesday-through-Sunday start of 2000’s Mission: Impossible II. (Deadline’s Nancy Tartaglione will have more details on foreign later this weekend.) China is eyeing a $27M-$30M weekend, not too shabby for a Hollywood film now. We’ll take it. The last Mission: Impossible, 2018’s Fallout, posted a $76.1M in the PRC (not accounting for inflation and currency swings); that was a much different time for Hollywood movies. Note Japan, a big Mission market, isn’t in this opening suite.

Angel Studios’ Sound of Freedom continues to ring loudly at 3,265 theaters with a second Friday of $6M (+15%), a second weekend between $20M-$22.5M, and running cume that could reach $81M by EOD Sunday. This Jim Caviezel thriller is bound for a $100M-plus gross. Rivals are even betting substantially more.

Sony/Stage 6 Films/Blumhouse’s Insidious: The Red Door is seeing a $4.35M Friday, -71%, with a second weekend of $13.5M, -59%, and running total by Sunday of $58.6M at 3,188 theaters.

Disney/Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, booked at 3,865 spots, is seeing a third Friday of $3.6M, -53%, and third weekend of $12.9M, -53%, and a running total by Sunday of $146.2M.

Disney/Pixar’s Elemental continues to hold in the top five with an estimated fifth weekend of $8.8M, a great -12% hold, and a running total of $125.3M. That will fire it past Lightyear‘s final domestic of $118.3M. Friday is estimated to be around $2.5M at 3,235 theaters.

UPDATE, FRIDAY AM: Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One saw $8.3 million million on Thursday, repping a 47% decline from the Wednesday opening plus previews of $15.5M. The two-day total for the Paramount/Skydance feature is $23.8M from 4,049 theaters. Hopefully this film spikes today. I mean, it will spike today, it’s just by how much given that A CinemaScore and 4 1/2 stars and 88% on Screen Engine/Comscore’s PostTrak. Guys at 65% gave the movie its best grades at 90%. Women at 35% weren’t that far behind at 86%.

A $90M five-day total seems unlikely, with rivals spotting $50M over three days and $73M over five. We’ll dissect what’s up here on this near-$300M production as the numbers become clearer; the feature went through several Covid delays. Right now M:I‘s box office looks similar to that of Paramount’s 2017 Transformers: The Last Knight, which was another long movie at 2 hours and 34 minutes that opened on Wednesday to $15.6M and Thursday to $8.1M for a two-day of $23.7M. However, that was largely a younger-guy-skewing feature versus the 74% over 25 here; and it was a B+ picture and not one of the fan-faves for the robots-in-disguise series. Last Knight‘s first Friday was $13.7M.

Last night’s 7 p.m. Dolby auditorium show for Dead Reckoning at the AMC Porter Ranch (30 minutes north of Los Angeles, and where Nicole Kidman shot the exhib’s commercial) was nearly sold out. What that exemplifies for these big tentpoles is that we’re under-screened when it comes to premium-format auditoriums. There’s no reason why a big star like Tom Cruise should have to go around asking for more PLF screens on a movie for which he’s already doing 360-degree press; exhibition has to build more of them if we’re going to expand the marketplace. Mission is expected to have its grab of PLFs next weekend despite Universal’s three-hour Christopher Nolan epic Oppenheimer muscling in.

Speaking of publicity, especially at a time when there aren’t any late-night talk shows, Dead Reckoning had a ton of it. Cruise is becoming a rare movie star, together with Dwayne Johnson, who knows how to go all out in making a movie a fire-breathing event and having the world know about it. I mean, this movie was promoted at two different CinemaCons, 2021 and 2022; there was the Rome premiere where the pic was shot including a mind-blowing chase scene; as well as multiple global stops by Cruise. RelishMix says that the social media universe reach for Dead Reckoning is at an awesome 529.9M across TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube views, which is ahead of Top Gun: Maverick (401.5 SMU/$126.7M opening), John Wick 4 (452.3M SMU/$73.8M opening) and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (296.4M/$60.3m opening).

‘Sound of Freedom’ Everett

Meanwhile, Angel Studios’ Sound of Freedom continues to wow. The pic posted daily middays of $4M+, out-pegging Sony/Stage 6 Films/Blumhouse’s Insidious: The Red Door every day. The latter pic took No. 1 last weekend with $33M. On Thursday, Sound of Freedom grossed an estimated $4.5M, +4% over Wednesday. Pic’s last seven days grossed $36.5M for a running total of $58.5M. Angel Studios released a statement yesterday, squashing rumors that AMC has made it difficult for patrons to see the movie. That’s fake news, with the circuit selling more than 1 million tickets so far for the Jim Caviezel thriller. The pic is getting 450 theaters added to the current count of 2,852 theaters.

Red Door was third on Thursday with $2.5M, -1% from Wednesday and a first week of $45M at 3,188 locations.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny did $2.3M on Thursday at 4,600 theaters, even with Wednesday, for a second-week take of $38.6M and a running total of $133.3M.

‘Elemental’ Disney

Disney has fifth place with Elemental and a fourth Thursday of $1.6M, +6% from Wednesday, with a $17M fourth week; its running total is $116.5M at 3,440 theaters. Get a load of this: Despite the Pixar movie opening lower than Lightyear, $29.6M to $50.5M, it’s going to outstrip that Toy Story spinoff’s final domestic total of $118.3M.

UPDATED THURSDAY AM: Paramount reported $15.5M for the Wednesday opening day of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which includes previews. The studio isn’t reporting a 3 and 5-day projection as those type of forecasts can be wonky and it ultimately boils down to Friday business.

Rivals, however, are betting at this point in time that Dead Reckoning isn’t as big as the $90M tracking purported it to be. More like $47M for the 3-day and $70.5M per industry estimates right now. The worry here is if this is Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny all over again with a very expensive film near $300M production cost, long-running time and older dude skewing franchise falling short of expectations. There’s a chance on a five-day basis, this could still be a franchise record start: Mission: Impossible II has the best five-day opening for the Cruise series at $78.8M.

With a running time of 2 hours and 43 minutes, it’s clear that Dead Reckoning is appointment viewing for moviegoers like Avatar: The Way of Water and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. However, it’s a fast 2 hours and 43 minutes given the awesome action set pieces in the movie.

Last night on Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak, Dead Reckoning looked similar to Indy‘s Thursday night demos with 34% over 45, 74% over 25 and heavily male at 65%.

However, here’s the box office viagra that Ethan Hunt has over Indiana Jones, and hopefully this will bode well in spreading word of mouth, especially with the younger demos: Dead Reckoning has an A CinemaScore to Dial of Destiny‘s B+. That’s the second A for a Mission movie after 2018’s Fallout. The franchise counts three A- grades for Rogue Nation, Mission Impossible III and Ghost Protocol. Mission: Impossible did B+ while Mission: Impossible II got a B. It’s also one of the best reviewed Missions of all-time at 96% certified fresh to Fallout‘s 97% certified fresh. In addition, Mission‘s edge over Indy is that Cruise and the franchise are more of a draw at the overseas boxoffice than the Lucasfilm IP (which isn’t even known in certain big markets like China). Korea and Japan are expected to be big for Dead Reckoning. It’s overseas in the end that could possibly bail this very pricey Mission movie out. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny opened to $130M WW, with a domestic 3-day of $60.3M. The Friday-Tuesday five day was $83.8M. Current global on the Lucasfilm franchise finale is north of $256M WW.

On social media, RelishMix spots, “Convo tone on Dead Reckoning runs positive as fans acknowledge Tom Cruise’s tireless tenacity as Hollywood’s modern daredevil, proclaiming he’s ‘hauling modern cinema on his back.’ Paired with filmmaker Christoper McQuarrie’s daring direction and newcomer Hayley Atwell, some already herald it as potentially ‘the best action movie of all time.’ This series is being elevated above competitors, notably Fast X and The Fast and Furious franchise, with fans assertively favoring its consistently epic entries — ‘This franchise is the movie embodiment of aged fine wine.’ Even with a chorus of praise, a handful of viewers yearn for fresh elements, countering the franchise’s predictable beats. Yet, the Mission: Impossible saga continues its powerful performance, captivating its loyal audience and igniting anticipation for this new chapter.”

UPDATED WEDNESDAY PM: Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One‘s opening day is looking like $16 million, which includes the $7M in previews.

Yes, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Mission: Impossible – Fallout both posted first days in the $22M-$23M range, but those were Fridays. This is about the long play of the movie, and Tom Cruise fare is back-loaded. The reason why this pic is going for the five-day record is due to its length, at 2 hours and 43 minutes. It’s expected, especially with a current great Rotten Tomatoes audience score of 94%, to get to $90M, a franchise record opening, by Sunday. Again, it’s still early. These numbers could go up.

Sound of Freedom is looking at second place with $3.9M and a running total of $53.4M. That daily gross is holding steady with Monday and Tuesday. Very impressive.

UPDATE AFTER EXCLUSIVE: Paramount/Skydance’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One came in at the high end of expectations with $7M in previews. Pic was booked at 3,300 locations and hikes its theater count up to 4,000-plus today including Imax and PLF.

I’m told that the fan PLF money from Monday shows isn’t included in that $7M figure. The previous chapter, Mission: Impossible – Fallout posted Thursday previews of $6M, a record for the franchise. Next to other summer comps, Disney/Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny posted $7.2M in previews.

The Rotten Tomatoes audience score out of the gate after previews is 94%.

Tom Cruise and filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie have been touring the film; the duo making stops in Toronto, Atlanta, Miami, and Washington DC, greeting fans at cinemas.

Yessica Borroto Perryman in ‘Sound of Freedom’ Everett Collection

In early estimates this morning, Angel Studio’ Jim Caviezel thriller Sound of Freedom won another weekday with $4M yesterday, beating Sony/Blumhouse/Stage 6 Films’ Insidious: The Red Door which had $3.48M. Both pics had even holds from Monday percent-wise. Sound of Freedom raises its running total to $49.7M in its eight-day run. Wow. It’s expected that the pic will post a -30% ease in weekend 2 with around $13M-$14M after a $19.6M reported 3-day last week. Red Door‘s five day run rises to $40M.

EXCLUSIVE: Paramount/Skydance’s Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning – Part One is looking at $6M-$7M in previews so far, which is bound to be higher than the Thursday previews of the last Mission Impossible – Fallout back in 2018 which did $6M. This is according to sources. The figures we’re seeing now could go higher or lower.

Dead Reckoning previews began at 2PM today, however, I hear there were PLF fan screenings on Monday and that handful of bucks is accounted for in the estimate.

Dead Reckoning is one of the longer films of the summer at 2 hours and 43 minutes with credits. Not as long as Oppenheimer‘s 3 hours (opening on July 21), but longer than Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2 hours and 34 minutes) and The Flash (2 hours and 24 minutes). However, the action is unlike anything any Mission Impossible or Fast and Furious movie has ever delivered before. Seriously, that Rome, Italy car chase will make you want to see the movie again. Paramount is going for a Mission:Impossible franchise five-day record here with a Wednesday start, which is smart given this sequel’s length and the limited amount of showtimes exhibitors can program. Disney did not execute a Wednesday start with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, another older dude skewing film, the studio opting for a Friday launch and seeing $60.3M over three days before July 4.

The best reviewed Mission: Impossible of all-time at 98% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, Dead Reckoning is projected to have a $90M five-day stateside, $250M+ worldwide.

Last year, the decades long-awaited sequel Top Gun: Maverick posted the best box office results of Cruise’s career with $19.3M in U.S. previews, $126.7M domestic opening, and $256.4M WW start. The pic finaled at $718.7M domestic (No. 1 pic for 2023 domestic), $1.49 billion WW (No 2 global for 2023 after Avatar: The Way of Water).

Mission: Impossible – Fallout opened to $61.2M domestic, and legged out to $220.1M domestic, and $791.6M WW. Even if Mission comes up short this weekend, remember, Cruise’s movies are always backloaded at the B.O.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvYm94LW9mZmljZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctdG9tLWNydWlzZS0xMjM1NDM0ODIxL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvYm94LW9mZmljZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctdG9tLWNydWlzZS0xMjM1NDM0ODIxL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-07-24 16:00:00+00:00,Mission: Impossible 7 box office,"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One had a franchise record opening, but has the new Mission: Impossible movie been a box-office hit or a failure?","Last summer, Tom Cruise saved cinema with the release ofTop Gun: Maverick which flew to an incredible $1.5 billion worldwide.

Hopes were high, then, that his return as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One could be another huge hit that boosted the box office, following the dire performances of The Flash and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.

But those hopes didn't quite pan out with the US debut for Mission: Impossible 7, which, while it marked a series high, ended up below expectations. And then Barbenheimer hit and Ethan truly faced his toughest test yet.

So after two weeks in play, has Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One been a box-office hit or flop? Let's delve into the numbers.

Paramount Pictures

After its second weekend of release, the new Mission: Impossible movie has grossed $118.8 million at the US box office and $252.1 million overseas, giving it a global haul to date of $370.9 million.

It will soon overtake the worldwide tallies of Mission: Impossible III ($399.4 million) and Mission: Impossible ($457.7 million), not adjusted for inflation. But whether it has enough in the tank to challenge the series high of Mission: Impossible – Fallout ($786.6 million) remains to be seen.

The combined release of Barbie andOppenheimer has had a bigger impact than expected on Mission: Impossible 7, especially because Barbenheimer proved such a record-breaking smash. It led to a franchise-worst week-on-week drop of 64% in the US, with the movie losing IMAX and Premium Large-Format screens to the newbies, hitting its gross.

It's too early to panic though as, historically, Mission: Impossible movies have enjoyed long runs at the box office, while the new movie isn't too far behind Fallout. At the same stage, Fallout was at $124.8 million, only $6 million ahead, and it went on to take $220.2 million.

Paramount

Mission: Impossible movies have also generally been stronger overseas than they have been at the US box office. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Mission: Impossible 7 is tracking ahead of Fallout in a number of markets, and it's just had a strong $7.9 million debut in Japan, 23% ahead of Fallout.

What should play in Dead Reckoning Part One's favour too is its strong reception from both critics and fans. It stands at 96% on Rotten Tomatoes, just below Fallout's 97%, and received an A CinemaScore, the same as other summer hits Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 and The Super Mario Bros Movie.

Once the Barbenheimer hype dies down, it's likely that the new movie can sustain at the box office. Not only will it regain some of those IMAX and PLF screens in the coming weeks, but there's little major blockbuster competition opening given that The Marvels shifted from July 28 to November 10.

Mission: Impossible 7 has to contend with the likes of The Meg 2 (August 4) and Gran Turismo (August 11), as well as family-friendly offerings like Haunted Mansion (July 28 in US, August 11 in UK). However, none of them are direct competition and shouldn't stop the movie being a box-office draw into August.

Whether Mission: Impossible 7 will be able to rebound enough to challenge Fallout as the series' highest-grossing movie is unclear at the moment. Even though it has the capacity to do so, a continued Barbenheimer interest could stop it in its tracks.

While the movie was unexpectedly hit by the huge Barbenheimer success, it's still too harsh to call it a box-office flop, though. It's already overtaken the likes of The Flash and Indiana Jones 5 to currently rank as the ninth biggest movie of 2023, and the Mission: Impossible series has never been a billion-dollar success.

There is one thing that Mission: Impossible 7 does have in common with those notable disappointments though: a huge budget.

It reportedly had a $290 million budget, not including marketing, which means to make a profit, it'll need to take around $700 million (assuming the industry standard of 2.5 times its budget). It's not guaranteed that the new movie can get there, but there will be hope that it can as it's in a good position despite the second-weekend setback.

Coming weeks will prove just how much of a success we can deem Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.

2023-06-21 21:16:26+00:00,"Disney ""Panics"" Over New 'Indiana Jones' Film as Worst Nightmare Unfolds - Inside the Magic","Disney and Lucasfilm are reportedly in a ""panic"" as the Harrsion Ford film, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny', is about to be released.","Things are not looking promising for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023).

The beloved Lucasfilm franchise is just a matter of days away from releasing its final installment. The franchise currently boasts four movies, which include Raiders of the Lost Ark(1981), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008).

Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which was released more than 15 years ago, received terrible ratings from critics and audiences alike. The movie, which starred Harrison Ford reprising his role as Dr. Henry Jones Jr. for the first time in nearly 20 years alongside Shia LaBeouf (Mutt Williams) was okay at the box office but was horribly rated. Though the film brought in $790.7 million at the box office, it received just a 53% approval rating from audiences and a 77% rating from critics, which is actually surprisingly high considering the reviews that were released following the film’s release.

Now, Disney and Lucasfilm have joined forces to produce Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which is set to be released on June 30, 2023. The film debuted at the 76th Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2023, and has been quite a controversial topic since well before then.

Disney was originally planning a spinoff series for Indiana Jones that could have starred the likes of Phoebe Waller-Bridge taking over the lead role in the place of Harrison Ford. However, after much backlash, the series was reportedly canceled. If that weren’t enough, the new film has faced controversy for scenes that have been released, including a couple of moments that have opponents believing the movie will be part of Disney’s reported “woke agenda.”

Still, the film– which will be Harrison Ford’s swansong in the role with Waller-Bridge and Mads Mikkelsen (Jurgen Voller) playing his key supporting roles– is barrelling into its debut weekend, where it’s expected to earn big.

However, Disney’s biggest nightmare might be upon them. Reviews continue to come in for the movie and early screeners for the film several months ago reportedly had the company “in a panic” after hearing feedback. Now, it seems that the fears that the film might be a “bust” could be walking straight into reality. With Rotten Tomatoes showing a 77% rating from critics for the Shia LaBeouf Indiana Jones film, you might be surprised to know that critics hate this upcoming movie even more. With 93 reviews, Rotten Tomatoes shows an abysmal 58% approval rating, which is noticeably low.

A review from Express shared that the film “should’ve stayed buried.” Though the review shared that James Mangold did an excellent job stepping in for Steven Spielberg as the director of the film, the publication said that they did not think this is how Harrison Ford’s character should ride off into the sunset.

“If we never see Ford as Indy again, it’ll be a crying shame, because frankly his story is not finished just yet,” they said.

Several other reviews from critics have noted many of the same feelings toward the ending of the film.

Example video title will go here for this video

LOS ANGELES — “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” slung its webs back atop the box office ranks while “The Flash” saw a drop faster than the film’s speedy character.

The Spidey animated sequel — starring Shameik Moore as the teenage webslinger Miles Morales — reclaimed the No. 1 spot in its fourth week in North American theaters, scoring $19.3 million. The latest number helped the Sony film reach $317.1 million domestically and an impressive $560.3 million worldwide.

“For a film like this to crawl and spin a web back into the No. 1 spot is very rare,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “It’s a testament to the quality of the movie. This is a very competitive and crowded summer movie marketplace. And yet ‘Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse’ has distinguished itself as one of the biggest movies this summer season.”

“Spider-Verse” beat out “Elemental,” which took second place for the second week in a row with an estimated $18.5 million. The film held on to the spot after experiencing Pixar’s worst three-day opening last week.

No other film had such a dramatic drop than “The Flash” with $15.2 million for the big-budget offering. The second-week output for the DC and Warner Bros superhero film, starring Ezra Miller, fell off by 72% after opening with a subpar $55 million.

So far, the numbers “The Flash” have accumulated haven’t measured up for a movie with a $200 million production budget. Some are crediting the film’s struggles to Miller’s off-screen behavior that has included arrests and misconduct. The actor has apologized and sought mental health treatment.

“Sometimes it’s not the opening weekend that tells the whole story — particularly with ‘Elemental,” Dergarabedian said. “It’s more about the challenges that can sometimes face a movie like ‘The Flash’ that are multifaceted, and it’s very difficult to overcome.”

“The Flash” barely edged out “No Hard Feelings,” starring Jennifer Lawrence and Andrew Barth Feldman. The Sony R-rated comedy, which opened in fourth place with $15.1 million, tells a story about a teen’s parents who hired a woman (Lawrence) to date and boost his confidence.

With “Spider-Verse” and “No Hard Feelings,” Dergarabedian said Sony should be pleased about the turnout for both films.

“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” came in fifth place with $11.6 million in its third week with a total $122.9 million. It placed ahead of Wes Anderson’s “Asteroid City,” which did better than expected with $9 million.

In seventh, “The Little Mermaid” pulled in $8.6 million to bring its total to more than $270 million.

Dergarabedian said he expects a good draw for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which opens June 30.

“No matter what the reviews are. I know the reviews have been mixed. But the summer movie fan who wants to go to the movie theater, you can’t sit this one out,” he said. “It’s really going to be the audience who will decide the ultimate success of this film.”

Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny unearthed a solid $24 million at the Friday box office, setting the stage for a projected weekend debut in the $60 million range. While it falls on the lower end of expectations, it highlights the challenge of attracting the target audience of older adults back to theaters.

The Friday earnings include $7.2 million from preview screenings, signaling some early interest in the long-awaited final installment of Disney and Lucasfilm's adventure-action series. The filmmakers are optimistic for a domestic launch closer to $65 million and a cumulative total of $83 million or more through Tuesday, and it does enjoy an 88 percent positive audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.

Interestingly, Friday's audience skewed predominantly male, with 58 percent of viewers, while 42 percent of ticket buyers were aged 45 and older, including 23 percent aged 55 and above. This demographic breakdown is unusual for a Hollywood summer blockbuster, as older moviegoers typically don't rush to theaters on opening weekend, even prior to the pandemic.

Returning Harrison Ford as the iconic swashbuckling archaeologist, the Indiana Jones franchise welcomes new faces such as Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Antonio Banderas, John Rhys-Davies, Toby Jones, Boyd Holbrook, Ethann Isidore, and Mads Mikkelsen in the James Mangold-directed film. Notably, Steven Spielberg directed the previous four Indy films.

Is the first Indy movie not directed by Spielberg

In line with the series' recurring Nazi theme, ""Dial of Destiny"" centers around the pursuit of an ancient device by Jones and a villain portrayed by Mikkelsen. The movie serves as a sequel to 2008's Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which debuted with a three-day total of $100 million fifteen years ago.

Produced by Kathleen Kennedy, Frank Marshall, and Simon Emanuel, Indiana Jones 5 features executive producers Spielberg and George Lucas. The legendary John Williams, renowned for scoring each Indiana Jones film since the original Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1981, has once again composed the score for this installment.

In addition to Indiana Jones 5, the pre-July Fourth weekend witnessed the release of DreamWorks Animation and Universal's Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, which garnered $2.4 million on Friday, including $725,000 from Thursday previews. However, the family film appears to be struggling, projected to open with a modest $6 million and secure the sixth-place spot at the box office.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmNhLmNvbS9lbi9saWZlc3R5bGUvbW92aWVzLzIwMjMvMDcvMDIvNjRhMGI3OGIyNjhlM2UzODI4OGI0NWRjLmh0bWzSAVJodHRwczovL2FtcC5tYXJjYS5jb20vZW4vbGlmZXN0eWxlL21vdmllcy8yMDIzLzA3LzAyLzY0YTBiNzhiMjY4ZTNlMzgyODhiNDVkYy5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The Hannibal actor plays villain Jürgen Voller in the fifth chapter on the archaeologist portrayed by Harrison Ford. Ahead of the film's release, Mikkelsen sat down with Digital Spy for an exclusive chat, revealing the ending is everything he'd hoped for.

""I was hoping to go that way,"" he said.

""In the previous films, we've had, you know, a grail that gave you eternal life. We've had an ark that opens up with infinite power. So I was hoping this film was going exactly where it was going. And so it did.""

Speaking about his character, Mikkelsen explained he's just not your regular Indy villain.

As it's sometimes the case in the archaeo-star's franchise, the baddie is a Nazi. Well, in this case, a former Nazi now working for NASA and looking to use the moon landing for his own gain.

""This character had a passion, he had a dream,"" the actor said.

""There was something he thought could have been much better resolved back in the '40s, if only he had a chance to fix it, right? So that was in there.""

Mikkelsen, who's Danish, also said they steered clear of stereotypical accents when fleshing out Voller. Dial of Destiny avoids the clichéd German slant so often used to portray villains in older films, previous Indiana Jones instalments included.

""I think we also maybe went a little away from, let's say, the classical accent of a German – or the clichéd accent of a German,"" he said.

""We just kept mine [laughs] and threw a few German words in there.""

2023-06-22 13:25:00+00:00,"Harrison Ford Refuses to Retire From Acting as He Turns 81, Says ‘Indiana Jones’ Exit Is Not Bittersweet: ‘It’s Time For Me to Grow Up’",Harrison Ford laughs when asked if he's going to retire as he's about to turn 81 years old.,"Harrison Ford is retiring from playing Indiana Jones after the upcoming “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” but that doesn’t mean Ford himself is leaving Hollywood behind. Far from it. During an upcoming interview on CNN and Max’s “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace?” (set to air and stream on June 23), Ford laughs at the idea of retiring from acting. Next month, he will turn 81 years old.

When asked if he plans to retire, Ford replied, “I don’t. I don’t do well when I don’t have work. I love to work. I love to feel useful. It’s my jones. I want to be helpful”

Why does Ford still have the acting bug as he gears up to turn 81 years old? “It is the people you get to work with,” he said. “The intensity and the intimacy of collaboration. It’s the combined ambition somehow forged from words on a page. I don’t plan what I want to do in a scene. I don’t feel obliged to do anything. I’m naturally affected by things that I work on.”

With “Indiana Jones” winding down, Ford has the Apple TV+ comedy “Shrinking” and the Paramount+ drama “1923” heading into second seasons once the writers strike concludes. He’s also spent recent weeks in Atlanta filming the Marvel tentpole “Captain America: Brave New World,” in which he stars as U.S. president Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross.

While age is but a number for Ford, he really wanted his current stage of life to be felt in his fifth and final “Indiana Jones” movie. He told Chris Wallace that the entire allure of coming back to play Indiana Jones was to embrace his age and not make it a joke.

“I wanted it to be character driven,” Ford said about his “Dial of Destiny” return. “And I wanted us to confront the question of age straight on. Not to to hide my age, but to take advantage of it in the telling of the story.”

When asked if it’s bittersweet saying goodbye to Indiana Jones, Ford answered: “No. It’s time for me to grow up.”

“Six years ago, I thought maybe we ought to take a shot at making another one,” Ford said. “And I wanted it to be about age because I think that rounds out the story that we’ve told and we brought it to the right place. I mean, the last one ended in kind of a suspended animation. There was not a real strong feeling of the conclusion or the closure that I always hoped for, the roundness and speaking to this issue of age. Not making jokes about it, but but making it a real thing.”

“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” opens in theaters June 30 from Disney. New episodes of “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace?” are available Friday mornings on Max and air at 10pm ET/PT on CNN.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC1yZXRpcmUtYWN0aW5nLWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtZW5kLTEyMzU2NTExODkv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9oYXJyaXNvbi1mb3JkLXJldGlyZS1hY3RpbmctaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1lbmQtMTIzNTY1MTE4OS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-10 15:00:19+00:00,The Flash & Dial of Destiny Are the Children of Rise of Skywalker,The Flash & Indiana Jones Dial of Destiny descend from Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: nostalgia aimed at the wrong audience demographic.,"Hollywood is in the midst of a generational crisis, and that is playing out at the box office with the recent failures of big-budget blockbusters like The Flash and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. However, this crisis is entirely of Hollywood’s own making.

It is also a problem that was entirely foreseeable and preventable. Historically, the key demographic for cinemas has always consisted of 18-34-year-olds. There are multiple reasons for this. Members of this group are old enough to have disposable income and young enough that their earnings aren’t yet tied up in mortgages and loan repayments. They also socialize in large groups outside the house and don’t yet have the obligations that come with having a family or running a home.

This is not just anecdotal. Any study of the numbers backs it up. A 2013 study by the Urban Land Institute reported that 75% of respondents in the age group regularly went to the cinema, with a majority of those going more than once a month. A Nielsen survey for the first quarter of 2019 observed that 56% of weekly movie-goers fell within the age bracket. A 2022 survey by Morning Consult confirmed the group was more likely than other age demographics to “often” or “sometimes” go to the cinema, with the lowest response of any demographic to “never.”

So, logically, any successful four-quadrant blockbuster needs to be able to offer something to that demographic. These films need to be able to convince the largest and most frequent movie-going audience that these movies are worthy of their time. Consistently over the past year, the blockbusters that have failed to perform have been the ones that have failed to draw in those younger audiences. Seventy percent of the audience for The Flash was over 25, while the largest demographic for Dial of Destiny was over the age of 54.

In contrast, many of the biggest success stories of the past few years have managed to attract these younger audiences. The #gentleminions trend helped to power Minions: The Rise of Gru to the most successful Independence Day opening ever. Sixty percent of the opening weekend audience for Spider-Man: No Way Home was under the age of 25. Fifty-six percent of the audience for John Wick: Chapter 4 was between 18 and 34, although it skewed older within that demographic – 31% between 25 and 34. Sixty-two percent of the audience for The Super Mario Bros. Movie was between 18 and 34, with 33% between 18 and 24.

Unsurprisingly, anybody paying attention to these demographics is concerned. Analysts have expressed worry about what Hollywood is doing to win over younger audience members, particularly those within Gen Z. After all, studies have long suggested that the emerging generation is more interested in playing video games or listening to music than in going to the cinema. Why hasn’t Hollywood been able to get these audiences to consistently turn out for big blockbusters? The default assumption has been to blame the kids.

Much of this analysis misses the forest for the trees. The question isn’t: “Why have these younger audiences stopped going to these big tentpoles?” It is: “Why would these younger audience members want to spend their hard-earned money on big-budget blockbusters that are increasingly nostalgic for properties, characters, and actors that they are too young to remember?” Call it the inverse Field of Dreams effect: If you don’t build it, they won’t come.

Tellingly, many of the big box office disappointments of the past few years are built around properties that exist outside the living memory of even the oldest members of that 18-to-34-year-old demographic. The Flash made a big deal of bringing back Michael Keaton as Batman, a role that he first played in 1989, exactly 34 years ago. That was the same summer that Harrison Ford rounded out the original Indiana Jones trilogy with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Even the oldest members of that demographic didn’t catch those in theaters.

Indeed, the ongoing and much-discussed decline of the Marvel Cinematic Universe may also be a result of simple demographics. It has been 15 years since Iron Man was released in 2008, so the demographic that connected with those movies towards the end of their teenage years are now in their 30s. A couple that went on their first date to see The Incredible Hulk could be taking their kids to see Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but they are just as likely to see the trip as expensive and difficult to coordinate.

Hollywood is caught in a nostalgia trap, something that Dial of Destiny explicitly acknowledges in its third act. Of course, nostalgia has always been a strong force in mainstream Hollywood filmmaking. Indeed, one can trace the roots of long-delayed star-driven generation-straddling sequels like The Flash and Dial of Destiny back to earlier efforts like Tron: Legacy, The Godfather Part III, or even The Color of Money. However, it feels like the trend has kicked into overdrive in recent years.

These “legacyquels” became a dominant cultural force during the mid-2010s, with the release of films like Mad Max: Fury Road, Creed, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 2015. However, these early examples were structured to pass the torch between generations of movie-goers. Old audience members, likely aging out of regular cinema trips, got to have one last hurrah with their old favorites, while younger viewers were welcomed into the family and given protagonists to which they might relate.

Characters like Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) stepped into the role of aging mentor to a new generation of characters like Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) or Rey (Daisy Ridley). The role of Max Rockatansky was recast from Mel Gibson to Tom Hardy, and he served as a supporting figure in the story of Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who would get her own spinoff prequel that is currently in development.

These sorts of films existed towards the end of the window of nostalgia for 1980s properties. Indeed, the release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in 2008 was likely the last chance for a financially viable blockbuster farewell to the eponymous archaeologist (Ford), with the film powering to $790M at the box office. Even then, there was a sense that Indy might have to at least acknowledge the existence of a new generation and potential successor, his son Mutt (Shia LaBeouf).

At a certain point, everything changed. The third film in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, The Rise of Skywalker, feels very much like the pivot point. If The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi had been about the idea of an older generation gracefully passing the torch to a younger group of heroes, The Rise of Skywalker was a panicked reversal. These older characters would not surrender the spotlight. They would yank it back, unable to resist the urge to take the Millennium Falcon for one last joyride.

This was a flawed approach from the outset. The Rise of Skywalker was the only film in the sequel trilogy to earn negative reviews and would also receive the lowest CinemaScore in the franchise’s live-action history. It was the only film of the sequel trilogy not to be the highest-grossing movie of its release year and was the lowest-grossing of the three. This box office collapse happened in real time; pre-sales were strong, and its opening weekend total ($175.5M) ultimately came in below the Friday ($195M), Saturday ($190M), and even Sunday ($179M+) estimates.

However, The Rise of Skywalker set a new template for these sorts of nostalgia projects. They would no longer offer more than a fig leaf to younger viewers. There could be newer characters, but there was never any confusion about whether they would replace the aging franchise veterans. Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller Bridge) can be in The Dial of Destiny, but she won’t get to touch Indy’s fedora. Rey can be the hero of the narrative, but only if she’s the granddaughter of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) and takes the name “Skywalker.”

This was the era of the “anti-legacyquel,” designed to assure older viewers that they would always be the center of this pop culture landscape. There were some successes. Top Gun: Maverick overcame all the odds to become the second highest-grossing movie of 2022. However, it was only the first sequel to Top Gun rather than part of a longer lineage of films, and it was much more about Tom Cruise as a movie star than Pete “Maverick” Mitchell as a character. It was also sold as a celebration of movies more than a celebration of the original film. In other words, it was a unicorn. It was not a model that could be replicated at scale.

Other successes were much more qualified. Sony’s smartest move with Ghostbusters: Afterlife wasn’t to indulge in nostalgic fan service for an irreverent 1980s comedy; it was to budget the film at a much more responsible level than Paul Feig’s more irreverent take on the concept. Indeed, Afterlife actually earned weaker reviews and a lower box office than the previous film in the franchise. It was only a success because it cost less. However, as is always the way with these things, Hollywood failed to learn the right lessons.

The trend is obvious even outside of cinemas. As franchise streaming shows like The Mandalorian leaned heavier into nostalgia by bringing back old characters and plot points, they seemed to enter a gradual decline. Of course, streaming data is opaque, but one can track trends. The relatively self-contained first season of The Mandalorian was the most in-demand show on the planet, while the more fan service-heavy third season failed to attract the same level of attention. This model doesn’t seem especially viable for streaming.

Similarly, the third season of Star Trek: Picard pulled its own attempt at The Rise of Skywalker, jettisoning its younger cast to replace them with the leads from Star Trek: The Next Generation. This move may have appeased older fans, but it seems to have coincided with a larger decline of the Star Trek franchise. While Star Trek: Discovery has spun off Strange New Worlds, a Section 31 movie, and an upcoming Starfleet Academy show, Picard has not gained traction on its proposed Legacy spinoff.

However, as projects aimed at the nostalgia of older viewers falter, there is plenty of evidence that projects that appeal to the nostalgia of younger viewers can succeed. These audiences turned out for Minions, John Wick: Chapter 4, or even Creed III because those franchises belong to them. With the failure of projects like The Flash and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the chickens are coming home to roost in the wake of The Rise of Skywalker.

2023-07-02 15:12:00+00:00,‘Indiana Jones’ & The Box Office Of Doom: Why ‘Dial Of Destiny’ At $60M Opening Isn’t Setting Records For Franchise Finale – Updated Box Office,'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' is looking at a box office opening weekend of $60 million to $65 million in the U.S.,"SUNDAY AM Writethru Final after Saturday AM Update: Even though Disney/Lucasfilm‘s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is looking to hit the bottom rung of its tracking projection of $60M Sunday morning, there’s no question this is a disastrous result for the finale to a historically beloved franchise film. C’mon, Indiana Jones is one of the reasons Disney shelled out $4 billion for Lucasfilm. Global start here at $130M, is $10M less than what we were seeing; Nancy will have more. The fan-loathed Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had a $272.1M global start, unadjusted for inflation/currency swings back in 2008.
A few things to stomach: Not only did 2018’s Star Wars spinoff bomb Solo open higher than Dial of Destiny, with $84.4M 3-day/$103M 4-day, but so did Paramount’s seventhquel Transformers: Rise of the Beasts ($61M) in May.
How could Disney and Lucasfilm mess this up?
On Saturday, I learned from a key source that Indiana Jones and the Dial Destiny, before $100M in estimated P&A, cost a mindboggling $300M-plus. Much higher than the $250M-$295M that’s been leaked out there. Disney doesn’t comment on budgets, and I’m getting some pushback. But the high price tag here is due to the start and stops of production during Covid; Harrison Ford‘s $20M fee; Steven Spielberg reaping a huge producing fee, which is standard; and I’m told director James Mangold got a pretty penny. All that said, it stands to reason that Disney would invest greatly here to revive a franchise; its spent $259M on The Force Awakens in 2015. The point is, for what the studio spent, it’s not getting anywhere near Star Wars box office results.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has been destined to live in a Temple of Box Office Doom since world premiering at Cannes to lackluster reviews. This resulted in landing like a wet towel on tracking three weeks ago, with projections not budgeting. This despite the fact that Dial of Destiny had a marketing and publicity global campaign louder than The Flash, with$90M in promotional partners and the cast doing several interviews.
It’s baffling that a storied franchise can end on a downer note at the box office in its finale. I found the movie out of Cannes to be too plug-and-play, laden in tropes of the franchise, from the kid sidekick to videogame-like action to it’s his goddaughter (not his dad) as his other sidekick. It completely lacked the breadth and nuance that Spielberg provided in action scenes of the older films. And I’m a James Mangold fan! He knows how to make a styled and dramatically charged movie just like Spielberg, whether it’s Ford v. Ferrari, Logan or Walk the Line.
I’m not too far off in my take on the film: CinemaScore audiences gave Dial of Destiny a B+, which isn’t that far from the previous unloved 2008 installment, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which landed a B.
So what the hell went wrong here with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny?
Lucasfilm is so precious and fastidious when it comes to developing Star Wars properties, and the legend with Indiana Jones is that these movies could never be made unless George Lucas and Spielberg (and Harrison Ford) saw eye-to-eye on the script. Remember all the TLC that J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kadsan took in hatching Force Awakens? There were stories of them walking down NYC streets, going back and forth on storylines. Given the black eye that Lucasfilm took from fans on The Last Jedi, The Rise of Skywalker and Solo, it is careful not to just rush and dump sequels nowadays (thus, the safety of building out the franchise on Disney+), which is why it’s taken them so long to bake the next Star Wars sequels. All of this makes the misfire with Dial of Destiny so concerning.

The biggest problem with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is that there were no efforts here to cast-it-up and make it appealing to an under-40, diverse crowd, like Paramount did with Top Gun: Maverick. Dial of Destiny was conceived for the hardcore Indy fans, which are dudes over 50. This is evident in the B- that Dial of Destiny received from 18-24 moviegoers. Disney reports that 42% of the audience was under 35 for Dial of Destiny.
I’m told from a few insiders that this movie did not have the behind-the-scenes calamity melodrama of such Lucasfilm titles as Rogue One (which had Tony Gilroy doing reshoots and rewrites on the Gareth Edwards-directed film) and Solo: A Star Wars Story (which had the ungracious firing of Lord & Miller and Ron Howard rescue), installments that required major surgery during production. No melodrama meaning everyone got along, with Mangold calling the production and Lucasfilm boss/Indy producer Kathleen Kennedy and producer Frank Marshall “family” at Cannes. Spielberg loved and signed off on the script by Mangold and his Ford v. Ferrari scribes, Jez and John Henry Butterworth, and that’s a challenging bar to clear.
On Saturday I heard that several editors were brought in to get this one right. It’s unfortunately apparent here that the sublime which Mangold delivered to the X-Men franchise with the R-rated Logan did not translate to Indiana Jones.
To date, Indy co-franchise architect Lucas has remained silent about his thoughts on Dial of Destiny.
I’ve gotten clarity on the whole thing about inflated test scores. While Disney typically uses a “friends and family” testing system so that no spoilers are leaked in advance, I’m now told Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny never tested. Take what you will from that.
Still, it’s so not like Disney to stick its head out there on a chopping block by launching so-so movies on a global stage when they’re not ready. The studio plots the marketing campaigns for their tentpoles like D-Day. Both of these planned tentpoles’ commercial potential went out the window the minute Disney took them to Cannes. Why did Elemental and Dial of Destiny go to the Croisette? To eventize them to overseas audiences, who aren’t as cynical as U.S. auds when it comes to sizing up a blockbuster. Plus, after Pixar was imprisoned on Disney+ during Covid, Disney had to show the world that family toon brand was truly back on the big screen. True, had both titles skipped Cannes, the Band-Aid would have been ripped off at some point in time. However, perhaps keeping the lid longer on these lukewarm movies and away from the press would have increased some box office revenue here on this crazy-expensive sequel.
But here’s the consistent problem Indiana Jones has had at the box office and with critics, and that is, he’s always been in competition with himself. Raiders of the Lost Ark really blew audiences away back in 1981, bringing new life to the old adventure serial movies. The pic grossed more than $212M in its initial release and had multiple reissues making its way to $248.1M. That’s been the gold standard against which all Indy sequels have been compared, and well, he generally comes up short. Read on.
Harrison Ford in ‘Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom’ Paramount/courtesy Everett Collection
I think to this day that Part 2, 1984’s Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, remains the best sequel; it’s as edgy as hell. C’mon, it has a villain who pulls hearts of people and makes human sacrifices! It’s a PG movie that prompted the MPA to create a PG-13 rating because it scared the heck out of kids. However, I’ll never forget back then in the whip-and-buggy days before Rotten Tomatoes that critics loathed the movie. Variety’s then-critic — and Deadline’s current — Todd McCarthy, slammed Temple of Doom, writing, “The pic comes on like a sledgehammer, and there’s even a taste of vulgarity and senseless excess not apparent in Raiders.” That sentiment played out at the box office, where Temple of Doom saw its final domestic gross of $179.1M off 15% from Raiders of the Lost Ark‘s first-run gross. Temple of Doom didn’t receive the rereleases at the box office like Raiders did, as it has its fans and nonfans. Spielberg and Lucas were able to please fans with the Sean Connery-fueled Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which landed an A CinemaScore in 1989 (during the exit-poll firm’s early days) and boost domestic box office by 10% to $197.1M.
‘Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull’ Paramount
So why did the critically not-loved Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (77% on RT, just like Temple of Doom), wind up being the franchise’s highest-grossing film, with a massive $100M-plus opening, and 3x leg-out to $317M stateside? Because it was coming off of Last Crusade, which was quite beloved, and there was an appetite from moviegoers to see the sequel because there hadn’t been an Indiana Jones film in close to two decades. But despite its blockbuster success in a vibrant, stadium-seating exhibition era, not many people liked Crystal Skull — hello, B CinemaScore. And that sequel, too, also doted and joked around about Indy going gray. Unlike 007, the same actor has always played Indiana Jones. The franchise’s legacy with Ford has prevented it from being rebooted with a new leading actor.
Which leads us to Dial of Destiny‘s blah results. Why so low? Because it’s coming off of a sequel not many loved, and it’s playing the same game of Indiana Jones getting older. Couple that with sour reviews coming out of Cannes, plus the finale’s older skewing audience (42% over 45) who are slow to come to cinemas, and here we are with a less-than-stellar box office result.
While Comscore/Screen Engine’s PostTrak exits show a 93% recommending Dial of Destiny (combined from the yes or probably recommend category) and 8% not recommending, dig further in morning’s report and you’ll find a more-telling stat about how no one is rushing to Dial of Destiny: Only 9% heard it was good from friends and family.
Paramount’s ‘Transformers: Rise of the Beasts’ (Everett Collection) Paramount
Here’s the box office surprise no one was expecting this summer: At an opening of $61M, Paramount’s long-in-the-tooth franchise sequel Transformers: Rise of the Beasts opened higher than high-gloss pics including Dial of Destiny and The Flash. The latter DC film counts a running total at end of Weekend 3 of $99.2M; that’s 19% behind the running total of Rise of the Beasts at the same point in time. OMG. Rise of the Beasts currently a running total of $136.1M at end of Weekend 4. Can Dial of Destiny even outgross Rise of the Beasts by the end of the summer? Who the hell knew we’d be having this conversation??
Dial of Destiny‘s problems, to a certain degree, aren’t that different from The Flash‘s: More than Ezra Miller’s lack of publicity on that DC film and tabloid dilemmas, that DC movie at the end of the day was a B CinemaScore film and way too long at 2 hours and 24 minutes. Dial of Destiny has a similar grade and is also too long at 2 hours and 34 minutes.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Harrison Ford were hoping to discover big bucks this weekend Disney
More diagnostics on Dial of Destiny:
PostTrak’s audience is 79% and four stars. The leading guy 25+ ticket buyers at 43% are giving it a 77% grade. That’s not good. Overall, men are giving a 74% grade on a 58% turnout.
Here’s what’s interesting: Even though just 10% came to see Phoebe Waller-Bridge as the female lead in the movie, women like Dial of Destiny better than men with a 85% grade. Women over 25, who showed up at 35%, give it an 86%.
The older Dial of Destiny‘s audience gets, the better the grades with the 45-55 sect (19% turnout) giving it 83% and the over-55 people (at 23%) giving it 89%.
Diversity demos weren’t that diverse with 54% Caucasian (79% grade), 18% Latino and Hispanic (80%), Black at 10% (73%) and Asian 13% (80%).
Dial of Destiny played best in the West, Mountain and Midwest, with PLF, Imax, Screen Box, D box driving 35% of the weekend. Broken down that’s 21% from PLF, 11% from Imax, 3% from combined 4D, D-box and Screen X. Disney’s El Capitan in Los Angeles is the top-grossing theater with $114K running cume through end of Friday.
All tickets sales for movies are at $125M off 34% from a year ago, per Comscore, which was led by Universal/Illumination’s Minions: The Rise of Gru with $140.6M over its holiday Friday-Tuesday (July 4th fell on a Monday). Indiana Jones is expected to be around $82M over its five days, around -40% less Minions take last year — who’da thunk?

Yikes, this movie is opened lower than Paws of Fury last summer. The results here make Strange World‘s 3-day of $12M look like a blockbuster. Just kidding. But seriously, we can’t take potshots at Pixar and ignore the fact here that a DreamWorks movie which cost $70M before P&A tanked. What’s the lesson here? Don’t make animated movies that have unknown protags in the title, and animation that looks like Strange World. Ruby Gillman‘s few moviegoers gave it a surprising A- CinemaScore, the same as last summer’s Paws of Fury. For the record, it’s higher than the B which Strange World got. PostTrak exits, which are always harder than CinemaScore, at 68% positive, however, kids under 12 said 91%. Moms leading, of course at 52% females, 64% between 18-34, biggest demo being 18-24 at 42%.

FRIDAY AFTERNOON UPDATE: Harrison Ford’s swan song as the man in the hat, the guy with the whip, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (read the review), is looking very similar to a pair of other older-leaning franchise pics aimed at guys, 2021’s No Time to Die and 2018’s Mission: Impossible – Fallout, with a Friday of $24M. That’s around the neighborhood of the first Friday of those two movies.
That means last night’s previews repped 30% of today’s gross. The $250M installment directed by James Mangold and produced by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas still is on track for a $60M-$65M 3-day and, rolling in Monday and July 4th Tuesday, should see around $85M for the 5-day. The Disney/Lucasfilm finale sequel is booked at 4,600 theaters.
Universal/DreamWorks Animation’s Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken (read the review) isn’t wowing as expected with a $2.5M Friday (including Thursday previews of $725K) and $6M Friday-Sunday take outside the top five.
We’ll have more as it comes. Here’s the chart:
1.) Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (Dis) 4,600 theaters, Fri $24M, 3-day $60M-$65M/Wk 1

UPDATED after EXCLUSIVE: Disney/Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny came in at $7.2 million in previews Thursday, per Disney. We heard last night that the pic was heading for $6 million-$7.5 million. That’s where previous older-skewing action-guy comps live.
RELATED: Harrison Ford: Deadline’s How They Reached The Top
We’re specifically referencing the Thursday night starts of No Time to Die, which grossed $6.3M (started at 4 p.m.) before its $55.2M opening weekend in October 2021, and Mission: Impossible – Fallout, which made $6M before its $61.2M weekend start in 2018. Dial of Destiny, which started previews at 3 p.m. Thursday, is expected to gross between $60M-$65M at 4,500 theaters, making is the second-highest stateside opening for the Steven Spielberg-George Lucas franchise after 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which posted a five-day opening of $151.9M, after a 3-day of $100.1M.
Crystal Skull didn’t have previews but opened fully on the Thursday before Memorial Day weekend with $25M at 4,260 theaters.
Dial of Destiny‘s Thursday night is below recent dude movies John Wick 4 ($8.9M, $74M 3-day) and Fast X ($7.5M, $67M).

Also previewing last night was Universal/DreamWorks Animation’s Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, with $725,000 from 2,700 theaters that started at 2 p.m. yesterday. No one is expecting this movie, which looks like it used the same animation style as Disney’s bomb Strange World, to do well, with an outlook in the single digits. Yes, original animation is hard to launch, but parents will see that 65% Rotten Tomatoes critics score and not waste their time. The pic’s Thursday is higher than the previews for Paramount’s toon misfire last July Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank, which did $505K from previews that started at 3 p.m.; that pic opened to $6.3M and finaled at $17.8M.

Why aren’t weekend projections for Dial of Destiny up to the same level as the previous chapter? It’s twofold: Part of that has to do with this Indy getting the worst reviews ever at 66% coming out of its Cannes Film Festival world premiere, but also, its audience is graying and on par with 007 franchise. You can’t say that Mission: Impossible is getting older just yet because a franchise-best start is expected for Dead Reckoning, with more than $100M over five days starting July 12. That sixth sequel should nab a Top Gun: Maverick halo effect.

Hopefully audiences are better on Dial of Destiny. Crystal Skull was slammed with a B CinemaScore after 1989’s Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with Sean Connery landed an A. Dial of Destiny is OK so far: 88% with Rotten Tomatoes audiences. Screen Engine/Comscore’s PostTrak shows 78% with general audiences and 3½ stars and a 59% definite recommend, while parents and kids under 12 are slightly better at 4 stars apiece and 82%. Turnout on Thursday night was 59% guys to 41% women.

What’s social media saying about Dial of Destiny? RelishMix reports: “Chatter on Indy 5 runs mixed-leaning-positive with fans who think ‘this will be a masterpiece, filled with heart-pounding action’ and that Ford as Indy will be missed as one the best heroes ever — along with adoration for John Williams’ historic contribution and career. Plus, there’s excitement for James Mangold at the helm as fans talk about their lives over the 39 years [of the] franchise and wish there had been more episodes. Hecklers are taking pot shots at everything from the story, throwback elements and cliché comments about sequels, but are nowhere as loud as lovers of the franchise.”

Social media universe for Dial of Destiny counts 296.4M across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube views “predominately on Lucas channels and cross-promoted on several Disney movie channels with brand tie-in spots which are also well integrated into the push,” says RelishMix. That figure is above Fallout‘s SMU of 234M but well below that of No Time to Die (692.5M), Top Gun: Maverick (401M) and Hobbs and Shaw (961.4M).
No Time to Die‘s Thursday previews repped 27% of its $23.3M first Friday, while Fallout‘s previews repped 26% of its $22.8M Friday. Indy here will, of course, have the extra legroom of the Monday and Tuesday in the extended holiday, though July 4th is always a downer day for moviegoing. No Time to Die, released in October 2021, drew 64% guys, 57% over 35, and Fallout pulled in 58% men, 41% of that demo over 25, and 17% under 25. Crystal Skull skewed 66% over 25 and with a third of its audience comprised of kids under 12 and parents.

Dial of Destiny will have the exhibition treasures of 400 Imax auditoriums, 900 PLF screens, 280 D-Box theaters and 85 Screen X hubs in its theater swath.
Logan filmmaker Mangold took over directing the finale from longtime franchise architect Spielberg. In this latest installment, Indy teams with his goddaughter (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) and is on the search for a device which, as Cher has always sung, “can turn back time.” If you thought Indy was old in Crystal Skull, he’s even older here, with the action taking place in 1969. That said, he’s still dealing with Nazis, one of them played by Mads Mikkelsen.
The rest of Thursday and this week:
Sony Animation’s Spider-Man: Across the Universe (read the review) wins the week with an estimated $30.6M at 3,785 in Week 4 after a Thursday of $2.38M, -16% from Wednesday and a running total of $328.3M.
Disney/Pixar’s Elemental (read the review) is second with a Week 2 of $30.4M, a Thursday of $2.4M and running total of $77.4M, 22% behind last summer’s Lightyear at the same point in time. The pic is booked at 4,035 theaters.
Sony’s No Hard Feelings (read the review) at 3,028 theaters ends Week 1 with a hearty $21.8M. While The Flash‘s second weekend edged out No Hard Feelings, $15.1M to $15M, Flash‘s second week ends with $21.8M as well after a $1.1M Thursday, -29% from Wednesday at 4,256 theaters. No Hard Feelings‘ Thursday was $1.37M, -13%.
Paramount’s Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (read the review) at 3,523 theaters did $1.2M Thursday, -12%, for a third week of $17.7M and a running total of $129.1M.

2023-06-29 18:06:00+00:00,Does Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Have a Post-Credits Scene?,A friendly PSA for everyone heading to theaters this weekend.,"The fifth Indiana Jones film was always supposed to chronicle Indy's final adventure. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a celebration of one of Harrison Ford's most popular roles—and a grand farewell to our favorite archeologist. More Indy? Who could say no?! After a visit from his old buddy's daughter (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), Indy is roped into another Nazi-punching adventure to save the world—and learn about another one of the universe's greatest mysteries.
With the film focusing on the search for Achimedes dial—a device with the power to travel through time—one may think that Indiana Jones would be entering the complicated world of multiverses. After all, another summer blockbuster, The Flash, just went into multiverse overdrive because of its bizarre time-travel plot. Thankfully, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a fitting end for the character—and one that avoids the need to shoehorn Marvel-level shenanigans into the film.
What we will tell you, however, is that there's no need to sit through the credits for a certain tip of the hat—one that points to another Indy film. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny does not have a post-credits scene. Good for them! When Disney said that this film is Indy's final outing, they really meant it. If the House of Mouse ever chooses to recast a young Indiana Jones for a new round of adventures, they can do that on their own time. Let's all just give the 80-year-old Ford a break before he has to saddle up again in 1923. In the meantime, the last Indiana Jones picture premieres in theaters tonight, June 29. Now go forth, intrepid adventurer—we'll let you discover how the film ends for yourself.

2023-07-02 07:00:35+00:00,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny review – Harrison Ford does the heavy lifting in lightweight sequel,The octogenarian star gives it his all in James Mangold’s fun but formulaic action adventure co-starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge and a scenery-sucking Mads Mikkelsen,"After scoring box-office bullseyes with Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Steven Spielberg blotted his Hollywood wunderkind copybook with 1941 (1979). A “comedy spectacular” set in the wake of the Pearl Harbor bombing (yes, really), 1941 cost nearly twice as much as Spielberg’s previous outing yet took less than a third of its box office. Chastised, the director teamed up with George Lucas on a project inspired by the serial cheapies of the 1930s and 40s. The result was the moderately priced Raiders of the Lost Ark, which promptly became the highest-grossing film of 1981, and which Spielberg later told me helped him get back to his crowd-pleasing roots.
Four decades and as many sequels/prequels later, the Indiana Jones franchise is still a money-spinner, although exponentially soaring budgets (this latest instalment cost close to $300m) have put paid to the original’s comparatively cheap and cheerful ethos. In its place we have a strange combination of cutting-edge, computer-enhanced nostalgia (Harrison Ford is digitally de-aged for flashbacks to second world war-era Europe) mixed with a string of old-but-new action set pieces involving big trains, small cars and nippy bikes – sequences that weirdly mirror this summer’s other massively expensive action franchise release, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. The difference is that while MI7 looks machine-tooled to keep you on the edge of your seat, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny just wants you to sit back and wallow in it.
With Spielberg no longer directing, it’s left to safe pair of hands James Mangold to crack the whip, with the help of his Le Mans 66 (AKA Ferrari v Ford) co-writers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth. Thankfully, Shia LaBeouf’s insufferable Mutt Williams, whom Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) had clumsily attempted to lineup as a successor to Dr Jones, is gone, his absence handily explaining why Indy finds himself alone again, naturally.
It’s the late 1960s, and the good doctor has become a bone-aching grouch, a live-action cinematic cousin of the old guy from Up. While Indy growls at retirement, the US co-opts former Nazi Jürgen Voller (a scenery-sucking Mads Mikkelsen) to aid Nasa’s moon landing efforts. But Voller has his sights on a bigger prize – the titular magical MacGuffin, which he last laid hands on back in 1944. Here, young(er) Indy and the oddball Prof Basil Shaw (Toby Jones, stealing every scene) do knockabout battle with Voller’s Nazi henchman for possession of Archimedes’s Antikythera mechanism; a two-piece contraption (crucially, you need both pieces) that can not only predict but perhaps control temporal anomalies… or something. Think Ark of the Covenant meets the Tardis. But smaller. And in two bits.
You’re invited to marvel at the scenic vistas and passably unremarkable popcorn adventures
Meanwhile, back in the 60s, Basil’s daughter Helena (a clearly delighted Phoebe Waller-Bridge) has her own monetary designs on the dial. Helena is Indy’s goddaughter, setting the stage for much lively quasi-familial bickering as everyone hotfoots it around the globe, racing to find the ancient artefact with mysterious powers that will change the course of blah, blah, blah…
According to the British Board of Film Classification’s splendidly straight-faced consumer advice, “those familiar with the series will not be surprised by the violence and the threat”, to which it might well have added: “Or indeed anything else.” There’s literally nothing here to frighten the horses or upset any applecarts, save for those knocked over during the crowded-street chase scenes. Even the preposterousness of the final act (not so much WTF? as OFFS!) seems par for the course in a series that started with Nazi faces being melted by scary angels and most recently had Dr Jones and co communing with space aliens through a multidimensional portal in the mythical city of Akator.
Instead, you’re invited to feel warm and fuzzy about reuniting with old friends (even those whose reappearance has proved divisive) and to marvel at the scenic vistas and passably unremarkable popcorn adventures, all played out to sturdy John Williams themes. Hats off to Ford, who continues a winning streak of later-life role reprisals (Han Solo, Rick Deckard), proving that whatever gruff genre appeal he possessed in his heyday has aged better than Indy’s knees. He may be 80, but Ford carries the weight of the film, which, for all its gargantuan expense, feels a bit like those throwaway serials that first inspired Lucas – fun while it lasts, but wholly forgettable on exit.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZmlsbS8yMDIzL2p1bC8wMi9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LXJldmlldy1oYXJyaXNvbi1mb3JkLXBob2ViZS13YWxsZXItYnJpZGdlLW1hZHMtbWlra2Vsc2VuLXRvYnktam9uZXPSAZYBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2ZpbG0vMjAyMy9qdWwvMDIvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1hbmQtdGhlLWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS1yZXZpZXctaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC1waG9lYmUtd2FsbGVyLWJyaWRnZS1tYWRzLW1pa2tlbHNlbi10b2J5LWpvbmVz?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Harrison Ford brought the legendary titular character Indiana Jones back to the big screen this weekend with “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” but its opening box office showing was lower than advance estimates.
The movie grossed $60 million in the United States and $70 million internationally, bringing the fifth and final installment of the storied franchise’s global box office to $130 million on its 3-day opening.
“Dial of Destiny” reportedly cost nearly $300 million to make, which makes the open weekend box office numbers underwhelming and a tall hurdle for the movie to clear in order to profit.
The movie did open at number one despite mediocre reviews for Indy’s final chapter, and is projected to earn $82 million in its 5-day opening through the July 4 holiday weekend.
“Dial of Destiny” also appears to have been better received by fans than the franchise’s fourth installment, “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” although that film still grossed $100 million during its 2008 opening weekend.

Ford, who first portrayed Jones in 1981’s “Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark,” told CNN’s Chris Wallace in a June interview that he wanted to give fans, and the character, an ending that felt conclusive.
“I wanted it to be character driven and I wanted it to confront the question of age straight on – not to hide my age, but to take advantage of it in the telling of the story,” Ford said, adding he felt “very strongly” that they achieved that goal.
As for saying goodbye to the character that he’s played for over 40 years? “It’s time for me to grow up,” he joked.
The opening is one of several disappointing showings for big-budget movies at the box office this summer, with Warner Bros.’ “The Flash” and Pixar’s animated “Elemental” both falling well short of expectations. (Warner Bros., like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.)
July will bring three more highly anticipated titles, including the latest “Mission: Impossible” sequel, “Barbie” and director Christopher Nolan’s fact-based “Oppenheimer,” starting with “Mission: Impossible” on July 12.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8wMi9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtNS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-04 18:00:00+00:00,Box Office: ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Only Cracking $82 Million Through Fourth of July,"Harrison Ford's finale in ""The Dial of Destiny"" is still on track for an $82 million opening over the five-day frame.","“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is staying in line with some tempered box office expectations, still tracking to fall in line with estimates that had pegged the film with an opening between $80 million and $85 million through the Fourth of July holiday.
The Harrison Ford finale earned $11.8 million on Monday, pushing its domestic total to $71 million. Unlike some other holidays, Independence Day isn’t exactly the largest box office booster — with families hitting the beach, barbecuing red meat and waiting for fireworks, filmgoing isn’t exactly at the top of the agenda for most Americans. Rather, it’s the time off around the Fourth that can offer some extra lift to studio tentpoles.
And “Indiana Jones 5” needs all the lift it can get. An $82 million gross through the first five days of release shouldn’t be shabby for a legacy sequel from a more-than-40-year-old franchise, but “Dial of Destiny” is one of the most expensive films ever produced by Disney and Lucasfilm. The finale carries a production budget of $295 million. Along with an underwhelming debut overseas and upcoming July releases like “Oppenheimer” and “Mission: Impossible 7” that also look to target older viewers, things aren’t looking bright for “Indiana Jones.” $295 million. Why’d it have to be $295 million?
Whether it turned out to be a hit or a flop, “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” was always billed as the final entry in the globe-trotting action series. Ford reprises his role as the whip-cracking archeologist, teaming up with his goddaughter (played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge) to protect a powerful artifact from the hands of Nazis during the Space Age. James Mangold helmed the feature, taking over after franchise director Steven Spielberg exited the project during development.
The remainder of the top five remained steady through the weekend. Along with the top slot, Disney also claimed third with the Pixar romance “Elemental.” The animated adventure added $3 million on Monday to push its domestic total to $92 million, inching closer to surpassing the $100 million mark. It’d be a cause for celebration if it weren’t for the film’s $200 million production budget.
“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” added $3 million on Monday. The Sony release has now earned $343 million in North America, honing in on surpassing “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” ($355 million) to become the second highest-grossing domestic release of the year.
Sony also took fourth place with the Jennifer Lawrence comedy “No Hard Feelings,” which added $1.89 million on Monday. Domestic total is at $31 million. Paramount’s “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” rounds out the top five with $1.7 million on Monday.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYm94LW9mZmljZS1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWRpYWwtZGVzdGlueS1mb3VydGgtb2YtanVseS0xMjM1NjYxMjQyL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYm94LW9mZmljZS1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWRpYWwtZGVzdGlueS1mb3VydGgtb2YtanVseS0xMjM1NjYxMjQyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-07 11:00:00+00:00,How Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny De-Aged Harrison Ford,Industrial Light & Magic developed a new suite of tools to reincarnate the Indy of the 80s. The effect is haunting—and raises more questions about the use of AI in Hollywood.,"Near the end of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Nazis attempt to pull off one of the oldest tropes in entertainment: using the movie’s titular dial, the Antikythera, to travel back to 1939 and assassinate Adolf Hitler. As their aircraft bears down on a time warp, the scientist Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), tells Indy of his plan to install himself as the führer and win the war. In his mind, history’s “greatest moment” is “it’s end.”
To enter the past, then, is to end history. It’s Voller’s motto, but also the movie’s—a nod to the de-aging technology that has made it possible. Thanks to several tools—machine learning, CGI, other tech—80-year-old Harrison Ford spends roughly 25 minutes of the film looking like the Indiana Jones of the early 1980s. He personifies the end of history brought about by technology’s endeavor to pull people out of time, to return Ford or Bruce Willis or Robert De Niro to their younger selves. Ford’s is also a face many fear: a visual representation of a future for Hollywood in which aging or deceased actors can be resuscitated via artificial intelligence. That’s the promise. But the message that comes through in Dial of Destiny, a film that seems intensely preoccupied with how it was made, is that there is something hauntingly sad about this vision.
The tech-reincarnated Indy of the 1980s makes a poignant contrast to the Indy we see for most of the film: a retired academic, stuck in a crusty apartment and estranged from Marion Ravenwood. Dial’s story, like the Jones movies before it, focuses on an ancient MacGuffin (the Antikythera) sought by both Indy and Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). She seeks to sell it for a pretty penny on the black market; he, of course, thinks it belongs in an American museum. Naturally, they form an uneasy alliance to stop Voller.
So how does de-aged Ford look? An odd mix of impressive and unreal, his face unhumanly smooth as if slathered with magic grease, glowing from within like a Stable Diffusion portrait that moves. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, who worked with Steven Spielberg on all of his Indy movies in the ’80s, recently told Empire that she hoped fans would see the movie and think someone had found footage from 40 years ago. This will probably not be the case—and not just because director James Mangold shot the film in 4K. Ford looks too perfect, his surroundings too clean. It looks like trickery, but of course you are looking for trickery.
The current discourse around AI and Hollywood would have you believe that a Disney executive fed Ford’s face into a copier and pressed a big “De-Age” button. New tech always provokes this reaction, explains Andrew Whitehurst, one of the VFX supervisors at Industrial Light & Magic who worked on Dial’s de-aging. “People assumed that we all sat down in front of a Silicon Graphics workstation in 1993, pressed D for ‘dinosaur,’ and Jurassic Park fell out of the back of the computer,” he says.
“From my perspective, there’s nothing that we can’t do. Given enough time and resources, we can accomplish anything.” ILM VFX supervisor Robert Weaver
Instead, ILM used a set of tools it calls FaceSwap. Like the the purpose-built tech ILM developed to let Martin Scorsese de-age actors for The Irishman, Dial of Destiny utilized a proprietary system called Flux that used two infrared cameras perched on either side of the one filming Ford to gather information from his performance. Unlike The Irishman, it also involved what the actor called “dots on my face” that captured even more data. All of that info was then combined to create a “CG mask” that could be placed on Indy in every frame.
To ensure Ford looked like his younger self, the ILM team used machine learning tools to scour years of footage of the actor that Lucasfilm had in its archives. The team also worked with VFX tools from Disney Research and a “smattering” of other sources to fine-tune the de-aged shots. “Each of these things is a pencil; now we have another pencil,” says Whitehurst. “So it’s just enabling us to make better choices.”
Most of the de-aged scenes take place on a train hurtling through the Bavarian countryside. Keeping the suitable “physical configuration of the face,” as ILM VFX supervisor Robert Weaver puts it, is a fiendish process involving a blue screen and hundreds of artists. Because the sequence begins at night and ends at dawn, Indy’s smirk might require a dash less shadow from one moment to the next, but that tweak could introduce a sheen that highlights new creases and makes the smirk read as a frown.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LWRlLWFnaW5nLXRlY2gv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Indiana Jones: Harrison Ford says he wanted 'emotional ending',The actor is playing the character for the final time in the fifth instalment of the franchise.,"Indiana Jones: Harrison Ford says he wanted 'emotional ending'
By Emma Jones BBC Talking Movies
Disney
Harrison Ford said he wanted the ageing of his character to be developed into a complex story
There's often speculation when an artist announces a ""last"" project that it won't be - which is why Harrison Ford is still being asked whether this really will be his last outing wearing the battered hat of legendary adventurer Indiana Jones.
But the actor is unequivocal in his reply to BBC News.
""It is my final film,"" he says. ""And I was always ambitious with this final film.""
It could be argued the movie, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the first for the franchise since 2008's Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, wasn't even necessary to conclude the series, since Ford is now 80 years old.
But the actor says he wanted to give this beloved character ""an emotional ending"" while acknowledging the passing of time.
""We've been making these films for 40 years, we can't deny the effect of age on the character, and I wanted to see that developed into a complex story,"" he says.
Disney
Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen plays the villain in the latest instalment of the franchise
The film makes a virtue of the character's age, showing the professor of archaeology complaining as he's performing action stunts with his god-daughter Helena, played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, as the pair chase an ancient dial that can alter the course of history.
The film is packed with in-jokes about the character as well as featuring Indiana Jones's greatest enemies, the Nazis, led in this film by Danish actor and former Bond villain Mads Mikkelsen.
But Ford insists he won't be tempted back: ""I was not so much interested in doing the same thing over and over again, I wanted to have an emotional ending to this character.
""And I'm so grateful for the audience that we've had, I just wanted to make sure that they would be satisfied and happy with the final iteration.""
That's not guaranteed - the film's world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival drew lukewarm reviews from critics. The BBC review at the time said that the film was ""a depressing reminder of how much livelier his past adventures were"".
It's also the first film in the series that's not directed by Steven Spielberg, although he remains an executive producer.

Harrison Ford received an honorary Palme d'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival in May
At one point, Dial of Destiny ranked at only 52% on American review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, although it's since risen.
But the nostalgia factor could still be a powerful lure for audiences. Those who remember the trilogy from the 1980s - Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade include Mikkelsen, who says: ""Anyone I know would have killed me if I turned it down.
""I watched it first when I was 15 years old. And it was a huge inspiration to me in terms of acting, but also to a lot of my colleagues, a lot of directors.""
Audiences can be reminded of Indiana Jones in all his glory in an extended flashback scene in this movie, played by the present-day Harrison Ford and altered by technology.
Ford explains that the images ""are just what I looked like 35 years ago. It's not disquieting, it's not Photoshop, because it's real images.""
Martin Scorsese's The Irishman also digitally altered Robert De Niro to take his character in the mafia film backwards and forwards in age, and as Dial of Destiny director James Mangold explains, the technology is continuing to advance.
""Steven Spielberg shot four Indiana Jones movies with Harrison, three of them were in the age that the opening sequence takes place in,"" he says.
Disney
Phoebe Waller-Bridge has played down the suggestion the franchise will continue with her character as the lead
So, he had a reservoir of Harrison's face, every expression, every lighting style. On top of that, Harrison is not a pound over the weight he was when he was 35 years old. So, the computer mapping of putting that young flesh, visage on him, is easy because the bones of the man haven't changed at all.
""And he's driving the performance. It's not just motion capture, it's a performance based on his acting, knowing he is playing himself much younger.""
Emmy-winning Fleabag actress and writer Waller-Bridge took on her first action role in the character of Helena, described by the Guardian's review as ""a naughty Enid Blyton heroine"".
She says Ford told her to ""act like you're hammered"" in a punching scene.
""It was a scene where I was going to be punched and I was very tense. And he came up and was like, 'just act like you're hammered.' It was that kind of mature advice I was given daily,"" she jokes.
""But the stunts alone were the time of my life. They're my happy place now, being thrown off things, or tripping over things, sometimes just being strung from a ceiling. It doesn't get old.""
Ford says that her action performance is ""terrific - I had no idea she would be so capable and so fearless"".
Disney
The film received mixed reviews from critics following its Cannes premiere
But Waller-Bridge has reportedly ruled herself out of succeeding Harrison Ford if its makers want to continue the franchise. Ford himself quipped to reporters at the US premiere that ""Jennifer Lopez would be fantastic"" when asked who should succeed him as Indiana Jones.
But the actor isn't retiring. He'll continue working in two series - the western 1923 with Helen Mirren and Shrinking, where he plays a curmudgeonly therapist.
Indiana Jones is now a closed chapter in his life, the actor reiterates, saying: ""I just feel a sense of completion.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LWFydHMtNjYwMDEwMzjSAThodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3MvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1hcnRzLTY2MDAxMDM4LmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-06-19 12:00:00+00:00,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Is a Fitting End for Indy,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a fitting end, and a couple more hours with a Hollywood icon. Nostalgia ﻿doesn't always work, but it does here.","It's been 15 years since we last saw Indiana Jones on screen, and just over 40 years since the Nazi-punching archeologist discovered that the Ark of the Covenant was real. That's a lot of time—enough to possibly forget that Indy has, over the course of four films before returning for Dial of Destiny, also proved the existence of Jesus Christ, the Holy Grail, mind-controlling blood magic, and ancient aliens. It's the perfect combination of James Bond and crackpot History Channel shows, with each new entry into the franchise sending the college professor barreling into another adventure as if he didn't just learn the secrets of the universe.
But Indy's complete indifference to these mind-altering revelations is also part of his everlasting charm. Though he possesses knowledge of every religious object and international fable throughout history, Indy is still someone who won't believe anything is real until he has it in his hands. He's the kind of guy who screams ""That belongs in a museum!"" way before he ever stops to consider just how a holy chalice brought his father back to life in The Last Crusade. Chalk it up to movie magic, but the success of such a lovable, unmoved rogue also rests largely on the shoulders of Harrison Ford.
Related Story Harrison Ford Has Stories to Tell
The 80-year-old actor has made a career of playing tough, smart-mouthed heroes. Han Solo stuck it to the Stormtroopers, Rick Deckard stuck it to the replicants, and Indiana Jones stuck it to the Nazis. So, as it was time to say goodbye in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Blade Runner 2049, it was only natural that the Hollywood great also received an official sendoff in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
Luckily for audiences, a grand farewell is all Dial of Destiny had in mind. While other franchises attempt to spend over two hours straddling the line between thanking the old guard while also ushering in the new, the fifth Indiana Jones film plays it straight. No multiverses, no teasing spinoffs, no one last last ride. This is it, and it's a fitting end. Back in The Crusade, Indiana Jones uttered one of the greatest lines in American action films: ""Nazis, I hate those guys."" That spirit lives on. The villains in Dial of Destiny? Nazis. The Nazi? Mads Mikkelsen. The punching? Right in his face.
Ford is right—it's the most impressive use of de-aging technology I've seen yet.
Director James Mangold (Logan) does his best to take over from the great Steven Spielberg, but it's a tough act to follow. Admittedly, some of that charm is lost in sequel exposition and familiar action sequences. Mangold is still forced to explain why certain characters aren't here anymore, why Indy is all alone, and why an 80-year-old man may have trouble performing the same unbelievable feats of his past. Thankfully, that's where digital de-aging comes into play, and it's surprisingly convincing. Ford is right—it's the most impressive use of de-aging technology I've seen yet.
But past the exciting train-fight flashback that opens the film, we spend most of Dial of Destiny dealing with the same problem that now threatens Indiana Jones: time. The ancient dial is said to hold the power to send someone back into the past—something the Nazis would naturally jump at the chance to acquire. As Mikkelsen's Dr. Vuller tells us, ""You didn't win the war, Hitler lost.""
But Indy can't do it himself—not as this age. So, we're introduced to Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Helena Shaw. Much like Shia LaBeouf in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, she's a next-gen adventurer related to another one of Indy's rolodex of archaeologist buddies who has gone crazy in pursuit of an ancient artifact. She wants the dial for her own personal purposes, but Indy just wants what he's always wanted. The dial belongs out of Nazi hands, and in a museum. So, he's forced into yet another international adventure to save the world. The two have great chemistry together, and Indy's lack of an I'm too old for this shit attitude once he gets moving is actually refreshingly on brand for his character.
The journey sends them on a mission to discover a life lesson that's quite simple. While other summer blockbusters such as The Flash shove so much content in your face that it makes the reward feel meaningless, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny does it right. Especially for a character who has studied history all their life, the message of this final Indy outing hits home with purpose. You can't erase your problems by changing the past, but you can always reminisce about the good.
That's called nostalgia, and it's dominated reboots and sequels in Hollywood for the past decade. It doesn't always work, but it's employed most fittingly in a film like Indiana Jones 5. We're saying goodbye to Indy, but it's no funeral. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny gives audiences the chance to spend a couple more hours having fun with Indiana Jones again. There's only a legacy to celebrate when the film his theaters on June 30, right alongside the Indiana Jones we know and love.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcXVpcmUuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbW92aWVzL2E0NDIyMjU2Mi9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LWlzLWEtZml0dGluZy1lbmQtZm9yLWluZHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"Harrison Ford Talks 'Indiana Jones,' Life at 80, Legendary Career: 'Never Thought I'd Be a Leading Man' (Exclusive)","'I never thought that I would be a leading man,' Harrison Ford tells PEOPLE in this week's cover story, as he prepares for the release of 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,' his final turn as Indiana Jones","When Harrison Ford picks up the fedora and whip for the last time in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, out June 30, he returns to a role that helped make him a legend.
But truth be told, Ford didn’t set out to be a Hollywood superstar. Or famous at all.
“I never thought that I would be a leading man,” he tells PEOPLE in this week’s cover story. “I really was just hoping I could make a living as an actor and not have to supplement my income with some other side hustle… I thought I would be lucky to have a character part on a regular TV show.”
Fate—and fans—had other plans, of course. Over an unparalleled five-decade career, the dry-witted Chicago native has carried films, including the epic Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises, that have grossed nearly $10 billion worldwide.
And Ford, who turns 81 in July, has lost none of his love of the game. “I probably enjoy making movies more now than I ever did,” he says.
He acknowledges age takes its toll—he’s still recovering from tearing a shoulder muscle on the second day of shooting Indiana Jones—but he has no interest in turning back the clock. “I don’t want to be young again,” says Ford, who has been married to actress Calista Flockhart, 58, since 2010 and is a father of five. “I was young, and now I enjoy being old.”

He adds: “You are certainly physically diminished by age but there are wonderful things about age—richness of experience, the full weight of all the time you’ve been spending getting to being old— and there’s a certain ease in it for me.”
Not one to be nostalgic or flashy, Ford has long preferred to keep his head down, and just get to work. “No one ever believes this, but I never wanted to be rich and famous,” he says. “I just wanted to be an actor.”

These days Ford is busier than ever. He leapt into TV this year with two hit shows: Shrinking, on Apple TV+, and the Yellowstone prequel 1923 on Paramount+. He recently wrapped his first entry into the Marvel universe, Captain America: Brave New World: “I saw a lot of great actors having fun,” he says, “so I thought, ‘Hey, I want some of this!’”
But perhaps his most sentimental turn—at least for fans—is the reprisal of the swashbuckling Indiana Jones. “I wanted to see him rally for one last adventure,” he says.
At the film’s world premiere at Cannes, where Ford was honored with a Palme d’Or for lifetime achievement and received a rapturous reception, he did pause to take in the affection.
“I was just trying to keep myself composed,” he says. “There was very generous applause from the crowd [and] it was positive and humbling and nice.”
For that moment, and for all the support he’s received from fans over his still-thriving career, Ford is thankful. He says: “I am very gratified that I still have the opportunities that I have to work, and I owe that to the audience.”

2023-05-31 14:20:20+00:00,Harrison Ford Told ‘Indiana Jones 5’ Stunt Guys to ‘Leave Me the F— Alone’ While on Horseback: ‘I’m an Old Man’ and ‘Want to Look Like It’,"Harrison Ford wanted Indiana Jones to look and feel like an old man in ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.""","For Harrison Ford, the allure of reprising Indiana Jones for a fifth time in the upcoming “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” was all about time. Ford will celebrate his 81st birthday in July, just a few weeks after “Dial of Destiny” opens in theaters, which is not the typical age of your 2023 Hollywood action hero. That was a selling point for Ford, who told Esquire magazine that he ensured Indiana Jones looked and felt like an old man in “Dial of Destiny.”
“I wanted an ambitious movie to be the last one,” Ford said about reprising Indiana Jones. “And I don’t mean that we didn’t make ambitious movies before — they were ambitious in many different ways. But not necessarily as ambitious with the character as I wanted the last one to be.”
One of the action set pieces in “Dial of Destiny” finds Indiana Jones riding a horse through the streets of New York City during the 1969 ticker-tape parade to celebrate the moon landing. As he was finishing up filming the scene, Ford felt the hands of three stunt workers spotting him from the ground as he was on horseback.
“I thought, ‘What the fuck?’ Like I was being attacked by gropers. I look down and there’s three stunt guys there making sure I didn’t fall off the stirrup,” Ford recalled. “They said, ‘Oh, we were just afraid because we thought, you know, and bah bah bah bah.’ And I said, ‘Leave me the fuck alone…Leave me alone, I’m an old man getting off a horse and I want it to look like that!”’
For similar reasons, Ford made the decision to go shirtless during one of the early scenes “Dial of Destiny.” He said, “Waking up in my underwear with the empty glass in my hand was my idea.”
Ford’s age did show itself at times during the making of “Dial of Destiny,” such as when he pulled the subscapularis muscle off his right shoulder during a fight scene with co-star Mads Mikkelsen. The film’s production shut down for two weeks. When it resumed, Ford had to sit out an additional six weeks.
“Yeah, well, I’m also known for shutting movies down because I get hurt, which is not something you want to be known for,” Ford said. “But hey, shit happens.”
At nearly 81 years old, Ford isn’t slowing down. He’s been spending time in Atlanta filming “Captain America: New World Order,” his first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Is it fun making a Marvel movie? “Uh,” he said. “Yeah. I mean, there are tough days and easy days and fun days and all kinds of days. It’s a tough schedule and, yeah, it’s fun. But it’s not a walk in the park. It’s not fun fun. It’s work.”

,Harrison Ford Hugs Ke Huy Quan at 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' Premiere,Harrison Ford and Ke Huy Quan hugged at the Los Angeles premiere of 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' nearly 40 years after they costarred together in 1984's 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom',"Harrison Ford and Ke Huy Quan still make the perfect pair.
At the Los Angeles premiere of Ford's new film Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Wednesday, the actor, 80, and recent Oscar winner Quan, 51, took a moment to pose for a photo together.
The Everything Everywhere All at Once actor wrapped both his arms around Ford, who beamed as he held his arm around Quan's shoulder on the red carpet. Quan crashed Ford's interview with Extra on Wednesday, gleefully greeting the star as Ford quipped: ""You're all grown up!""
“I don’t need to be proud of this guy,"" Ford told the outlet when asked how he feels about Quan's success. ""He’s done all of this himself. It has nothing to do with me. I have great love and admiration for this guy, but his pride is his own.”
“You’re making me get very emotional Harrison. I love you so much,"" Quan said during the exchange. ""Of course, the reason why I love acting so much is because of him, because I had such a wonderful, wonderful experience on Temple of Doom.""

""I'm so happy for him, I can't tell ya. He's a wonderful person and an incredibly talented actor,"" Ford said of Quan after they parted ways.
The pair's semi-frequent reunions over the last year — Quan costarred with Ford as he made his film debut in 1984's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom — have come during Quan's career resurgence for his part in the 2022 multiverse movie Everything Everywhere All at Once, for which won he won an Oscar as the film won seven total awards at the 95th Academy Awards in March.
Ford presented Everything Everywhere's cast, director and producers with the Best Picture Oscar at the ceremony and embraced Quan as he arrived onstage to celebrate at the time, with the younger actor excitedly jumping up and down before he appeared to kiss Ford on the cheek.

Following the pair's hug at the Oscars, a side-by-side image of their onstage moment and a film still of Ford hugging a then-child Quan, who played Short Round in Temple of Doom, went viral on social media.
Ford and Quan first displayed their now signature hug when they reunited for the first time in more than three decades at Disney's D23 Expo back in September, where Quan bumped into Ford and shard a picture of the two on Instagram.
He later explained to The New York Times that he initially felt nervous that Ford would not recognize him so many years after they worked together, but the veteran star immediately recognized him.

""I go, 'Oh my gosh, he probably thinks I'm a fan and he's gonna tell me to not come near him.' But he looks and points at me and says, 'Are you Short Round?' Immediately, I was transported back to 1984, when I was a little kid, and I said, 'Yes, Indy.' And he said, 'Come here,' and gave me a big hug,"" Quan told the outlet.
""He's an amazing man — one of the most generous men on the planet,"" he added of Ford.
Close to 40 years after Quan and Ford first met on Temple of Doom, Ford is closing the door on his time as Indiana Jones with the franchise's latest movie, which had its world premiere at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival in May.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is in theaters June 30.

2023-07-10 00:59:50+00:00,‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’: VFX Team on Creating a Young Harrison Ford and How Mads Mikkelsen’s Villain Survived That Train Fall,‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ visual effects team on creating a young Harrison Ford and those actions scenes.,"Lucasfilm’s Industrial Light & Magic, which won Oscars for the visual effects in Steven Spielberg’s Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark and Temple of Doom, returned to use every trick in the book on the whopping 2,350 VFX shots in the fifth installment of the franchise.
In the opening action sequence of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, a young Harrison Ford appears in a 1944-set flashback highlighted by an action scene atop of moving train. Then we meet the elder Indy in 1969 for his next adventure, which includes a tuk-tuk chase in Morocco and — using the titular dial to time travel — a climax set during the epic siege of Syracuse.
The Hollywood Reporter spoke with production VFX supervisor Andrew Whitehurst and ILM VFX supervisor Robert Weaver about their work on the movie — the first in the franchise to be helmed by James Mangold (Logan, Ford v Ferrari). “The conversation never stops,” Whitehurst says of working with Mangold. “He is so engaged, and he just wants everything to be as good as it can possibly be.”
It goes without saying, a lot of attention has been placed on the young Harrison Ford, who appears during the movie’s opening scene. How’d you do it?
ANDREW WHITEHURST It’s called ILM Face Swap; it’s using an enormous number of techniques.
ROBERT WEAVER Face swap essentially is replacing the face with another face, whether it’s a younger version or somebody entirely different. In this case, it was the younger version. And as Andrew was saying, we utilized every trick in the book as far as what it would take to get each individual shot to the level that it needed to be. It employed using machine learning; it employed building a full CG asset to highly critical detail. This work doesn’t lend itself well to having a very consistent recipe; it’s completely dynamic to the individual shot. So there were times that we were leaning more on the CG asset, and there were times that we would be getting a bit more out of the machine learning passes.
WHITEHURST The one continuous element throughout all of this is having really great artists with really great eyes making those choices with Robert and me. And we had an enormous amount of reference material from earlier Indy films, which we got scanned, and we could use that and we could frame through that and understand what exactly the likeness was that we were trying to hit. And it’s building it up. We would initially do a low-resolution pass that we could give to the edit. So they were always cutting with an age-appropriate Indiana Jones, even if it was not a final quality, so that they could judge the performance in the cut and understand how that was working. And that meant we then got better notes back.
It’s building it up, and it’s using a huge variety of techniques, but it’s all down to artists looking at stuff, talking to us, really getting their heads around what the character is, looking at the performance that Harrison gave that’s driving all of this underneath, and then working and polishing that to get to the finished result.
WEAVER There were times we would rely on key frame [hand] animation.
WHITEHURST [In other instances,] we can shoot with multiple cameras at a performance, we can extract the 3D performance from that, and then we can use that to be mapped onto a different 3D face but maintaining that same performance.
So that was based on techniques used on The Irishman?
WEAVER That one component, yes, but the technology was better and the artists have learned more [since The Irishman was made]. All of these other components are equally as useful, or in some shots, more useful.
And then you mentioned machine learning. Obviously between the Indiana Jones movies and the Star Wars movies and everything he’s done, there’s a huge body of Harrison’s work on film. How much of that material did you use to teach the computer some of those more minute mannerisms?
WEAVER It was incredibly instrumental for the machine learning process to have that repository of imagery, for sure. But as Andrew also alluded to earlier, the artists are really the key component here. In addition to the machine learning, we also had a program that we call Face Finder that would, frame by frame, find a similar pose from that repository that artists could then reflect back on and see what in actuality it looked like in the past, and then draw comparisons and know in a very instructive way where we needed to do a bit more work to get what we needed.
WHITEHURST That’s one of the key things for me, when I was looking at the work coming in, is that ability to have a frame-by-frame reference to compare and go, “OK, well actually, you know, when he does this smirk around his cheek, there’s this little crease that always comes in. Maybe we just need to enhance that a little bit.” Getting a performance is a very holistic thing. It’s not just a physical, sculptural quality. It’s a lot of everything.
How did machine learning contribute?
WEAVER There are absolutely components to it that we rely on. Definitely. And that’s part of the evolution of us doing more successful digital human performance. [To teach the computer,] we primarily relied on the older Indy films and that target age. But we also captured present day.
WHITEHURST Yes, exactly. We shot a lot of reference material, as well as the actual shots from the film we were making. We went and deliberately set up the cameras and got Harrison to perform as he is now. We learn, the computer learns, but I think it’s also worth saying that even within feeding the footage, you need to be careful and select your footage, because some footage might skew results in a way that actually isn’t helpful for a particular shot. So there’s a lot of kind of skill and judgment in terms of selecting what you are going to use as reference.
WEAVER Exactly, that curation process that Andrew was just talking about was incredibly important. Artists would make determinations as to what is helpful.
For his body in this flashback, what was a new Harrison Ford performance? A body double? What was the combination of these things?
WHITEHURST Whenever possible, it’s Harrison. There were times where, for either shoot timing issues or because it was a more of a stunt type scenario, we had to use a stunt performer. So the body there would be the stunt performer. And there’s a couple of times where it’s a digi body, but it’s mostly newly shot Harrison.
Tell us about filming that train sequence.
WHITEHURST Everything involving actors was shot on a stage. We did go to the Austrian Alps and shot a load of material that we were able to use for some of the backgrounds, and we did a lot of scanning of that kind of that environment. We were then able to do a fully CG environment, because the nature of the narrative for that sequence meant that we had very specific requirements for the environment in different places. An awful lot of it ended up being fully CG-generated because there is no place that was going to give us what we needed.
[When filming the actors onstage,] we used bluescreen [instead of virtual production] mostly just for speed of getting through shots, and also we needed the flexibility in post to be able to change the background because we were still slightly adjusting exactly what the backgrounds were going to look like when we were shooting. We knew what the overall background would be, but in terms of, well, “We need more trees here, or fewer trees here,” or the sky, you know, dawn is, is happening over the whole sequence. And that timing is extremely difficult to do upfront. We start in pitch black, we end up post-dawn on a cloudy day.
How did Mads Mikkelson’s villain survive his fall from the train?
WHITEHURST This was a long conversation, with a lot of iterations. The thing that he gets hit by is a very lightweight hose that they use for putting water into steam trains, which itself can rotate. So he’s being hit by as soft a thing as you can be hit by that’s going to be hanging by a railway line in 1944. But, yes, it should be a little bit of a surprise when he shows up again later.
WEAVER It boils down to him being a very tough bugger. (Chuckles.)
WHITEHURST The one thing I will say is that when Mads does get knocked off the train, he did that. We put some crash mats there, and Mads Mikkelson knows how to take a punch and how to look like he’s been hit by something heavy. We had to make him travel back further because the train was moving at speed, and obviously we weren’t doing that on the stage. But in terms of the physicality of the performance, he did that.
Tell us about creating the tuk-tuk chase.
WHITEHURST We had a whole amazing second unit crew directed by Dan Bradley who went out to Fez [Morocco], which was where we were actually filming. This was a sequence that we had prevised and boarded. Because there’s a lot of dialogue that happens in the scene, we knew there was going to be process work back at Pinewood with our principals. And we needed to know how we were going to stitch that into location-based stunt material, also how we were going to acquire the materials to put in the backgrounds of the process work. So the previs and boarding was essential. That whole process was based on visits to the location and understanding that environment and what could be done there.
They just went and filmed some really amazing stunts, and we were able to shoot multicamera backgrounds, plus scanning everywhere. And so we were then able to build either fully digital versions of backgrounds or projected photography onto digital assets to create the backgrounds for the process work that we shot back at Pinewood.
There were a couple of stunts that we did at Pinewood just because there was no way of being able to get them on location for various reasons. Usually safety, or just the streets — they are super cramped — so you are limited into where you can put a camera, what kind of camera you can put in there.
Would you describe how you did the underwater dive sequence?
WHITEHURST We used every technique, including actually filming things in the Mediterranean. We shot in tanks at Pinewood. We did some dry-for-wet work, particularly close-ups, because it’s so performance critical. And then there’s a lot of full CG work and CG enhancement work on top of that. We were able to storyboard and previs the whole sequence upfront, which meant we could take a look at each shot and go, “Well, this shot should be full CG. This shot we think we can get on location, this shot we can get in a tank.” And we were able to divide and conquer using that approach.
There are a couple of fully CG shots in there, particularly wide establishing shots where we just couldn’t get the location to look right or that matched our requirements and the tank at Pinewood is just not big enough for doing that kind of work. The art department was able to build us some sections of a wreck, but because of the safety requirements for working underwater, it means that people have to be able to get in and out very quickly and safely. So there was a lot of enhancement work that we needed to do to really make it feel like an enclosed and threatening environment. And then of course, there’s the eels on top of that.
The close-ups were all dry-for-wet, and we were using stunt performers in the Pinewood tank.
Tell us about re-creating the siege of Syracuse.
WHITEHURST Because we had the scene earlier on of 1969 New York, we sort of set our world up as being a real place. And then we extended that and we needed ancient Syracuse to be the 213-214 B.C. equivalent. It had to feel like a real, lived in city. And that’s a huge amount of work.
WEAVER It was a massive build — building ancient Syracuse and being accurate to the time period. You could have taken the [virtual] camera at any point and flown down into the city and through the streets. All the props sitting on wagons would all be appropriate for 200 B.C. And that of course involved building the various boats and the ocean and the buildings that would have to get destroyed at various points in time and building all the tools that Archimedes employed to fight the Romans back in the day. It was quite an endeavor, but it was very rewarding.

,Phoebe Waller-Bridge on punching Indiana Jones in 'Dial of Destiny',"Phoebe Waller-Bridge gets to punch Indiana jones in 'Dial of Destiny,' and she says it's a 'glorious' moment.","Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny character, Helena, gets to kick a lot of ass... including the one belonging to Indiana Jones.
In a very shocking — albeit hilarious — moment in the upcoming film (in theaters Friday), Helena punches her godfather, Indy (Harrison Ford), so hard in the face that she knocks him out, a moment which Waller-Bridge calls ""glorious.""
""It's such a brilliant cut, and it's such an excellently scripted moment. And particularly because there's so much fighting and left hooks and all that stuff all the way through the film, when she's just fighting the bad guys,"" Waller-Bridge tells EW. ""But to have to level a punch to the hero of the film... It was glorious, because it was so funny.""
The British star laughs when EW tells her that at both screenings we've attended, audiences loudly cheered at that moment. This makes Waller-Bridge laugh, but she hopes viewers understand her character's decision in the moment. ""Underneath, it really had heart and emotion. And that's really a testament to Jim [Mangold, director] and the Butterworths [Jez and John-Henry] for writing a moment like that. I hope the audience understands why she does it.""

In the film — which also stars Mads Mikkelsen, Antonio Banderas, Toby Jones, John Rhys-Davies, Karen Allen, and more — Helena and Indy are reunited in a race against time to get the mythical Dial of Destiny, which can reportedly change the course of history, before a nefarious Nazi, Voller (Mikkelsen).
It's the fifth film in the beloved franchise about the daredevil archaeologist, and like all of its predecessors, it features wild action sequences, which means Waller-Bridge got to do a lot more than just punch the film's hero.
""I managed to do quite a lot of the landing and jumping off bits, but none of the actual real, proper dangerous stunts. But I got to drive a tuk-tuk!"" she says excitedly, before adding, ""I did crash it... which wasn't meant to happen.""
Waller-Bridge continues, ""I got to jump out of a plane. And I got to jump into water, and roll out from under things, and jump over things. So there was a lot to do, and I was completely covered in bruises. Each one was a mark of honor for the day.""

2023-07-01 15:00:00+00:00,Harrison Ford Is Too Old for This Shit,‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ proves that the 80-year-old film icon has gotten too old for this shit — and there’s nothing wrong with that!,"About an hour into Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the world’s most active archeologist, a little less active of late, is reunited with a friendly face from his past. Dr. Jones, played by Harrison Ford in what he insists will be his final turn in the fedora, is on the run and headed overseas in search of a rare, allegedly supernatural artifact. You know, typical Indiana Jones shit. Can the professor count on a one-time partner in temple-plundering? Are the Raiders boys back together? Afraid not. That old friend is now too old for such mischief; at this late stage in life, he’d rather leave the heroics to the kids. The reunion is short-lived, a quick and bittersweet hit of nostalgia.
Indy, of course, soldiers on. The Nazis are back, you see — a predicament that should sound familiar to any fan of this franchise, not to mention anyone current on the state of American politics. Jones has to saddle up again, aching joints be damned, to take them down. But should he? Watching Ford, now officially an octogenarian, amble back into some semblance of action, you have to wonder if that old friend had the right idea. Let someone else save the world! Indy needs a drink. Lord knows he’s earned one.
Even those with an undying affection for Steven Spielberg’s whip-cracking academic, star of four previous exercises in globe-trotting precarity, might grant that this one last adventure could be one adventure too many. Ford was already out of his running-and-jumping prime in the last sequel, 2008’s widely maligned Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Fifteen years later, director James Mangold, taking over for Spielberg, has no choice but to build the whole movie around an acknowledgement that Indiana Jones is, to paraphrase another Eighties action hero, too old for this shit.
Indy is the last iconic role left for Ford to reprise during this chapter of his career. (At least if one assumes that he won’t be going on the lam as an elderly Dr. Richard Kimble or giving us a grizzled Jack Ryan.) His legacy tour included previous stops in a galaxy far, far away and the cyberpunk future. There was something rather affecting about his performances in those movies. Maybe it was the surprise of seeing the star, often so crotchety in public persona (he’s been playing the part of a grumpy old man since he was a grumpy young man), warmly pass the torch. Ford brought a relaxed gravitas to The Force Awakens and Blade Runner 2049, playing mentor to a younger generation of heroes — which may be why Dial of Destiny follows suit, pairing him with Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s wisecracking goddaughter. Editor’s picks
So why was it poignant to see the actor suit up again for those late sequels and a little sadder somehow to see him do the same here? It could be that Ford, at 80, is simply pushing the limits of his credibility as an action hero in a way he wasn’t five or seven years ago. (No shame there; it happens to every Hollywood cowboy eventually.) But the difference arguably has more to do with the nature of Indiana Jones as a character. For all their occasional fisticuffs and gun fights, neither Han Solo nor Rick Deckard are quite as deeply defined by pure physical activity — the veritable Olympics of environmental obstacles Indy made a career out of vaulting.
To even call Jones a character, in the traditional sense, is arguably misleading. Spielberg and George Lucas conceived of him more as a body in perpetual motion — the adventure-serial spirit incarnate, the human equivalent of a cliffhanger. So much of the fun of the Indiana Jones movies, so much of their excitement and humor, lies in seeing Jones constantly dumped out of the frying pan and into the fire. His ideals are wrapped up in the sheer lengths he’s willing to go to realize them: the boulder he’ll outrun, the punches he’ll lean into, the speeding truck he’ll scramble over and under.

Ford simply can’t credibly perform those kinds of feats anymore, even with stunt doubles on hand to fortify the illusion. It would be strange if he could at his age! For better or worse, Dial of Destiny embraces this reality instead of trying to disguise it. The adventure commences with a shot of the professor shirtless in his apartment — a stark, vanity-free acknowledgement of how Ford’s physique has changed over the years. Jones, when we catch up with him in the late 1960s, is on the cusp of retirement from academia, a subplot that emphasizes the valedictory nature of the larger story. Ford, during the press cycle, underscored that part of the reason he agreed to do Dial was that it promised to not only accept his age but also make it central to the dramatic arc of the movie and its vision of Jones. Should we have expected anything less than an Old Man Indy movie from the director of Logan?
Yet Mangold is boxed in by Ford’s normal, natural limitations as a movie star of a certain age. They necessitate a different kind of Indiana Jones vehicle, pokier and less kinetic. While Spielberg moved fluidly from set piece to set piece, defining Indy largely through action (even Crystal Skull has a rollercoaster momentum), Dial of Destiny often struggles to meet even the most generous fan’s expected quota of derring-do. One of the only sustained bursts of action, a tuk tuk pursuit through the streets of Tangier, seems blocked and shot to minimize Ford’s exertion; we’re a long way from the famed truck chase of Raiders of the Lost Ark. It’s telling that the closest Dial can come to a vintage Indy sequence is the cold open, a flashback that features Ford’s digitally deaged mug pasted, by all appearances, on the body of someone capable of moving like he could 40 years ago.

If there’s anything resonant about this creaky approximation of a classic Indiana Jones adventure, it’s the way it serves as a sobering reminder that everyone gets old. If it can happen to a towering paragon of Hollywood masculinity, to a hero of our collective dreams, it can (and will) happen to you, too. Dial of Destiny is after something much different than what the new Mission: Impossible movie will offer in a few weeks: It lays bare the diminished mobility — and by extension, the mortality — of an aging action star, rather than stubbornly defying it. It’s a summer blockbuster about how history leaves even its legends behind as they shuffle toward oblivion.
Whether anyone wants that out of an Indiana Jones movie is another question. This series once stood outside of time — a reliable source of old-fashioned entertainment, bridging the blockbuster era of the 1980s to an earlier age of propulsive spectacle. Through the enduring involvement of its star, now past the point where his age can go unaddressed, it’s become something impossibly freighted by time’s passage: a meditation on getting older. Ford brings about as much dignity as he can to a character it would have been more dignified to leave offscreen, unblemished by the harsh reality of what he can no longer do. Behind the actor’s weathered star power, you can see the image of a Hollywood machine that refuses to ever let anything go, or to let any beloved character ride permanently into the sunset.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yb2xsaW5nc3RvbmUuY29tL3R2LW1vdmllcy90di1tb3ZpZS1mZWF0dXJlcy9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LWhhcnJpc29uLWZvcmQtdG9vLW9sZC1mb3ItdGhpcy1zaGl0LTEyMzQ3Nzk4MjMv0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vdHYtbW92aWVzL3R2LW1vdmllLWZlYXR1cmVzL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnktaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC10b28tb2xkLWZvci10aGlzLXNoaXQtMTIzNDc3OTgyMy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Inside the VFX of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Andrew Whitehurst of ILM discusses the techniques used to create the memorable effects of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.,"Spoiler warning: This article discusses story details and plot points of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
“I’ve been looking for this all my life,” says our adventuring archaeologist in the trailer for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. But that sentiment could have also come from Industrial Light & Magic’s Andrew Whitehurst, longtime visual effects supervisor, about what the opportunity to work on the film represented.
“I have the joy-of-going-to-the movies side of loving Indiana Jones, which was that it was this ultra-exciting adventure serial,” he tells Lucasfilm.com. “Everything seemed plausible and tangible and real-world, but then with this supernatural edge to it. The characters were so engaging and there never seemed to be anything cynical about it. The peril is absolutely in earnest and the jokes are absolutely in earnest. Even as a kid, I loved that. And from the visual effects side of it, in the ‘80s there was a BBC science series called Horizon. Every week they would do an episode on a different subject, and one week they did visual effects, which I knew nothing about. I was nine years old, and it was mainly focused around the making of Temple of Doom. And so I had my mind blown for an hour where I learned that you could make movies with models and paintings and animation. That was my literal introduction to what visual effects is. To see that and, you know, 40 years later I’m supervising the fifth one, it’s kind of crazy. So, the visual effects of Indiana Jones is a really key component in me doing what I do for a living now.”
The adventure begins
As production visual effects supervisor on Dial of Destiny, Whitehurst would oversee the work of ILM and all vendors for a time and world-jumping adventure, which follows Indy from WWII-era Europe to 1969 New York and Morocco to ancient Sicily. Even for someone with Skyfall, Ex Machina, and Annihilation on his resume, it was a lot. “The trickiest thing about a movie like this is that it’s an odyssey,” he says. “Almost every single scene is in a different location or has a different component to it. So you have to break up the project into all of the various places that we are and things that happen within those places.” Whitehurst worked closely with production designer Adam Stockhausen in figuring out the look of the various effects sequences in the movie, with input from director James Mangold throughout the process.
Over time, Whitehurst has developed his own method for realizing sequences in a way that welcomes in his collaborators. “My background is in fine arts, so I tend to draw and paint a lot for two reasons. One, for me to start to get my own head around how things might look or the things that are going to be tricky. And also, then, to communicate ‘How about doing things this way?’ to Jim or Adam or, Phedon Papamichael the DP, or Mike McCusker the editor, and so that they’ve got something concrete in front of them as a drawing or as a really rough, sketchy animatic or a painting or something. They go, ‘Well, I like this. I don’t like that. What about doing this?’ I tried to get things going visually as early as possible, often in quite a rough, loose way.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1Y2FzZmlsbS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZHJldy13aGl0ZWh1cnN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-30 15:15:37+00:00,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Is a Dud,"It might as well have been titled ""Indiana Jones and the Quest for Cash.""","Quick: Name your favorite bit from an Indiana Jones film. I mean ""bit"" expansively—it could be a quip, an extended action sequence, a scene of tension or tenderness, a shocking effect, a moment of playfully mischievous charm. One could say that the series, at its best, is marked by a profusion of these moments, but perhaps even more important is that the series is marked by them even at its worst.
Raiders of the Lost Ark, which kicked off the franchise in 1981, is a masterpiece of popular filmmaking, in which every single scene, shot, and line works individually, and somehow they all work even better together. Raiders created a magic movie alchemy that still maintains an outsize influence on blockbuster movies more than 40 years later.
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, the second film in the series, is far worse than its practically perfect predecessor: It's both too silly and too grotesque, too mean-spirited and too enamored with its own elaborate action-movie cleverness. But it also boasts a slew of ideas and images that you can instantly recall: the antic diamond scramble in the nightclub that kicks off the movie, the gross-out meal at the palace, the mine-cart chase, the shocking, gory, ritual heart removal scene.
The same can even be said for the franchise's much-derided, late-breaking fourth entry, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which contains a handful of crackerjack, high-hijinks action sequences and a delightfully ridiculous performance from Cate Blanchett, as the Natasha-esque villain. You may not care for the movie, or remember all the specifics, but you still know what it means to ""nuke the fridge.""
All four of these films, of course, were directed by Steven Spielberg, whose gift for witty comic action is unrivaled in modern Hollywood. Spielberg's action sequences may not make total sense in terms of real-world physics, but they all have perfectly coherent internal logic—even if it's Looney Tunes logic.
And they were anchored on maximally charming Harrison Ford performances in his movie star prime (or, in the case of Crystal Skull, only a little past it). If you want to understand what it means to be a movie star, watch Ford in these films: Not only does he take patently ridiculous material and make it a hoot, he makes a roguish, bordering-on-unlikable jerk—Indy is selfish and buffoonish throughout the series—and turns him into one of cinema's most enduringly charming characters.
Sadly, the same can't be said for the newest installment in the franchise, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. The fifth installment is a charmless dud, with no apparent reason to exist other than the enduring appeal of the character. It might as well have been titled Indiana Jones and the Quest for Cash.
Instead of Steven Spielberg, the film is directed by James Mangold, who conspicuously lacks Spielberg's gift for antic action. The big setpieces are creaky and uncreative, with none of the cartoon logic that gave Spielberg's over-the-top setpieces such energy and life. Several sequences, including an opening fight on top of a train and a chase that has Indy riding a horse into a subway, are so riddled with awful computer-generated effects work that at times they almost look fully animated. Almost every shot in the movie looks like it was shot inside, in front of a green screen, with heavy compositing work in post-production. For a series about global adventure, it rarely looks like Indy actually goes anywhere beyond the studio backlot.
And while it brings back Ford as the lovably grumpy archaeologist of the title, it also pairs him with Phoebe Waller-Bridge, playing Indy's goddaughter, another roguish archaeologist with some self-dealing tendencies, Helena Shaw. Anyone who's seen Waller-Bridge's Fleabag knows she has a gift for making nominally unlikable characters vulnerable and charming, and you can imagine her capturing some of the young Ford's roguish appeal. Instead, she's just blandly off-putting, as if the filmmakers forgot to put the charming bits in.
The script, meanwhile, goes from boring to bizarre, with a third-act twist that feels like it came from a Roger Corman quickie.
A late-breaking sequel with an aging star need not be a disaster: Just a few years ago, Harrison Ford reprised his 1980s role as the robot-hunting detective Rick Deckard in the remarkable, haunting Blade Runner 2049.
But Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny mostly just serves as a reminder of how great even not-so-good Spielberg/Ford joints used to be. There's not a memorable bit or moment in the movie, not a scene or a line or a gag that will stick with you for the rest of your life. The franchise's 1980s installments are some of Hollywood's most prized relics; but these days, Indiana Jones just belongs in a museum.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vcmVhc29uLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2LzMwL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnktaXMtYS1kdWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"James Mangold, Harrison Ford on deciding if Indiana Jones dies",'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' director James Mangold and star Harrison Ford open up about making the decision to kill the beloved archaeologist or keep him alive at the end of the fifth film.,"Warning: This article contains spoilers for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
""How could I have done that?""
This is what Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director and co-writer James Mangold says emphatically when EW thanks him for not continuing in the recent Hollywood tradition of bringing back iconic characters only to kill them off.
Still, he understands why you were worried about the titular archaeologist's fate. ""I think everyone, particularly, because I made Logan and wrote it as well, there was a lot of anxiety that I was just going to turn into the icon executioner,"" he says with a laugh. (The 2017 superhero film famously killed off Hugh Jackman's Wolverine.)
So yes, the cat is out of the bag and Indy fans can rest easy: Though he comes close in the film's final moments, Harrison Ford's fedora-wearing adventurer does not in fact meet an untimely end, and lives to don the hat another day.
Mangold says that he and his fellow co-writers, brothers John-Henry and Jez Butterworth, never discussed if Indiana Jones should die. ""Honestly, I enjoy that people were so atwitter about it, because to me, there really is no attraction to just getting thousands of people in a theater and hitting them in a head with a hammer... Death is not an ending. The reason death worked in Logan is because of the beautiful irony of his death, which is that he lived such a painful life, that it was only in the last 30 seconds of his life that he actually got to experience love. And that to me was what was so moving about that ending,"" Mangold says, adding, wryly, ""And [Jackman's] off making another one right now [with Deadpool 3]. So you could see the finality of that.""
""But,"" he continues, ""for Indiana Jones, it isn't about him dying. It had to be about him coming to terms with this period of his life and this period of the world. And in a way, coming to terms with whether Indiana Jones has relevance to ours.""

The film, which Ford has sworn is his fifth and final in the franchise, follows Indy and his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) as they race to keep the mysterious Dial of Destiny out of the hands of a Nazi, Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), who has dastardly plans to alter the course of history.
For his part, Ford confirms he and and the film's creatives never had serious discussions about his character's death ""because the script came out, and it didn't have Indiana Jones dying, so we didn't really need to talk about it."" However, he says, ""It came up in conversation a few times, and [Mangold] said he didn't want to be the one to kill me.""
By film's end, Indy is back at home in his own time, recovering from his injuries and surrounded by loved ones — Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and his grandkids, goddaughter Helena, and his estranged wife, Marion (Karen Allen), with whom he rekindles their longtime love. (More on that, here.)
""I think it's a good choice to leave him in the condition we see him at the end of the film,"" says Ford. ""Most of his problems have been solved, dealt with. He's back to the form that we like to see him in, I think. And I think it's a wonderful last scene... I really like it.""

,James Mangold on final Indiana Jones hat shot in 'Dial of Destiny','Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' director James Mangold explains the meaning behind that final shot of Indy's beloved fedora.,"Warning: This article contains spoilers for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
Harrison Ford has been adamant — including in EW's own cover story — that he's saying goodbye to Indiana Jones with the fifth film in the franchise, Dial of Destiny. Fans might be surprised, then, to learn that the film ends with a shot of his hand plucking Indy's beloved fedora off of a clothesline.
So, with Hollywood's penchant for remakes, reboots, and sequels, are we meant to read more into that final shot? According to the film's director, James Mangold, the scene is nothing more than a tip of the proverbial hat to the fact that, though we as an audience may not accompany Ford's Indy on any more adventures, the character himself is never ""giving up.""
""I don't think he'll ever stop digging,"" Mangold explains to EW. ""And when he takes the hat off the clothesline, I think it's because, first of all, you shouldn't put hats on clotheslines. And second of all, no, I don't think he's done. I think that an ending doesn't mean that the characters never move again in their lives. It just means that you feel that you've entered a state of grace with their story.""

Mangold even has some thoughts about where the daring archaeologist goes from here.
""I think he'll wake up tomorrow and want to do something. But whether he's going into battling Nazis through time portals again, I don't think so,"" he says. ""But I could really imagine him and Marion going on a road trip to some Inca dig or to some dig in Montana or North Dakota and renting a cabin. And I could see him really enjoying his life as a retired archeologist.""
These things are easy to imagine, the helmer says, because ""Indy and Harrison are so close together, and Harrison will never retire, and I don't think Indy will [either].""
He clarifies, ""He retires as a teacher [in Dial of Destiny], but I don't think he will retire from being an obsessive learner, thinker about the past and the future, and science and mankind. I think that the second he stops thinking about that, I think it's game over.""
Dial of Destiny — which also stars Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, John Rhys-Davies, Toby Jones, Boyd Holbrook, Shaunette Renée Wilson, and more — is now playing in theaters. For more on the film and Ford's last hurrah as the whip-cracking archaeologist, read EW's cover story.

Mads Mikkelsen and Boyd Holbrook joined ABC7 to discuss the new movie
CHICAGO (WLS) -- The grand finale of the Indiana Jones saga hits theaters next week.
The actors who play the villains are ready to do the hero in and spoil his last hurrah. They spoke with ABC7 about ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.""
""Obviously it's surreal. We grew up with this, at a point where we had no plans of being actors. So, we just like anybody else, morphed into the film, and wanted to be 'Indiana Jones,' so it's crazy to be here 42 years later,"" said Mads Mikkelsen, who plays ""Jurgen Voller.""
Mikkelsen also spoke about his character in the film.
""He was a scientist working in Germany in the 30s and 40s. That should ring a bell. Obviously, he wants to make the world a much better place,"" Mikkelsen said.
Boyd Holbrook also spoke about his character, ""Klaber.""
""I play, basically, Voller's lap dog. I do all the stuff he can't get his hands dirty with,"" Holbrook said.
The actor additionally talked about some intense action sequences.
""Some of those 'took tooks' were replaced with Tesla engines, and they were going 70 miles an hour. A world-class crew arrived months ahead of time to plan all this stuff out, at a totally different scale,"" Holbrook said.
And, of course, they spoke about working with Harrison Ford.
""If the three of us were to get together now, we would be the adults in the room,"" Mikkelsen said. ""He is a kid by heart. He makes everything easy for everybody else because he's really taking it serious, but at the same time, he's also bringing it down to earth.

,How 'Dial of Destiny' explains the absence of Shia LaBeouf's Mutt,"Here's how 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' explains the absence of Indy's son, Mutt, played by Shia LaBeouf in 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.'","Warning: This article contains spoilers for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
When audiences sit down to watch Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny this weekend, one character will be noticeably absent from the big screen: Shia LaBeouf's Mutt Williams, a.k.a. Henry Jones III.
This in and of itself should come as no surprise — screenwriter David Koepp revealed way back in 2017 that Mutt wouldn't be in the fifth installment. This was welcome news for some fans, particularly ones miffed by the introduction of the cocky greaser in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and the implication at the time that he was heir apparent to the Indiana Jones franchise moving forward.
Still, Mutt's absence in Dial of Destiny couldn't be ignored, what with his prominent role in Crystal Skull and an ending that saw Mutt's mother, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), marrying his father, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford).
Dial of Destiny deals with Mutt in a way that also explains why Marion isn't a bigger part of the narrative. Near the beginning, we glimpse divorce papers and Indy himself angrily covers up a picture of Marion, indicating an estrangement between the pair. Later, in one of the film's most emotional moments, Indy tells his goddaughter, Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), that if he could go back in time he'd tell his son not to enlist to fight in the Vietnam War. He says he'd tell his son that he's going to die, and the resulting grief would so consume his mother and impact his father's ability to be there for her that it would end both their happiness and their marriage.

It's not all sad news for the Jones family, however. Though the film makes it clear it's the end of the road for Mutt's character, it's insinuated that Marion and Indy might still get their happily ever after. After the daredevil archaeologist nearly loses his life in the film's climax, he awakens to find that Marion has returned to look after him. After recreating their romantic ""where does it hurt"" moment from Raiders of the Lost Ark, the two share a tender embrace in the film's final moments. Allen spoke to EW all about the ""emotional"" scene.

2023-06-26 09:50:00+00:00,Indiana Jones and the Contractually Mandated Fifth Adventure,"The latest chapter may not be necessary, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a blast.","In 1979, when Steven Spielberg and George Lucas signed with Paramount Pictures to develop a film series based on classic Hollywood adventure serials, the deal they struck was to make five separate movies. The first, Raiders of the Lost Ark, was released in the summer of 1981 and became that year’s top-grossing movie, beating even the long-anticipated Superman II and remaining on screens in some cities for more than a year. By 1984, it was Raiders’ sequel, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, that had become the year’s most anticipated movie, banking that year’s biggest opening weekend, and the third entry in the franchise, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, became not only the highest-grossing movie of 1989 but the top-earning Indiana Jones movie yet.
Given that track record, and viewed from the perspective of our own IP-crazed times, it seems inconceivable that Spielberg and Lucas decided not to move forward immediately with a fourth Indiana Jones picture (though Lucas did go on to produce a spinoff TV series, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles). The reason: They were unable to come up with a plot device that would credibly carry the beloved archeology-prof-turned-world-adventurer through another feature-length story. Lucas’ idea, a riff on the 1950s sci-fi films that would have been contemporaneous with a middle-aged Indy, was to introduce extraterrestrial beings into the previously earthbound Raiders universe. But, according to Lucas, that notion was struck down by both Spielberg and star Harrison Ford, who on hearing the pitch replied with a gruffness that’s easy to picture: “No way am I being in a Steve Spielberg movie like that.” (Steve’s own response was so ambivalent as to recall Hamlet: “I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know.”)

Almost 20 years would pass before Ford would once again don the fedora, in a Spielberg movie exactly like that. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, released in the summer of 2008 to mostly thuddingly bad reviews, featured a cursed glass knick-knack from outer space, an interdimensional portal housed in a Peruvian obelisk, and a famously nuclear-blast-proof refrigerator. Some critics, me among them, were so glad to see Indy again that they forgave the fourth movie its silliness and enjoyed its small pleasures (Cate Blanchett as a Russian dominatrix-style villain! John Hurt as an antiquities savant driven insane by the titular trinket!), but very few of us walked out expecting or needing a fifth. And yet 15 years later, with Ford about to turn 81, the Paramount prophecy has been fulfilled. With the release of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the Indiana Jones series is, as originally planned, a pentalogy, even if this last chapter is the first of the five not to have been co-written by Lucas or directed by Spielberg. Instead, James Mangold (Walk the Line, Logan, Ford v. Ferrari) is at the helm—and if it isn’t cinematic sacrilege to say so, his solidly entertaining if not inspired installment feels truer to the franchise’s swashbuckling spirit than the latest Spielbergian contribution.

For the length of the movie’s opening sequence, an elaborately staged chase in the series’ grand first-act tradition, you might think Mangold had cutting-room-floor footage from the Raiders archive, given the smooth surface of Indy’s digitally de-aged face and the agility of his footwork as he escapes from a pack of Nazis on a moving train. With the war nearing its end, the Germans, under the command of true believer Jürgen Voller (a deliciously punchable Mads Mikkelsen), are trying to smuggle a trainload of pilfered treasure out of the country. Indy finds his friend and expedition partner, mild-mannered British archeologist Basil Shaw (Toby Jones), tied to a chair in the train car that doubles as Voller’s interrogation chamber. The Nazis, Shaw explains, have gotten their hands on the Antikythera, a powerful ancient artifact supposed to have been invented by the Greek mathematician Archimedes with the aim of finding “fissures in time.” (This priceless doodad, the world’s oldest known analog computer, is real, though it is only known to predict such celestial events as eclipses, not time warps.)

After one more spectacular chase atop the racing train, Indy and Shaw escape with their lives as the audience encounters a time fissure of our own. Fast-forward 25 years to the summer of 1969: All of America is going wild over humankind’s first trip to the moon. Well, all but for the now gray-haired and craggy-faced Professor Jones, who’s grouchily sleeping off one too many slugs of whiskey in his lonely Manhattan apartment. His wife, Marion (Karen Allen, appearing only briefly), has just filed for divorce, for reasons that will be revealed later on; his job teaching archeology no longer seems to inspire either him or his glazed-eyed students.

Indy’s glum routine is thrown off by the sudden appearance of his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). Helena’s father, the now-deceased Basil, lost his sanity spinning paranoid (or were they?) theories about the missing half of his precious Antikythera.
His daughter is determined to travel the world to find it—a plan that would suit the motives of either a loyal daughter or a mercenary black-market antiques dealer. Meanwhile, Voller, a fascist so committed that he at one point appears to badmouth Hitler for not having believed hard enough in the Thousand-Year Reich, is working undercover as a U.S. government scientist. Herr Voller seeks the mystical Greek whim-wham for an even less noble purpose: Like some contemporary political figures I could name, he longs to travel backward in time to a place where life was simpler and made more sense. You know: Germany in 1944.

The abrupt entrance of Waller-Bridge into the Raiders-verse at first generates a wave of cognitive dissonance: What are Fleabag and Indy doing in New York in the late 1960s? But as we get to know Helena (whom Indy calls “Wombat,” an old childhood nickname), the alliance begins to make sense. She and her irascible godfather, for all their bickering as they hurtle in various hotly pursued vehicles from to Tangier to Sicily and back to New York again, are alike: two wisecracking skeptics with incurable wanderlust and a problem expressing sincere emotion. Waller-Bridge’s physical presence is both commanding and comical, her lanky frame and klutziness in the face of danger giving her an Olive Oyl–like quality. Her relationship with Indy toggles between affectionate and prickly, landing at a place of grudging mutual acceptance that, perhaps because I am basic, I found genuinely touching.

In their travels, Indy and Helena cross paths with some figures familiar from earlier chapters of the saga, like Sallah (a likeable Egyptian character who, as played by Welsh actor John Rhys-Davies, should nonetheless perhaps have stayed back in the 20th century), and others new to this episode, like Helena’s teenage sidekick Teddy (Ethann Isidore) and a Spanish boat captain (Antonio Banderas) who takes the gang on a dive to explore an ancient shipwreck. The cinematic references at play derive less from golden-era Hollywood than from previous Indiana Jones adventures: There is a callback to Indy’s fear of snakes, a clever reversal of a gag from the first movie involving a less-than-fair gunfight, and the familiar but still pleasing image of a globe traversed by a moving red line that establishes the protagonists’ location. (As the Muppets have noted, there are few more efficient modes of transportation than “traveling by map.”)

Though the action is often wittily imagined and choreographed, no one could confuse Mangold’s workmanlike direction with Spielberg’s kinetic instinct for how to place and move a camera. Still, Dial of Destiny clips along nicely: Even at 2 hours and 22 minutes, the pace seldom drags. Above all, this movie understands, respects, and loves its title character, even in a loopy late sequence that drops the bullwhip-wielding scholar into a circumstance we’ve never seen or imagined him in before. A sudden third-act swerve into the supernatural—a feature all the franchise’s movies have shared, if not quite at this level of implausibility—could easily have lost the audience’s goodwill, but by drawing on our long experience of the curmudgeonly grave-robber’s passions, beliefs, and preferences, the movie manages to serve up a twist that’s as psychologically credible as it is contrary to all known laws of physics.

Ford has spoken in proprietary terms about his four-decade-long relationship with the character of Professor Henry Walton Jones Jr.: “I’m Indiana Jones. When I’m gone, he’s gone.” Indy has been the great role of Ford’s career (sympathies to the also-memorable Han Solo) and one of the enduring movie characters of my lifetime. You might say that the last two chapters of his story, contractually intended from the start or no, were unnecessary (though Dial of Destiny certainly stands head and shoulders above The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and, depending on your taste, may surpass the second film in the series, the often cringingly xenophobic Temple of Doom). But now that Indiana Jones (though not, thankfully, the man who plays him) seems in fact to have made his last stand, I for one am grateful to have had the chance to stow away on his final adventure.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy8wNi9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLTUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LW1vdmllLXJldmlldy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-08 16:16:30+00:00,Box Office: ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Tracking for $60M-$70M Debut,'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' sees Harrison Ford returns in his final portrayal as the adventurous archeologist.,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny hopes to set off early Fourth of July fireworks at the domestic box office.
Disney and Lucasfilm’s long-awaited next installment in the action-adventure franchise is pacing to open to $60 million to $70 million over the June 30-June 2 weekend, according to early tracking. That’s on par with Mission: Impossible — Fallout and No Time to Die, and those films didn’t face such a crowded marketplace.
The fifth and final installment in the storied series once again returns Harrison Ford as the swashbuckling archeologist Indiana Jones.
The 80-year-old actor stars opposite Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Antonio Banderas, John Rhys-Davies, Toby Jones, Boyd Holbrook, Ethann Isidore and Mads Mikkelsen in the James Mangold-directed film. (Steven Spielberg directed each of the previous four Indy films.)
The movie is a sequel to 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which posted a three-day debut of $100 million 15 years ago. (Tracking is often on the conservative side. Also, Disney’s marketing machine still has time to pump up interest in Dial of Destiny.)
Indiana Jones 5 came on tracking just weeks after its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in France, where it played out of competition. A victorious Ford, along with the rest of the cast and Mangold, happily walked the world’s most famous red carpet.
Keeping the film series’ ongoing Nazi theme alive, the story revolves around an ancient device being chased by Jones and a villain played by Mikkelsen.
Indiana Jones 5 is produced by Kathleen Kennedy, Frank Marshall and Simon Emanuel, with Spielberg and George Lucas serving as executive producers.
John Williams, who has scored every Indiana Jones film since the original Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1981, once again composed the score.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLXRyYWNraW5nLTEyMzU1MTAzMjEv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy9tb3ZpZS1uZXdzL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LWJveC1vZmZpY2UtdHJhY2tpbmctMTIzNTUxMDMyMS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-08 12:01:00-04:00,Dial of Destiny gave me everything I wanted from Indiana Jones,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the last adventure for Harrison Ford in the title role, checks all the boxes that made the series great over the past 42 years.","More than 40 years after its release, Raiders of the Lost Ark is still my No. 1 argument for seeing a movie in a movie theater. It’s the best example of bona fide Hollywood movie magic, the kind that becomes a lifelong memory. I saw Raiders in its first week of release back in 1981, when I was 7 years old. Raiders, for me, doesn’t begin with Indiana Jones running away from a rolling boulder, or grabbing a seaplane’s pontoon under a hail of arrows and blowgun darts. It begins with my dad cooking round steak in an electric skillet on a late-spring Saturday evening, with Siskel and Ebert on PBS at 6:30, raving about this revival of amazing high adventure inspired by 1950s serials.
Dad clapped his hands and told me and my brother, “Hot damn! Boys, we are gonna go see that.” Mom dressed us in church clothes to see Raiders and then go to a nice dinner in a bigger city. We wore the same jackets and ties to Sunday school the next day. (And after Raiders’ Old Testament finale, I sat ramrod straight when the church lady read us the story of Job, the only dude to survive being called out by God.)
The real catalyst of an Indiana Jones movie has always been what viewers bring to the theater before the opening credits roll. So I was one of the fans walking into Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny shouldering some preemptive resentment about how the franchise was exploiting my childhood nostalgia by bringing Indy back to the screen one more time. But when Dial’s credits rolled, I had only a nonplussed, middle-distance stare as my best friend asked what I thought.
“That was... actually good?” I finally said.
“Yeah... I think it was,” he replied.
With the understanding that nothing overcomes the nostalgia of the first time you watched a treasured movie hero do their thing, I can accept that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny still checks all the boxes on my menu of demands for a proper Indy movie.
It sure didn’t sound like it would, heading into its premiere weekend. Reviews, particularly after the film debuted at Cannes, bagged on it for leaning too hard into cameos and callbacks. Redditors and YouTubers, knives drawn as always for any culture-war topic, complained that Harrison Ford portrayed a sad, broken man, and that new character Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) was a detestable sociopath whose only point was to emasculate Jones.
I strongly disagree on both points. Waller-Bridge’s character may not be admirable, but crucially, she returns the series to where it began: As archaeologists, she and Indy are technically grave robbers of questionable methodology. Director James Mangold and writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and David Koepp kept this arc from any problematic colonialism/cultural-theft angle by putting the MacGuffins in Nazi hands and in an ancient Greek tomb. Thus we get the same cynical, borderline antiheroic fortune-and-glory motivation that begins Raiders, without the kind of sociological squeamishness that provokes online duels. Points to Mangold and his team.
That’s important, because even action heroes have to take some kind of emotional journey if their characters are going to be worth a damn. The journey Indiana Jones must make in every movie is one from nonbeliever to believer. That’s what earns the happy ending as John Williams’ classic Raiders march builds up and soars.
In Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indy is convinced of the Ark of the Covenant’s existence and authenticity, but only as an academic or historical matter. “It’s a radio for speaking to God!” Belloq pleads in the Cairo bar. “You want to talk to God? Let’s go see him together, I’ve got nothing better to do,” Jones snarls, almost blasphemously. It takes the Angel of Death, reminding the Nazis that God shall not be mocked, to prove the Ark’s supernatural qualities to him.
In Temple of Doom, chronologically a prequel, Indy is skeptical that a lingam stone, stolen from a desiccated Indian village along with its children, actually has any mystical properties to protect the people or keep their farmland fertile. Much less could it actually be one of the five Sankara stones (a myth invented for this movie). Fast-forward to the scene at the collapsed bridge, where Indy furiously chants Sanskrit and the stones burst into flame, dooming Mola Ram. At the end, Jones warmly agrees with a village elder about his stone’s importance: “Yes, I understand its power now.”
The Last Crusade is another mission to stop Hitler, first and foremost. Indy has spent most of his life resenting his father’s pursuit of the actual Holy Grail, to the exclusion of his family. “This is an obsession, Dad; I never understood it,” he seethes. “Neither did Mom.” Then Indy makes a literal leap of faith, uses the Grail to save his father, and becomes obsessed with recovering the cup himself, before his father tells him to let it go.
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull’s fatal flaw is that both its MacGuffin and its surrounding mythology are complete science fiction. So there’s even less for the audience to either disbelieve or believe in than in Temple of Doom. Suspension of disbelief is crucial to an Indiana Jones story, but Crystal Skull goes forward with no structure to support or enable it. The movie makes a lot of other dumb narrative mistakes, but that’s its biggest shortfall: Jones’ journey from disbeliever to believer, if it even happens, is completely lost.
Which brings us back to The Dial of Destiny. The plot device here is completely different in appearance (and function) from the actual, historical Antikythera mechanism, but at least it has an anchor in reality. Neither the audience nor Indiana Jones really believes that it enables time travel, though. He considers the chunk of the mechanism only as a malefactor that drove a friend insane. In a flashback sequence, when Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) raves about “fissures in time” (which Jones sneers at), Indy fires back, “The proof is what makes it science!”
Indiana Jones gets his proof. In fact, this is the central and most meaningful conflict in any Indiana Jones story: when all is revealed, and the humanist, scientist Indy realizes just how small he is against the cosmos he’s exploring. That kind of point has to be delivered with a velvet hammer — with full impact, but a soft, subtle touch.
Here, The Dial of Destiny succeeds thanks to its remarkably restrained depiction of time travel, especially considering all the wish fulfillment Mangold could have indulged. Who knew time travel is a lot messier than just dialing up coordinates on a flux capacitor? Dial’s version of time is a single strand, with fixed loops backward and forward. Nonetheless, experiencing all this and understanding what time means so stuns Indy that he’s willing to give up the life he has in the present day to remain in ancient Sicily. After decades of seeing the impossible, he’s actually experienced the most impossible — time travel.
Once again, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny takes its hero from disbeliever to rapturous believer. When the story toes that line, regardless of what Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, or any of the other supporting characters do, Dial of Destiny sings the loudest as an honest-to-God Indiana Jones film.
I’ve read so much complaining about how Dial’s third act challenges the audience’s suspension of disbelief, as if it wasn’t challenged in lesser scenes from the first four movies. (Swimming across the open sea to stow away on a submerging U-boat? Escaping an unpiloted airplane with an inflatable raft as a parachute?) The complaints ignore a key detail that invites viewers to suspend their disbelief: This is a real object. The scientists who first studied it said it was too far ahead of its time to have been found in an ancient Roman shipwreck. Could it actually be evidence of time travel?
In either case, there’s an element of real history, and suspension of disbelief in real life, for viewers to lean on in a theatrical flight of fancy, before the film makes a grand leap into the paranormal — like every other Indiana Jones film.
Other things make Dial of Destiny rightfully an Indiana Jones movie, more than just fistfights, or Indy flashing a bullwhip, or people driving antique vehicles beyond their limit. There’s Jones’ overt vulnerability in every action sequence. There’s also the obligatory moment of moral contempt, which recenters Indy’s character, and ennobles his pursuit. In Dial of Destiny, it’s when Helena is a bit too cavalier and self-congratulatory about the escape she engineered from Jürgen Voller (Mikkelsen) and his thugs. “They just killed my friend,” Jones says, which brings the moment up short for antiquities hustler Helena and her streetwise fixer Teddy (Ethann Isidore).
For those who feel Indy is too sad, too angry, or too emasculated in Dial of Destiny, here’s a counterargument: He earns all of his emotions in this movie, thanks to some well-placed foreshadowing. My God, this is a man at the end of his career. He’s cheated death and been beaten senseless as a job description. His son died in Vietnam, destroying his marriage. “Everything hurts,” he growls to Helena as they struggle to make their way into Archimedes’ tomb. He doesn’t just mean physically.
Perhaps Dial of Destiny isn’t the best of the five Indiana Jones films; it doesn’t have to be. After all, Raiders was sui generis, which I think is Latin for “new IP,” so anything following it is going to be derivative by definition. If Dial makes any real filmmaking stumble, it may be that the visual callbacks (to Sallah, to Marion, to the scenes they shared in 1981) are so overt, its real narrative heritage seems buried by comparison.
But the DNA of the rest of the Indy movies is there, even if you have to excavate a little to find it. When I finished digging, at the end of the film, I realized that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny gave me everything I expect from an Indiana Jones movie.
And even if Dial of Destiny didn’t make me feel exactly the way I did when I was sitting in a theater with my family 42 years ago, I’m still struck by how much I’m thinking about the film now, a week after seeing it. I might even go see it again. It’s a throwback to the era in which Indiana Jones was conceived, the era when blockbuster movies and theaters were a perfect match, when my best friend and I would go back to the theater to see something two or three times, because the movie was... actually good.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIzNzg1NzcwL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LWlzLWdvb2QtZmFuLXJldmlld9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tL3BsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8yMzc4NTc3MC9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS1pcy1nb29kLWZhbi1yZXZpZXc?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-21 18:43:37+00:00,‘Indiana Jones 5’ Director James Mangold on ‘Pinch-Hitting’ for Spielberg and Refusing Fan Service: Franchises Have Become ‘Large-Scale Advertising’,"""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" director James Mangold also discusses taking on ""Swamp Thing"" and ""Star Wars.""","Before Indiana Jones entered director James Mangold’s life, Harrison Ford told him he was worried Indy was looking too old.
It was the fall of 2019, and Mangold had joined the team working on the film adaptation of “The Call of the Wild,” in which Ford plays a rugged frontiersman, to help with reshoots. In their downtime, Ford began confiding in Mangold about the fifth “Indiana Jones” movie, which had been bouncing around in development for the better part of three years. Steven Spielberg and screenwriter David Koepp had conceived a roughly five-minute opening sequence set during World War II, in which Ford would be digitally de-aged. Ford wasn’t sure it was a good idea.
“Harrison told me he was nervous, because he felt like if people saw him younger, when they confronted Indiana in his 70s they’d be disappointed,” Mangold says, sitting on a cream-colored couch inside his sunlit office on the Fox lot in early June.
At the time, the filmmaker had no reason to think he was auditioning to be the guy to solve Ford’s dilemma. But Mangold impressed the actor. “He seemed to have a keen perception of what was required,” Ford says. “I just found it very easy and comfortable to work with him.” So much so that when Spielberg decided later that year that it was time to bequeath Indy’s signature whip and fedora to someone else, Ford recommended Mangold.
Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, who has produced every “Indy” film since serving as Spielberg’s assistant on “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” recalls, “It was pretty much immediate that Steven said, ‘Oh, he would be fantastic. Let’s do that.’”
It’s easy to understand why. Starting with his feature debut, the 1995 Sundance hit “Heavy,” Mangold has built a career steeped in the old-school Spielbergian classicism that is embedded in the DNA of the “Indiana Jones” movies. “I’ve always been a little behind the curve of what’s happening in the moment,” Mangold says. “I mean, I made a wordless film about a fat guy in a diner when everyone else was trying to emulate Quentin — when the hot thing was clove cigarettes and rock-’n’-roll soundtracks.”
For decades, that approach has served Mangold well, as he has turned out a procession of quite disparate studio features, from the psychological drama “Girl, Interrupted” and Johnny Cash biopic “Walk the Line” to the Western thriller “3:10 to Yuma” and the historical entertainment “Ford v Ferrari.” In the 2010s, he even stepped inside the Marvel sandbox and brought a brutal humanism to the comic book adaptations “The Wolverine” and “Logan,” the highest-grossing movies in his filmography.
Increasingly, though, Mangold has been feeling out of step with the franchise-building imperatives of a modern film industry fixated on sustaining an ongoing series of interconnected movies. “I am interested in making something that works from beginning to end — to curtain,” he says. “Otherwise, I’m working on the world’s most expensive television show.”
Lucasfilm Ltd.
So when Kennedy approached Mangold in late 2019 about directing the fifth and final “Indiana Jones” movie, Mangold was not an instant yes.
“Oh, he was incredibly intimidated,” Kennedy recalls with a laugh. “He was immediately excited by the potential of it, but he was very daunted by stepping into Steven’s shoes.”
Still, Mangold was captivated by what was by any measure a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, even as he was acutely aware that it came with the singular hazards inherent in taking over a franchise that has meant so much to so many for so long. “There are a million land mines,” Mangold says. “But the idea that I would get a chance to play not just in the backyard of my heroes, but with Harrison, with Steven — it was so profoundly moving to me. How many people get a chance to make a movie with these people?”
Mangold spent a year with his “Ford v Ferrari” screenwriters Jez and John-Henry Butterworth to craft the screenplay for what would become “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.” Mangold’s goal was to make a film worthy of the iconic hero and the movie star embodying him — and, perhaps, explicate his own feelings about the world passing him by. Because while the 59-year-old filmmaker’s success has brought him into the orbit of two other marquee franchises, “Swamp Thing” for DC Studios and a new “Star Wars” movie for Lucasfilm, he remains ambivalent about being seen as a franchise filmmaker at all.
As Mangold talks with me in his office, I can’t help noticing the 22 framed index cards filling the wall just above his head, each with a handwritten rule for cinematic storytelling. For example: “Self-expression (talk without action) is BORING!” And: “What is happening NOW is not as exciting as what may or may not HAPPEN NEXT.”
All of the rules were created by the late filmmaker Alexander “Sandy” Mackendrick (“Sweet Smell of Success”), who mentored Mangold as the dean of the CalArts School of Film in the early 1980s. Mackendrick had the cards hanging in his own office, and, Mangold explains, “he would point at these different rules as he was analyzing your eight-page screenplay.”
When I ask Mangold how often he’s turned to his mentor’s directives over the course of his career, he smiles wistfully. “Every day,” he says. “I’ve lived with these all my life.”

As we converse, I begin to grasp just how much these rules have provided Mangold with the intellectual scaffolding to build a story that feels at once exciting and emotionally connected. Take that WWII prologue that had so concerned Ford. Mangold thought it was a brilliant idea, because it tackled one of his biggest issues with 2008’s “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull”: That film barely acknowledges that Indy is not only older but has aged out of the 1930s and ’40s era that he’s meant to embody.
“What’s so beautiful about the best of the ‘Indiana Jones’ movies is that thematically they know what they’re about,” Mangold says. “I didn’t feel like I knew what ‘Crystal Skull’ was about. He’s living in a world that has overtaken him — a world that has found new heroes in John Glenn or Elvis Presley. No one in the film is really thinking about the past; everyone’s focused on the future.”
Mangold says he “spoke plainly” about these feelings in early discussions with Spielberg and Kennedy about what he’d want to do with “Indy 5,” which he felt was at risk of making many of the same mistakes as “Crystal Skull.” The MacGuffin at the center of the early script, for example, “was just another relic with power, similar to the relics we had seen,” with no clear connection to Indy or what he was going through. So he changed it to the Antikythera, an ancient mechanical device invented, in the new script’s conception, by the Greek mathematician Archimedes to allow its user to manipulate time.
“Indy had spent his entire life exploring time,” Kennedy says. “Once Jim seized upon that as a theme, it emotionally resonated, frankly, with all of us, who have in excess of 40 years invested in this storytelling.”
Mangold also understood, however, that audiences would show up with an image of Indiana Jones in his prime fixed in their memories. So rather than cut the prologue, he expanded it to a 25-minute sequence set in 1944, when Indy encounters the Antikythera for the first time on a Nazi loot train. Effectively, Mangold wanted viewers to be disappointed by the shock of cutting from Indy as a younger man to Indy in his late 70s. “It might be a really good opening gambit for the present-tense part of the movie — that much about growing older in life is disappointing,” he says.
In spite of his trepidation, Ford applied himself to the sequence with his typical aplomb. “I tried to raise my voice into a higher register, which seemed to be appropriate for the age, and physically tried to move with all the grace and youthfulness that my old ass could muster,” he says. “I had not anticipated that the process of de-aging, if you will call it that, would be so successful.”
Neither did Mangold. The director knew Ford would need to be de-aged with a level of verisimilitude that has proven elusive to filmmakers so far. The process involved drawing from hundreds of hours of archived footage of Ford as a younger man and mapping that onto the older actor’s face. But when I ask Mangold how he ensured the technology was up to snuff before he started filming, he just shrugs. He hadn’t.
“You have to believe that they’re going to be able to do something better, but you don’t know,” he says. “Every movie is a leap of faith. People are like, ‘Can Joaquin Phoenix sing?’ And you go, ‘Yeah, absolutely. He’s incredible.’ And you don’t know. You’re just believing in the people around you delivering.”
Lucasfilm Ltd.
Spielberg never told Mangold why he decided to relinquish the “Indiana Jones” director’s chair, and Mangold never asked. “I never went there,” Mangold says. “I mean, it wasn’t my business. I knew he had a personal movie he had been working on, so I assumed that he wanted to make ‘The Fabelmans.’ But I didn’t grill him about it.”
The two did talk frequently throughout the making of “The Dial of Destiny,” shot from from June 2021 to February 2022, most often about the “mechanics of things” and how an “Indy” movie should feel and move. “Steven told me, ‘Think of shooting an “Indiana Jones” movie like you’re shooting a trailer — no scene can ever last too long,’” he says.
When I ask how Mangold approached making the film his own, however, he corrects me. “I wasn’t looking to make the movie my own,” he says. “I would say I was looking to have a voice.” More than practically any other film franchise in cinema history, “Indiana Jones” is inextricably associated with one filmmaker, and Mangold had no interest in changing that.
“You don’t want me doing a knockoff Steven, but I want to be playing from the same hymnal, using the same tools,” he says. “I mean, I’m pinch-hitting for Babe Ruth. I at least have to use my own swing some of the time. But the reality is, every day I’m thinking of what he would do, how he would do it. In any way I could, I wanted to do the movie in his style. It didn’t feel threatening to me at all.”
Mangold knew comparisons were inevitable, so he wasn’t exactly shocked when the premiere of “The Dial of Destiny” at the Cannes Film Festival in May drew a muted reaction from critics. “When you’re in franchise land, it’s very hard for critical thinkers” — meaning journalists — “to overlook what I’m sure their editors want, which is this business prism of how does it rate to the other ones?” he says. “I always thought if I were second or third best to one of the greatest films of all time, I’d be good. I mean, it all vaporizes later. Either the movie will live or it won’t.”
Mangold talks about this with the kind of good-natured forbearance built up over decades in the studio trenches, so I’m surprised by how animated he gets when I bring up the future of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s character, Helena Shaw, Indy’s goddaughter. Mangold and the Butterworths wrote Helena specifically for Waller-Bridge, seeing in her the same kind of pluck and resourcefulness that made Karen Allen’s Marion Ravenwood a perfect foil for Indy in “Raiders.” I ask if he has talked with Disney and Lucasfilm about the potential for Waller-Bridge to carry on the franchise. Mangold smiles and waves his hand dismissively.
“I’m not interested,” he says. “I refuse. I just can’t do it.” He gestures to the rules hovering just over his shoulder. “The amount of lore and Easter eggs and fan service starts to become antithetical to any of this stuff at a certain point. It isn’t storytelling anymore. It’s large-scale advertising.” (For her part, Kennedy says that while it’s “entirely possible” that a Helena Shaw movie could happen, “we’re not having any of those conversations right now. We’re just focused on finishing this with Harrison.”)
Lucasfilm Ltd.
At the same time, Mangold seems resigned to the inevitability of the franchise economy. For instance, Hugh Jackman will return in 2024 as Wolverine in a Marvel Studios film with Ryan Reynolds’ Deadpool, seven years after Jackman retired the character in “Logan” — the film that earned Mangold his first Oscar nomination (for adapted screenplay). “I can’t say that there’s a part of me that doesn’t wish that we’d let it be,” he says. “But there was always going to be another Wolverine. There could be a baby Wolverine and a cartoon Wolverine. As much liquid as they can squeeze out of that rag, they’re going to try to. I don’t measure my success on a movie like ‘Logan’ with whether we ended the conversation. I ended my conversation.”
The great irony is that Mangold is attached to make a DC movie and a “Star Wars” movie — he’s just choosing not to see them that way. “While I’m sure DC views ‘Swamp Thing’ as a franchise, I would be viewing it as a very simple, clean, Gothic horror movie about this man/monster,” he says. Mangold had been “toying for years with the idea of making a kind of Frankenstein movie,” he adds, so when James Gunn and Peter Safran took the reins at DC last fall, Mangold “put in a friendly call” to suggest himself. “Just doing my own thing with this, just a standalone.”
With “Star Wars,” Mangold had “more than flirted” years earlier with making a Boba Fett movie that would have been a one-off spaghetti Western in the vein of Sergio Leone. (Lucasfilm turned it into the Disney+ series “The Book of Boba Fett” instead.) So while in production on “The Dial of Destiny,” Kennedy asked him if he was still interested in exploring a galaxy far, far away. “I said, ‘Yes, but it seems like everything you’re developing is continuing forward,’” he says. He pitched “a ‘Ten Commandments’ about the dawning of the Force,” he says. “It is basically, for fans, a kind of religion. What is it to have found this power and not even understand what it is?” Kennedy pounced.
“Jim’s pretty fast — he’s already got the basic treatment laid out in his head,” she says. Once the writers strike is over, she adds, “He has every intention of wanting to move this forward very aggressively, and we want to support that.”
Before either project goes anywhere, though, Mangold intends to begin shooting the relatively small-scale Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown” with Timothée Chalamet in August. It’s the film Mangold was working on in 2019 when Kennedy approached him about “Indy,” and he’s been itching to get back to it. But the looming prospect of an actors strike in July could scuttle the movie before it starts. If a strike goes on too long, Chalamet’s commitments to promote “Dune: Part Two” and “Wonka” in the fall and winter could prevent the film from happening. When I ask Mangold about that possibility, he grimaces.
“I get asked this question,” he says. “All we do is keep moving. Just keep trying to prep the movie and hope that the two sides will resolve things. I don’t know what else I can do.”
The only thing Mangold is certain of is that he never wants to get too comfortable making anything. “I don’t put myself in one bin in the record shop,” he says. “Is he country and western or jazz? Is he rock ’n’ roll or is he soundtracks? What the fuck is he?” He laughs. “To me, sticking within one lane, I don’t know whether I’d keep learning.”
I make note of another Mackendrick rule of cinema — and, it seems, of life — hanging just out of Mangold’s view: “Drama is EXPECTATION mingled with UNCERTAINTY.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LWphbWVzLW1hbmdvbGQtaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC0xMjM1NjUwODk0L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LWphbWVzLW1hbmdvbGQtaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC0xMjM1NjUwODk0L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,An Archaeologist’s Take on What Indiana Jones Gets Right—and Wrong—About the Field,The movie franchise speaks to ethical issues at the very heart of anthropological thinking,"Pop culture’s most famous archaeologist, Indiana “Indy” Jones, returns to the big screen this summer. In this fifth installment, The Dial of Destiny, Harrison Ford once again stars as the titular character who defined public perceptions of archaeology.
Producers have confirmed this will be the final chapter in Indy’s story. It’s also the first and only film in the series not directed by Steven Spielberg, though he remains an executive producer. Now directed by James Mangold, the flick premiered at the Cannes Film Festival with lackluster initial reviews.
The movie will certainly elicit grumblings from Indy’s real-life colleagues. Many professional archaeologists love to hate on the franchise. Critics often bemoan the unrealistic representation of archaeology and the mystification of historical facts. Some find it demeaning to the serious research undertaken in the field.

But at the same time, many archaeologists appreciate that Indy raises the profile of archaeology in the popular imagination. As an archaeologist and frequent moviegoer, I want to highlight another merit of the franchise: the cinematic expression of ethical issues at the very heart of anthropological thinking.
Of course, these issues are embellished and reinvented; we’re watching action blockbusters, after all. Nevertheless, the Indy movies reflect fundamental challenges in the field—real concerns to real archaeologists.
As a warning, this essay contains spoilers from the first three Indiana Jones movies. But you have had more than 30 years to watch them.
Archaeology is destructive
From Egyptian tombs to medieval churches, archaeological sites suffer damage throughout the movies. Often, this is the first objection raised when it comes to archaeology’s depiction on screen.
Let us recall Indy’s cinematic debut in 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark. The opening sequence shows Indy in South America, searching for a Golden Idol worshipped and protected by the (fictional) Indigenous Hovitos people. Following in the footsteps of previous expeditions, he reaches a temple hidden in the jungle. After unsuccessfully replacing the idol on an altar with a bag of sand, he has to escape as an ancient trap causes the entire hall to crumble.

While this is definitely not the proper way to conduct fieldwork, the underlying premise is accurate: Archaeological excavations often destroy the context they seek to understand.
Though not as cinematic as a booby trap’s wreckage, excavations are controlled, systematic destruction. That is why contemporary archaeologists meticulously document sites and use less invasive techniques such as ground-penetrating radar, which probes below ground without digging. Field archaeologists create detailed, written descriptions accompanied by drawings, photography and 3D scanning.
Archaeology’s destructive nature isn’t limited to remains beneath the surface. For instance, since the 19th century, conservators have tried to reconstruct the Athenian Acropolis to its classical Greek style. In the process, they have removed medieval and Ottoman structures, including houses, fortifications such as the so-called Frankish Tower and a mosque inside the Parthenon.
Archaeologists can punch Nazis … metaphorically
In the third movie, The Last Crusade, Indy searches for his kidnapped father, an eccentric medievalist played by Sean Connery. The senior Jones disappeared while looking for the Holy Grail, the cup Christ used during the Last Supper. During the journey, set in 1938, Indy discovers a Nazi lair in a castle and whispers, “Nazis. I hate these guys.” And indeed, brawling with the Nazis becomes a recurring activity for Indy on his pursuits.
As the trailer for Dial of Destiny reveals, these old villains return in a new revanchist form. Mads Mikkelsen’s Nazi character says, “Hitler made mistakes, and with this, I will correct them all.”

In reality, historical sites and artifacts are often misused for political purposes. Representations of the past have been manipulated by leaders across political and ideological spectrums. But nationalist and far-right ideologies have been especially active in this regard due to their tendency to idealize an imagined past.
The intellectual and ideological training apparatus in the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (more commonly known as the Nazi Party) contained a specialized group for German prehistory. It was later incorporated into the interior ministry. The notorious SS also had a research and teaching unit for German heritage under the direct supervision of Heinrich Himmler, the man who later oversaw the Holocaust. The unit’s point was to subdue research and cultural policy. (Adolf Hitler himself was not concerned with the wartime destruction of monuments because, in his view, this opened an opportunity to erect new ones.)
The communist regimes in the former Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc are intriguing in this respect. According to the official ideological stance of the party, Marxism was the sole acceptable reading of the past. Archaeology was tasked with the promotion of cultural unity among the communist nations, leading to an explosion of studies into Slavic heritage.
In my home country, Bulgaria, former leaders expected archaeologists to find fodder for nativist propaganda. During the first decades of communism, the government emphasized Bulgaria’s Slavic ethnic background to blend its citizens with other nations under Soviet domination. Archaeologists were tasked with finding evidence that most of the medieval population was Slavic. Then, starting in the 1970s, the leadership reappropriated a nomadic Bulgar heritage. They thought that because Bulgars migrated from the Eastern European steppe, this origin could showcase the close ties between Bulgaria and the USSR.
History was also exploited in the political preparation for Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. Seven months prior to the invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin personally published an essay arguing for the historical unity of Russia and Ukraine.
As even Indy becomes the target of persecution at some point (in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), the films allude to the complex realities of scholarship in unfree societies. To metaphorically punch Nazis and other extremists, archaeology must understand the field’s political implications and expose the biases encoded in representations of the past.
Not everything belongs in a museum
In 1984’s The Temple of Doom, Indy finds himself searching for a sacred stone stolen from the shrine of a village in India. The trio of Indy; his romantic interest, Wilhelmina “Willie” Scott; and his self-appointed assistant, Short Round, must face the evil Thuggee cult to retrieve the valuable item.
Eventually, Indiana returns the Sivalinga stone to the village residents. Their religious leader says, “Now you see the merit of the rock you bring back.”
The protagonist agrees: “Yes. I understand its power now.”
A minute later, Willie asks why he did not keep it, to which Indiana replies, “What for? They’d just put it in a museum, and it’d be another rock collecting dust.”

This may seem like quite the step for a character who has said other items considered antiquities belong in museums. His seemingly inconsistent stance reflects the often fraught relationship among archaeologists, museum collections and communities.
Yes, museums are key institutions for heritage management and protection. But protecting and promoting heritage requires the inclusion of broader communities.
This is not a new idea in academic archaeology. In the 1950s, archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler expressed “the moral and academic necessity of sharing scientific work to the fullest possible extent with the man in the street and in the field.”
Considering the problematic origins of many museum collections and the ongoing repatriation requests made by various nations and Indigenous groups, Indy’s realization conveys the fundamental concerns of public archaeology. Controversial collections store sacred objects such as the Mijikenda vigango statues and the human remains of Indigenous ancestors.
The fictional Indian village presents a very real situation. The local community holds the knowledge for the protection of its culture. Archaeologists and anthropologists, being cross-cultural communicators by craft, have a role to play and can support such communal efforts. Indy seems to get this when he returns the Sivalinga. (Though in a more critical take, I, like writer Cathleen Luo, would discuss the underlying white savior trope in the movie.)
There are many nuances to the Indiana Jones story. As I see it, the films express the important role and responsibilities granted to archaeology by the public. Despite some misrepresentations, the movies show that, at its best, archaeology can be community-oriented work that unites people and heritage.
At the very least, the real field and the films can be a lot of fun.

,Flying Lessons from Harrison Ford: Ethann Isidore on Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"Ethann Isidore, Teddy in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, tells Lucasfilm.com about joining Indy on his last adventure in theaters now.","When Isidore got the chance to audition for the role of Teddy, a street-wise kid from Morocco who teams up with Waller-Bridge’s Helena Shaw, he was convinced he wouldn’t get the part; he didn’t mind. “I just wanted to have fun during the audition,” he says. “I had a piece of the script and I was like, ‘I know what’s going to happen in the next Indiana Jones!’ I didn’t think that I was going to be the one chosen, I was just so excited to be part of an Indiana Jones audition.”
To his surprise and awe, Isidore landed the part and the chance to work with Waller-Bridge, Ford, and director James Mangold.
“Life is actually good”
To get into character, Isidore walked the streets of Fes, Morocco, on location to take in the environment and step into Teddy’s shoes. It wasn’t much of a stretch to imagine other aspects of the character, however, like Teddy’s desire to be seen as an equal and a partner in Helena’s schemes despite his youthfulness. “Teddy’s a kid like me and he’s always trying to be an adult,” Isidore says. “He’s trying to find his place between Helena and Indiana Jones and I think that’s pretty much how I feel as a kid with adults.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1Y2FzZmlsbS5jb20vbmV3cy9ldGhhbm4taXNpZG9yZS1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWludGVydmlldy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-07 21:22:54+00:00,"23 Years Ago, Harrison Ford Laughed at Jokes About Playing Indiana Jones at 80 Years Old: ‘Indiana Jones and the Comfortable Bed’","Back in 2000, Conan O'Brien joked about Harrison Ford playing Indiana Jones when he's 80 years old.","A July 2000 clip from “Late Night with Conan O’Brien” has gone viral on social media for featuring the eponymous late night host making a joke to Harrison Ford about the actor playing Indiana Jones when he’s 80 years old. That panned out to be somewhat true in the recently-released “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which opened in theaters just a few weeks before Ford turns 81.
“People will never get tired of that genre,” O’Brien told Ford at the time. “When you’re 80 you could just do ones where they bring the treasures to you.”
Ford burst into laughter, with O’Brien adding that an “Indiana Jones” movie starring an 80-year-old Harrison Ford could be titled, “Indiana Jones and the Comfortable Bed.”
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” marks Ford’s final outing as the iconic archeologist. While he is done with playing Indiana Jones, Ford has no plans to retire from acting as he turns 81. He just joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe in “Captain America: Brave New World,” which recently wrapped production in Atlanta, and he’s got the Apple TV+ comedy “Shrinking” and the Paramount+ drama “1923” heading into second seasons once the writers strike concludes.
When asked last month if he plans to retire, Ford said, “I don’t. I don’t do well when I don’t have work. I love to work. I love to feel useful. It’s my Jones. I want to be helpful”
“It is the people you get to work with,” he added about why he wants to keep acting. “The intensity and the intimacy of collaboration. It’s the combined ambition somehow forged from words on a page. I don’t plan what I want to do in a scene. I don’t feel obliged to do anything. I’m naturally affected by things that I work on.”
Ford’s “Dial of Destiny” promotional tour reunited him with Conan O’Brien on the latter’s “Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend” podcast. Their discussion went viral after Ford roasted O’Brien for having a note reminding him that Ford played Han Solo in “Star Wars.”
“You can’t fucking remember that?” Ford asked O’Brien.
“No I can’t. I can’t remember Han Solo,” O’Brien said. “I wrote it down because I heard that you were in some of the ‘Star Wars’ films, and this was news to me because I’ve seen those films and I don’t exactly think that you ‘pop.’”

,Chasing Destiny: The Villains and Antagonists of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"Actors Mads Mikkelsen, Shaunette Renée Wilson, and Boyd Holbrook talk about joining Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, in theaters now.","But there’s only one Indy. So, when it came time to sign on for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Mikkelsen got to join his childhood hero for one last adventure, playing the villain — the Nazi Dr. Jürgen Voller, a mathematician for the United States government credited with helping to put astronauts on the moon. “I mean, since I can’t be Indy, I can be the baddie,” he says. “And it’s been a wonderful journey to see this home.”
On Mikkelsen’s first day on set, he arrived for a costume fitting and a script read, but ended up meeting the man with the hat. “I went outside my trailer and Harrison [Ford] was outside. That was the first time I met him.” Ford was in full costume, and Mikkelsen says he felt like a kid again, recognizing not the esteemed actor and co-star but the hero he loved. “It wasn’t Harrison, it was Indiana Jones. He had the hat, the whip, the jacket. [It was] surreal. Watching him work, it’s just been, you know, an experience of my life….Because, all of a sudden, I’m part of it.”
Mikkelsen wasn’t alone. In Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, he’s joined by Agent Mason, a by-the-book special agent played by Shaunette Renée Wilson, and Klaber, Voller’s enforcer played by Boyd Holbrook, an unlikely team-up that led to plenty of inter-personal conflict on screen.

Harrison Ford Admits Lucasfilm Reworked Ending Of ‘Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny,’ Appears To Confirm Leaks James Mangold Previously Denied
Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in Lucasfilm's INDIANA JONES AND THE DIAL OF DESTINY. ©2023 Lucasfilm Ltd. & TM. All Rights Reserved.
Actor Harrison Ford, who reprises his role as Indiana Jones in the upcoming Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny film, recently admitted that Lucasfilm did indeed rework the ending to the film.
It was rumored back in June 2021 by YouTuber Overlord DVD that “Two endings are supposedly being considered in this script. I guess they’ve been written and they are going to shoot both of them. Both endings allegedly have old Indiana Jones dying at the end of this movie.”
“But in one of the rumored endings, young Indiana Jones dies alongside old Indiana Jones and Phoebe Waller-Bridge swoops in like a vulture, picks the hat up, and takes his place moving forward,” he adds.

A separate rumor from The Daily Mail in September 2021 claimed, “Phoebe Waller-Bridge is being tipped to replace the veteran actor as a female version of the fictional professor of archaeology in the adventure movie franchise.”
An anonymous source told The Daily Mail’s Showbusiness Editor Katie Hind about the rumor, “It would be a huge statement, and a great role for Phoebe.”
Another source stated, “The gossip on the set is that this character will slot into the leading role.”
Overlord DVD would follow-up his initial rumor claiming that the film actually had six endings in November, “We’ve been told out of the six endings they tested the best one gets a 35% approval from test audiences.”
“We’ve been told that Bridge put the hat on in every ending,” he added.
Overlord DVD then clarified, “All my spies actually said was Phoebe Waller-Bridge puts on Indy’s hat, takes Indy’s whip, and in a brave and stunning display of girl power she becomes the besest Indy evar at the end of all six version of the movie.”

Mangold denied the rumors of Indiana Jones being replaced writing on Twitter in December, “One more time. No one is ‘taking over’ or replacing Indy or donning his hat nor is he being ‘erased’ thru some contrivance— and he never was, not not in any cut or script — but trolls will troll — that’s how they get their clicks.”
He added, “And please don’t exhaust me pointing out how once in a while a troll is ‘right’. Even a blind squirrel finds a nut now & then. All one has to do is look at set photos & interviews & u get enough info to make wild guesses about a movie plot.”

“The diff between trolling a-holes & everyone else is they r trying to make $ off your feelings about other films & culture war politics. They push contoversial guesses as coming from “sources” to gin up clicks. Let it go. END,” he concluded.
Mangold’s denial of the rumors was previously called into question when the film’s composer John Williams revealed that Mangold and Lucasfilm planned to film a different ending.
Williams said, “Here are three pieces from Indiana Jones 5. I felt we would be finished with Indiana Jones after four. You know Harrison Ford. You all know who Harrison Ford is. And Harrison is 78 years old, but he’s much younger than am. Well, I thought, ‘Aw if he can do five of them, I have to try to do the final five also.”
He then states, “So, we have just about completed the film. We have maybe another ending to shoot and to record. Maybe in a couple weeks.”
Last night, John Williams told his audience that they are shooting a new ending to Indiana Jones V in a couple weeks. Thanks to @doomcock for the find. Added captions for you.@wdwpro1 @ValliantRenegad pic.twitter.com/FZUOpjOpX7 — Jonas J. Campbell (@JonasJCampbell) December 14, 2022
RELATED: ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Director James Mangold Claims Composer John Williams Is “Mistaken” About New Ending To Film, But Then Claims “He’s Fully Informed”
Mangold attempted to refute Williams’ comments writing on Twitter, “John was mistaken. Maybe read Twitter too much.”
He then declared, “We’re not shooting new endings. Never did. The film is 99% finished & being rated by MPAA.”
Mangold concluded, “This imagined zany ending w/ Indy being erased & replaced is a fever dream of wounded folks angry about other films I did not make.”
When asked for clarification on Williams’ comments, Mangold answered, “Joking, mistaken or misinformed. Not happening.”

However, when further pressed on the issue, Mangold claimed Williams was “fully informed” just after claiming he was either “joking, mistaken, or misinformed.” He tweeted, “I agree that he’s one of the greatest composers in the history of film. And also one of the most lovely people on earth. And he’s fully informed.”
It now appears that it was Mangold who was mistaken or he was intentionally trying to mislead people.
Actor Harrison Ford admitted to Spanish-language outlet Espinof, “We did a little work on the ending, which is the last thing I shot with Karen Allen, who has been in a substantial part of the whole thing, but appears in this story only briefly, at the end, but with a very strong, emotional hook. I felt nostalgia, a sense of accomplishment. I’m proud of the film, happy with the film.”
“Every good thing, you know, there comes a right time to go on to something else. I really enjoyed the process of making this film. I’m very happy with it. So I left the set that day content,” Ford concluded.

RELATED: Harrison Ford Admits Indiana Jones Is “Not So Strong, Not So Brave, Not So Attentive” In ‘Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny’
In a video on WDW Pro’s channel, Midnight’s Edge founder Andre Einherjar reacted to Ford’s comments and noted that fans need to hold Mangold accountable for disparaging them.
He said, “Hold him accountable for it. Retweet his earlier statements and don’t let him get away with it. Simple as that. Now of course, no one should do anything more than that. When you blatantly lied and you have unfairly maligned and attacked your own audience and you were lying in doing so then I see no problem with reminding them of that fact especially when the movie fails as it is going to.”
WDW Pro added, “Matt Kadish and Doomcock, they deserve apologies at this point. They reported correctly.”
It’s unclear what the exact ending for the film will be, but an alleged leaked ending by Reddit user LunekJones claims that Indiana Jones, Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Helena, and Mads Mikkelsen’s Doctor Jürgen Voller end up in in the distant past during the Roman siege of Syracuse. Voller and his compatriots end up dying in a plane crash over the battle while Indiana Jones and Helena are able to escape.
Upon landing they encounter Archimedes who retrieves the Dial of Destiny from Voller’s corpse and ensures that it can only be used to travel back in time to him in Syracuse during the siege. He also takes possession of one of Voller’s watches that gives him knowledge of the device.
LunekJones explains, ““As Helena tells him that Archimedes has ‘rigged’ the dial, in making sure it only sends back to Syracuse on the day of the siege so that they could save him, we understand it’s thanks to this jump in time that he found his knowledge about watches and on how to complete the dial.”
RELATED: Alleged ‘Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny’ Plot Leak Claims Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Character Makes The Heroic Choice To Knock Out Indiana Jones To Protect History
From there, LunekJones details that Indiana Jones does not want to return to his present, but would rather stay in Syracuse because he believes there is “nothing for him in 1969.” In contrast, Helena attempts to convince Indy to return to the present believing if he stays in the past “he would change the course of history.”
Indy apparently is unconvinced by Helena’s arguments so she resorts to punching him and knocking him out.
When Indy awakes he’s back in 1969 in New York City in his bed. He then “reproaches [Helena for] having brought him back to the present although there is nothing for him there.”
However, Helena counters that there is something for him to continue living for and Marion shows up in his apartment with a number of groceries. The film earlier made it clear that Marion and he were either divorced or on the brink of divorce as divorce papers were pinned to Indy’s fridge held up by a picture of Marion.
The two eventually appear to reconcile whatever contrived issues the film gives them to have them embrace in a kiss with the plot synopsis explaining “they re-enact the boat scene from Raiders in reverse before Indy kisses her.”
Finally, the film reportedly ends with a shot of Indiana Jones’ hat on a drying line outside the apartment with what appears to be Jones’ hand eventually grabbing it off the line as the camera zooms onto the hat in a small circle similar to old Warner Bros. cartoons.
LunekJones details, “The screen reduces into a small circle like in the Tom & Jerry cartoons, circling the hat and appearing to end there… just before we see Indy’s hand (can’t be sure 100% sure it was his now that I think back about it but it makes sense that it was) getting the hat back inside. The end !!”
What do you make of Ford appearing to confirm the rumors that they reshot or reworked the ending of the film?

Far from it. During an upcoming interview on CNN and Max’s “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace?” (set to air and stream on June 23), Ford laughs at the idea of retiring from acting. Next month, he will turn 81 years old.
When asked if he plans to retire, Ford replied, “I don’t. I don’t do well when I don’t have work. I love to work. I love to feel useful. It’s my jones. I want to be helpful”
Why does Ford still have the acting bug as he gears up to turn 81 years old? “It is the people you get to work with,” he said. “The intensity and the intimacy of collaboration. It’s the combined ambition somehow forged from words on a page. I don’t plan what I want to do in a scene. I don’t feel obliged to do anything. I’m naturally affected by things that I work on.”
With “Indiana Jones” winding down, Ford has the Apple TV+ comedy “Shrinking” and the Paramount+ drama “1923” heading into second seasons once the writers strike concludes. He’s also spent recent weeks in Atlanta filming the Marvel tentpole “Captain America: Brave New World,” in which he stars as U.S. president Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross.
While age is but a number for Ford, he really wanted his current stage of life to be felt in his fifth and final “Indiana Jones” movie. He told Chris Wallace that the entire allure of coming back to play Indiana Jones was to embrace his age and not make it a joke.
“I wanted it to be character driven,” Ford said about his “Dial of Destiny” return. “And I wanted us to confront the question of age straight on. Not to to hide my age, but to take advantage of it in the telling of the story.”
When asked if it’s bittersweet saying goodbye to Indiana Jones, Ford answered: “No. It’s time for me to grow up.”
“Six years ago, I thought maybe we ought to take a shot at making another one,” Ford said. “And I wanted it to be about age because I think that rounds out the story that we’ve told and we brought it to the right place. I mean, the last one ended in kind of a suspended animation. There was not a real strong feeling of the conclusion or the closure that I always hoped for, the roundness and speaking to this issue of age. Not making jokes about it, but but making it a real thing.”
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” opens in theaters June 30 from Disney.

2023-06-02 14:00:40+00:00,"Long Range Box Office Forecast: INDIANA JONES AND THE DIAL OF DESTINY and RUBY GILLMAN, TEENAGE KRAKEN","After a fifteen-year wait by fans, Harrison Ford returns on June 30 for the final performance as one of his most iconic and beloved characters.","Photo Credits: Disney, Lucasfilm, & Phedon Papamichael (""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"")
Fifteen years after its last installment, the Indiana Jones franchise returns to theaters on June 30 with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Sharing a release date with the film is Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, the latest from animation studio DreamWorks. Early analysis and forecasts for those two films, as well as the latest forecasting updates on June’s releases, are below.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny
Disney / Lucasfilm
June 30, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $81M-$111M
Domestic Total Range: $225M-$380M
PROS:
The prospect of a new chapter in the Indiana Jones saga has ignited fan excitement in the years since Lucasfilm announced they’d pursue the film; Harrison Ford returning to one of his most iconic roles is a big plus, as is the presence of director James Mangold (Ford v Ferrari, Logan) behind the camera.
Social media chatter has been mostly positive throughout the movie’s long production history.
A wave of nostalgia helped Top Gun: Maverick surpass $126M over the first three days of its Memorial Day weekend opening last year; if Dial of Destiny manages to appeal to adult audiences, it could get a similar bump.
If those adult audiences show up with families in tow, as happened with Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in 2008, Dial of Destiny could end up more back-loaded than the typical franchise film.
The fourth of July comes the Tuesday following Dial‘s release—meaning Disney could, essentially, be viewing the Friday-Tuesday window as a five-day opening weekend.
Early pre-sales are respectable when given proper context, i.e. the glut of male- and fan-driven films opening before Dial of Destiny hits theaters in June. The film is currently pacing ahead of John Wick: Chapter 4 and Fast X.
CONS:
A monkey on Dial of Destiny‘s back is the mixed reputation of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the only other Indiana Jones film to come out this century. It’s no secret that Kingdom divided Indiana Jones fans upon its release in 2008, becoming the target of numerous memes and drawing comparisons to the Star Wars prequels.
Early critics’ reviews from the film’s Cannes Film Festival premiere have been mixed; the film currently stands at 49% approval on Rotten Tomatoes.
A mixed critical reception doesn’t always mean family audiences will stay at home—see The Super Mario Bros. Movie—but if families do stay away from Dial of Destiny, Indy’s final adventure could prove more front-loaded than Kingdom.
A gauntlet of summer competition lies ahead of Dial of Destiny, with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning: Part One, Barbie, and Oppenheimer, among others, coming to cinemas in July.
Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken
Universal / DreamWorks Animation
June 30, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $13M-$18M
Domestic Total Range: $38M-$66M
PROS:
The female-leaning animated comedy/adventure could serve as a solid counter-programmer against the more male-focused Dial of Destiny.
Ruby Gillman opens in the third weekend of release for Elemental, the latest from Pixar. That film is currently generating mixed critics’ reviews, which could help Ruby Gillman‘s chances as a potential sleeper hit.
CONS:
Though family audiences have definitely returned to theaters—see the success of The Bad Guys, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie—DreamWorks’ original animated films are challenging to forecast in an era when Illumination has taken over as the dominant brand and films like Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse offer cutting-edge animation that appeals strongly to today’s younger audiences.
The aforementioned Across the Spider-Verse, if it enjoys good word of mouth like its 2018 predecessor, could still be drawing in family audiences a month after its June 2 release.

A famous work of classical music makes an unexpected appearance in the fifth instalment of the Indiana Jones film series. We explain why...
Listen to this article Loading audio...
Harrison Ford returns to our screens as the intrepid explorer Indiana Jones for the fifth and final time in ‘The Dial of Destiny’, accompanied by the momentous musical musings of legendary composer, John Williams.
The 91-year-old film music great has composed over two hours of new music for the film. However, he is not the only composer to be featured during the movie’s runtime.
In an unexpected twist, the music of Beethoven joins the soundtrack of the fifth Indiana Jones film two-thirds of the way through the film – but perhaps not in the way you might think.
To learn why, grab your hat and your whip, because it’s time to dive into the history of classical music to decipher the meaning behind the appearance of Beethoven in Dr Jones’ final adventure. Warning, there are spoilers ahead.

Watch the trailer for Indiana Jones 5 and the Dial of Destiny
What piece of classical music features in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny?
The fifth instalment of the Indiana Jones series is (mostly) set in 1969, 33 years after the events of the first film ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’. Dr Jones is now 70 years old and has seemingly left his days of adventuring across the world, looking for ancient treasures, behind him.
But of course, for the film to happen, this doesn’t last long. Thanks to his chaotic goddaughter, Helena Shaw, he is plunged (figuratively and literally) into an adventure that takes him around the world in search of Archimedes’ dial.
At the beginning of the final chapter of the film, our protagonists, Dr Jones and Shaw enter the cave in search of the final resting place of Archimedes.
As they are talking, they notice an echo, and Indy encourages Shaw to sing in order to find where the echo is strongest, as this will determine where to go next. Out of all the pieces of music Shaw could have chosen to sing, she sings the opening notes of Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5 in C minor.

Why is Beethoven’s Symphony No.5 sung in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny?
Written over 160 years before the events of the fifth Indiana Jones movie, Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5 has become a mainstay within pop culture.
But its use in this recent Indiana Jones film could be to do with its musical phrasing.
Just like many of the artefacts featured in the storylines of Dr Jones’ adventures, the history of the fifth symphony has inspired a host of theories about what could have inspired Beethoven to write the orchestral work.
Beethoven is said to have described the ominous four-note opening motif of his Fifth Symphony (which is sung by Dr Jones and Shaw in the film) as ‘Fate Knocking at the Door’, or at least that is what critics have attested.
And fate – another word for ‘destiny’ – is certainly what was awaiting Dr Jones and Shaw when they successfully used the Fifth Symphony to guide their way through the cave.

Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony as a body percussion epic played by hundreds of schoolchildren
Another possibility as to why the Fifth Symphony was chosen for the fifth Indiana Jones film is to drive home the significance of numerical values within the movie’s plot.
The mathematician Archimedes is a central figure in the film, and a numerical code plays an important part in the plot’s development.
So it’s not implausible that the writers behind the adventure romp wanted to double down on the ‘five’ imagery hidden within the fifth film.
Regardless of why the work was chosen, its numerical significance and ties to the discovery of our protagonist’s fate cement Beethoven’s legacy as one of Indiana Jones’ favourites composers, and unofficial companion in his final adventure.

Harrison Ford has addressed the long wait fans have faced in getting the fifth and final film, ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.""
The film, set to be released in theaters on June 30, marks Ford's final farewell to the franchise and comes 15 years after ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.""
Speaking to Digital Spy, Ford addressed the 15-year gap between the fourth and fifth ""Indiana Jones"" films, revealing that there weren't immediate plans for a followup after ""Crystal Skull"" was released in 2008.
""Well, it wasn't as though we sat around for 10 years waiting to come up with an idea,"" he said.

""When we finished the last film, I don't think anybody thought about going and doing another film for some time.""
""Crystal Skull"" is considered by many to be the worst film in the franchise and currently holds a 53% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. Adjusted for inflation, it has the lowest box office gross of any movie in the franchise, according to Box Office Mojo.

The 80-year-old actor said that in the last few years, ""there were some interesting ideas that were floated"" for a fifth movie, but ultimately they ""didn't quite gel over a period of time.""
""And then we found an idea, and a script, and a strong story that we wanted to tell,"" he said of ""Dial of Destiny"" which is directed by James Mangold and cowritten by Mangold, Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and David Koepp.

Ford said that he was ""very happy"" with the story of the new film in which the archaeologist adventurer is joined by his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), in a race against time to retrieve a legendary dial that can change the course of history.
Taking place against the backdrop of the 1960s space race, the sequel sees Indy going head-to-head with a former Nazi scientist (Mads Mikkelsen) and also stars ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" alumni John Rhys-Davies and Karen Allen.

Ford said: ""We're coming to the end of Indiana Jones's time on the planet, and I wanted to see a conclusion of his story that accommodated the reality of his age, and what that effect has on this person that we've come to know over the years.""
He added that when it came time to hang up Indy's iconic fedora and whip for the last time, he ""felt a sense of peace, a sense of contentment.""

,Harrison Ford Addresses That Age-Old Rumor That He Stapled His ‘Indiana Jones’ Hat to His Head During Filming,"Harrison Ford reflected on Indiana Jones' iconic costume in a new interview with GQ, in which he talked about stapling the character's hat to his head.","Harrison Ford is spilling the beans about Indiana Jones' wardrobe staples.
The 80-year-old actor said that during his stint as the franchise’s titular archaeologist — which he reprised one last time for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny this year — he had to use an unusual method to keep his iconic hat from flying off.
In a GQ video about the bullwhip-wielding character's legacy, behind-the-scenes footage from the first Indiana Jones installment shows a young Ford stapling Indy’s signature pinch-front fedora to his forehead.
“That should do it,” he says in the clip from the Raiders of the Lost Ark set.

When a GQ staffer mentions the video to Ford, the actor motions to a spot near his hairline, saying, “I still have the [scar], see it?”
“You do what you need to do,” he told the interviewer.
Ford also reflected on other aspects of his iconic Indiana Jones ensemble, which he said he had a lot of initial qualms about.
""It was presented to me as [an] aspect of character in the first film,"" he said in the video. “My questions about it were many.”
He went on to list some of his costume queries: “Why am I wearing a leather jacket in the jungle? Isn't it hot here? Why am I carrying a whip? What am I gonna do with a f------ whip? Are you gonna whip people?”
The Star Wars actor went on to say that he was told, presumably by someone in the 1981 film’s wardrobe department, that the archaeologist's outfit was “an evocation of a time period” and “reflection of movies past.”
The star added that despite his initial hesitation, he said “okay” to wearing the now-iconic 'fit, which, according to him, “makes it my own.”

Ford’s final go-around as Indy has led to some nostalgic and touching moments, including an interview in which he appeared to momentarily choke up when a journalist thanked him on behalf of Indiana Jones fans and telling him, “You mean the world to us.”
“And I must say to you, thank you, sincerely,"" Ford responded in the BBC Radio 1 interview. ""It means the world to me.”

The actor went on to say that the franchise is “peopled with some of the most amazing actors and characters and the stories are so compelling and they mix adventure and humor and heart,” and that he admires ""the depth and the subtlety of the emotion, and the importance of emotion in these films.""
""As this one concerns age and frailty and changing nature of life, it was especially compelling to me because I am of that age and I wanted it to feel real for the audience,"" Ford said of Dial of Destiny. ""I wanted them to see the complexity of that experience with someone they spent 40 years with.”

,Harrison Ford Describes 'Complicated' Experience Making 'The Devil's Own' with Brad Pitt,"Harrison Ford opened up in a new interview about the ""complicated"" experience he had working on The Devil's Own with Brad Pitt","Harrison Ford is recalling why his 1997 thriller The Devil's Own was such a ""complicated"" movie to make.
In a new interview with Esquire, the Star Wars alum revealed that at one point in filming the movie with costar Brad Pitt, they ""didn’t have a script that Brad and I agreed on."" The film centers on an IRA gunman (Pitt) who draws an American family into the crossfire of terrorism.
“Brad developed the script. Then they offered me the part. I saved my comments about the character and the construction of the thing — I admired Brad,"" Ford, 80, said. ""First of all, I admire Brad. I think he’s a wonderful actor. He’s a really decent guy. But we couldn’t agree on a director until we came to Alan Pakula, who I had worked with before but Brad had not.""
Ruven Afanador
""Brad had this complicated character, and I wanted a complication on my side so that it wasn’t just a good-and-evil battle,"" he continued. ""And that’s when I came up with the bad-shooting thing.”
The ""bad-shooting thing"" was a scene in the movie where Ford's police officer character sees his partner participate in an illegal shooting. As Ford explained, he ""worked with a writer"" for the scene, but he and Pitt, 59, couldn't come to an agreement on how things would go.
""Each of us had different ideas about it. I understand why he wanted to stay with his point of view, and I wanted to stay with my point of view—or I was imposing my point of view, and it’s fair to say that that’s what Brad felt,"" Ford shared.
""It was complicated. I like the movie very much. Very much.”
Ruven Afanador
The film itself, which was directed by Alan J. Pakula, ended up earning $140 million worldwide. It also starred Margaret Colin, Treat Williams, Rubén Blades and Natascha McElhone.
Elsewhere in his interview with Esquire, Ford revealed why he hasn't gotten around to writing an autobiography covering his storied career. As he explained, Elton John once asked him why he hadn't written the book yet.
“I said, ‘I thought about it, but I decided I’m not going to do it, because I didn’t want to tell the truth,’ ” Ford said. “And I saw the disappointment on his face—Elton’s a pretty genuine guy, you know. I wanted to mollify him, so I said, ‘But I didn’t want to lie, either.’""
""So that’s the reason I’m not writing a book: because I don’t want to tell the truth, and I don’t want to lie.”
Ruven Afanador
Ford's latest film Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, marks his ""most emotional"" performance, according to some critics. The actor, who first played the role in 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark, opened up about retiring the character during a press conference this month.
""Is it not evident? I need to sit down and rest a little bit. I love to work, and I love this character, and I love what it brought into my life, and that's all I can say,"" he said, adding that he ""wanted to round up the story"" with this new installment.
""Everything has come together to support me in my old age, and I love the work. So I just want to work and I want to tell stories, good stories, and I have been so lucky in my life to have that opportunity.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9oYXJyaXNvbi1mb3JkLW9uLWNvbXBsaWNhdGVkLW1vdmllLWZpbG1pbmctd2l0aC1icmFkLXBpdHQtNzUwNzU2N9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director James Mangold has explained why Shia LaBeouf will not be reprising his role as the titular archaeologist’s son, Mutt.
LaBeouf, 37, debuted the role in 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull directed by Steven Spielberg.
Asked about LaBeouf’s absence at the Dial of Destiny premiere this week, Mangold told Variety: “I think the point I had was that when I came on, I wanted to capture that wonderful energy between Indy and an intrepid female character.”
The franchise’s fifth instalment sees the new addition of Fleabag star Phoebe Waller-Bridge, 37, as Indiana’s goddaughter Helena who helps him on his new quest.
“So that was my first goal, and there’s only so many people you can edge into a picture,” Mangold added.
The maligned fourth film in the Indiana Jones franchise, starring LaBeouf, was widely panned by critics.
At the end of the movie, it is heavily hinted that Mutt would be Indiana’s successor as the adventurer’s iconic hat is seen flying in the breeze and landing at Mutt’s feet.

However, screenwriter David Koepp revealed in 2017 that LaBeouf would not be reprising his role.
LaBeouf criticized the production in a 2010 interview with the Los Angeles Times. He said that he “dropped the ball on the legacy that people loved and cherished”, and that Harrison Ford wasn’t happy with the film either.
Ford, 80, later responded by calling his costar a “f***ing idiot” for making the comments.
In recent years, the Even Stevens star has been repeatedly mired in controversy.
The actor is currently fighting a legal battle over allegations of abuse made against him by his former partner, the musician known as FKA Twigs.

Though he denied each of the allegations, LaBeouf admitted to being aggressive and mentioned his alcohol addiction, stating: “I’m not in any position to tell anyone how my behaviour made them feel. I have no excuses for my alcoholism or aggression, only rationalisations.”

,“The Chance to Collaborate with My Heroes”: Director James Mangold on Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"James Mangold tells Lucasfilm.com how Raiders of the Lost Ark led him to direct Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, in theaters June 30.","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is more than Indy’s last adventure — it’s a love letter from a kid who became enthralled with filmmaking while watching Raiders of the Lost Ark on opening day in 1981.
Director James Mangold was a teenager when he saw the first Indiana Jones adventure in theaters. “It inspired me,” Mangold tells Lucasfilm.com. “I mean, I was already making Super 8 films at that point; I was already a crazy filmmaking geek. My room was a double-system editing room and cameras galore, and I was devising how to make special effects, building models, animating, and shooting movies in my high school.” But to the aspiring young filmmaker, the cast and crew of Raiders was already firmly ensconced among his personal heroes. “You’re talking about George Lucas and Steven Spielberg [who executive produced this film]. You’re talking about Harrison Ford and John Williams. These were my North Star.”
Now more than 40 years later, Mangold has helmed Indy’s final ride, an epic send-off for one of cinema’s legendary action-adventure heroes, once again played by the incomparable Harrison Ford. The story finds Indy at the end of his teaching career, confronted by his past, at a crossroads in a life filled with some significant disappointments.

2023-07-20 20:44:13+00:00,Lucasfilm Sued in Trademark Dispute Over Backpack in ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’,Lucasfilm has been roped into a legal battle between rival clothing companies over the backpack Indiana Jones wore.,"Lucasfilm has been roped into a legal battle between rival clothing companies over the backpack Indiana Jones wore in the latest installment to the franchise.
In a suit filed on Wednesday in California federal court, Frost River accused Lucasfilm of using its products in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny without permission and then passing off its signature backpacks as a competitor’s product in a deceptive marketing campaign.
“This lawsuit concerns two corporate juggernauts, Filson and Lucasfilm, exploiting the hard work and intellectual property of Frost River, a small American company,” states the complaint.
In the movie, Indiana Jones wears a bag with a knapsack design featuring a drawstring-topped main compartment with a flap cover. Frost River says Lucasfilm never obtained its permission to use its product. Instead, the studio removed identifying marks on the bag in violation of a federal trademark law.
As part of its marketing for the movie, Lucasfilm authorized Filson to run a co-branded campaign to promote the movie and the clothing company’s products, according to the suit. “Lucasfilm and Filson produced a 60 second commercial prominently featuring video clips from the Indiana Jones 5 film intertwined with video clips of actors using Filson’s own products,” writes Devin McRae, a lawyer for Frost River, in the complaint. “Shockingly, one of the intertwined video clips was one from Indiana Jones 5 featuring Frost River’s Geologist Pack.”
Frost River says the marketing is intended to trick consumers into believing that the bags seen in the movie and advertisements are sold by Filson.
The complaint claims a violation of the Lanham Act, a federal trademark law.

“This takes a certain kind of artistic bravery, a fearlessness that Mads possesses,” Mangold added. “In all honesty, I think he has been offered the roles of ‘villains’ in movies simply because he is so fearless about taking them on and humanizing them”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3L2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnktbWFkcy1taWtrZWxzZW4tcHJlZmVycy1wbGF5aW5nLWxvc2Vycy1vdmVyLWN1dGllLXBpZS1jaGFyYWN0ZXJzLTEyMzU0MjkwMTQv0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1hbmQtdGhlLWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS1tYWRzLW1pa2tlbHNlbi1wcmVmZXJzLXBsYXlpbmctbG9zZXJzLW92ZXItY3V0aWUtcGllLWNoYXJhY3RlcnMtMTIzNTQyOTAxNC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-30 12:36:20+00:00,"‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Teenage Breakout Ethann Isidore on Battling Nazis By Day, School Homework by Night",The 16-year-old French actor discusses his major role in Dial of Destiny and bonding with Harrison Ford and Phoebe Waller-Bridge on set,"While much of the attention regarding Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has been — understandably — on Harrison Ford, plus the franchise finale’s renowned and much-loved additions in Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Mads Mikkelson, the film also welcomes a (very) fresh-faced newcomer into the globe-trotting historical adventure mix.
In his feature debut and first English-speaking role, French actor Ethann Isidore, 16, appears about halfway into the Lucasfilm movie as Teddy Kumar, the sneaky sidekick of Waller-Bridge’s relic-stealing Helena Shaw. From there on in, the teenager — who was just 14 years old when he was cast and turned 15 during the shoot — is a regular presence on screen, heavily involved in the film’s biggest action sequences, including tuk-tuk races, airborne pursuits and the Dial of Destiny‘s rather spectacular time-twisting climax.
Born on the outskirts of Paris and of Mauritian descent, Isidore was already a “huge fan” of Indiana Jones years before the long-awaited final movie came his way (and despite being more than two decades younger than the original trilogy). But he doesn’t appear to have been starstruck by its iconic whip-cracking lead, with Ford pulling faces at him as they filmed scenes together (on one occasion he was laughing so hard that director James Mangold kept having to tell him to concentrate). He and Waller-Bridge, he says, came up with their own special handshake.
Such was the friendship he developed with his co-stars that at the end of the 8-month-shoot, the two presented their young companion with an electric guitar and wrote Isidor a letter saying how much they’d enjoyed working with him (“one of the greatest gifts I’ve ever received”).
Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter from his grandmother’s apartment in Paris while on school holiday, Isidore discusses his special audition tactic (one that may well have landed him his life-changing role), the nicknames given to him and Waller-Bridge on set, his upcoming appearance in another epic franchise, and juggling time-traveling, Nazi-bashing adventures with schoolwork.
At the Cannes premiere, you just looked like you were having an absolute blast. How was the Cannes experience for you?
Cannes was amazing. It feels like you’re in a dream. And everything is so fancy. I’ve never seen anything like it before. And there are all these stars around you. You feel like you’re on top of the world. And it also feels like there are all these fireworks going off when photographers are taking pictures of you.
Did you manage to chat with any other stars?
I didn’t really speak to anyone. I was staying at the Carlton, which was the same hotel as Leonardo DiCaprio. But I left the day he arrived at the hotel.
Have you been part of the Dial of Destiny‘s big global tour since then?
Well, I went to LA, but I didn’t go to Berlin with the other members of the cast, and I didn’t go to Italy. But that’s fine because I went to the Paris premiere. And I was really happy about it because I was the only member of the cast there, so everyone was asking me questions. I had to go on stage to speak to around 2,600 people — it feels like you’re God!
I’m sure you’ve been asked this question thousands of times already, but how did you get to be part of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny?
I was coming back from school and my mom told me that my agent had received a call from a casting director asking me to do an audition for a “very famous adventure franchise.” This was in Paris. So I went there and I didn’t think I was going to be chosen. Because there were so many kids in the waiting room — about 20 other kids. I thought, “yup, not me.” Then I went to the audition. And they called me back, asking for me to meet with James Mangold in London two weeks later. I met him and he told me he liked what I did. And then, two days later, they called me and said I was going to play in Indiana Jones.
Wow, that was it? Can you remember what you did in the audition?
I did the same in Paris and in London. I had lines to learn, but there’s something I do for every casting audition, which is I learn my lines at the last minute, like the night before, so it’s more natural in the audition and to take away the pressure. And it kind of works!
It clearly does. Where were you when you got the call and what did you do?
I was actually on London Bridge in front of Big Ben. I was with my family as we were in London for a week. But we called my cousins, my aunts, my uncles, my grandma, my grandfather, my entire family from Mauritius, where we’re originally from. I think even the neighbors got a call.
The original Indiana Jones films were already getting quite old when I was your age, a very, very long time ago. Did you know them or did you have to quickly watch them before the audition?
Oh, I definitely knew them — I used to watch all these movies with my family when was I younger. I had the DVD collector pack. And I also had the Lego Indiana Jones game on Xbox. And I used to make Indiana Jones short films with my cousins when I was about four. I’d play a kid Indiana Jones who was looking for animals. I don’t know why. I was a big fan!
Most of your scenes are with Phoebe Waller-Bridge. How was it working with her?
She’s really nice and very funny. She kept making jokes with me and the entire cast. We even had a personal handshake! They would call us Bonnie and Clyde on set. I had a line in the original script, where I say we’re Bonnie and Clyde. It didn’t make it into the movie, but it stayed in people’s minds, and on set that’s what we were called.
Harrison Ford doesn’t seem like an easy guy to amuse. Did you manage to make him laugh? Was he good fun to be around?
When you make Harrison laugh, you do feel really proud of yourself, basically like you could make anyone laugh. But I had the time of my life making jokes with him and we’d make fun of each other. I remember James Mangold kept telling me to concentrate because I was laughing too much during one scene, but it was just because Harrison was making faces. So it was all Harrison’s fault.
There’s so much going on in the film — tuk-tuk races, adventures on boats and that spectacular climax. How much of it was real and not done in a studio in front of a green screen?
Actually, most of it was real — we traveled to Sicily and Morocco, and the New York scenes were shot in Glasgow. And even on the boat — we were actually out in the ocean.
Do you have a favorite moment from the entire production?
I think it was the last week because Harrison and Phoebe bought me an electric guitar. They also gave me a letter and they signed it, telling me that I was doing a great job and that it was awesome working with me. I was so happy — I cried when got it. It was one of the greatest gifts I’ve ever received. I’ve got the letter on the wall in my room.
Why did they get you a guitar?
Because I used to talk about music with Harrison and Phoebe, and about rock and roll, which I love. And also they know I’m a musician. I play the piano. So they knew I was going to play it.
Did you manage to take home any other souvenirs from the set?
Yeah, I have a rope. There was a scene way where I have to tie a rope on a boat — it was really brief, like two seconds. But I kept it because I just wanted to have something from the film.
What were you doing with schoolwork during the shoot?
I had teachers on set on Zoom. I had at least three hours of school every day. And every Friday I’d have an exam — it’s one that all 14 and 15-year-olds in France have to do. And it was quite complicated because I’d be on set and like “Yeah, I’m gonna fight Nazis. And then: Math.”
Are you back at school now?
Well, it’s the holidays now, but yeah, I’ve been back to school.
How was returning to post-Indy normality?
It felt really weird like you were in a dream and someone smacked you and told you to wake up. And you see your math teacher again, and you’re like, well, so this is reality.
And what do your friends and classmates think about the fact you’re in Indiana Jones with Harrison Ford?
At first, they didn’t believe me. I was really proud of it, but first when I told them they were like ‘yeah, yeah, yeah.’ So I had to show them photos to prove I wasn’t lying. But my friends have been amazing and they haven’t changed since they found out. So I’m happy about that because I was scared people would going to change. So life is good!
Besides school, what’s next for you?
I have a role in the Walking Dead spin-off about Daryl Dixon. We filmed that last year — it was really fun to see zombies everywhere. I can’t say much about that though.
So do you now have agents in the U.S.?
Not yet, but my French agents are working on it. We’re going to have some meetings. We’re also waiting for the release to see what’s going to happen next.
And now you’ve starred in a major film series that you were already a fan of yourself, is there anything else that you’d love to do?
I’d love to be involved in a Spider-Man movie. I have a lot of Spider-Man comic books in my room. I’d love to play Miles Morales (the star of Sony’s animated Spider-Verse franchise) That would be a dream.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9ldGhhbm4taXNpZG9yZS1pbnRlcnZpZXctaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnktMTIzNTUyNjE4Ni_SAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3MvZXRoYW5uLWlzaWRvcmUtaW50ZXJ2aWV3LWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LTEyMzU1MjYxODYvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-30 05:51:17+00:00,Harrison Ford is back as an 80-year-old Indiana Jones – and a 40-something Indy. The highs (and lows) of returning to iconic roles,Actors love to return to their most famous roles decades later – and digital de-ageing is Hollywood’s next big thing.,"Saddle up, don the fedora and crack that whip: Harrison Ford is back as the intrepid archaeologist in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. The film premiered at Cannes, where Ford was awarded an Honorary Palme d’Or in recognition of his life’s work.
Reviews for the fifth film in the franchise have been mixed, and it is the first Indy film not to be directed by Steven Spielberg (this time, it’s James Mangold, best known for his motor-racing drama Ford v Ferrari).
But this is “event” cinema that combines nostalgia, old-school special effects and John Williams’ iconic score.
So, Ford is back, aged 80. What draws actors back after all this time?

Role returns
Ford first played Indy in 1981 and last played him in 2008. That is a full 15 years since the most recent film in the series, and 42 years since his first outing in Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Ford has form in returning to celebrated characters. One of the great pleasures of watching The Force Awakens back in 2015 was seeing Ford play Han Solo again for the first time in over 30 years.
Actors return to roles for numerous reasons:
financial (Ford was reportedly paid US$25 million for Dial of Destiny)
protection of their brand, image and star persona (Michael Keaton returning to play Batman after three decades and three other actors who have embodied the role)
professional (Tom Cruise admitted over the 36 years between Top Gun films he wanted to make sure the sequel could live up to the original)
personal (once-huge stars are working less and less, and only feel the need to return to a built-in fan base every few years – Bill Murray in the 2021 Ghostbusters sequel springs to mind).
It’s not always a successful endeavour.
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone – two of the biggest action stars of the 1980s off the back of iconic roles as The Terminator, Rocky Balboa and John Rambo – have repeatedly returned to those roles, and critics have been particularly harsh.
It did not work for Sigourney Weaver in Alien: Resurrection in 1997, 18 years after her first time as Ripley; nor for Keanu Reeves in The Matrix Resurrections in 2021, 23 years after the original.
And still, I’m intrigued to see what Michael Mann could do with his long-rumoured sequel to Heat, his definitive 1995 crime film. Ever since Mann published his novel Heat 2 last year – a kind of origin story for Heat’s key protagonists – fans have been hoping a de-aged Al Pacino (now aged 83) might return as LA cop Vincent Hanna.

Undoing time
“Digital de-ageing” first entered the Hollywood mainstream in 2019 with The Irishman and Captain Marvel.
Via this process, older actors (Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Samuel L. Jackson have all been subject to the technology) move back and forwards in time without younger actors having to play them.
Films still tend to cast two actors to play older and younger versions of the same character, a choice that dates back at least to 1974’s The Godfather Part II, in which a young Robert de Niro plays Vito Corleone, portrayed by the much older Marlon Brando in the first film.
In 1989, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade features a delightful opening scene where River Phoenix plays the young version of Indiana Jones, before Ford takes over for the rest of the film.
Actors used to just play characters of their own age when reprising earlier roles. Paul Newman finally won a Best Actor Oscar for his role as “Fast Eddie” Felson in The Color of Money (1986), a quarter of a century after first playing him in The Hustler.
The sequel plays on Newman’s age, and his role as a mentor to an upcoming Tom Cruise, and bathes viewers in nostalgia and memories of a younger Newman.
But actors no longer have to exclusively play their age.
The first part of Dial of Destiny is an extended flashback, set in 1944, in which Ford has been digitally de-aged to appear in his 40s. This process used an AI system that scanned used and unused reels of footage of Ford from the first three Indy films to match his present-day performance.
Here, it is as if we are getting two Fords for the price of one: the “younger”, fitter Indy and the older, more world-weary version. It makes for a powerfully emotional connection on screen.
Yet there are some pitfalls to de-ageing. Some viewers complain that the whole process is distracting and that the hyper-real visual look of de-aged scenes resembles a video game.
Even so, de-ageing in Hollywood cinema is here to stay. Tom Hanks’s next film is using AI-based generative technology to digitally de-age him.
Given its reduced cost, speed and reduced human input, AI-driven innovation might have industry-changing ramifications.
The star of Ford
Harrison Ford remains a bona fide “movie star” in an industry profoundly buffeted by COVID, the rise of streaming platforms, the demise of the monoculture, and the changing nature of who constitutes a star.
In the midst of all this industry uncertainty, it seems there is no longer a statute of limitations on actors returning to much-loved characters.
The next big ethical issue for the film industry as it further embraces AI is whether to resurrect deceased actors and cast them in new movies.
Still, I’m looking forward to seeing more actors de-aged as the technology improves and audiences acclimatise to watching older actors “playing” younger versions of themselves. We are only at the start of Hollywood’s next big adventure.

The fifth Indiana Jones instalment had its world premiere at Cannes Film Festival on May 18, but it seems the critics in attendance weren't impressed by the film, which currently sits at 49% on Rotten Tomatoes from 43 reviews.
Given the critic scores for previous films in the franchise (93% for Raiders of the Lost Ark, 84% for Last Crusade, 77% for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and 76% for Temple of Doom), this makes it the lowest Tomatometer rating of the series to date by a large margin.

This score is likely to fluctuate as more critics get to watch James Mangold's film over the coming weeks, while audiences will be able to share their own thoughts on Indy's final adventure from next month.
Dial of Destiny will see Harrison Ford reprise his role as the legendary archaeologist for the fifth and final time, though Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy recently teased that the franchise could continue on TV in the future.
""It's Harrison's last entry. That's how we look at the Indy franchise,"" she told .

Kennedy continued: ""I mean, truthfully, right now, if we were to do anything, it might be in series television down the road, but we're not doing anything to replace Indiana Jones.
""This is it. It's five movies that Harrison Ford did. And Harrison is so specific and so unique to creating this role. We just… Steven [Spielberg] agrees, we just wouldn't do that.""

,Mask used for stunts in Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny is giving people nightmares,They definitely fall squarely into the uncanny valley,"A mask used during the production of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has been giving fans 'nightmares' online.
In the age of wall-to-wall CGI, there's still no replacing the real feel produced by a practical effect in a movie.
A straight up comparison between the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films, for example, can show how strange CGI sometimes looks next to top-notch practical effects.
Advert 10
However, sometimes such effects can look a little... interesting before post-production works its magic on them.
And a mask used in the new Indiana Jones movie has shown just that.
Creepy but also very impressive! Credit: Twitter/@IndianaJones_ch
The mask was worn by stunt doubles so that they would look more like star Harrison Ford. The effect would then be completed in post, and make the process easier than replacing the face altogether.
Advert 10
However, before post-production, they look somewhere between Michael Myers from Halloween and an old-school alien from Doctor Who.
And viewers were quick to pick up on the uncanny valley appearance of the mask, which featured both an old version and a young version for flashback scenes.
One person wrote: ""Seeing this right before bed on the night I saw the movie. 1000% nightmare fuel.""
Another joked: ""They should hand them out at each screening.""

Meanwhile, a third pointed out the resemblance to a certain villain, saying: ""Paint it white and you have a whole new Halloween franchise.""
And a fourth said: ""On one hand, this has been a thing for a while, on the other SWEET JESUS.""
Despite looking creepy, the masks also received some positive feedback, with fans remarking that they were still an improvement compared to an over-reliance on CGI.
One said: ""Looks better that the CGI face…""

Another wrote: ""Long proud history of these in movies. I'll take these over CGI any day because at least the brain knows there's a real person in the shot.""
""Horrifying, but at least movie magic blends this in, unlike CGI where it's almost always recognisable."" someone else commented.
Nonetheless, there was no denying that the masks were pretty horrifying to look at despite how fantastic they might look once the editing process was complete.
Advert 10
And it's not the first time that movies have taken an unusual approach when it comes to replacing the faces of actors in movies.
Stars Wars franchise movie, Rogue One, also featured the regenerated faces of Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin and Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia.
The film drew some criticism for 'resurrecting' the actors for their appearances instead of recasting the roles or writing around the characters, so there wouldn't be the need to use the technology.
And director Gareth Edwards responded to the criticism, telling CNN in 2017: ""I think it’s fair enough and you should tread carefully around this area.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaWxhZC5jb20vZmlsbS1hbmQtdHYvaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC1tYXNrLWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtZmlsbWluZy03MzQ2OTMtMjAyMzA3MDPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-07-13 15:00:49+00:00,Oscars: Will Harrison Ford get a farewell hug for playing Indiana Jones?,"Harrison Ford lost the 1985 Best Actor Oscar race for ""Witness"" to William Hurt (""Kiss of the Spider Woman"").","Harrison Ford is a legend. Indiana Jones is a legend. But despite the marriage between actor and character generating a legacy spanning five movies, multiple generations, billions of dollars, and the hearts of so many, the combination has never produced an Oscar nomination.
Ford himself has only ever been nominated for one Academy Award. That was for “Witness” all the way back in 1986 when Ford was nominated for playing a detective protecting an Amish eyewitness in Amish country. He lost that year to William Hurt, who won for “Kiss of the Spider Woman.” However, the real tragedy is that Ford wasn’t nominated for any of his performances as Indiana Jones. Sure, those aren’t the type of movies to land Best Actor bids, and hindsight is 20/20 of course, but when an actor with such star power comes along to play a character with such charisma, you have to sit up and take note of the talent it takes to pull that off.
How many actors could pull off the role of Indy with such casual charm? Not many, and the easy, light-hearted spirit of the role is captured so beautifully by Ford that he makes the craft of his performance look so easy. It’s a much more technical performance than people give him credit for, not to mention the fact that he did all of his own stunt work and strenuous physicality for the role. If actors are given credit for doing their own singing in biopics, then they should be appreciated for doing their own stunt work, too (stunt performers should also be given credit in their own right, but that’s a different story).
And Ford’s performance hasn’t dwindled with age. At 80 years old, Ford is still as charming and physical as ever and still possesses that playful gleam in his eye. But this time around, in “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” the franchise’s fifth and final movie, Ford gives Indy aching loneliness and gruffness that suits the character’s aging tenure as the true adventurer of his time. He is a man out of time — the opening sequence showing Indy in his prime via de-aging technology juxtaposes with the harsh imagery of him struggling to get out of bed as an old man and yelling at his neighbors to keep the music down.
This ties in with the movie’s exploration of time, as Indy and Phoebe Waller-Bridge‘s Helena Shaw race Madds Mikkelsen‘s Nazi villain to find the titular Dial of Destiny, a device created by Archimedes that plays with time. The final act, as all Indy films do (some more literally than others), takes a leap of faith into a jaw-dropping narrative left-turn. If you stay with it and push past the fantastical plot, at its center is an old man who is looking to avoid feeling out of place and time by willingly staying behind in the past. Helena doesn’t let him do this, of course, but it’s an emotional moment for Indy and viewers — those of us in the audience were shouting in our heads, “No, please don’t stay there, Indy. You’ll always have a place with us.”
It’s as if the film, directed by James Mangold, knew this itself and thankfully transported Indy back to his present day and reunited him with Karen Allen‘s Marion. It was another emotional moment, with a great throwback to “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” and was some of Ford’s finest work as an actor. We’ve never seen Indy, or Ford, for that matter, this vulnerable on screen and it felt like a seminal moment for Jones, Ford, and us. All of that culminates in what is a genuinely good performance, as critics have noted.
Peter Travers (ABC News) observed: “The wow factor in ‘Dial of Destiny’ comes totally from Ford, whose humor and humanity cuts through digital effects… Ford, working deep and true, sees to it that Indy goes out in a blaze of glory.” He continued: “Indiana Jones has given Ford something better than a gold statue — that’s movie immortality, an honor bestowed on very few. That’s why watching him take a final bow to the thrilling thrum of the John Williams score — a roguish gleam flashing in his eyes and inimitable crooked grin — is an occasion for cheers and tears. One word: Respect.”
The positive critical reception is one thing. The fact that Ford has only been nominated once for an Oscar is another. And the nostalgia surrounding this role is a third thing. Ford returning to play this role for one final time may be a narrative that may prove too powerful for voters to ignore. Ford’s “Temple of Doom” co-star Ke Huy Quan had a powerful narrative last year (so did Brendan Fraser, Michelle Yeoh, and Jamie Lee Curtis, for that matter) on his way to a Best Supporting Actor win and Ford could benefit from his own narrative this year. There is precedence, too. Sylvester Stallone returned to play the role of Rocky Balboa in “Creed.” That was a big, bold action movie, too, but voters still found heart in it thanks to Stallone’s performance as an aging Rocky and they nominated him for Best Supporting Actor.
That could happen to Ford here, particularly as the “Indiana Jones” franchise is actually steeped in pedigree. In total, the “Indiana Jones” film series has won six Oscars and been nominated 13 times across four movies. The last entry failed to reap any nominations at all from the Academy — and that, like “Dial of Destiny,” was a nostalgic sequel released decades after the previous movie. That doesn’t bode well for “Dial of Destiny.” However, this entry carries so much nostalgic power that they may just forget about that. The film could get snubbed in every other category but still land a bid for Ford, just like Stallone and “Creed.”
Plus, Ford is showing his skill as an actor now more than ever. He stars in the TV drama “1923” and the Apple TV+ comedy “Shrinking,” both of which could nominate him for an Emmy very soon. Those shows will help to boost him towards the Oscar ballot, the same way that Laura Dern‘s Emmy win for “Big Little Lies” helped her to win Best Supporting Actress in 2020 for “Marriage Story.”
Currently, however, Ford is not in our lineup of predicted nominees for Best Actor, which is at the moment made up of Paul Giamatti (“The Holdovers”), Colman Domingo (“Rustin”), Cillian Murphy (“Oppenheimer”), Bradley Cooper (“Maestro”), and Leonardo DiCaprio (“Killers of the Flower Moon”). It is very, very early days, however. If Disney mounts a campaign for Ford and starts pressing down on that nostalgic narrative, there could easily be a route for Indy and Ford. Here’s hoping.

In his way is the need to thwart one last attempt by the Nazis to use a time travel invention by Archimedes to change history and once again plunge the world into darkness.

,Harrison Ford's Heroic Legacy Explored in New PEOPLE Special Edition: From Landing 'Star Wars' to His Last Ride as Indy,"PEOPLE explores Harrison Ford's iconic movie career and life in a new Special Edition, looking back to his years as a carpenter in Hollywood before securing his iconic 'Star Wars' role as Han Solo — and how it led to another major film franchise as famous archeologist Indiana Jones","Harrison Ford has starred in some of the world's most popular movies — and yet he's said he never set out to be a movie star.

“I don’t want to be a movie star,” Ford, now 80, told PEOPLE in 1981. “I want to be in movies that are stars.”



Ford, a Park Ridge, Il., native, dropped out of Wisconsin's Ripon College to move to Los Angeles in 1964, though it took him close to a decade to break through in the film industry.

PEOPLE's new special edition, Harrison Ford: America's Greatest Movie Hero, is available now wherever magazines are sold.

After working for a number of years as a carpenter to supplement income earned from a contract with Columbia Pictures, the actor met eventual Star Wars creator George Lucas when he was cast in Lucas's 1973 movie American Graffiti.



Though Ford and Lucas had already worked together before Star Wars began searching for its Han Solo, Ford only got the part by happenstance: he was doing carpentry work for Francis Ford Coppola when Lucas and Richard Dreyfuss arrived to read for Solo. Eventually, Lucas asked Ford to read for the part — launching his career to new heights in a galaxy far, far away.



Ford went on to play Han Solo in all three original Star Wars movies, shocking fans when his character was indefinitely frozen in 1980's The Empire Strikes Back before his rescue in Return of the Jedi's opening sequence three years later. He also reprised the role in 2015's The Force Awakens, which made good on the actor's long-held desire to give Solo a tragic death.

Notably, the actor improvised perhaps the most memorable line of Star Wars' original trilogy: he decided to say ""I know,"" in response to Princess Leia's (Carrie Fisher) declaration of love, though the movie's original script called for a longer line and its director Irvin Kershner simply wanted Han to say ""I love you"" back.

Star Wars spawned a creative partnership between Lucas and Ford that was fastened further when the filmmaker teamed up with Steven Spielberg for what became the first Indiana Jones movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).

Surprisingly, Ford was not their first choice for the role: the two visionary filmmakers wanted to cast Tom Selleck, but when Selleck committed to film Magnum, P.I., instead, they turned to Ford, who helped spawn a second iconic Hollywood franchise. Ford reprises the role one last time in his new movie Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.

Jonathan Olley / Lucasfilm Ltd.

Spielberg's desire to collaborate with Ford did not end with Indiana Jones' adventures. The director filmed a cameo with Ford for his 1982 classic E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, in which Ford played Elliott's (Henry Thomas) school principal Harold Solo.



In the final cut of the film, the actor's face is obscured from full view, but a sequence was originally filmed that would have shown Ford in full view for a scene with Elliott and E.T. himself.

Ford debuted Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny at the Cannes Film Festival in May, with some critics calling it his ""most emotional"" performance as the character.

In September 2022, Ford himself got emotional while speaking at the D23 Expo and showcasing footage from the sequel to fans. ""Thank you for making these films such an incredible experience for all of us. I'm very proud to say that this one is fantastic,"" he said.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny opens in theaters June 30.

,Film Review: 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' is an ordinary closure for an extraordinary hero,This article is a film review written by Jude Hannahs for James Mangold’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” (2023).,"“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” (2023) opens with an extended-action flashback sequence where the audience is given the pleasure of seeing a beautifully done digitally de-aged Harrison Ford and his partner Basil Shaw (played by Toby Jones) fleeing from the Nazis on a moving train in the French Alps.

Jones and Shaw are there because they are trying to retrieve the Lance of Longinus, the blade that allegedly pierced the side of Jesus Christ as he hung on the cross during his crucifixion. The duo soon finds out that the lance is a fake but ends up leaving with another precious artifact: a half piece of Archimedes’ Dial.

Jones and Shaw manage to escape the Nazis and journey back home with the ancient mechanism that reveals time fissures, allowing for the possibility of time travel. After such a fun and exciting opening sequence, you would think that the rest of “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” would complement its opening with an even more entertaining movie. Unfortunately, the rest of the film fails to match the enjoyment of the first fifteen minutes.

“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is an inconsistent film. Some parts are good, some aren’t so good. That’s what happens when a sequel has been in development hell for many years. One thing this movie gets right is its leading performance.

Harrison Ford as the iconic Indiana Jones in all of his 81-year-old glory is without question the best part about the film. Ford has stated in numerous interviews that Indy is one of his favorite roles and has been waiting eagerly to return to the big screen. Ford delivers an amazing performance for a character that hasn’t been a part of popular culture for a long time.

Ford’s chemistry with the other actors/actresses in the film is also a highlight. Phoebe Waller-Bridge plays Helena Shaw—the daughter of Basil Shaw and goddaughter to Indiana Jones. The relationship between Waller-Bridge’s Helena and Ford’s Indy is rich.

They are complete opposites to each other. Indy is all about preserving ancient artifacts and not selling them in the black market whereas Helena has zero problem stealing something as valuable as Archimedes’ Dial and using it for financial gain. Throughout the runtime, the audience is given lots of good subtle character moments between the two.

The best scene of the film is just the two of them on a boat at night. Helena asks Indy what he would do if he could travel back in time. He responds that he would prevent his son Mutt Williams (played by Shia LaBeouf) from enlisting in the Vietnam War which resulted in him getting killed in action.

The emotion that Waller-Bridge shows after hearing that tragic piece of information coming from Ford is outstanding acting. The way Ford delivers his lines is heartbreaking and goes to show how committed he is to playing the character. Both Ford and Waller-Bridge give their A-game throughout the movie and it is pleasant to watch.

Where the movie falls apart is the lack of creativity in the script and its main villain. Acclaimed actor Mads Mikkelsen plays Jürgen Voller, an astrophysicist who worked for the Nazi regime and had a fascination for Archimedes' Dial. It is later revealed in the movie that Voller wants the dial to go back in time to 1939, assassinate Adolf Hitler and lead Germany to victory in World War II.

The issue with Voller as a villain isn’t the performance but rather the writing of the character. Voller is an extremely bland and forgettable villain for Indy to fight. He never really feels intimidating and the writers never give him any scenes to shine. It’s a total waste of a performance by such a talented actor as Mads Mikkelson.

What the previous Indiana Jones films had that this film doesn’t have were scenes that stuck with the audience. Yes, even “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” (2008) had many more scenes that resonated with moviegoers. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” suffers because it isn’t too different from any other generic Disney reboot/sequel.

However, one thing that I will credit the writers for is the climax of the film. Indy, Helena, Teddy (played Ethann Isidore) and Voller and the Nazis end up traveling back in time not to 1939 Nazi Germany but to the Siege of Syracuse in 212 B.C. There, Archimedes is constructing his dial while two armies are fighting against each other outside.

This climax caught me off guard so much that I must give credit where credit is due. The writers did take a chance on something that may or may not work for certain watchers. It’s by far the most ingenious and risky idea in the whole movie.

One other thing that needs to be addressed is how the film handles the relationship between Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood (played by Karen Allen). It is explained in the film that Indy and Marion decided to divorce after the death of their son created turmoil in their marriage.

What doesn’t work with this decision is that at the end of the movie, Indy and Marion reunite and romantically reconcile with each other. Why doesn’t this fit well? It's because we've already had Indy and Marion split before and have a happy ending in “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.”

The decision to divorce Indy and Marion after they had gotten married to just reunify them in this movie is sloppy screenwriting and mirrors most of the film.

“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is neither a bad film nor a good film either. It has its ups and downs which makes it hard to recommend to both lifelong fans of Indiana Jones and regular film viewers. If you are interested in seeing it, then go watch it. If you are not interested in seeing it, then you don’t have to watch it. Either way isn’t a bad resolution.

Rating: 2.5/5

Let's face it: ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was always going to be at the bottom of the list.

No, it's not quite as bad as you might remember, but it's not exactly good either.

It still has all the signature wit and action that comes with an ""Indiana Jones"" movie, but there is a lot of it that feels unbelievable — even for a franchise that investigates the supernatural.

Indy surviving a nuclear blast by stuffing himself into a fridge is practically laughable, and don't even get us started on the alien plot twist in the climax.

""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is only kept upright by the impressive cast, including Academy Award winner Cate Blanchett, who clearly has a lot of fun chewing the scenery as Russian villain Irina Spalko.

It's also great to see Karen Allen reprise her role as Marion Ravenwood, and the dynamic she has with Indy all those years after ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is still just as palpable. Their relationship is arguably the best thing about the movie.

Shia LeBeouf as their son, Mutt Williams?

Most would describe actor Harrison Ford‘s approach to life as ‘dry wit.’ He’s sarcastically stoic in many of his most iconic roles, like Han Solo in the Star Wars series and, of course, Indiana Jones. Every Ford fan is dying to see the newest installment in the Indiana Jones film franchise, and finally, Dial of Destiny debuts in theaters tonight and is fully released tomorrow! Disney and Lucasfilm have done a bunch of promotions for Indiana Jones 5, but you can’t help but smile at this latest video featuring Indiana Jones action figures.

Lucasfilm uploaded an absolutely adorable video to YouTube featuring Harrison Ford and Dial of Destiny co-star Phoebe Waller-Bridge. With the Indiana Jones soundtrack playing in the background, the video opens on a table holding action figures of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones and Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Helena Shaw. The dolls are surrounded by the Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Lego set.

The first question the director asks the co-stars is, “Did they get the likeness okay?” After inspecting his figure on the table, Harrison Ford replies, “I’m actually bigger than that.” Hilarious. Classic Harrison Ford. Phoebe and the crew laugh as Ford gives a shrugging smirk.

Waller-Bridge is impressed at all the different Indy figures from all the different ages. She lists out Lego Indy, Big Indy, and Car Whipping Indy. You’ll have to watch the video to see what she’s referring to. She asks which of those three Ford feels most drawn to, and he replies casually but CLEARLY into it, “The biggest one.” Waller-Bridge does a Fleabag-style reaction to the cameras.

Later, Phoebe can’t get her action figure to stand up, and they wonder if Indy’s hat can come off. Ford nearly removes the doll’s head when he tries. Perhaps the cutest part of the interview is when Ford and Waller-Bridge march the action figures around while they sing Indiana Jones’ iconic theme music.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny star Shaunette Renée Wilson has revealed she asked for changes to an ""offensive"" scene.

The actress plays Agent Mason in the fifth film of the franchise, which is set to be Harrison Ford's final appearance as the iconic adventurer.

In an interview with Variety, Wilson said she initially took issue with the way her character exited the film, but subsequently altered the scene after collaborating with director James Mangold.

""Initially I found it [the scene] to be a little too offensive and a bit problematic, and I was like, 'We probably don't need to say these words or have it done this way, and this is something I'm uncomfortable with,'"" she said before praising the director.

""He was like, 'You know what, you're completely right, I hear you. That's something I flagged as well.' And we were able to work on that.""

The actress, who has also appeared in Black Panther and Billions, described the series as ""special"" in an exclusive interview with Digital Spy last month, explaining why the films appeal to such a wide audience.

“It's the humanity of this character,"" she said. ""We all kind of see ourselves in him, in some respect, whether it's the naughty side, the antihero, the curmudgeon, the humour, the sexy guy – whatever it is. To kind of track his journey in this world, I think is just really special.""

,Harrison Ford and Phoebe Waller-Bridge are fighting for their lives in the otherwise lifeless Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"If there is one thing to take away from Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, it is that we owe the much-maligned prior entry...","click to enlarge Less boulder, more older.

If there is one thing to take away from Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, it is that we owe the much-maligned prior entry Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull an apology. At least that was well-directed and dynamic where this new entry is not.

While both are imperfect sequels that attempt to build on a trilogy that concluded decades ago, the first crack at it now looks downright charming. For any who bemoan its ""nuking the fridge"" scene, moments like that fit in well with the cartoonish roots of the character. Above all else, it saw series director Steven Spielberg returning to prove he is still a talented filmmaker whose passion and precision are now painfully absent here. All the fridge nuking in the world would be more fun than whatever this is. The only saving grace is the cast, but they are trapped in the confines of a surprisingly dull film.

Starting it all off is an extended flashback scene in 1944 where Indiana Jones must fight the Nazis once again. Yet, we don't really see Harrison Ford in any real sense for quite a while. Rather, we see a digitally de-aged version of him that, while not the worst example of the technology, still holds viewers at a distance that grows increasingly distracting. Worse still, the stiffness of his voice sounds perpetually off, making it hard to get immersed in what is meant to be the movie's exciting start, while also establishing the timey wimey artifact that the characters will spend the rest of the film chasing.

When the film then jumps forward decades into the future as the space race is in full swing, we pick back up with Ford's Jones in the actual flesh in what is initially promising fashion. Drunkenly passed out in his apartment, he is stirred from his fitful slumber by the loud music of his neighbors. He grumpily yells at them to turn it off before going to his last day of work before a forced retirement. This is complicated when his goddaughter Helena, played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge (of the spectacular and shattering series Fleabag) pays him a visit to ask about said time artifact he recovered back in 1944.

Of course, since this is an Indiana Jones film, a group of Nazi goons — led by Mads Mikkelsen's Dr. Jürgen Voller — are not far behind. Cue the classic John Williams theme as we then go on one last globe-trotting adventure. (At least, one hopes this is the last one, if any future sequels are going to be as banal as this one.)

It isn't that Dial of Destiny does anything particularly egregious, as it mostly plays out as a greatest hits of Indiana Jones from solving puzzles to evading creepy-crawlies, but there is nothing all that bold about it either. When the execution of these rather safe sequences are pedestrian at best and plodding at worst, it soon grows tiresome rather than thrilling. Though it picks up in the finale by taking us somewhere Indiana Jones has never gone before, the superficial and often empty road to get there undercuts the more bonkers swing it attempts. For a film about a character looking to the past, you'd have hoped it would have learned something new rather than just regurgitating more of the same that we've all seen done far better before.

There is still something more substantial Ford brings, but we only get small glimpses of it. Jones carries plenty of regrets, and we see they have taken their toll on him. Ford has portrayed this character more than any other, and it's unfortunate to see the care for the role be let down by the slapdash film around him. Even the action — which had a kineticism in all of the past films, even in Crystal Skull — is without the same spark. The back-and-forth Ford has with a delightful Waller-Bridge is the only thing keeping the film even close to afloat. This was obviously never going to be a fully somber affair, as the series has always been centered on adventure, but the scenes where the two performers are given space to delve into loss makes one wish this impatient yet also oddly rushed film had not been so averse to leaning into this pathos.

Though the way the ending leaves behind silly spectacle for genuine emotion is unexpectedly sweet, it comes far too late to matter much. Much like how Jones himself was haunted by the mistakes that accumulated in his past, the last-ditch attempt by the film itself to tap into something deeper can't stop it all from slipping away. ♦

The best special effect in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny isn’t a stunt, an explosion, or a CGI re-creation of another time. It’s the sight of Harrison Ford being overcome with emotion. It happens several times in the film, which — like director James Mangold’s other meditation on aging heroes, Logan — is about older people reluctantly admitting that their once-indestructible bodies are crumbling, that there’s more life behind them than ahead, and their failures are so numerous that they can’t even be tallied up, much less atoned for.

One such moment finds Indy, now a depressed, 70-year-old, newly retired professor and international fugitive, standing on the deck of a boat with his goddaughter and partner-in-adventure Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). Helena asks Indy what he would do if he could go back in time and change one thing. He says he would prevent his son Mutt, who died in Vietnam, from enlisting, a tragedy that led to the collapse of his marriage to the great love of his life, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). Ford plays the first part of the moment turned partly away from the camera. It was a wise decision: The sound of his rumbling baritone voice fragmenting with sorrow is so affecting that if he’d played the whole scene head-on, the film might not have recovered.

He does it again near the end of the film, when Indy is given a chance to enter history itself via time travel and literally live in the past — something he’s been figuratively doing by fixating on his mistakes and losses, and hiding from the people that he associates with them. When Indy admits he wishes to stay in the past, there’s a desperation and brokenness to Ford’s delivery. It reminded me of visiting my grandfather in a retirement home and hearing his voice break as he said that he wished he could be 20 again, before the Depression, the war, and decades in an emotionally abusive marriage ground him down. He wanted to have a young face and body again, but mostly he wanted to remember what it felt like not to have the tragic knowledge he’d gained over time. In Dial of Destiny’s coda, Indy wakes up again in the present, like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, and he and Marion sit down for a quiet exchange, each seemingly now willing to work through their problems. The takeaway, perhaps, is that it’s braver to face reality head-on than try to escape it. The sentiment retroactively seizes a five-chapter pulp-fantasy series in which lost Arks disintegrate Nazis and 800-year-old Grail Knights wave farewell from ancient tombs and grounds it in the cold facts of time, age, and mortality. It’s powerful.

Ford’s long career earns a lot of adjectives, but “powerful” isn’t the first that springs to mind. He never seemed intent on knocking viewers over with emotional force. The last 15 years of Ford’s career, however, have been distinguished by cracks-in-the-monument moments, in which tough, accomplished men let us see what a mess they are inside, rather than continue to hide it with pride and bluster. It’s impressive because these moments seem to come from an authentic place, and because Ford is like this now in project after project: emotionally transparent, vulnerable, unafraid — not of physical injury, because Ford was always great at communicating that fear, but of having his deepest, most anguished self on display for the other characters and his audience to scrutinize.

These men are often devastated by events that transpired a long time ago — ones they were at least partially responsible for.

From his breakthrough as Han Solo in the original Star Wars through his box-office heyday in the ’80s and ’90s, Ford was a leading man who checked most of the boxes and then some. He had astonishing physical control — remember the way Indiana Jones’s knees cartoonishly buckle in Raiders of the Lost Ark after a Nazi strongman clocks him? And he was convincing as a man hopelessly intoxicated by a woman (see the original Blade Runner, Witness, Working Girl, Sabrina, and, in a way, The Fugitive), a feat that Robert De Niro, to name just one of Ford’s more respected contemporaries, has never done convincingly unless stalking was involved. But Ford let us feel when his heroes were in over their heads, too, or flat-out scared to die, and it helped convince audiences that one of the handsomest and most physically assured men ever to step in front of a lens was just a regular Joe.

All that said, a big part of what made Ford special was the way he underplayed everything, including outwardly “big” moments. He often withheld obvious signifiers of emotionality so that the little glimpses he did give you felt like piercing anomalies. (See: the expression of absolute gratitude on Indy’s face in The Temple of Doom when the voodoo potion wears off and he hugs his rescuer Short Round.) The actor is bringing the same understated directness to the most recent phase of his career. The stakes tend to be more internalized and personal, because they’re about grappling with what already happened in the Ford character’s life. He not only encourages us to share the characters’ regret, alienation, and sadness, he treats these feelings as a brittle core around which fantastic visions can be wound.

Ford has been doing what Clint Eastwood gets a lot more credit for but doesn’t do anywhere near as consistently or with as much simplicity and force. His brand now — you could even say it’s his calling — is to embed ordinary but universal anxieties about age and the certainty of death into the kinds of glossy mainstream productions that more often validate viewers’ fantasies of being the bosses of their own fate. Big-budget adventures, fantasies, and science-fiction films have cast him as familiar heroes (often ones he’s already played) adrift in a world that doesn’t care what they want or need. These men are often devastated by events that transpired a long time ago — ones they were at least partially responsible for, and that landed them in the melancholy, borderline impotent predicaments they’re in now.

This comes through most strongly in the three legacy characters Ford has revisited later in life: Indiana Jones, Star Wars’ Han Solo, and Blade Runner’s Rick Deckard. All three are loners hiding from themselves, their existences defined by regret and loss. In the Disney Star Wars sequel The Force Awakens, Ford’s space pirate turned stalwart rebel has gone back to scuttling around the fringes of intergalactic smuggling. The more time we spend with the character, the more we realize that he’s distracting himself from obsessing over the failure of his relationship with Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and his shame over their son Ben (Adam Driver) turning to evil. (Both Indy and Han’s marriages fell apart because they were emotionally incapable of giving their partners the support they needed after losing a son — figuratively in The Force Awakens, literally in Dial of Destiny.) Solo, introduced in the 1977 original as a Humphrey Bogart–style cynical materialist who turns idealist when circumstances demand it, dies because of that very same capacity for optimism. He embraces Ben on a catwalk, hoping to use fatherly love to turn his son back toward goodness, and gets a lightsaber through the gut for his trouble. The look of agonized disappointment on Ford’s face as Han dies is more wrenching than the character’s plunge to oblivion. It’s the death of an illusion.

In Blade Runner 2049, meanwhile, Ford’s former replicant hunter Rick Deckard is now a hermit living in an abandoned casino in a radiation-poisoned Las Vegas, a purgatorial landscape that mirrors his ruination after losing his great love, the android Rachel (Sean Young). The peak of the performance is when a corporate overlord (Jared Leto) gifts Deckard with a “new” Rachel. Ford’s face maps Deckard’s tragic progression from wonder and anticipation at this promised reunion to disgust and regret at having to accept that this Rachel is only a simulation, and the real thing can never return.

Even some of the lesser films Ford’s done since hitting retirement age show him leaning into melancholy and, at key points, falling into an abyss of despair. The role that’s taken Ford deeper into an old man’s sadness than any other to date is in a lesser-seen, perhaps surprising film: The Age of Adaline, a Blake Lively vehicle about an ageless woman who has to keep abandoning relationships before her community can figure out her secret. Ford plays William, who is happily married (to Kathy Baker) but goes to pieces after recognizing Adaline as the long-lost great love of his life. The younger incarnation of Ford the movie star rarely presented himself this way. His characters’ emotional pressure points were usually hidden beneath a carapace of patriarchal authority and unexamined entitlement: They were either the bosses of others or one-man islands. And while they sometimes (briefly) broke down, they rarely fell apart.

Ford’s work in Adaline ranks with his very best and foregrounds a truth about some of his iconic earlier characters that people joke about but tend not to examine closely: Han Solo, Indiana Jones, and Rick Deckard have all the outward hallmarks of a tough, capable, self-actualized hero, but like most of us, were more often acted upon by events than capable of controlling them. Ford excels at playing action heroes swept away by forces larger than any one person, group, or nation. They don’t so much direct the waves of action as ride them.

His two Jack Ryan movies end with Ryan defeating specific villains without changing the corrupt institutions that enfold them, because that would be impossible. Han Solo gets pulled into the rebellion, sticks around, leaves it, gets pulled back in, leaves it again, and so on; he’s important to its success, but he’s just one small part, and he spends a lot of his time trying not to get tied down to it. Every Indiana Jones film ends with Indy witnessing a miracle that then passes, returning him to ordinary life. Both Blade Runner movies center on police officers who are overwhelmed by conspiracies, corporate skullduggery, and the city’s endless scope. In the first Blade Runner, Deckard can only save Rachel because he’s already been saved by another android, his quarry Roy Batty, who broke his fingers and let him dangle from a ledge before deciding to pull him up and let him live. In the second Blade Runner, Deckard is saved from drowning by another android, Ryan Gosling’s K, who then dies reuniting Deckard with the daughter he’d never met. Ford’s action-hero filmography is more about survival than winning. It’s about existing within limits and sneaking a little bit of goodness into a ruined world. For all their righteous fearlessness and kinetic daring, the Ford hero is, to quote a line from The Last Crusade, as human as the next man. There’s only so much he can do.

This was the subtext of Ford’s career in his 30s, 40s, and 50s. But the older Ford hero excavates this idea, polishes it up, and foregrounds it. It was a timepiece all along. The clock is running out for Indy, for Ford, for all of us. That’s why it’s so right that Dial of Destiny focuses on time and the yearning to roll it back and redo history, or just start again in a place where no one knows you. Even if such things could happen, the script implies, they shouldn’t. Ford is the weathered face of this truth.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC1hbmQtdGhlLXJhdmFnZXMtb2YtdGltZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-19 18:44:34+05:30,Hollywood going the AI way: How the new Indiana Jones movie de-aged actor Harrison Ford,"With a team of 100 artists, ILM used its FaceSwap technology to make the 80-year-actor, Harrison Ford, look young in the movie Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.","While many writers and actors are opposing the use of Artificial Intelligence, there are some in the industry who are embracing the technology. In the recently released Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the creators, with the help of Industrial Light and Magic visual effect company, de-aged the lead actor Harrison Ford.

With a team of 100 artists, ILM used its FaceSwap technology to make the 80-year-actor look young in the film. ILM used tools like CGI, machine learning and “geometry derived from photography” for the 25-minute flashback sequence in the film. ILM senior publicist Ian Kintzle told Inverse, “We knew that we were gonna be using every single technique we had produced to date and whatever else we could develop for this production and to use in the future.”

The creators used extra cameras along with the main camera to capture all the necessary data including lighting and even details of Ford’s face. ILM’s VFX supervisor Robert Weaver revealed that AI played a major role in this process. ILM used a computer to scour through old Indiana Jones films which gave them enough reference images to match each shot in Dial of Destiny.

Once the film was fully shot, creators went shot-by-shot and used FaceSwap technology to make Ford look younger. Weaver revealed that machine learning helped them get a 2D replica of what they needed but they also needed a little help from 3D scans of the actor's face. For this, the franchise’s protagonist- Harrison Ford had to go through the process of recording his facial expressions in different scenes which were then combined to get the final performance. Notably, The Dial of Destiny took three long years in the making before it hit the theaters.

ILM has used similar techniques in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and The Mandalorian. In addition to these, Marvel Cinematic Universe and Martin Scorsese' The Irishman have also utilised similar techniques.

2023-07-20 15:40:00+00:00,Boyd Holbrook Breaks Down His ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ and ‘Justified: City Primeval’ Baddies,"Boyd Holbrook talks about his villains in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Justified: City Primeval opposite Harrison Ford, Timothy Olyphant.","[This story contains spoilers for Justified: City Primeval‘s two-episode premiere and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.]

From Logan and Sandman to Indiana Jones and Raylan Givens, Boyd Holbrook has a knack for being a thorn in the hero’s side.

Holbrook recently returned to the big screen in James Mangold’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which marked the conclusion of Harrison Ford’s 42-year tenure as the title character of Indiana Jones. The Kentucky native played Klaber, a neo-Nazi wannabe who served as Jürgen Voller’s (Mads Mikkelsen) top lieutenant, resembling Holbrook’s role as Donald Pierce in Mangold’s Oscar-nominated film, Logan (2017). Despite some early reservations over the similar parts, Holbrook couldn’t resist the opportunity to work with Ford and help say goodbye to his iconic and daring archaeologist.

“Jim [Mangold] called and said, ‘Listen, I don’t want to offend you, but have a look at it,’” Holbrook told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike. “So the character was a similar second-in-command bad guy who does all the bidding. That was the similarity, and that was my hesitation when I read it. But then there’s the pull of, ‘Wow, this is the last hurrah. This is the last run of Indiana Jones.’ So I didn’t want to repeat anything for Jim, and we were very adamant about that.”

Dial of Destiny revolves around the decades-long pursuit of Archimedes’ time dial, the Antikythera, as Klaber (Holbrook) wants to help Voller travel back to 1939, so he can replace Hitler and lead Nazi Germany to victory during World War II. Voller ultimately commandeered the Dial from Indy but severely miscalculated along the way, resulting in a group trip to the Siege of Syracuse in 212 BC. Despite Holbrook’s first-hand involvement, Indy’s voyage to the past still moved him as an audience member.

“It’s so elegantly done that it’s not farcical whatsoever,” Holbrook said. “It bottlenecks to a really touching moment where you feel that Indiana has earned this moment and wants to stay. When I saw it, I was surprised that it grabbed me by the throat. I was a little emotional, even though I’m so close to it.”

Holbrook also plays the main villain on Justified: City Primeval, FX’s revival of one of its most beloved television properties. Timothy Olyphant’s affable U.S. Marshal character, Raylan Givens, ends up having to pass through Detroit while on a road trip with his now-teenage daughter, Willa (Vivian Olyphant), and their stay in the Motor City is quickly extended due to a double murder involving Holbrook’s Clement Mansell.

Written by co-showrunners Michael Dinner and Dave Andron, the second episode of the two-episode premiere, “The Oklahoma Wildman,” ends with Raylan beating Mansell to a pulp for threatening Willa, and Holbrook wants to make it clear that this is only the beginning of the lawman’s showdown with his murderous conman.

“Clement can’t get enough of it. He loves it. He loves screwing around with this guy to a point, and then it gets a little too serious. But it is a totally different dynamic than Boyd Crowder [Walton Goggins]. Those guys knew each other, and there’s more longevity between the characters. Being that this is a limited series, the structure is built from the get-go that these guys are gonna collide.”

Below, during a spoiler-filled conversation with THR, Holbrook talks Indy and Justified, while also looking ahead to Jeff Nichols’ long-awaited sixth film, The Bikeriders, co-starring Tom Hardy, Austin Butler, Jodie Comer and Michael Shannon.



Well, it’s an exciting time for you right now.

Yeah, it is. I did a lot of things over the pandemic, and now they’re all bottlenecking.

When I last spoke to you for The Fugitive (2020), the key point you made was that you wouldn’t have said yes to the project if you were asked to play the fourth version of Dr. Richard Kimble. So when you were eventually cast in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny alongside the second Dr. Richard Kimble, Harrison Ford, I said to myself, “I bet Boyd is even more glad that he didn’t end up playing Richard Kimble.” Did that ever cross your mind once you knew you’d be working with Harrison?

Yeah, for sure. I wondered if he was aware of things and what he would say, because there’s always a predecessor to something. And I guess you always want a little bit of approval if you’re in it for the right reasons. But it never came up. We stuck to the business at hand. And watching Harrison work, there’s a reason why I had that initial reservation.

There’s even a stretch of the film where Indy is a fugitive and you’re the one chasing after him.

I didn’t even think about that. It’s funny how everything just gets thrown in a blender and all of our soups kind of come together.

Other actors have told me that you get over the Harrison Ford of it all rather quickly just because he’s pretty cool and whatnot. Was that your experience as well?

Absolutely. Harrison cuts the mustard, man! He gets it off the plate really quick. It’s like a construction site. That’s what I also love about Jim Mangold. He’s just very to the point; direct, blunt and has a good sense of humor while doing it, which makes for a great work environment. Harrison had this saying on set, “Alright, let’s shoot this piece of shit,” and it just cut the air out of everything. So we gave it 10 tries, two tries, 20 tries until we got it. And that’s what acting is all about.

When James Mangold came to you with this role, it was probably an easy sell on one level because it’s Harrison Ford’s final Indiana Jones movie. But the flip side is that you had just played another lead henchman of sorts for Jim in Logan. So did he carefully differentiate these guys to you, assuming you would probably notice the similarity?

You’re a hundred percent right. You hit the nail on the head, man. Jim called and said, “Listen, I don’t want to offend you, but have a look at it.” I don’t know if it was because of what the character did or who he’s associated with or the size of the part. We talked about doing another project before this, but I looked at it and it was Indiana Jones. So the character was a similar second-in-command bad guy who does all the bidding. That was the similarity, and that was my hesitation when I read it. But then there’s the pull of, “Wow, this is the last hurrah. This is the last run of Indiana Jones.” So I didn’t want to repeat anything for Jim, and we were very adamant about that.

I think the character was even written as German in the beginning, but I couldn’t figure out why this guy was hanging out with these neo-Nazis. Why was he not in Haight-Ashbury, smoking a spliff or something? (Laughs.) But then I got into it and thought, “Well, he wants to be a part of this gang or club because nobody else wants the guy. He’s just a vagrant mess.” And then he’s trying to learn German to fit in; he’s eager. So I just had to figure out how to humanize it and make a character that I could actually believe, instead of just the surface or veneer of whatever. So we talked a lot about that.

The term “trigger-happy” feels like an understatement in regard to Klaber, so he really did drink Voller’s Kool-Aid if he was that quick to kill for him.

Yeah, I thought about it as Voller being this enterprise that was starting up, and Klaber was getting equity in the startup as the first on board. So the loyalty and the dedication comes from, “Well, I’m gonna be first in line and at the top of the totem pole when we get to the new island.” He was a mad lapdog.

I based it all upon being accepted by Voller. It’s a classic archetype of approval. You’ve gotta find something real in there. Birds of a feather flock together, but I don’t think Voller’s ideology came first. I think Klaber was just desiring a real primitive acceptance that he’s never had. So, somebody didn’t love him.

Were you pretty blown away when you found out the characters would be time traveling to the Siege of Syracuse in 212 BC?

I was. I thought it was a bold, earned choice. It’s so cleverly speckled in throughout the film. Those seeds are planted, and it’s preparing you for it, subliminally. You don’t really know it until it’s happening and it’s so elegantly done that it’s not farcical whatsoever. It bottlenecks to a really touching moment where you feel that Indiana has earned this moment and wants to stay. When I saw it, I was surprised that it grabbed me by the throat. I was a little emotional even though I’m so close to it.

Many decades from now, what day on Dial of Destiny are you going to tell your grandkids about first?

Good question, bud. And God, there are a lot. You remind yourself every day that this is the last one, and so there’s a really special feeling that it puts off. There was a fantastic scene, and just watching Harrison work was a true master class. It’s mainly a scene between Dr. Schmidt [Voller’s American alias] and Indiana where he’s shot, and Dr. Schmidt is about to transform back into Voller. And Harrison just used the rocking motion of the [plane] to come up into this line of dialogue. So there were just moments like that that I got to be around all the time and soak up, and so it was a great experience. A real experience.

Before we get into Justified: City Primeval, I would love to hear about your time on The Bikeriders because I’m a Jeff Nichols fanatic.

Oh, I couldn’t be more excited about something. I did a little run here with The Sandman, Indiana Jones and then Justified, which was a dark period, I guess. That’s just the way it happened, but with The Bikeriders, it’s a totally different character and color to all of this other stuff that we’re talking about. And Jeff is a national treasure of a director. He is Americana filmmaking. He’s exceptional. We had a great cast, and it’s an excellent time in history. It’s the early ‘60s when biker clubs were getting put together and culture was really developing. It’s great. I’ve seen most of it, and it’s really good.

So, from one trigger-happy lunatic to the next one, we’ve now arrived at Justified’s Clement Mansell. He’s a sadistic killer and thief, but the oddest detail about him is that he’s apparently a musician who refuses to share demos of his own White Stripes covers with anyone but himself. Sandy said that he doesn’t play his stuff for her. Could you make sense of that?

Well, the reason why I got into the show was because a friend of mine who worked on season five asked me if all the same people were still involved, and I said yes. And he said, “Run, don’t walk, to the project.” So that [detail] wasn’t in the book. I don’t know which brilliant dude created it, whether it was [co-showrunner] Dave Andron, [co-showrunner] Michael Dinner or [EP] Graham Yost. But they gave Clement so much humanity. He just really thinks he’s gonna make it. He really thinks he’s this undiscovered talent. And when all of this stuff comes up about his past, he thinks it’ll just legitimize him as this outlaw, disillusioned singer. But he’s really just mentally ill.

Do you think he genuinely loves Sandy (Adelaide Clemens), or does he just need her for the game they run on wealthy marks?

He trusts Sandy. He can trust Sandy, and that’s a big thing. That’s got a lot of traction on it, but Sweety [Vondie Curtis-Hall] is the one that he admires. Sweety is somebody he really looks up to, because he’s done the things musically that he’s looking to do. So there’s a lot of great relationships in the show. It’s fantastic writing.

So was it a painful day when Quentin Tarantino had to drop out as director?

Yeah, that was tough. That was how I discovered the project. I was offered the part, and things happened. We had a great time, and I hope to still work with Quentin one day. That’d be great. I know [Justified] is one of his favorite shows, so hopefully he’ll be tuning in. But yeah, it was great, man. It was a great experience. I can’t really complain. Things happen.

In the first episode, Clement instigates a high-speed car chase involving guns, and it’s quite eerie considering a very similar real-life situation happened to cross paths with your set. Were you anywhere near this incident?

Yeah, I had wrapped up my scene, and it took place in between my scene and the next one up. So I was a couple football fields away, maybe. But these things happen in big cities, sometimes, and luckily, no one was hurt. Fiction does imitate life.

Well, in the second episode, Raylan confronts Clement in relation to the murders of a judge (Keith David) and his assistant. And then Clement declares war by seeking out and threatening Raylan’s daughter, Willa (Vivian Olyphant), without her realizing it. Raylan then proceeds to unload a few fists on him in retaliation. Was this encounter just the tip of the iceberg for what’s to come between them?

Yeah, Clement can’t get enough of it. He loves it. He loves screwing around with this guy to a point, and then it gets a little too serious. But it is a totally different dynamic than Boyd Crowder [Walton Goggins]. Those guys knew each other, and there’s more longevity between the characters. Being that this is a limited series, the structure is built from the get-go that these guys are gonna collide.

You’ve mentioned wanting to find humanity in both Klaber and Mansell, but could you really pull that off, especially with a guy like Mansell?

I dissect the script and figure out what I am getting out of it. If it has heart, then it has heart. If it’s not that, then what else is it? Because it can’t be one note. I don’t want to give one note. And the great thing about Justified is that it’s fucked up and funny. That balances the show out.

2023-06-30 14:02:44+00:00,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Is a Failure,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a fiasco for two reasons. Admittedly, one reason is purely personal, and so that’s on me.","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a fiasco for two reasons. Admittedly, one reason is purely personal, and so that’s on me. The other, though, is totally the movie’s fault.

Dial of Destiny is the fifth movie in the Indiana Jones franchise, an action-adventure series that began and seemingly ended in the ‘80s as a perfectly self-contained trilogy. The third film was even subtitled The Last Crusade and featured our intrepid, titular hero riding off into the sunset. Nothing else needed to be said, right?

19 years after the “final” 1989 theatrical adventure, the original creative trio–series creator George Lucas, director Steven Spielberg, and star, Harrison Ford–all returned for another Indy adventure only to prove that no, nothing else needed to be said about the character.

So here we are, another 15 years later and another go at an Indy adventure, this time with only minimal involvement from Lucas and Spielberg. I hoped this movie’s existence was based on course correcting from the last adventure, an apology for what went wrong the last time. I mean, Harrison Ford is 80 years old, what else could sway him to once again don Indiana Jones’s iconic fedora, leather jacket, and whip?

Money, probably.

But I’m not that cynical. Harrison Ford has plenty of that (…money, I mean, though a healthy dose of cynicism as well, it seems). Plus, his grouchy demeanor and apparent displeasure at being on movie sets, preclude him from doing something solely for the cash.

My hopes for Dial of Destiny’s course correction were dashed almost immediately, though. The original trilogy of films had muscular action sequences with real stunts: dudes dragged underneath trucks, jumping from a horse to a real tank, actual motorcycles careening off cliffs with stuntpersons freefalling through the air.

Dial of Destiny kicks off with a twenty-minute sequence featuring a (*sigh*) de-aged Harrison Ford. Motionless, the effect is quite good. Lots of details on the face. Once things start moving, though, all bets are off. It looks painfully awkward: a too big head on a normal size body, a weird cg blur over the face. The opening sequence’s main event is a lengthy chase/fight on a train. The entire sequence is accomplished through thoroughly unconvincing CG. Worse, the avalanche of computer graphics completely erases any semblance of danger, which wipes out all hopes for excitement. On the big screen were explosions, gunfights, John Williams’s iconic score blaring in the background; in the auditorium, a dude started vaping. Not a good sign.

Even moving to its present day of the 1960s, the whole movie is shellacked in a thick miasma of CG. But the computer graphics imagery isn’t the movie’s real dilemma. The problem here is the director, James Mangold. He simply doesn’t have a feel for action. As befits an Indiana Jones movie, Dial of Destiny is filled with it–mostly chases on a variety of vehicles both organic and in-, mostly I assume because Harrison Ford is too old to be involved in any other kind of action–but they’re largely pointless endeavors because they lack narrative drive or reason. The chases begin and end seemingly at random. It’s never clear who’s chasing whom and why, and they don’t build to anything. Mostly, they just…end. They’re just there to fill the setpiece quota expected from an Indiana Jones film.

So much of the movie does just that: fill a quota. Since the original Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones is known to hate snakes, and so he had to face a tomb full of them in that first film. So what do we have here? Indiana facing eels under water. In Temple of Doom, Indiana had to face a room infested with bugs, so Dial has to have a sequence with bugs also. And again, like the action sequences, none of these moments are presented with any aplomb. Remember how the bug sequence in Doom kept escalating? The ceiling began lowering, threatening to crush our protagonist while squeezing even more bugs onto him. Then someone had to stick their hand into a hole swarming with even more creepy crawlys to pull a lever and stop the crushing. It built tension, anxiety, and the audience’s gag-reflex. Here, in the fifth film, the bugs show up, crawl on our hero a bit, and just as quickly disappear when he turns a corner. How are the bugs in only one small section of a cave? They read the script, obviously. The same happens with the eel sequence. They show up without build-up, harass only Indiana for some reason and not his diving mates (like Steve Zissou and his leeches), and then just disappear.

Add a painful repetitiveness to the general lackluster presentation and you have yourself one lame-duck adventure movie (Do me a favor, count how many times an innocent person is threatened with a gun to the face during the film’s runtime). What really grinds my gears about the film, though, is that its very existence stands in direct contrast to what the Indiana Jones movies were made for in the first place. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg loved the heroes (square jawed, indestructible) of matinee adventure serials (think Zorro, Lone Ranger…) of their youth. Indiana Jones was their homage to those heroes and movies. They were built to be pure action-adventure escapism. An 80-year-old Indiana Jones, grappling with old age, the death of loved ones, feelings of uselessness and alienation from a society that’s moving on without him is bold, yes, and preferrable to pretending he’s still a spring chicken, but it’s antithetical to what the character of Indiana Jones was created for.

It’s a bait and switch. I’m at the tail end of 45 years on this earth. Every day I’m reminded that I’m getting older. It sucks. I need escapism more than ever. Indiana Jones by its very nature is an explicit promise of that break from reality. Instead, this new “adventure” gives you a dour two plus hours that reminds you with every passing frame of the ravages of age. I would say it’s time for this franchise to hang up its fedora for good, but it never should have picked it back up in first place.

2023-06-14 20:13:38+05:30,Helen Mirren calls Harrison Ford a ‘god-given movie star’; shares her experience of working with Indiana Jones actor,Helen Mirren starred opposite Harrison Ford for the first time in Peter Weir's The Mosquito Coast. The duo was last seen together in Taylor Sheridan's Western drama television series 1923.,"Harrison Ford continues to radiate brilliance even at the age of 80 and is now gearing up for the release of his latest flick Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. This eagerly anticipated film stands as the grand finale of the awe-inspiring Indiana Jones saga, further solidifying the Hollywood actor’s everlasting legacy as the indomitable Indiana Jones.

While many celebrities have previously voiced their appreciation for Ford, renowned British actor Helen Mirren recently unleashed her unbridled admiration for the Star Wars actor, referring to him as a “god-given movie star”.

Mirren, who starred opposite Ford for the first time in Peter Weir’s The Mosquito Coast (1986), told PEOPLE, “I think the element that makes him the legend that he is and will be is that sense of being the kind of guy you would call when your car got stuck in a ditch and also completely understand why you were so upset about your cat dying and shed some tears with you. He is a real god-given movie star, but also a chap, a geezer, a guy, a bloke and a mensch. And along with millions of others, I love him.”

The duo was last seen together in Taylor Sheridan’s Western drama television series 1923, a prequel to the series Yellowstone and a sequel to the series 1883.

When Harrison Ford told PEOPLE that “Helen is incredible”, Mirren was quick to respond that the feeling was mutual.

Reflecting on the changes and constancy in Ford’s persona over the past four decades, the actor said, “In his essence, Harrison Ford is the same person he was when I first met him. Impatient with the annoying sides of the great fame that had settled upon him, adult sycophancy, loss of privacy, etc., and yet immeasurably patient and kind to starstruck kids so excited to see their hero. His privacy was a profoundly protected place. His work was always beautifully designed and constructed, like the carpentry he was so well known for, and I was deeply impressed with his understanding and use of the techniques of film acting. He taught me a lot through my observations. He was professional, guarded, and mysterious, and I was both fascinated and intimidated.”

Helen Mirren, who was last seen in Louis Leterrier’s Fast X, is now working on Marc Forster’s war drama film White Bird.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, featuring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, and Antonio Banderas alongside Harrison Ford, had its world premiere at the 76th Cannes Film Festival. The culmination of the franchise was commemorated with a remarkable five-minute standing ovation from the Cannes audience, an emotional moment that deeply touched Ford, bringing tears to his eyes.

,"'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' PEOPLE REVIEW: Indy's Last Hurrah Starts Slow, Finishes Strong","Read PEOPLE's review for 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,' starring Harrison Ford and Phoebe Waller-Bridge","Admirably stoic and unfussy, Harrison Ford has played Indiana Jones for more than 40 years—running, riding, jumping and tumbling this way and that, up and down as the physically challenging role demanded. If he hadn’t been a Hollywood star he could have been a battle-scarred Norse legend—Beowulf with a fedora.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the fifth and final film in this astonishingly successful franchise, starts with a long, clunky and somewhat dull prologue that’s also a bit of a bait-and-switch. We’re back in World War II Europe: Young Indy (Ford, de-aged with great skill) has been captured by the Nazis and foiled in his attempt to keep Hitler from getting hold of a legendary artifact, the Lance of Longinus. But there’s a second object of antiquity in play, a device that could upend world history (no one in an Indiana Jones movie is ever itching to discover something as insignificant as a painting from Picasso’s lost ""purple"" phase). Created by the Greek mathematician Archimedes, this mythical doohickey is a dial with wheels as meticulously engineered as those in a modern watch. It would have required an enormous Swatch band!

At any rate, Indy escapes, and the dial becomes the engine of a 2 hour, 20-plus minute film that alternately ambles and races to its conclusion, with John Williams’s brassy theme blaring out from time to time like a strategically administered dose of Viagra.

The story jumps forward to 1969. Indie is now more rumpled and taciturn than ever, living in a messy, ugly Manhattan apartment that could have been rented to Richard Dreyfuss in an old Neil Simon rom-com. He’s still having to contend with that Greek thingie: His goddaughter Helena (Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge) wants to find it and make a fortune. So off they go!

Waller-Bridge and Ford. Jonathan Olley / Lucasfilm Ltd.

Waller-Bridge is a brilliant talent, but she’s wrong here — she lacks the right cynical brassiness. It’s like casting Emma Thompson when you need Barbara Stanwyck. Okay, sure, that actress died in 1990, but who’s to say that digital magic and Archimedes’ genius couldn’t resurrect her? Meanwhile, the movie squanders Antonio Banderas in a tiny role and under-utilizes Mads Mikkelsen in a bigger one: Voller, Indy’s Nazi rival for the disc. Then again, Mikkelsen doesn’t necessarily have the hammy vitality to capitalize on a role like this. His performances tend to be immaculately precise, as if the emotions were measured by pipette.

The movie delivers some satisfying if unsurprising action sequences — the customary boobytrapped tomb — before suddenly springing to thrilling life in its concluding third. There have been grumblings online that this final twist, which is both crazy and inspired, isn't too far off from shark-jumping, but that’s scarcely fair: Let's not forget that Raiders of the Lost Ark reconfigured the Ark of the Covenant as a nuclear device.

Even as time itself spins on its invisible axis, Ford always seems completely sane. That may have been key to this whole franchise. Imagine if it had starred Jack Nicholson.



Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is now playing in theaters.

2023-06-25 13:14:00+00:00,"In 'The Dial of Destiny,' Indiana Jones Wears a Watch for the First Time Ever",And it's a Hamilton.,"Hamilton watches have appeared in hundreds of Hollywood movies. Now, the latest installment of the iconic Indiana Jones franchise, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, joins the ever-expanding . As watch fans, we can't help but wonder if the watch itself is significant, based on that title — and the fact that Harrison Ford's beloved character hasn't previously worn a watch at all.

We won't know until the movie debuts on June 30 (and until we've seen it) exactly how the watch factors into the story or what kind of screen time it'll get. But we do know what watch it is: it's the Hamilton Boulton Quartz, the modern version of which was released in 2018. (Apparently, there will also be a Hamilton Khaki Navy Scuba watch making an appearance on the wrist of actor Antonio Banderas.)

Harrison Ford’s character has always had a distinct style, but it hasn’t included a wristwatch — causing some watch-forum nerds to speculate on what he would wear. Now they finally have an answer. CBS Photo Archive Getty Images

With the film set in 1969 (excluding flashbacks), a quartz watch wouldn't be historically accurate, but the vintage (mechanical) watch it's based on came out decades before (in the 1940s) and so would certainly be plausible as a choice for the character. Think of it this way: just as Indiana Jones is played by Harrison Ford, the historical Hamilton Boulton watch is portrayed by a modern quartz Boulton.



We will, however, be checking to see if the watch features a ticking seconds hand in the movie — in which case we'll stand up in the theater and start yelling at the screen, naturally. It'll be hard to spot, since the Boulton Quartz features a small seconds subdial, just like the vintage watches — such a trait always makes the seconds hand's motion more difficult to detect than watches with large central seconds hands, even when you see them in person.

The Hamilton Boulton is nicely sized at 27mm wide by 41.5mm long and, thanks to its quartz movement, nice and thin at only 7.8mm thick. Hamilton Watch

Sure, the film's prop master could have chosen the ($895), which has a sweeping center seconds hand, but the quartz version is the more stylistically accurate. The Quartz is also smaller and thinner (27mm wide by 41.5mm long and 7.8mm thick), and most watches of the time would have been small by our modern standards.

The film's costume designer can't be faulted for the choice. We feel it fits the era and the character well, and this particular version with its gold-toned steel case will match Indy's khaki and leather ensembles. We like the Boulton style for everyday wear, too — it offers a look that's uncommon today and a great alternative to dressy, ""shaped"" watches like the Cartier Tank.

If you fancy yourself an intrepid archaeologist, or just like the Boulton's style, you can get your own version direct from Hamilton — whip and fedora not included.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlYXJwYXRyb2wuY29tL3dhdGNoZXMvYTQ0MjcwNzYzL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LWhhbWlsdG9uLWJvdWx0b24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

This week:

Indiana Jones vs. the Subway

There were a few things I knew before seeing Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny—and, after seeing it, can now confirm.

The CGI de-aging of Harrison Ford is spectacular. I question the more insidious implications of how well the effects team were able to pull off this digital approximation, but it has to be said: Harrison Ford, you will always be hot!

The movie is also endless (derogatory); the two-and-a-half-hour running time is offensive and unnecessary. But the ending is one of the silliest things I’ve had the pleasure of witnessing on a big screen. I was genuinely delighted at how ridiculous the time-travel finale is. I won’t spoil the specifics, but envisioning director James Mangold, Ford, and esteemed auteur/actress Phoebe Waller-Bridge filming it with a straight face recontextualized for me the shameless power of money, and for that I am grateful.

But there is one scene that early reviewers have not talked enough about, which I am here to shout about through any speaker phone on any platform I can: the subway horse scene.

This is not a spoiler, as it happens in the first act of the movie, but there is a SUBWAY HORSE SCENE IN INDIANA JONES that, by virtue of its unapologetic ridiculousness and commitment to seriousness, may just be the pinnacle of any action sequence we’ll see this year.

Ford, as Indiana Jones, is living in New York City in 1969 and just celebrated his retirement, when his connection to an artifact leads to him being kidnapped by Nazis. He escapes them, in the middle of a Manhattan parade celebrating the astronauts from the moon landing. In order to further evade the baddies, he has few options: He must steal a police horse, and he must take that police horse into the subway.

From there, Jones and said horse gallop through the tunnels, evading multiple trains that would surely hit and kill anyone not protected by John Williams’ Indiana Jones score. The whole sequence is thrilling, and yet hilarious. It ends perfectly, with Jones tossing off a grumpy one-liner. I don’t ever endorse going to see a movie of this length, but, for this scene, it is worth it.

Consonant Professional?

Listen: I don’t know if Vanna White wanted the job of replacing Pat Sajak as the host of Wheel of Fortune. I would hope that, if she did, execs would have given it to her. But in lieu of that, we’re left wondering whether or not Ryan Seacrest is the right choice to take over the institution. (And we’re also starting a rallying call to give Vanna a raise.)

The thing about Seacrest being hired to host anything is: yeah, sure. It’s obvious. Seacrest hosts things. Is there any way to be more imaginative in hiring?

But as someone who has watched Seacrest host things for over 20 years, and who has watched other people try and wildly fail at the same job, I think we take for granted how easy he makes it look.

Based on how many celebs have flopped harder trying to host a game show than Carrie Bradshaw working the runway at a fashion show, this is a more complicated job than it seems. I don’t love that someone as problematic as Sajak is being replaced with someone who also has skeletons in his closet. So it’s not like I’d cheer this news. But an obvious choice is sometimes a good choice, something that Jeopardy! favorite James Holzhauer elucidated in this tweet:

Fall Out Boy Started the Fire

Every time I write this sentence, I still don’t believe it’s real: Fall Out Boy wrote and recorded a sequel to Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire,” updating the lyrics to account for the nearly 35 years since Joel released the original.

The song is atrocious, obviously. But it is my journalistic duty to point out some of the most hilarious (abhorrent) lyrics:

“Oklahoma City bomb / Kurt Cobain, Pokémon / Tiger Woods, MySpace / Monsanto, GMOs / Harry Potter, Twilight / Michael Jackson dies / Nuclear accident, Fukushima, Japan.”

There’s also:

“More war in Afghanistan / Cubs go all the way again /Obama, Spielberg / Explosion, Lebanon / Unabomber, Bobbitt, John / Bombing, Boston Marathon / Balloon Boy, War On Terror / QAnon / Trump gets impeached twice / Polar bears got no ice.”

But then there’s the height of songwriting, a moment in music (and history!) I will never forget:

“Self-driving electric cars / SSRIs / Prince and the Queen die / World Trade, second plane / What else do I have to say?”

What else do I have to say?

What Would Zenu Say?

I would truly love to hear all of Tom Cruise’s thoughts on the Barbie movie.

,Indiana Jones: Car buyer discovers new motor stars in film,The new owner of a classic car says he did not realise it had been driven by A-lister Harrison Ford.,"Indiana Jones: Car buyer discovers new motor stars in film

By Pritti Mistry BBC News

Martin Ward

The car was used in a car chase scene with Harrison Ford in the driving seat

A motoring journalist who bought a Fiat 500 was amazed to discover his new wheels star in a car chase in the new Indiana Jones film.

Martin Ward, from Huddersfield, said he bought the 1964 classic vehicle six weeks ago from a specialist dealer.

But unbeknown to him at the time, the car had been driven by Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Mr Ward said.

""I think it's great and it just makes me smile,"" he said.

""You hear about the car's the star, I think in the film this little car - along with one or two others - really will be the star of the movie.""

Ford, 78, stars alongside Fleabag writer and actor Phoebe Waller-Bridge in the latest Indiana Jones instalment, which comes 40 years after Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first film in the series.

Mr Ward, a classic car enthusiast, said he was aware the car had been previously used by Pinewood Studios but he did not know for which film.

He said he later found out it was used in a car chase scene with Ford at the wheel and Waller-Bridge, who plays his goddaughter, in the passenger seat.

""It's going to be probably the most viewed Fiat 500 ever in the world,"" he said.

""It's just a nice history. I mean the car is a classic anyway, the Fiat 500 is really very collectible.

""But that sort of history with it, that it's been in a film driven by Harrison Ford; Phoebe Waller Bridge sat next to him in a chase in [Sicily].

""I just think it makes what is a very special car into something even more special. I just love it.""

Mr Ward said number plates of the Fiat 500 in the film - released in the UK on Wednesday - matched that of his vehicle, which corroborated they were the same car.

""This little car that spent most of his 50-plus years of its life in Italy now ends up in Huddersfield, Yorkshire.

""You don't have to drive it. I feel happy just sat in it, looking at it and touching everything, because it really is immaculate.

""Everywhere I go people just stop and stare at this little thing. I think because it's in such good condition.

2023-06-24 09:00:09.646000+00:00,John Williams on ‘Indiana Jones’ and His Favorite Scores,"In a long career making music for the movies, the composer has made an indelible contribution to cinema. Williams shares his thoughts on some landmark works.","When the New York Philharmonic honored the work of the film composer John Williams this past spring, the director Steven Spielberg introduced a clip of the opening scenes of “Raiders of the Lost Ark” — without the music. The effect, he noted apologetically, was like something out of the French new wave.

The clip was played again, this time with the orchestra joining in. Like magic, the adventuresome spirit of the movie was restored.

On June 30, the rugged archaeologist at the heart of that film (played by Harrison Ford) will return for the fifth entry in the franchise, “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.” He’ll be accompanied, as ever, by Williams’s indispensable music.

The composer, who turned 91 this year, had said it would be his final film score.

,Indiana Jones and the fedora boom,Indy’s latest caper proves a help to hatters | Business,"Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the <audio> element.

I n a summer crowded with blockbusters, Disney may sweat to recoup the $295m it reportedly spent making “Dial of Destiny”, the fifth and final Indiana Jones film, out on June 30th in America. But the movie is already a hit for a firm in another industry. Herbert Johnson, a 134-year-old London hatmaker, is fielding soaring demand for a certain fedora.

“It’s been just glorious,” says Michelle Poyer-Sleeman, the master hatter who designed the latest iteration of the Poet, the hat first donned by Harrison Ford in “Raiders of the Lost Ark” in 1981. The firm had to keep the product under its hat until a couple of weeks before the movie’s launch. But already the “Destiny Poet” has caused a seven-fold rise in Herbert Johnson’s revenue since June last year. A backlog of over 300 orders waits to be handmade in a workshop that hums with the sound of fans, steam and irons.

The boom marks a sharp turnaround for the firm. After the success of “Raiders” it provided Indy’s hats in the follow-ups, “Temple of Doom” (1984) and “Last Crusade” (1989). But a downturn in hat-wearing brought hard times. Venerable hatters such as Italy’s Borsalino went bust. Herbert Johnson was sold and for a while stopped making its hats in-house. For “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull”, Indy’s fourth adventure, in 2008, the producers went elsewhere.

After a rethink in 2016 the firm went back to handmaking and focused on the Poet, which today accounts for three-quarters of sales. The internet brought new customers, many of them American (and many women). Customers wait up to six months for their £495 ($630) rabbit-felt Poet, which comes with an optional “Raiders turn”, a 25-degree twist of the crown to match the jaunty angle at which Mr Ford wore his (supposedly to keep it on during stunts). The firm advises keeping it out of heavy rain and heat and to brush it only anticlockwise. Dr Jones would surely scoff.

Swaine, the 273-year-old luxury-goods firm that owns Herbert Johnson, hopes for success with other on-screen products. It sells a £520 umbrella of the sort twirled by Gene Kelly in “Singin’ in the Rain” and a £3,200 attaché case used by James Bond in “From Russia with Love” (minus the concealed knife). In March it opened a new flagship shop. Hat-wearing is making a comeback, says Ms Poyer-Sleeman, who spotted several clients at the “Dial of Destiny” premiere. There is also a “swing back to quality”, she says. People want something that will last, “and we’re in that niche.”■

,"Harrison Ford reflects on replacing Tom Selleck as Indiana Jones, first impression of 'Raiders' and his 'Dial of Destiny' farewell",Legendary actor says he never imagined playing iconic archaeologist for 40-plus years.,"What if Tom Selleck hadn’t turned down the role of swashbuckling, Nazi-slugging archeologist Indiana Jones in 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark?

Such is one of Hollywood’s great sliding-door moments. Selleck was the first choice for the adventure film helmed by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. Selleck wanted the part. Unfortunately, he had to give it up because he was contractually obligated to a new drama that CBS just picked up for series, Magnum, P.I. — a show that would eventually catapult him to stardom.

Harrison Ford had no idea at the time.

The actor had recently completed The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Star Wars boss Lucas, who conceived the character of Jones in 1973, asked his Han Solo to read the Raiders script.

“I didn’t know that it was a script that someone else had read and was unable to take the job of Indiana Jones because of a contract, Tom Selleck,” Ford, 80, tells us in a new interview. (Selleck would eventually get his shot as a big-screen action hero in 1983’s High Road to China, one of the many Indy-inspired films that flooded theaters following the blockbuster success of Raiders.)

Ford says he was “enthusiastic” about the Lawrence Kasdan-penned screenplay and excited to work with director Spielberg — but he also couldn’t have imagined that he’d be donning Indy’s famed fedora and cracking that signature whip for four decades. After Raiders became an instant classic in ’81, there have been four sequels: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), and this week’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which marks Ford’s swan song in the series.

“As far as I knew, it was a one-off,” Ford says now about Raiders. “I mean, I didn’t really have my head around anything but that job at work right there. I never thought of continuing on to make a four films over 42 years now. But the opportunity came because the films were so satisfying for an audience, and they were made with such skill and ambition, and so I was delighted to be along for the ride.”

Set primarily in 1969, Dial of Destiny finds Indy on the brink of retiring from his day job as a college professor when he’s lured back into action by his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). She’s in a race against an ex-Nazi scientist (Mads Mikkelsen’s Jürgen Voller) to recover the mythical Archimedes Dial, a device thought to be capable of time travel.

“One thing I asked for in each of them was to further embrace a complication of the character,” Ford says of his evolution as Indy. “I wanted to know more about Indiana Jones. I wanted the things that he did to be generated out of his character, out of his nature, out of his experience. I didn’t want it just to be pinned on like a merit badge.

“I wanted these films to inspire people, to make them laugh, to make them cry. And so for me it’s been just an unbelievable experience to have this opportunity. And the last one, I wanted to be about character. I wanted it to be about what it's like to be an older archeologist.”

Dial of Destiny is written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, David Koepp and James Mangold, the Oscar-nominated filmmaker behind Walk the Line, Logan and Ford v. Ferrari. Like seemingly every other major director who came of age with 1980s movies, Mangold was deeply influenced by Raiders, particularly for its boldness.

“There’s so many risks in that movie,” he says of the original film. “It’s such a wild anachronism. It’s screwball, it’s kind of comedic. It’s about an archeologist who carries a whip, who is brilliant, but also scared of snakes, who can take on action, but kind of gets freaked out in social environments. It’s such a bunch of contradictions that no one would go, ‘That smells like a hit, George.’ It’s such an amalgam of wonderfully eccentric things that, in the alchemy of [Ford] in the role and [Spielberg] directing and Larry Kasdan writing and George producing and guiding, something happened, which was bigger than the sum of the parts.

“And that thing is something that can instruct all of us who make movies now. And for me, there was the opportunity to be part of this world and try to understand that alchemy. But it’s also an inspiration for the projects I do beyond the world of this franchise, which is that you can take these swings. They don’t have to always make sense by the standard rules of the day of what a hero is or what a protagonist does.”

One thing’s for sure about the Indiana Jones franchise. There are few 80-year-old action stars out there that can still do what Harrison Ford — or “the bionic man,” as franchise producer and Lucasfilm President Kathryn Kennedy called him — does in Dial of Destiny.

“Harrison said to me quite early on, he was like, ‘You are just doing all the [action] that I used to do ’cause I can’t do them anymore,’” Waller-Bridge recalls. “But then every time I was doing anything, Harrison was always there, on the wall next to me or in the boat [or] jumping out the plane. Like he did all the same stuff as me.

She adds laughing, “I was like, ‘This is not a passing of the baton. This is a war over it.’ He does not let go. It was amazing.”

Recalls Shaunette Renée Wilson, who plays a government agent caught in the middle of Jones’s battle with Voller: “He’d just be jumping on a horse and galloping away. … My mind was just like, ‘What is happening?’ It was like the Indiana Jones [of old].”

“Yeah, try to get off the floor with hands cuffed and not touch the ground,” adds Boyd Holbrook, who plays Klaber, Voller’s lead henchman. “Harrison’s got the body of a 40-year-old, it’s just bizarre. Unfortunate for me. Good for him.”

“Obviously his age has been mentioned a lot,” says Mikkelsen. “But I think we underplay the talent we’re dealing with. He’s just a tremendously talented person and you don’t think about [his age] one second when you’re working with him. He’s just a very talented man.”

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny opens Friday, June 30.

2023-07-02 11:22:00+00:00,Here's What We Know About a Sixth Indiana Jones Movie,"Following 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,' the fifth film in the franchise, here's what we know about the possibility of a sequel.","More than 40 years after he first took up the now-iconic hat and whip in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Harrison Ford is back as the adventuring archaeologist Dr. Henry Jones, Jr. in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the fifth movie in the long-running franchise and the first installment to not be directed by Steven Spielberg.

Set primarily in 1969, Dial of Destiny catches up with Jones on the brink of retirement as he looks back on his past adventures. He is convinced his globe-trotting, treasure-hunting, Nazi-punching days are behind him, until his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) shows up and convinces him to join her on a quest to find a powerful device before it falls into the wrong hands.

The last time Ford played Jones it was in the divisive Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, a mess of a movie which riffed on 1950s sci-fi in the same way that the earlier films paid tribute to the pulpy serials of the 1930s and 40s. This time around, however, Ford seems genuinely interested to be revisiting the character of Indiana Jones, playing him with more layers as a man in much later life.

With Dial of Destiny sure to win over a whole new generation of Indy fans, and given Ford's renewed enthusiasm for the role, it makes perfect sense that people are wondering if this movie will lead into another sequel. Here's what we know about the future of the Indiana Jones franchise.

Disney

Will there be an Indiana Jones 6?

The short answer is no. While an Indiana Jones streaming series has been rumored for a while, Ford confirmed in April 2023 that this will be his last performance as Jones, and the last movie in the series.

""This is the final film in the series, and this is the last time I'll play the character,"" he said. ""I anticipate that it will be the last time that he appears in a film.""



That said, the introduction of Waller-Bridge's character Helena, much like Shia LaBoeuf in Crystal Skull, leaves the door open for a ""next generation""-style continuation of the franchise set in the wider world of ancient artefacts and mythology.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNoZWFsdGguY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYTQ0NDA4MzA1L2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtNi1jYXN0LW5ld3MtdXBkYXRlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"New movies this weekend: See Harrison Ford's final 'Indiana Jones,' stream 'Nimona'","New movies in theaters or streaming this weekend: Harrison Ford headlines ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"" Riz Ahmed in Netflix's ""Nimona.""","Pass the tissue box again: After already saying goodbye to Han Solo, we're now doing the same for Harrison Ford's other iconic character.

This weekend, Indiana Jones rocks the signature fedora one more time in a fifth and final Indy adventure, opposite Phoebe Waller-Bridge (""Fleabag"") as a roguish new character in the franchise and Mads Mikkelsen as a villainous Nazi scientist. But if animation is more your jam, Annie Murphy and Jane Fonda star in a coming-of-age comedy about a teenage kraken girl while Riz Ahmed and Chloë Grace Moretz headline a Netflix fantasy.

Here's a guide to new movies that will satisfy every cinematic taste, plus some noteworthy theatrical films making their streaming and on-demand debuts:

If you live for Harrison Ford cracking a whip: 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny'

Indy's swan song isn't one of his greatest adventures, but director James Mangold's action-packed franchise installment does enough right to satisfy longtime fans. Set in 1969, Indy retires from academia and is pulled into another globe-trotting quest with his goddaughter (Waller-Bridge) to find the rest of the mysterious and powerful Archimedes Dial and keep an ex-Nazi scientist (Mikkelsen) from using it to change history. While the plot has pacing issues and the movie is reticent to veer from the proven ""Jones"" formula, it all leads to a bonkers finale and an emotionally satisfying sendoff for Ford's Man in the Hat.

Their duty is to keep the oceans safe from villainous mermaids, and if young adulthood wasn't already stressful enough, the popular new girl at high school (Murphy) turns out to be one of these power-hungry baddies.

To prove his innocence, Ballister teams with mercurial Nimona (Moretz), a shape-shifting teen who might be the same creature the kingdom's knights have been trained to destroy. It's an inclusive and thoughtful piece about friendship and honor with engaging queer characters that's also a heck of a lot of fun.

2023-06-30 10:00:01+00:00,"Indiana Jones hits theaters for one last adventure, but box office prospects look shaky","Box office analysts predict Disney's ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" will open to between $60 million and $65 million at the domestic box office.","It's Harrison Ford's final bow as the boulder-dodging, whip-wielding, Nazi-punching Indiana Jones.

On Friday, ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" arrives in theaters, marking the fifth and likely final chapter in the Lucasfilm movie franchise.

Disney spared no expense in bringing the film to the big screen, starting with a nearly $300 million production budget. Factor in marketing costs, which are typically equal to half the production budget, and a swanky premiere and after-party at the Cannes Film Festival, and ""Dial of Destiny"" has quite a hole to dig itself out of.

Box office analysts are predicting the film will capture between $60 million and $65 million during its first three days in theaters and around $90 million for the five-day holiday weekend. That would mark the latest mediocre opening in the summer blockbuster season, following disappointing bows for ""The Flash,"" ""Elemental"" and ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" earlier this month.

It would also fall well short of the $100 million ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" secured during its first three days in theaters in 2008. Previous Indiana Jones installments, released in the 1980s, saw significantly lower box office openings because tickets were significantly less expensive at that time and the films were released in fewer theaters.

For instance, ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was released in more than 4,200 theaters, while 1989's ""The Last Crusade"" was released in 2,300 cinemas, according to Comscore data. In 2023, blockbuster features are generally opening in 4,200 locations, with some films, such as Marvel's ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3,"" opening in as many as 4,450 locations.

""Dial of Destiny"" also marks the first time Steven Spielberg hasn't directed an Indy movie, although the musical score was written by franchise stalwart John Williams. James Mangold, who helmed ""Logan"" and ""Ford v Ferrari,"" directed the new one.

The sequel comes 15 years after the ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" which ended up with a 77% ""Fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes but was widely panned by audiences. Despite a solid opening, the fourth Indiana Jones film tallied only $317 million domestically. It did manage to reach $786 million globally, according to data from Comscore.

The lackluster audience response resulted in a pause in future films, including the potential for a spinoff featuring Shia LaBeouf as Indiana Jones' son Mutt Williams. In 2012, Disney bought Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion, eventually taking the franchise away from its previous studio partner Paramount Pictures. Disney kept the character on ice while it worked on new Star Wars and Willow content — two other franchises that came from Lucasfilm.

Now, in 2023, the fifth installment in the swashbuckling archaeologist's movie adventures has generated a 67% ""Fresh"" score as of Friday morning, with critics saying ""Dial of Destiny"" doesn't quite capture the thrill of earlier adventures. Still, with Ford donning his iconic hat and whip combo, the film gives audiences a nostalgic rush, according to the critical consensus.

It's unclear whether that will result in a ton of ticket sales, however.

""The target audience of men over 35, who grew up on the entire series, will need to show up with their families and, perhaps, introduce the iconic character to their little ones who weren't even around for the previous movie,"" said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. ""The franchise has overcome stalled pop culture relevance before, but this time it also has to face that added challenge of winning back viewers who weren't as keen on 'Crystal Skull' as they were for the original films.""

Hollywood has had mixed results with nostalgia plays in recent years. While ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" and ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" captured healthy box office sales, others have floundered on the big screen. ""Blade Runner 2049,"" ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" and ""Terminator Genisys"" came up short with old fans and new audiences in North America.

""Dial of Destiny"" could benefit from audiences keen to see Ford, who will turn 81 next month, hang up his fedora and potentially even pass off the torch to a new generation.

Even with tepid reviews heading into Friday's release, Robbins notes that critics and audiences don't always agree.

""Indiana Jones' nature as a traditionally less front-loaded franchise compared to the comic book blockbusters we're used to seeing play with a short fuse also means a sizable portion of its audience could opt to see the film after the initial fan-driven previews and opening day,"" he said.

,Harrison Ford Grows Emotional as Indiana Jones Fan Thanks Him for the Franchise: 'Means the World to Me',"As Harrison Ford and his 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' costar Phoebe Waller-Bridge spoke with BBC Radio 1's Ali Plumb recently, the actor appeared to grow emotional as the journalist thanked him for his work on the beloved adventure franchise over the years","Harrison Ford is looking back on Indiana Jones' legacy ahead of his final film in the franchise.

While speaking with BBC Radio 1 during an interview published on Monday, Ford, 80, appeared to momentarily choke up as journalist Ali Plumb thanked the veteran actor for his contributions as the star of the long-running film series.

""Can I just say, on behalf of all the fans, thank you. It's been such an adventure, we love you so much. I don't want to make you blush or anything, but you mean the world to us,"" Plumb told Ford at the conclusion of his interview alongside costar Phoebe Waller-Bridge. ""Thank you, that's all I have to say.



“And I must say to you, thank you, sincerely,"" Ford responded. ""It means the world to me.”



Prior to the exchange, Plumb had asked Ford to speak to why he believes the franchise — which originated with 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark — has remained so successful and loved by fans over the years.

“Because of the talents of the screenwriters and directors and actors that have poured their hearts and souls into it,"" Ford told the outlet. ""And the experience that I had making these five films... the films are peopled with some of the most amazing actors and characters and the stories are so compelling and they mix adventure and humor and heart.”

The actor added that he admires ""the depth and the subtlety of the emotion, and the importance of emotion in these films.""

""As this one concerns age and frailty and changing nature of life, it was especially compelling to me because I am of that age and I wanted it to fell real for the audience,"" Ford said of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which will mark his final turn as the iconic bullwhip-wielding archaeologist. ""I wanted them to see the complexity of that experience with someone they spent 40 years with.”

While speaking with PEOPLE recently, the actor noted that he most often quotes 1997's Air Force One in his own day-to-day life rather than any of his iconic lines from Star Wars or the five Indiana Jones films.

""Because I fly, I probably say why more than I need to, 'Get off my plane!' "" Ford said, reciting his most famous line from the film.



Ford was honored with a Palme d’Or for lifetime achievement at the new Indiana Jones movie's world premiere at Cannes Film Festival last month, where he paused to take in the film industry and fans' affection for his work.



“I was just trying to keep myself composed,” he told PEOPLE recently. “There was very generous applause from the crowd [and] it was positive and humbling and nice.""

2023-07-07 01:31:35-05:00,‘Dial of Destiny’ falls far short of studio estimates,"Indiana Jones -- and executives at the Walt Disney Co. and Lucasfilm -- made a somewhat dispiriting discovery last weekend. Moviegoers didn't rush to the theater in significant numbers to see "" Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" and say goodbye to Harrison Ford as the iconic archaeologist.","Indiana Jones -- and executives at the Walt Disney Co. and Lucasfilm -- made a somewhat dispiriting discovery last weekend. Moviegoers didn't rush to the theater in significant numbers to see "" Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" and say goodbye to Harrison Ford as the iconic archaeologist.

The film, reportedly budgeted north of $250 million, came in on the lower end of projections with $60 million in ticket sales from 4,600 North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.

Including $70 million from international showings in 52 markets, ""Dial of Destiny"" celebrated a $130 million global opening. It easily earned the No. 1 title but was not the high-rolling sendoff for one of modern cinema's most iconic actor/character pairings that anyone hoped.

""Dial of Destiny"" is the long-delayed fifth installment in the Steven Spielberg/George Lucas-created adventure series that began in 1981 with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and the first Spielberg himself hasn't directed. Veteran James Mangold stepped in to take the reins overseeing the Spielberg-approved script, which finds an older Dr. Jones retiring from his university job and swept up on a new adventure with his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge).

""It's impressive that a franchise that's over 40 years old is No. 1 at the box office. But there's no question there were higher hopes for the debut of this movie,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. ""This is Indiana Jones. This is a summer movie icon.""

The film made its splashy premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May, with a fitting celebration of Ford, who has said this was his last time playing the character.

But then it was hit with lukewarm reviews. This was an unexpected and unwelcome hurdle, considering it was coming after the maligned fourth film, 2008's ""Indiana Jones and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" Another contributing snag was that a significant portion of the target audience, older viewers, don't tend to buy many tickets on opening weekend for big blockbusters. But even ""Crystal Skull,"" budgeted at a reported $185 million, managed to gross more than $790 million.

""Sometimes reviews don't matter, but the sentiment coming out of Cannes was very powerful,"" Dergarabedian said. ""It set off a narrative where people were already feeling disappointed and they hadn't even seen it.""

Second place went to ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" with $11.5 million, bringing its domestic total to around $340 million. ""Elemental"" landed in third place with $11.3 million.

Aside from ""Dial of Destiny,"" the weekend's other main new opener was the animated ""Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken,"" which debuted in sixth place with $5.2 million.

""Dial of Destiny's"" underwhelming debut comes just a few weeks after Warner Bros.' ""The Flash"" and Disney/Pixar's ""Elemental"" had lackluster openings in North America. ""Elemental,"" like Indy 5, also premiered at Cannes to middling reception.

And yet, ""Elemental"" in its three weeks in theaters has held on much better than ""The Flash,"" which plummeted again to $5 million, bringing its domestic total to $99.3 million. Disney also saw similarly promising holds with ""The Little Mermaid,"" now at more than $280 million domestically and ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" which has grossed more than $345 million. After Tuesday, Disney will be responsible for nearly half of the summer box office earnings.

""The entire story isn't told on the opening weekend,"" Dergarabedian said.

Disney has a ""clear weekend"" ahead with no competing blockbusters, when studio heads can reasonably hope for more families and older audiences to buy tickets. But things will only get more challenging for ""Dial of Destiny"" in the coming weeks with a crowded July. ""Mission: Impossible-Dead Reckoning Part I"" opens on July 12, followed by ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Barbie"" on July 21.

""The ups and downs at the box office are giving us whiplash,"" Dergarabedian said. ""And we're still on the cusp of some of the biggest movies of the summer.""

2023-07-01 15:21:27+00:00,"Movie review: Nostalgic, yes, but ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ lacks adventure",This dose of “Indiana Jones” is a disappointingly diluted version of this favorite hero.,"It’s been 15 years since we last encountered Indiana Jones, the whip-cracking archaeologist made iconic by star Harrison Ford, director Steven Spielberg, and George Lucas, who conceived of the story while seeking to update the classic adventure serial. Audiences fell for the brainy, blunt and brave Indy in his globe-trotting adventures explored in the original trilogy, which started with “Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark” in 1981. Even the fourth installment, arriving in 2008, “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” was profitable, and warmly received despite its goofy story.

It’s no surprise that in a filmmaking landscape where legacy sequels, or “legasequels,” roam the box office, the powers that be would take ol’ Indy out for another spin. Ford had returned to both “Star Wars” and “Blade Runner” to positive notices, so it made sense to get the band back together for one more gig, to see if there’s any juice left to squeeze. Enter “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” in which James Mangold takes the reins from Spielberg.

Mangold also co-wrote the script with Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and David Koepp, and, true to the spirit of the legasequel, it’s about time travel — the story reflecting the nostalgic desire of both filmmakers and audiences to utilize movies as vehicles to revisit the emotions we felt when we were young. Lucas and Spielberg used “Indiana Jones” to recreate the feeling of their favorite childhood serials, and Mangold is tasked with delivering a film that brings us back to that feeling of falling in love with “Raiders of the Lost Ark” back in the ‘80s. He approaches the task so literally that he seems to have overlooked the goal of simply making a great adventure movie.

“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” hits the nostalgia button from minute one, with an almost creepy, fetishistic reanimation of Indy’s appeal. These reminders of what was are like constant jabs in the ribs, as if the filmmakers are saying, “Remember this? You like this.” It’s cameos from beloved characters, reminders of Indy’s well-known idiosyncrasies (he hates snakes and enjoys punching Nazis), and do-overs of famous bits from the previous films. They try so hard to recapture the original charm but haven’t actually thought about what made it charming in the first place, and the result is a sloggy, dull sequel that’s more “Bogus Journey” than “Excellent Adventure.”

It opens with a sequence that takes place toward the end of World War II, as Jones and fellow archaeologist Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) sneak around piles of treasure looted by Nazis, trying to liberate a few historically significant — and potentially powerful — baubles. Fast forward to the late ‘60s, where Indy is a grumpy professor in New York City. He has no groupies, no wife and no child when a strange woman, Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), ambushes him at a dive bar. She’s Indy’s goddaughter, the daughter of dear departed Bas, and she wants a mysterious dial crafted by Greek mathematician Archimedes that her pop pilfered from the Nazi loot train. Can Indy help her?

He doesn’t have much of a choice when they’re suddenly pursued through the city by two bloodthirsty blondes with buzz cuts (Boyd Holbrook and Olivier Richters). These menaces are in the employ of Dr. Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), a shadowy figure from Indy’s past and a rocket scientist/former Nazi who needs the dial to “fix Hitler’s mistakes.” Yes, the plot itself is a rather hackneyed pop culture meme.

Mangold is a slick filmmaker, and in “Dial of Destiny,” he alternates the nostalgia bumps and surprise cameos with extremely fast set pieces; the entire film feels like one long car (horse, boat, tuk-tuk) chase. All of the action sequences are capably crafted, and a total snooze. As Indy and Helena — and a precocious poppet (Ethann Isidore) they pick up in Morocco — dart around the globe retrieving various items, the bad guys chase them and relieve them of said items. Helena quips annoyingly, Indy grumbles predictably, and Mangold stuns us into a stupor with his perfectly competent filmmaking. It is a crushingly dull film until it becomes jaw-droppingly cartoonish.

Perhaps a swig of something familiar in an air-conditioned theater will be just the ticket for a summer weekend. However, this dose of “Indiana Jones” is a disappointingly diluted version of this favorite hero that has the power to put a fan off the franchise forever.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny viewers have been left stumped by a major “plot hole” in the new Harrison Ford sequel.

The film, the fifth entry in the adventure franchise, sees Dr Henry “Indiana” Jones Jr (Ford) come up against an old Nazi adversary (Mads Mikkelsen) in 1969.

Spoilers follow for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny... you have been warned!

Most of the plot of the film revolves around the hunt for the two pieces of Archimedes’ dial, an ancient device that could supposedly be used to “read fissures in time”, potentially allowing the user to travel back in time, by locating the right fissure at the right time.

By the end of the film, the villainous Jürgen Voller (Mikkelsen) has acquired the dial, and follows it towards a wormhole located somewhere in the sky. He flies through the wormhole in an airplane with Indiana Jones on board, expecting to arrive back in Nazi Germany, where he will change the course of history and win the war for the Nazis.

The plane does indeed get transported back in time – but instead arrives in ancient Greece, during the Siege of Syracuse in 213-212 BC.

It is ultimately revealed that the dial was invented by Archimedes to help direct people from the future to his location in the past, during the ancient battle.

However, while the ending clears up some of the questions posed earlier in the film – namely, how Archimedes’ entombed body was wearing a modern-day wristwatch – the nature of the time travel still seemed to leave open a large plot hole.

Given that the dial was simply a device for reading the “fissures” in time, as opposed to creating them, it remains unexplained how Voller was able to locate a portal to Archemedes’ exact time and location, just hours after the device fell into his possession. The most logical explanation would be that the “time portals” are constantly opening up all over the world, round the clock – which poses further questions as to why no one had ever noticed them, or travelled through them.

One person shared his confusion on Reddit. “I’m not sure I really understand the time travel,” they wrote. “So archimedes was working on his dial when the Romans attacked. During the attack, the Nazi plane came out of the sky and murdered the enemy army. So archimedes knew in the future, the dial would be found and this would happen. So he built a device that allowed the user to find a worm hole to that exact moment in time?

“But like why is there a time hole to that exact moment? Are there just time vortexes to any point in history? How did archimedes even know there was a time hole to the time of this attack. Idk maybe I don’t understand it.”

Another viewer wrote that the film featured “plot holes the size of 18-wheelers”.

In a three-star review of the film for The Independent, Geoffrey Macnab wrote: “Tonally, the film wavers. It pulls in too many different directions at once. On the one hand, this is an exercise in affectionate nostalgia.

“On the other, like its predecessors, it’s an old-fashioned matinee adventure in which characterisation is deliberately broad. Certain episodes are knowing and ironic, while others seem painfully naive.”

2023-07-09 18:01:13+00:00,"‘Indiana Jones 5’ and ‘Insidious: The Red Door’ Tie at International Box Office, ‘Transformers’ Hits $400 Million Globally","""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is facing an unexpectedly close race with ""Insidious: The Red Door"" on international box office charts.","Disney’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is barely winning an unexpectedly close race with “Insidious: The Red Door” on international box office charts, with each film collecting roughly $31 million over the weekend.

Based on Sunday’s estimates, “Indiana Jones 5” is ever-so-slightly ahead of “Insidious 5” with $31.8 million for Harrison Ford’s swashbuckling adventure and $31.4 million for Sony’s paranormal horror story.

“The Red Door” easily took town “Dial of Destiny” at the domestic box office, with the former earning $32.6 million in its debut. It marked the second-best opening weekend of the franchise behind 2013’s “Insidious: Chapter 2” ($40 million).

Overseas, the newest “Insidious” movie managed to secure the best start for a horror film in pandemic times, as well as the biggest start of the supernatural-horror series in comparable markets. Top markets include Mexico ($5.8 million) the Philippines ($3.7 million) and the U.K. ($2.8 million).

With $64 million in global ticket sales to date, the $16-million budgeted “Insidious 5” is already reaping big rewards in its box office run. “The Red Door,” which is positioned as the conclusion to the horror franchise, brings back original cast members Patrick Wilson (who also directed the film) Ty Simpkins, Andrew Astor and Rose Byrne.

Meanwhile, “Dial of Destiny” has collected $127 million internationally so far, boosting its global tally to $248 million. For Disney and Lucasfilm, which shelled out an eye-popping $300 million to make the latest globe-trotting adventure, it’s catastrophic that ticket sales have yet to cross $250 million.

Disney and Pixar’s “Elemental” trailed “Dial of Destiny” and “Insidious 5” on international charts, bringing in $30 million from 48 markets. That takes its total to $142 million overseas and $250.9 million globally. The animated family film got off to a rocky start on the big screen, but it’s remained a draw for families in subsequent weeks. It cost $200 million, so it’ll need to keep playing in theaters to justify that price tag.

Also this weekend, Paramount’s “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” crossed the $400 million mark globally. With another $7.6 million over the weekend, the seventh “Transformers” installment has earned $261 million overseas and $407 million worldwide to date. “Rise of the Beasts,” which cost $200 million, has stuck around on movie theater marquees despite an unremarkable start at the box office.

Elsewhere, Warner Bros. and DC’s comic book adventure “The Flash” is running out of steam with $5 million from 78 markets in its fourth weekend of release. This weekend’s ticket sales take the international tally to $156 million and the worldwide total to $261 million. It’s a catastrophic result given the film’s $200 million price tag.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LWluc2lkaW91cy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtdGllLTEyMzU2NjQ4MjUv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vYm94LW9mZmljZS9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLTUtaW5zaWRpb3VzLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYm94LW9mZmljZS10aWUtMTIzNTY2NDgyNS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-21 01:00:00+00:00,Phoebe Waller-Bridge on why Hollywood should never recast Indiana Jones,"Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the star of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, talks about the heartbreak of saying goodbye to the legendary character.","“Then I sat down with it and honestly, within three pages, I just felt like I was in the world, I couldn’t wait to see what happened next. And I just forgot everything else.” Waller-Bridge had worked with the film’s executive producer, Lucasfilm boss Kathleen Kennedy, on the Star Wars film, Solo, in which she had voiced the droid, L3-37. The pair then met for dinner — Waller-Bridge’s last night out before the COVID-19 lockdown, “so that was quite an event,” Waller-Bridge says — and Kennedy offered her the role. “I didn’t know what the dinner was going to be about, I was happy to see her.” Waller-Bridge says. “I knew that Jim [the film’s director, James Mangold] had seen Fleabag. And the thing that really blows my mind is that these bigwigs are sitting around watching BBC3 comedies.” As a girl, growing up in Hammersmith in west London, Waller-Bridge had seen the Indiana Jones films and loved them. “I was so young, I wasn’t probably thinking about him in a particularly gendered way, he was just a hero and a legend and someone that went on these incredible adventures,” she says. “I’ve always really identified with adventure/action hero-led stories.

“I was just looking at the stuff he was doing and the places he was going to and just idealising being in that situation,” Waller-Bridge says, adding that she was also impressed as a kid by Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), Indiana’s love-interest. “She was such an equal match for him, it’s that first punch that she throws at the beginning, and you know she’s not your regular heroine.” At the time, though Indiana Jones was a dominating presence, Waller-Bridge’s attention was also drawn to what was in many ways the first wave of female movie action heroines, such as Sigourney Weaver’s Ellen Ripley in the Alien movies, and Linda Hamilton’s Sarah Connor in The Terminator movies. “Sigourney in Alien was a kind of awakening in some ways because she wasn’t a ‘female lead’ in the way that she had all the attributes and qualities and complexities of the male action heroes that I’d seen before. I came to Terminator a little bit later, but I had the same experience,” Waller-Bridge says. “I was a tomboy as well, and that may have been part of it. It seems like such an archaic word now, but I was a really committed tomboy, so I immediately put myself in the position of those male characters because it looked to me like they were having just more fun. I get excited when there’s a blend of masculine and femininity in any character. And there’s certainly that element in Sigourney’s performance. It’s so fundamentally female, and yet she’s so gloriously in touch with her feminine and her masculine.” The same can be said of Indiana Jones. “He’s frightened of things, like snakes, which you wouldn’t necessarily say is a feminine quality, but you would associate that kind of behaviour with screaming damsels. I think that’s why he was so successful and appealed to people all over the place.”

Meeting the 80-year-old screen legend who also played Star Wars′ iconic stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking, Nerf-herding space-smuggler Han Solo, was, for Waller-Bridge, a genuine pinch-me moment. A role can be a “a kaleidoscope of joy or torment really, depending on who you’re partnered with,” Waller-Bridge says. “I had a voicemail from Harrison a couple of weeks before rehearsals. I listened to his voice, I was like, oh my God, so I got my weird moment out of the way. Waller-Bridge in the Emmy-winning series, Fleabag. Credit: Amazon Prime Video “And then I spoke to him, and we talked about the process, or at least, we talked about how he didn’t want to talk about the process, which I was very happy to do. “He said, ‘I’m so happy it’s you and I’m so happy with this script.’ I was quite nervous but when I met him [in person], he was so warm and lovely and he made me feel like we were great mates from day one and that we were equals.”

The role of Helena Shaw seems writ large from the tapestry of Indiana Jones stories, where quick-witted women match the film’s hero step for step. Mangold did not give Waller-Bridge complex notes, though he did say that he saw in Helena an echo of Barbara Stanwyck’s conwoman, Jean Harrington, in the Preston Sturges film, The Lady Eve. “I love Barbara Stanwyck, I love that movie, and I love her performance in it,” Waller-Bridge says. “So when he said that, and I’d been thinking so much about that era and the style of acting and how she was so natural anyway, and the 1940s, I was doing a deep dive into those movies anyway. “What I got from [the note] is that he wanted her to be light on her feet and witty, and her to feel like she was a step ahead of the audience. “She has an ease, and there is a sexuality about her, but she’s not pushing her sensuality.” The Dial of Destiny is the final Indiana Jones film, at least for Ford, but Waller-Bridge says she can’t imagine the role with another actor.

The film itself hews closely to the Indiana Jones canon, a period action-adventure set in the pre-modern world, where Zeppelin airships and mystical relics like the Holy Grail, the Cross of Coronado and the Ark of the Covenant are woven into Biggles-grade, white-knuckle moments. They’re caper movies which send the heroes in pursuit of an arcane MacGuffin. The Dial of Destiny, however, is a little different. Some of its story elements, the way it plays with time, the fact that it features a younger version of Indiana Jones and the way it leans into the inescapable qualities of fate, seem to serve as metaphors for the larger piece itself. The fact that it is the final movie seems to weigh heavily around the story. In some respects, Waller-Bridge says, that overwhelming sentiment comes from the audience more that Ford himself. “We were all with him, being like, how do you feel, this is the end and are you going to miss him? And he’s always like, f... off, no, he’s a character, he’s not real. We were projecting a lot of that onto him.” Loading There was an “openness” in Ford’s performance though, that he hadn’t afforded Indy before, she says.

“And I felt he was so determined to make this movie and to make it about growing old and about looking back at your life as much as at history, and actually really explore the impact that has on the character rather than it just be the adventure, that once we saw those moments happen, when Harrison through Indy opened that heart or that window, that’s when we all felt it powerfully. “It’s easy to forget when we’re all just floundering, jumping off a ship or out of a plane or doing some fun stuff, but there were those real moments of poignancy when we’d all go like, oh my God. And then you look around at those sets, and you go, will there ever be sets built specifically for this world again like this? And then everything suddenly becomes very, very precious.” On the last day of filming, in 2022, Waller-Bridge says she was a wreck. “We’d been filming for just under a year, there was such hype going into it and such nerves. And then I think, from that first moment with Harrison, it became a place to have fun and really go on this adventure together, the most fun, beautiful, hilarious, challenging, but really positive experience,” she says. “It was an exhausting, impossible job, and everyone put everything into it. And then the joy and the celebration of it at the end, with Harrison, and saying goodbye to everyone was really, really emotional. Saying goodbye to Harrison was unbelievably emotional. I almost couldn’t do it, I was just crying so much. It was a lot.” Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny opens on June 28.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbWguY29tLmF1L2N1bHR1cmUvbW92aWVzL3Bob2ViZS13YWxsZXItYnJpZGdlLW9uLXdoeS1ob2xseXdvb2Qtc2hvdWxkLW5ldmVyLXJlY2FzdC1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLTIwMjMwNjE5LXA1ZGhrcy5odG1s0gGCAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNtaC5jb20uYXUvY3VsdHVyZS9tb3ZpZXMvcGhvZWJlLXdhbGxlci1icmlkZ2Utb24td2h5LWhvbGx5d29vZC1zaG91bGQtbmV2ZXItcmVjYXN0LWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtMjAyMzA2MTktcDVkaGtzLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-06-30 18:29:36+00:00,How ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Embarked Upon a Real-Life Global Adventure,,"Building upon its legacy of globetrotting exploits, Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny—now playing in theaters—was filmed on location in Morocco, Sicily, and the U.K., providing multiple backdrops for the whip-smart archeologist’s unforgettable final adventure. Says director/co-writer James Mangold, “Part of what we expect in an Indiana Jones film is a tumbling menagerie of characters coming at us while they travel the world.”
With that in mind, Mangold worked with production designer Adam Stockhausen, director of photography Phedon Papamichael, special effects supervisor Alistair Williams, and visual effects supervisor Andrew Whitehurst to develop the film’s dynamic action sequences and awe-inspiring visuals—which fans have come to expect ever since Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark was released in 1981, setting the tone for decades of international escapades. So, to give Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) a proper sendoff, the production team constructed large set-pieces, which included a 1944 train sequence in Germany, a horseback pursuit through a ticker tape parade in New York, a frenzied tuk tuk chase through the streets of Tangier, and a tense underwater dive in Greece, to name just a few.
“I think that is core to what makes these movies special; it’s different to be in a place than to pretend you’re in a place,” Stockhausen says of their considered approach. “Being in a place brings all the authenticity of the real thing, and it brings all the surprises of being able to twist and turn around corners that you wouldn’t have imagined to build into a set.”
The real-world locations and practical sets helped the cast get into character. “They each had their own personality,” says Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who joins the franchise as Helena Shaw. “Sicily was beautiful and serene, Morocco was full of bustle with a thousand things happening around you at the same time, and Glasgow has an energy I wish I could bottle.”
At the same time, Stockhausen strove to match the visual grandeur of the real-world locations with the massive and richly detailed sets he constructed at Pinewood Studios just outside of central London. The explosive opening sequence was a prime example of the way the film smartly married impressive locations—including England’s Bamburgh Castle and the North Yorkshire Moors Railway station—with Stockhausen’s inventive designs. The nighttime set piece sees the younger Indy attempting to rescue his friend Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) from Nazi captors aboard a moving train. “I wanted to give the audience what they want right up front,” Mangold says, “so we indulge in this Indiana Jones classic experience.”
Following the prologue, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny jumps to 1969, when an estimated 4 million people lined the streets of New York City to see NASA astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Mike Collins and celebrate the success of the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. Staging the parade and the chase that follows required considerable planning in Glasgow, Scotland, which doubled for Manhattan. The production team spent three weeks dressing Glasgow’s main artery, St. Vincent Street, which was then closed to the public for seven days as filming took place. Says Stockhausen, “You can’t walk into a downtown metropolitan area and just take it over for three months. You have to do your work in as compressed a period of time as you can possibly manage and then get out and let people get back to their lives. So, there was an incredible intensity for everyone to rush in and do all this dressing, put up all these signs, put up all this bunting. It was go-go-go.”
Fortunately for Papamichael, the weather cooperated while they were filming outdoors. “Although it was all shot in Glasgow, it felt like we were really in New York in the late ’60s—the scale of it, the colors, the hippies, the pipers, the big band, the cheerleaders, and the cars, and police on horses. The contrast couldn’t be greater than the sequence that precedes it. You explode from the night and the Nazis into this whole new visual bouquet of colors and tone,” he explains. “It worked as a great visual device for a transition of time.”
As the chase progresses, Indiana finds himself, on horseback, riding underground through Manhattan’s subway tunnels, racing an oncoming train. For those scenes, Stockhuasen created a full-scale replica of a subway station on Pinewood’s 007 stage—the largest soundstage in the world—complete with paint and tile work that was aged for authenticity.
When the story’s action moves to Morocco, exteriors were shot in the city of Fez, while the lavish interiors of the Hotel L’Atlantique—where Helena auctions off her loot—were built at Pinewood. Meanwhile, Sicily stood in for Greece, where—with Renaldo (Antonio Banderas)—Indiana and Helena dive into vast caverns to follow the trail of Archimedes.
Ultimately, Ford says it was “critical” to film on location. “You want to go to many places around the world. You want to feel these places, you want to smell them, as it were,” the actor explains. “And so, we want as much as possible to have practical sets, practical locations where there’s a different culture, where there’s a different feeling to the place.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2FsdGRpc25leWNvbXBhbnkuY29tL2hvdy1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LWVtYmFya2VkLXVwb24tYS1yZWFsLWxpZmUtZ2xvYmFsLWFkdmVudHVyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-30 15:05:48+00:00,Box Office: ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Earns $7.2 Million in Previews,'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' made $7.2 million in previews.,"Harrison Ford is gearing up for his last adventure as Indiana Jones with $7.2 million in previews at the domestic box office. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” opens in 4,600 theaters this weekend heading into the Fourth of July holiday on Tuesday.
“Dial of Destiny,” Disney and Lucasfilm’s fifth and final film in the franchise, is expected to whip up $65 million in its opening weekend, a solid start except for the fact that the movie carries a massive $295 million budget. A portion of that went to de-aging special effects, which turned 80-year-old star Ford back into his younger self for the movie, which partly takes place during Indy’s early years. The $295 million budget does not include marketing costs to promote the film, such as an exorbitant Cannes Film Festival premiere and afterparty. Indiana Jones has overcome some eye-popping odds in his adventures, and “Dial of Destiny” turning a profit may be his greatest challenge yet.
Ford is back in the fedora for “Dial of Destiny,” which sees Indy searching for a mystical artifact that can change the course of history. He’s accompanied by his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) in a race against former Nazi Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) for the treasure.
The last time Indy was on screen was in 2008’s “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” which opened to $100 million and finished with $317 million in North America and $790 million globally. “Dial of Destiny” is sure to open No. 1 this weekend, but it will take a lot of nostalgic fans to hit the franchise’s previous highs.
Elsewhere at the box office this weekend, Universal’s animated kids movie “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken” made $725,000 in previews. It’s expected to open between $8 million and $9 million, and it cost $70 million to make.

The film, which sees Harrison Ford reprising his iconic role as the whip-smart archaeologist, currently has an 88% Rotten Tomatoes-verified moviegoer rating (2,500+ reviews) and strong PostTraks scores (4.5/5 parents and kids; 4/5 generals).
Domestically, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny opened to $60.4 million, with a projected $82 million through Tuesday’s Fourth of July holiday. Internationally, the film—directed and co-written by James Mangold—earned $70.2 million and opened at No. 1 in several key markets, including Argentina, Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the U.K. It also posted the highest opening weekend of 2023 in Denmark, Finland, and Greece.

7/2/2023 16:51,Indiana Jones’ box office destiny? A lukewarm $60 million debut in North America,Moviegoers were only moderately interested in going to the theater to say goodbye to Harrison Ford’s archaeologist character in “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.”,"Indiana Jones, and executives at the Walt Disney Co. and Lucasfilm, made a somewhat dispiriting discovery this weekend. Moviegoers didn’t rush to the theater in significant numbers to see “ Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” and say goodbye to Harrison Ford as the iconic archaeologist.
The film, reportedly budgeted north of $250 million, came in on the lower end of projections with $60 million in ticket sales from 4,600 North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.
Including $70 million from international showings in 52 markets, “Dial of Destiny” celebrated a $130 million global opening. It easily earned the No. 1 title but was not the high-rolling sendoff for one of modern cinema’s most iconic actor/character pairings that anyone hoped. Disney is projecting that it will make $82 million domestically through the fourth of July holiday and $152 million globally.
“Dial of Destiny” is the long-delayed fifth installment in the Steven Spielberg/George Lucas-created adventure series that began in 1981, and the first Spielberg himself hasn’t directed. Veteran James Mangold stepped in to take the reins overseeing the Spielberg-approved script, which finds an older Dr. Jones retiring from his university job and swept up on a new adventure with his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge).
“It’s impressive that a franchise that’s over 40 years old is No. 1 at the box office. But there’s no question there were higher hopes for the debut of this movie,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “This is Indiana Jones. This is a summer movie icon.”
The film made its splashy premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May, with a fitting celebration of Ford, who has said this was his last time playing the character.
But then it was hit with lukewarm reviews. This was an unexpected and unwelcome hurdle, considering it was coming after the maligned fourth film, 2008’s “Indiana Jones and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.” Another contributing snag was that a significant portion of the target audience, older viewers, don’t tend to buy many tickets on opening weekend for big blockbusters. But even “Crystal Skull,” budgeted at a reported $185 million, managed to gross over $790 million.
“Sometimes reviews don’t matter, but the sentiment coming out of Cannes was very powerful,” Dergarabedian said. “It set off a narrative where people were already feeling disappointed and they hadn’t even seen it.”
Second place went to “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” with $11.5 million, bringing its domestic total to around $340 million. “Elemental” landed in third place with $11.3 million.
Aside from “Dial of Destiny,” the weekend’s other main new opener was the animated “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken,” which debuted in sixth place with $5.2 million.
“Dial of Destiny’s” underwhelming debut comes just a few weeks after both Warner Bros.’ “The Flash” and Disney/Pixar’s “Elemental” had lackluster openings in North America. “Elemental,” like Indy 5, also premiered at Cannes to middling reception.
And yet, “Elemental” in its three weeks in theaters has held on much better than “The Flash,” which plummeted again to $5 million, bringing its domestic total to $99.3 million. Disney also saw similarly promising holds with “The Little Mermaid,” now at over $280 million domestically and “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" which has grossed over $345 million. After the holiday, Disney will be responsible for nearly half of the summer box office earnings.
“The entire story isn’t told on the opening weekend,” Dergarabedian said.
Disney has a “clear weekend” ahead with no competing blockbusters, when studio heads can reasonably hope for more families and older audiences to buy tickets. But things will only get more challenging for “Dial of Destiny” in the coming weeks with a crowded July. “Mission: Impossible-Dead Reckoning Part I” opens on July 12, followed by “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie” on July 21.
“The ups and downs at the box office are giving us whiplash,” Dergarabedian said. “And we’re still on the cusp of some of the biggest movies of the summer.”
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.
1. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” $60 million.
2. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” $11.5 million.
3. “Elemental,” $11.3 million.
4. “No Hard Feelings,” $7.5 million.
5. “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” $7 million.
6. “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken,” $5.2 million.
7. “The Little Mermaid,” $5.2 million.
8. “The Flash,” $5 million.
9. “Asteroid City,” $3.8 million.
10. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” $1.8 million.

Kevin Brassard, a Disney cast member and stunt performer who originated the role of Indiana Jones in the “Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular!” at Disney’s Hollywood Studios, attended the premiere and got to meet Indiana Jones himself, Harrison Ford.
Brassard, who now plays the part of the show’s “director,” was joined on the red carpet by fellow stunt performer Michele Waitman, who plays the part of Marion in the show.
“If I could tell myself starting with this show more than 30 years ago about today, first of all, I’d say strap in, it’s gonna be a wild ride,” Brassard said in a post on the Disney Parks Blog. “And you’re gonna love it.”
Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular has been a staple at Hollywood Studios since 1989. The show opened in August, three months after the park, then called Disney-MGM Studios, opened to the public.
The show, which takes place in a 2,000-seat outdoor theater, takes the audience behind-the-scenes of “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” with stunts and reenactments of scenes from the movie—including the iconic boulder chase scene. The show lasts about 35 minutes and includes audience participation.
For Brassard and Waitman, attending the premiere for the new “Indiana Jones” movie and meeting Ford was an unbelievable experience.
“We so appreciate Disney making this huge dream come true,” Brassard said.
Ahead of the movie’s theatrical release, Disney has added a limited-time Indiana Jones-inspired experience at Hollywood Studios. A pop-up bar called Indiana Jones and the Den of Destiny has opened next to the stunt show.
The bar, open through Aug. 15, features drinks inspired by the world of Indy as well as displays with movie costumes and props.
And at the end of the month, a few new “Indiana Jones”-inspired items will be added to the menu at Jock Lindsey’s Hangar Bar at Disney Springs.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5teW5ld3MxMy5jb20vZmwvb3JsYW5kby9hdHRyYWN0aW9ucy8yMDIzLzA2LzE5L2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtc3R1bnQtc2hvdy1hY3RvcnMtbWVldHMtaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC1hdC1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnktcHJlbWllcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-28 17:18:00+00:00,Phoebe Waller-Bridge: From Indiana Jones fan to femme fatale in fifth film,"The fifth and final Indiana Jones film, ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"" will hit theaters on June 30th.","PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- On Friday, June 30, the fifth and final ""Indiana Jones"" film will hit theaters.
Harrison Ford says it's been a treasured part of his life and career for 42 years.
In ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"" Indy is about to hang up his iconic hat until one woman pulls him into one final adventure.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge plays Helena Shaw, an adventurer, and also a femme fatale.
""His life is a bit in disarray, and along comes this creature, this Phoebe Waller-Bridge,"" said Harrison Ford, who plays Indiana Jones. ""She invigorates him into one last adventure.""
Helena Shaw is the daughter of Basil, Indiana Jones' friend and fellow archaeologist. She's looking for a dial her father once told her about that can change the course of history.
To recover the ancient artifact, Helena and Indy go up against the Nazis. But first, Helena must call him out of retirement.
""That was a great moment in the script, actually, because he's experiencing some ennui in his life,"" Waller-Bridge said. ""He's not sure where he fits anymore. He needs someone to come in and ignite that fire. She comes in and tries to inspire him to have one last adventure, and foolishly.""
Waller-Bridge says she would spend the mornings on set doing crossword puzzles with Harrison Ford, and the afternoons filming some of the most exhilarating action scenes she's ever seen on screen.
Shaunette Renee Wilson plays Mason, a CIA agent, who is sort of in their way. Both women say they are awestruck being a part of this storied franchise.
""It inspired a little Shaunette to want to be an archaeologist, to want to go on explorations and discovery,"" Wilson said.
""We were born into an Indiana Jones world,"" Waller-Bridge said. ""I grew up with those movies. The fact that they made this film in the first place is so special. I would have been so excited anyway, let alone actually being in it.""

2023-07-07 11:00:00+00:00,How Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny De-Aged Harrison Ford,Industrial Light & Magic developed a new suite of tools to reincarnate the Indy of the 80s. The effect is haunting—and raises more questions about the use of AI in Hollywood.,"Near the end of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Nazis attempt to pull off one of the oldest tropes in entertainment: using the movie’s titular dial, the Antikythera, to travel back to 1939 and assassinate Adolf Hitler. As their aircraft bears down on a time warp, the scientist Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), tells Indy of his plan to install himself as the führer and win the war. In his mind, history’s “greatest moment” is “it’s end.”
To enter the past, then, is to end history. It’s Voller’s motto, but also the movie’s—a nod to the de-aging technology that has made it possible. Thanks to several tools—machine learning, CGI, other tech—80-year-old Harrison Ford spends roughly 25 minutes of the film looking like the Indiana Jones of the early 1980s. He personifies the end of history brought about by technology’s endeavor to pull people out of time, to return Ford or Bruce Willis or Robert De Niro to their younger selves. Ford’s is also a face many fear: a visual representation of a future for Hollywood in which aging or deceased actors can be resuscitated via artificial intelligence. That’s the promise. But the message that comes through in Dial of Destiny, a film that seems intensely preoccupied with how it was made, is that there is something hauntingly sad about this vision.
The tech-reincarnated Indy of the 1980s makes a poignant contrast to the Indy we see for most of the film: a retired academic, stuck in a crusty apartment and estranged from Marion Ravenwood. Dial’s story, like the Jones movies before it, focuses on an ancient MacGuffin (the Antikythera) sought by both Indy and Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). She seeks to sell it for a pretty penny on the black market; he, of course, thinks it belongs in an American museum. Naturally, they form an uneasy alliance to stop Voller.
So how does de-aged Ford look? An odd mix of impressive and unreal, his face unhumanly smooth as if slathered with magic grease, glowing from within like a Stable Diffusion portrait that moves. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, who worked with Steven Spielberg on all of his Indy movies in the ’80s, recently told Empire that she hoped fans would see the movie and think someone had found footage from 40 years ago. This will probably not be the case—and not just because director James Mangold shot the film in 4K. Ford looks too perfect, his surroundings too clean. It looks like trickery, but of course you are looking for trickery.
The current discourse around AI and Hollywood would have you believe that a Disney executive fed Ford’s face into a copier and pressed a big “De-Age” button. New tech always provokes this reaction, explains Andrew Whitehurst, one of the VFX supervisors at Industrial Light & Magic who worked on Dial’s de-aging. “People assumed that we all sat down in front of a Silicon Graphics workstation in 1993, pressed D for ‘dinosaur,’ and Jurassic Park fell out of the back of the computer,” he says.
“From my perspective, there’s nothing that we can’t do. Given enough time and resources, we can accomplish anything.” ILM VFX supervisor Robert Weaver
Instead, ILM used a set of tools it calls FaceSwap. Like the the purpose-built tech ILM developed to let Martin Scorsese de-age actors for The Irishman, Dial of Destiny utilized a proprietary system called Flux that used two infrared cameras perched on either side of the one filming Ford to gather information from his performance. Unlike The Irishman, it also involved what the actor called “dots on my face” that captured even more data. All of that info was then combined to create a “CG mask” that could be placed on Indy in every frame.
To ensure Ford looked like his younger self, the ILM team used machine learning tools to scour years of footage of the actor that Lucasfilm had in its archives. The team also worked with VFX tools from Disney Research and a “smattering” of other sources to fine-tune the de-aged shots. “Each of these things is a pencil; now we have another pencil,” says Whitehurst. “So it’s just enabling us to make better choices.”
Most of the de-aged scenes take place on a train hurtling through the Bavarian countryside. Keeping the suitable “physical configuration of the face,” as ILM VFX supervisor Robert Weaver puts it, is a fiendish process involving a blue screen and hundreds of artists. Because the sequence begins at night and ends at dawn, Indy’s smirk might require a dash less shadow from one moment to the next, but that tweak could introduce a sheen that highlights new creases and makes the smirk read as a frown.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LWRlLWFnaW5nLXRlY2gv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-07 16:30:00+00:00,‘Indiana Jones 5’: It Took 100+ VFX Industrial Light and Magic Artists to De-Age Harrison Ford,"Over 100 VFX artists spent three years working on ""Indiana Jones 5"" to help de-age Harrison Ford.","Before “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” even opened, the Disney adventure tentpole sparked intrigue with a de-aged Harrison Ford, who, in his fifth film playing the whip-cracking archaeologist, is now 80 years old.
The shots of a young Ford look impressive, and it’s thanks to the team of over 100 artists at Industrial Light and Magic, who spent three years on the film’s visual effects, which also included enhancing and developing their existing de-aging technology to create ILM FaceSwap.
Photorealism de-aging was nothing new to the team. After all, technology such as Flux existed and had been used on films such as “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” and “The Irishman.”
But when the film’s VFX supervisor Andrew Whitehurst and Robert Weaver, VFX supervisor at ILM, first took on the James Mangold-helmed “Dial of Destiny,” they knew this was going to be the biggest project they had undertaken.
Disney
“We knew we would have to use all of the tools we already had and develop some new ones,” Whitehurst says. So they developed ILM FaceSwap.
This new set of tools allowed the team to blend a full computer-generated 3D head, combine elements that had been extracted from on-set photography and, as Whitehurst explains, use “machine learning-based reference material from previous ‘Indiana Jones’ films.” Once the artists had that reference material, including a raw clay model in the shape of Ford’s Indy, they went to work making the actor look like a younger version of himself on a shot-by-shot basis.
But the process didn’t end there.
Weaver explains that while the machine learning aspect gave them a 2D replica of what they needed, there was still a full 3D CG asset that needed to be built.
“That involved putting Harrison through the process of recording all the facial performances and all its extremes, and the marrying of various technologies by the artists to blend between one and the other to get the final performance that you’re looking for,” Weaver explains. “The important aspect is that there’s not a single recipe that was cooked up that could be done for all shots.”
Whitehurst worked on the film for over three years, and one of the first things he did was “scan Harrison’s head so we had a current cast.” Once they had that, he and his team began building the 1944 CG head and used other elements from the Lucasfilm archives to help build that out.
While they were doing that, they also storyboarded the film’s prologue sequence to get an idea of the shots they needed. When it came to filming, Whitehurst says, “We made sure we were shooting with extra cameras attached to the main unit camera so we could get as much reference as we possibly could.”
That included capturing lighting references for every single setup so they could replicate it in the CG process.
Weaver says, “On the ILM side there were a few hundred artists involved in the process from start to finish, working on the various shots. They were working on every nuance in every shot. But we were able to achieve that because the reliance on the performance of Harrison was of utmost importance. He was the major driving force of what we needed to do for that opening act and make a younger act of that exact performance.”
Mangold was also key. Whitehurst calls it an “intense collaborative process” that began early, with the director laying out creatively how the sequence would play and “the action beats that would have to be featured within it.” Once the film got to post-production, Whitehurst says Mangold was “so open to hearing ideas from others.”
As to Ford, Weaver says, “We were just in awe as to what he is able to deliver, how fit he is and how much we could rely on him driving every aspect of the performance.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9hcnRpc2Fucy9uZXdzL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtNS1kZWFnaW5nLWhhcnJpc29uLWZvcmQtMTIzNTY2MzI2NC_SAVxodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvYXJ0aXNhbnMvbmV3cy9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLTUtZGVhZ2luZy1oYXJyaXNvbi1mb3JkLTEyMzU2NjMyNjQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Indiana Jones: Harrison Ford says he wanted 'emotional ending',The actor is playing the character for the final time in the fifth instalment of the franchise.,"Indiana Jones: Harrison Ford says he wanted 'emotional ending'
By Emma Jones BBC Talking Movies
Disney
Harrison Ford said he wanted the ageing of his character to be developed into a complex story
There's often speculation when an artist announces a ""last"" project that it won't be - which is why Harrison Ford is still being asked whether this really will be his last outing wearing the battered hat of legendary adventurer Indiana Jones.
But the actor is unequivocal in his reply to BBC News.
""It is my final film,"" he says. ""And I was always ambitious with this final film.""
It could be argued the movie, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the first for the franchise since 2008's Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, wasn't even necessary to conclude the series, since Ford is now 80 years old.
But the actor says he wanted to give this beloved character ""an emotional ending"" while acknowledging the passing of time.
""We've been making these films for 40 years, we can't deny the effect of age on the character, and I wanted to see that developed into a complex story,"" he says.
Disney
Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen plays the villain in the latest instalment of the franchise
The film makes a virtue of the character's age, showing the professor of archaeology complaining as he's performing action stunts with his god-daughter Helena, played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, as the pair chase an ancient dial that can alter the course of history.
The film is packed with in-jokes about the character as well as featuring Indiana Jones's greatest enemies, the Nazis, led in this film by Danish actor and former Bond villain Mads Mikkelsen.
But Ford insists he won't be tempted back: ""I was not so much interested in doing the same thing over and over again, I wanted to have an emotional ending to this character.
""And I'm so grateful for the audience that we've had, I just wanted to make sure that they would be satisfied and happy with the final iteration.""
That's not guaranteed - the film's world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival drew lukewarm reviews from critics. The BBC review at the time said that the film was ""a depressing reminder of how much livelier his past adventures were"".
It's also the first film in the series that's not directed by Steven Spielberg, although he remains an executive producer.

Harrison Ford received an honorary Palme d'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival in May
At one point, Dial of Destiny ranked at only 52% on American review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, although it's since risen.
But the nostalgia factor could still be a powerful lure for audiences. Those who remember the trilogy from the 1980s - Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade include Mikkelsen, who says: ""Anyone I know would have killed me if I turned it down.
""I watched it first when I was 15 years old. And it was a huge inspiration to me in terms of acting, but also to a lot of my colleagues, a lot of directors.""
Audiences can be reminded of Indiana Jones in all his glory in an extended flashback scene in this movie, played by the present-day Harrison Ford and altered by technology.
Ford explains that the images ""are just what I looked like 35 years ago. It's not disquieting, it's not Photoshop, because it's real images.""
Martin Scorsese's The Irishman also digitally altered Robert De Niro to take his character in the mafia film backwards and forwards in age, and as Dial of Destiny director James Mangold explains, the technology is continuing to advance.
""Steven Spielberg shot four Indiana Jones movies with Harrison, three of them were in the age that the opening sequence takes place in,"" he says.
Disney
Phoebe Waller-Bridge has played down the suggestion the franchise will continue with her character as the lead
So, he had a reservoir of Harrison's face, every expression, every lighting style. On top of that, Harrison is not a pound over the weight he was when he was 35 years old. So, the computer mapping of putting that young flesh, visage on him, is easy because the bones of the man haven't changed at all.
""And he's driving the performance. It's not just motion capture, it's a performance based on his acting, knowing he is playing himself much younger.""
Emmy-winning Fleabag actress and writer Waller-Bridge took on her first action role in the character of Helena, described by the Guardian's review as ""a naughty Enid Blyton heroine"".
She says Ford told her to ""act like you're hammered"" in a punching scene.
""It was a scene where I was going to be punched and I was very tense. And he came up and was like, 'just act like you're hammered.' It was that kind of mature advice I was given daily,"" she jokes.
""But the stunts alone were the time of my life. They're my happy place now, being thrown off things, or tripping over things, sometimes just being strung from a ceiling. It doesn't get old.""
Ford says that her action performance is ""terrific - I had no idea she would be so capable and so fearless"".
Disney
The film received mixed reviews from critics following its Cannes premiere
But Waller-Bridge has reportedly ruled herself out of succeeding Harrison Ford if its makers want to continue the franchise. Ford himself quipped to reporters at the US premiere that ""Jennifer Lopez would be fantastic"" when asked who should succeed him as Indiana Jones.
But the actor isn't retiring. He'll continue working in two series - the western 1923 with Helen Mirren and Shrinking, where he plays a curmudgeonly therapist.
Indiana Jones is now a closed chapter in his life, the actor reiterates, saying: ""I just feel a sense of completion.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LWFydHMtNjYwMDEwMzjSAThodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3MvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1hcnRzLTY2MDAxMDM4LmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-26 09:50:00+00:00,Indiana Jones and the Contractually Mandated Fifth Adventure,"The latest chapter may not be necessary, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a blast.","In 1979, when Steven Spielberg and George Lucas signed with Paramount Pictures to develop a film series based on classic Hollywood adventure serials, the deal they struck was to make five separate movies. The first, Raiders of the Lost Ark, was released in the summer of 1981 and became that year’s top-grossing movie, beating even the long-anticipated Superman II and remaining on screens in some cities for more than a year. By 1984, it was Raiders’ sequel, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, that had become the year’s most anticipated movie, banking that year’s biggest opening weekend, and the third entry in the franchise, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, became not only the highest-grossing movie of 1989 but the top-earning Indiana Jones movie yet.
Given that track record, and viewed from the perspective of our own IP-crazed times, it seems inconceivable that Spielberg and Lucas decided not to move forward immediately with a fourth Indiana Jones picture (though Lucas did go on to produce a spinoff TV series, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles). The reason: They were unable to come up with a plot device that would credibly carry the beloved archeology-prof-turned-world-adventurer through another feature-length story. Lucas’ idea, a riff on the 1950s sci-fi films that would have been contemporaneous with a middle-aged Indy, was to introduce extraterrestrial beings into the previously earthbound Raiders universe. But, according to Lucas, that notion was struck down by both Spielberg and star Harrison Ford, who on hearing the pitch replied with a gruffness that’s easy to picture: “No way am I being in a Steve Spielberg movie like that.” (Steve’s own response was so ambivalent as to recall Hamlet: “I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know.”)

Almost 20 years would pass before Ford would once again don the fedora, in a Spielberg movie exactly like that. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, released in the summer of 2008 to mostly thuddingly bad reviews, featured a cursed glass knick-knack from outer space, an interdimensional portal housed in a Peruvian obelisk, and a famously nuclear-blast-proof refrigerator. Some critics, me among them, were so glad to see Indy again that they forgave the fourth movie its silliness and enjoyed its small pleasures (Cate Blanchett as a Russian dominatrix-style villain! John Hurt as an antiquities savant driven insane by the titular trinket!), but very few of us walked out expecting or needing a fifth. And yet 15 years later, with Ford about to turn 81, the Paramount prophecy has been fulfilled. With the release of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the Indiana Jones series is, as originally planned, a pentalogy, even if this last chapter is the first of the five not to have been co-written by Lucas or directed by Spielberg. Instead, James Mangold (Walk the Line, Logan, Ford v. Ferrari) is at the helm—and if it isn’t cinematic sacrilege to say so, his solidly entertaining if not inspired installment feels truer to the franchise’s swashbuckling spirit than the latest Spielbergian contribution.

For the length of the movie’s opening sequence, an elaborately staged chase in the series’ grand first-act tradition, you might think Mangold had cutting-room-floor footage from the Raiders archive, given the smooth surface of Indy’s digitally de-aged face and the agility of his footwork as he escapes from a pack of Nazis on a moving train. With the war nearing its end, the Germans, under the command of true believer Jürgen Voller (a deliciously punchable Mads Mikkelsen), are trying to smuggle a trainload of pilfered treasure out of the country. Indy finds his friend and expedition partner, mild-mannered British archeologist Basil Shaw (Toby Jones), tied to a chair in the train car that doubles as Voller’s interrogation chamber. The Nazis, Shaw explains, have gotten their hands on the Antikythera, a powerful ancient artifact supposed to have been invented by the Greek mathematician Archimedes with the aim of finding “fissures in time.” (This priceless doodad, the world’s oldest known analog computer, is real, though it is only known to predict such celestial events as eclipses, not time warps.)

After one more spectacular chase atop the racing train, Indy and Shaw escape with their lives as the audience encounters a time fissure of our own. Fast-forward 25 years to the summer of 1969: All of America is going wild over humankind’s first trip to the moon. Well, all but for the now gray-haired and craggy-faced Professor Jones, who’s grouchily sleeping off one too many slugs of whiskey in his lonely Manhattan apartment. His wife, Marion (Karen Allen, appearing only briefly), has just filed for divorce, for reasons that will be revealed later on; his job teaching archeology no longer seems to inspire either him or his glazed-eyed students.
Advertisement
Indy’s glum routine is thrown off by the sudden appearance of his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). Helena’s father, the now-deceased Basil, lost his sanity spinning paranoid (or were they?) theories about the missing half of his precious Antikythera.
His daughter is determined to travel the world to find it—a plan that would suit the motives of either a loyal daughter or a mercenary black-market antiques dealer. Meanwhile, Voller, a fascist so committed that he at one point appears to badmouth Hitler for not having believed hard enough in the Thousand-Year Reich, is working undercover as a U.S. government scientist. Herr Voller seeks the mystical Greek whim-wham for an even less noble purpose: Like some contemporary political figures I could name, he longs to travel backward in time to a place where life was simpler and made more sense. You know: Germany in 1944.

The abrupt entrance of Waller-Bridge into the Raiders-verse at first generates a wave of cognitive dissonance: What are Fleabag and Indy doing in New York in the late 1960s? But as we get to know Helena (whom Indy calls “Wombat,” an old childhood nickname), the alliance begins to make sense. She and her irascible godfather, for all their bickering as they hurtle in various hotly pursued vehicles from to Tangier to Sicily and back to New York again, are alike: two wisecracking skeptics with incurable wanderlust and a problem expressing sincere emotion. Waller-Bridge’s physical presence is both commanding and comical, her lanky frame and klutziness in the face of danger giving her an Olive Oyl–like quality. Her relationship with Indy toggles between affectionate and prickly, landing at a place of grudging mutual acceptance that, perhaps because I am basic, I found genuinely touching.

In their travels, Indy and Helena cross paths with some figures familiar from earlier chapters of the saga, like Sallah (a likeable Egyptian character who, as played by Welsh actor John Rhys-Davies, should nonetheless perhaps have stayed back in the 20th century), and others new to this episode, like Helena’s teenage sidekick Teddy (Ethann Isidore) and a Spanish boat captain (Antonio Banderas) who takes the gang on a dive to explore an ancient shipwreck. The cinematic references at play derive less from golden-era Hollywood than from previous Indiana Jones adventures: There is a callback to Indy’s fear of snakes, a clever reversal of a gag from the first movie involving a less-than-fair gunfight, and the familiar but still pleasing image of a globe traversed by a moving red line that establishes the protagonists’ location. (As the Muppets have noted, there are few more efficient modes of transportation than “traveling by map.”)

Though the action is often wittily imagined and choreographed, no one could confuse Mangold’s workmanlike direction with Spielberg’s kinetic instinct for how to place and move a camera. Still, Dial of Destiny clips along nicely: Even at 2 hours and 22 minutes, the pace seldom drags. Above all, this movie understands, respects, and loves its title character, even in a loopy late sequence that drops the bullwhip-wielding scholar into a circumstance we’ve never seen or imagined him in before. A sudden third-act swerve into the supernatural—a feature all the franchise’s movies have shared, if not quite at this level of implausibility—could easily have lost the audience’s goodwill, but by drawing on our long experience of the curmudgeonly grave-robber’s passions, beliefs, and preferences, the movie manages to serve up a twist that’s as psychologically credible as it is contrary to all known laws of physics.

Ford has spoken in proprietary terms about his four-decade-long relationship with the character of Professor Henry Walton Jones Jr.: “I’m Indiana Jones. When I’m gone, he’s gone.” Indy has been the great role of Ford’s career (sympathies to the also-memorable Han Solo) and one of the enduring movie characters of my lifetime. You might say that the last two chapters of his story, contractually intended from the start or no, were unnecessary (though Dial of Destiny certainly stands head and shoulders above The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and, depending on your taste, may surpass the second film in the series, the often cringingly xenophobic Temple of Doom). But now that Indiana Jones (though not, thankfully, the man who plays him) seems in fact to have made his last stand, I for one am grateful to have had the chance to stow away on his final adventure.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy8wNi9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLTUtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LW1vdmllLXJldmlldy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

15:00.2,AutoMatters & More: Movie Review: Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"Set primarily in 1969, with flashbacks to establish the backstory in World War II, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the final Indiana Jones adventure — undoubtedly due to Harrison Ford’s advanced age.","Set primarily in 1969, with flashbacks to establish the backstory in World War II, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the final Indiana Jones adventure — undoubtedly due to Harrison Ford’s advanced age. Nevertheless, his on-screen persona is immediately recognizable, complete with his leather jacket, brown fedora and intimidating, loudly cracking bullwhip.
If you enjoyed the previous Indiana Jones movies, you will not be disappointed with this globe-trotting final installment. It has everything, beginning with fights with dastardly Nazis, and moving along to improbably campy derring-do atop a rapidly moving train, behind the wheels of automobiles, endless chases on foot and appropriate one-liners.
In the theater for the preview screening.
(Jan Wagner)
This time around Harrison Ford portrays a reluctant Indiana Jones. A professor at Hunter College in New York, he is facing his imminent retirement. His students find him boring. He lives a rather sedate, peaceful, uneventful life and he seems to be quite content with that. Soon, however, he is dragged kicking and screaming out of his retirement by someone from his past who needs his help. Of course, that character is much more than they initially appear to be, a situation that inevitably leads to Professor Jones’ efforts to try to save the world from an unimaginably horrible, history-changing, dire fate.
That said, important aspects of this movie merit criticism. Right at the start, the World War II fighting scenes are dark. I’m not talking about dark in tone (although it can be argued that they are that, too), but rather they are literally too dark. Much of the action takes place in near darkness — so much so that you can barely see the details of the action and the stunts, which were no doubt produced at very great expense. Why would they do that — and at a preview screening of the film in IMAX, no less? That was distracting and unnecessarily annoying.

That’s not all. I soon became distracted by another serious technical problem, but this one continued throughout the film. The sound was so distorted at times that I could not understand the dialog. It was as if the audio track was being played through the theater’s sound system at way too high an audio level. I’ll put that one on the theater. Hopefully your screening will be better.
Without spoiling the details for you, I will tell you that the really cool stuff related to the dial of destiny — the Archimedes Dial — happens close to the end of the film. The bulk of the film, however, was made up of silly, wildly improbable chases. The hero Tuk-Tuk vehicle which, by its frail-looking appearance should have been quite fragile, instead was seemingly indestructible as it endured innumerable impacts — many if not almost all of which should surely have caused it to fail massively, but instead it continued on, again and again. I’m talking about a degree of silliness almost as ridiculous as Wile E. Coyote falling off of cliffs while in the almost futile pursuit of the Road Runner.

It used to be that in movie car chases the film was undercranked, so that when it was played back at normal speed the cars appear to be sped up — which looked very fake. These days car chases in the movies — especially stratospherically high-budget movies — feature much more realistic chase scenes which at least look like they might somehow be possible — but not here. Be prepared to Laugh Out Loud. Unless you are a really little kid (in which case you would probably not be reading this review), you just will not be able to take what you see seriously.
I left the theater wishing that the script had focused more of its attention on the really clever, jaw-dropping stuff that focused on what the dial of destiny was capable of doing.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny was directed by James Mangold (Ford v Ferrari) and, in addition to Harrison Ford, its stars include Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Fleabag), Antonio Banderas (Pain and Glory), Karen Allen and John Rhys-Davies (Raiders of the Lost Ark), Shaunette Renée Wilson (Black Panther) and Thomas Kretschmann (Das Boot).

2023-06-08 16:48:05+00:00,‘Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny’ To Ring Up Around $60M Opening: Here’s Why – Early Box Office Outlook,"In the wake of world premiering in Cannes to lackluster film reviews at 50% Rotten, Disney/Lucasfilm's Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is currently looking at a $60M+ domestic opening.","In the wake of world premiering in Cannes to lackluster film reviews at 50% Rotten, Disney/Lucasfilm‘s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is currently looking at a $60M+ domestic opening.
The movie opens on June 30 heading into what is conceivably a five-day play period given that Independence Day falls on a Tuesday.
Dial of Destiny‘s 3-day is down from the $100.1M 3-day of the last movie, 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull — and this latest sequel reps the finale for the entire franchise. Crystal Skull opened on a Thursday over a Memorial Day weekend earning in total over five days, $151.9M. Logan filmmaker James Mangold took over helming the finale from franchise architect Steven Spielberg. Currently, Dial of Destiny is tracking significantly with older guys over younger, which has many comping he pic to the Daniel Craig 007 finale, No Time to Die ($55.2M) and 2018’s Mission: Impossible – Fallout ($61.2M).
Some are saying a $70M start for Dial of Destiny — that’s quite a stretch. Realize that Lionsgate’s John Wick: Chapter 4 opened to $73.8M with double the tracking metrics that Dial of Destiny is showing here.
Disney will need to pick up the slack in the coming weeks in their marketing to get more interest from younger guys, their distraction now being Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse in theaters and the upcoming Warner Bros DC The Flash on June 16. However, that hard word of mouth out of Cannes is quite the hurdle. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which wasn’t beloved by many, settled at 77% certified fresh and a B CinemaScore versus the previous 1989 installment, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which earned 84% certified fresh from critics and a solid A CinemaScore.
With Dial of Destiny at a $60M 3-day, that’s easily the second-best start for the Indiana Jones franchise. In the box office era, Last Crusade opened to $29.3M 3-day ($46.9M over extended Memorial Day weekend) at 2,327 theaters. 1984’s Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom bowed to $25.3M 3-day ($42.2M extended Memorial Day weekend) at 1,687 theaters. 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark‘s gross trajectory harkens back to the way blockbusters were made over a year: The pic opened to $8.3M at 1,078 theaters and by January 1982 earned $179.6M with an initial cume of $212.2M, lifetime gross of $248.1M.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1hbmQtdGhlLWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLXByb2plY3Rpb24tMTIzNTQxMjAxMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-07-12 21:00:00+00:00,Harrison Ford Was Baffled by ‘Indiana Jones’ Costume at First: ‘What Am I Going to Do with a F*cking Whip?’,"Harrison Ford revealed that he was skeptical over the practicality of the ""Indiana Jones"" costume in 1981.","Harrison Ford didn’t feel like Indiana Jones was destined to be a style icon.
The Oscar winner admitted during a GQ video interview that the costume initially baffled him when he started on “Raiders of the Lost Ark.”
“It was presented to me as an aspect of the character in the first film,” Ford said. “My questions about it were many.”
The “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” star continued, “Why am I wearing a leather jacket in the jungle? Isn’t it hot here? Why am I carrying a whip? What am I going to do with a fucking whip? Am I going to whip people?”
However, the production team told Ford at the time that “Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark,” despite being made in 1981, had to have an “evocation of time” and a “reflection of movies past” since it was set in 1936.
“I said OK, and that makes it my own,” Ford said, before showing off the presumed scars from when Indy’s fedora was rumored to be stapled to his head. A behind-the-scenes clip of “Raiders of the Lost Ark” seemed to show Ford attaching the hat to his forehead with a staple gun.
“I still have the…see it?” Ford explained now to GQ, adding, “You do what you need to do.”
Ford’s final turn as Indy was in this year’s “Dial of Destiny,” helmed by James Mangold.
“I wanted an ambitious movie to be the last one,” Ford said, “And I don’t mean that we didn’t make ambitious movies before — they were ambitious in many different ways. But not necessarily as ambitious with the character as I wanted the last one to be.”
Franchise creator and original director Steven Spielberg applauded Mangold’s vision for the final “Indiana Jones” film starring Ford during the recent Time 100 summit.
“It’s a really, really good ‘Indiana Jones’ film. I’m really proud of what Jim has done with it,” Spielberg said. “When the lights came up I just turned to the group and said, ‘Damn! I thought I was the only one who knew how to make one of these.’”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9icmVha2luZy1uZXdzL2hhcnJpc29uLWZvcmQtYmFmZmxlZC1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWNvc3R1bWUtMTIzNDg4MzIyMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Inside the VFX of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Andrew Whitehurst of ILM discusses the techniques used to create the memorable effects of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.,"Spoiler warning: This article discusses story details and plot points of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
“I’ve been looking for this all my life,” says our adventuring archaeologist in the trailer for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. But that sentiment could have also come from Industrial Light & Magic’s Andrew Whitehurst, longtime visual effects supervisor, about what the opportunity to work on the film represented.
“I have the joy-of-going-to-the movies side of loving Indiana Jones, which was that it was this ultra-exciting adventure serial,” he tells Lucasfilm.com. “Everything seemed plausible and tangible and real-world, but then with this supernatural edge to it. The characters were so engaging and there never seemed to be anything cynical about it. The peril is absolutely in earnest and the jokes are absolutely in earnest. Even as a kid, I loved that. And from the visual effects side of it, in the ‘80s there was a BBC science series called Horizon. Every week they would do an episode on a different subject, and one week they did visual effects, which I knew nothing about. I was nine years old, and it was mainly focused around the making of Temple of Doom. And so I had my mind blown for an hour where I learned that you could make movies with models and paintings and animation. That was my literal introduction to what visual effects is. To see that and, you know, 40 years later I’m supervising the fifth one, it’s kind of crazy. So, the visual effects of Indiana Jones is a really key component in me doing what I do for a living now.”
The adventure begins
As production visual effects supervisor on Dial of Destiny, Whitehurst would oversee the work of ILM and all vendors for a time and world-jumping adventure, which follows Indy from WWII-era Europe to 1969 New York and Morocco to ancient Sicily. Even for someone with Skyfall, Ex Machina, and Annihilation on his resume, it was a lot. “The trickiest thing about a movie like this is that it’s an odyssey,” he says. “Almost every single scene is in a different location or has a different component to it. So you have to break up the project into all of the various places that we are and things that happen within those places.” Whitehurst worked closely with production designer Adam Stockhausen in figuring out the look of the various effects sequences in the movie, with input from director James Mangold throughout the process.
Over time, Whitehurst has developed his own method for realizing sequences in a way that welcomes in his collaborators. “My background is in fine arts, so I tend to draw and paint a lot for two reasons. One, for me to start to get my own head around how things might look or the things that are going to be tricky. And also, then, to communicate ‘How about doing things this way?’ to Jim or Adam or, Phedon Papamichael the DP, or Mike McCusker the editor, and so that they’ve got something concrete in front of them as a drawing or as a really rough, sketchy animatic or a painting or something. They go, ‘Well, I like this. I don’t like that. What about doing this?’ I tried to get things going visually as early as possible, often in quite a rough, loose way.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1Y2FzZmlsbS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWFuZHJldy13aGl0ZWh1cnN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

,"Caves, Castles, and Tuna Factories: Inside the Locations of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny",Supervising location manager Duncan Broadfoot talks with Lucasfilm.com about filming locations in Europe and Africa.,"In the initial phase of his role as supervising location manager, Broadfoot oversaw a team of scouts in multiples countries, each helping to identify potential filming sites based on descriptions in the screenplay and on briefs from director James Mangold and production designer Adam Stockhausen. Where a typical Indy adventure already demands a large global search for distinct locales, Dial of Destiny faced additional challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Any travels in foreign countries resulted in weeks lost to quarantine,” explains Broadfoot. “Sometimes it’d be 10 days quarantine in the country and then ten days upon their return. So we tried a new remote scouting technology for the first time. Essentially, we had a team on the ground with an iPhone camera. The footage they captured went through an app and was beamed back to our control room in the UK, kind of like a broadcast scenario. Then that was fed into a Zoom call. The director in Los Angeles, the designer in New York, and the producers in London could be on the same call with a high-definition link to real-time footage of the location. They could speak to us and direct the camera around the location. We could even move between different countries and teams on the same call. We were limiting the traveling of the team so there was less exposure to COVID and less time in quarantine.”
Having narrowed down their selections, a small team would then visit the locations in person. “There is definitely value in being there in person to settle on what the final location is going to be,” says Broadfoot. “In every scenario, we established that we were in the right place and it was worth visiting. When we traveled there, we quite often wandered elsewhere and found other options as well.”
But there were other unique challenges. The film’s memorable tuk-tuk chase was initially slated for India. But when Broadfoot and others traveled to the cities Jaisalmer and Jaipur, “there was a terrible outbreak of Covid, and we had to leave the country and reevaluate,” as he explains. “Katmandu in Nepal was considered next, but then a similar Covid outbreak happened. Morocco came together very quickly after that.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1Y2FzZmlsbS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWR1bmNhbi1icm9hZGZvb3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Mads Mikkelsen and Boyd Holbrook joined ABC7 to discuss the new movie
CHICAGO (WLS) -- The grand finale of the Indiana Jones saga hits theaters next week.
The actors who play the villains are ready to do the hero in and spoil his last hurrah. They spoke with ABC7 about ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.""
""Obviously it's surreal. We grew up with this, at a point where we had no plans of being actors. So, we just like anybody else, morphed into the film, and wanted to be 'Indiana Jones,' so it's crazy to be here 42 years later,"" said Mads Mikkelsen, who plays ""Jurgen Voller.""
Mikkelsen also spoke about his character in the film.
""He was a scientist working in Germany in the 30s and 40s. That should ring a bell. Obviously, he wants to make the world a much better place,"" Mikkelsen said.
Boyd Holbrook also spoke about his character, ""Klaber.""
""I play, basically, Voller's lap dog. I do all the stuff he can't get his hands dirty with,"" Holbrook said.
The actor additionally talked about some intense action sequences.
""Some of those 'took tooks' were replaced with Tesla engines, and they were going 70 miles an hour. A world-class crew arrived months ahead of time to plan all this stuff out, at a totally different scale,"" Holbrook said.
And, of course, they spoke about working with Harrison Ford.
""If the three of us were to get together now, we would be the adults in the room,"" Mikkelsen said. ""He is a kid by heart. He makes everything easy for everybody else because he's really taking it serious, but at the same time, he's also bringing it down to earth.

2023-07-05 18:20:46+00:00,"Disney’s Harsh New Reality: Costly Film Flops, Creative Struggles and a Shrinking Global Box Office","Disney, once the theatrical gold standard, is experiencing a turn in box office fortunes.","For the past decade, Disney has been the Teflon movie studio, remarkably adept at withstanding the tectonic changes impacting the film industry, and well fortified by its arsenal of key properties such as Marvel, Lucasfilm and Pixar.
But this year, the long-reigning titan of the box office has shown cracks as four of its biggest releases from those brands and others have struggled in theaters. There was the dispiriting release of “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” a rare Marvel movie to likely lose tens of millions in its theatrical run; “The Little Mermaid,” a remake of the 1989 animated classic that fell drastically short of expectations; “Elemental,” an original story that tried and failed to recapture Pixar’s magic; and most recently “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” a nearly $300 million investment in one of cinemas’ most venerable franchises, which no longer appears to have the same hold on today’s audiences. On paper, these films seemed like they had all of the makings of huge hits, but somehow the Disney sparkle was lacking this time, in terms of filling movie theater seats.
Barring a miracle –- or a sudden surge of interest in all things “Haunted Mansion” — “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” looks like it’ll be the studio’s biggest earner of the year with $835 million. It’s the first time since 2014 (except for the pandemic-stricken years of 2020 and 2021) that Disney won’t have a movie that reaches $1 billion. It also marks a shift from 2022, which saw the studio release not only hits like “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” and “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” but also “Avatar: The Way of Water,” the third-highest grossing film in history.
Even if that’s the case, Disney still far outranks the competition in terms of market share in 2023, commanding 37% of the industry’s revenues (Universal is close behind at 31%). But ticket sales for the films it has produced have been more Earth-bound, especially compared to the last pre-COVID year, when Disney fielded a record seven movies that crossed the billion-dollar mark in 2019. In many cases, reviews for recent releases haven’t been standout, with critics being particularly scathing about “Quantumania” and openly questioning the need for a fifth “Indy” adventure. Audiences have been kinder, giving these movies respectable ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and CinemaScore.
There are other issues bedeviling the Magic Kingdom these days. Because of its all-tentpole, all-the-time strategy, Disney’s movies each require production budgets of at least $200 million — plus marketing costs of roughly $100 million. That means the studio’s films have a higher benchmark than its rivals to break even at the box office. In the past, those budgets were justified with movies that crossed $1 billion worldwide with ease. Those price tags are riskier in today’s box office landscape, with China’s dollars no longer a guarantee due to tensions with the West and changing tastes. Russia, another major market, is entirely cut off from Hollywood movies after its invasion of Ukraine. As a result, the international box office has diminished to a shadow of its former self, and that has major consequences for Disney’s profitability. To be fair, every studio is grappling with these punishing realities as the box office remains down roughly 20% from pre-pandemic times, but Disney has historically enjoyed such a track record of success and its issues are casting a pall over the movie business.
“Anything Disney threw out in 2019 made $1 billion,” says Jeff Bock, an analyst with Exhibitor Relations. “Now, it’s more difficult than ever to release a film worldwide. The international landscape has changed. It’s not close to back.”
The problem is that getting these costs under control will take time. Major movies take at least three to four years to develop, produce and distribute — a lifetime in a fast-changing industry. Even if Disney is serious about tightening its belt, it may not make a noticeable difference until 2026 or beyond.
“It takes a long time for a big ship like Disney to change course,” says Paul Verna, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence.
Some of these bloated budgets on 2023 releases reflect the tens of millions that were racked up from pandemic delays and enhanced COVID testing. That should ease as the pandemic becomes a less disruptive force, which should be a key source of cost savings. Beyond that, there are questions about where else Disney may save money — will it be in marketing the movies it produces or in cutting back on special effects and other cinematic set-pieces?
“If you cut costs, do you degrade the quality of the product?” says Brandon Nispel, an equity research analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets. “If you spend less, do people like the movies you are making less? And how much and how fast can you start cutting?”
The turn in fortunes isn’t only due to market conditions, but also a mix of creative shortfalls and outsized attention on streaming. Disney’s banner year in 2019, with the releases of “Avengers: Endgame,” “The Lion King,” “Frozen II” and more, came before Disney+ launched and squashed the need for repeat viewings in theaters. With “Endgame,” for example, people went to the movies three, four, even five times to watch the epic blockbuster that bid adieu to some of Marvel’s biggest heroes. Now, there’s less of a need to make multiple trips to the multiplex. Moviegoers can wait a matter of months (or less) for a film to land on streaming and satisfy the need for a rewatch.
“People have become conditioned to expect that things will quickly appear on Disney+,” says Neil Macker, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar Research Services. “The theatrical movie business has been in decline for awhile and the pandemic accelerated that.”
Pixar has suffered the most from that mindset, analysts believe. The animation empire has been struggling since the onset of COVID, when several of its titles were sent directly to Disney+ and trained family audiences to watch its movies at home. It’s re-entering the theatrical ring with heightened competition in the animation space from Illumination (“The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” “Minions: The Rise of Gru”), DreamWorks (“Puss in Boots: The Last Wish”) and Sony Pictures Animation (“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”). And those companies spend a fraction of Pixar’s budget to bring its animated adventures to life. Universal’s “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” which is expected to be the year’s highest-grossing film with more than $1.3 billion in revenues, cost $100 million to bring to life. That’s roughly half of what Pixar shelled out for “Elemental,” which has yet to crack $200 million globally. Rival studios believe that Disney’s animated efforts have become too twee and lack the more populist edge of “Mario” or Paramount’s upcoming “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” reboot.
“Pixar is becoming an anemic brand,” notes Verna. “It’s fallen so far from the days in in which anything it released would blow the doors off.”
“Star Wars,” too, has lost its luster in theaters as the franchise set in a galaxy far, far away has found repeated success on Disney+ with series like “The Mandalorian” and “Andor.” But following the 2019 release of “The Rise of Skywalker,” Lucasfilm’s efforts to get another trilogy off the ground have proceeded in fits and starts, with several high-profile projects being announced only to disappear into development limbo. Disney has planted three “Star Wars” films on the release calendar in 2026 and 2027, but hasn’t revealed any details about those movies.
“I’ll believe there’s a new ‘Star Wars’ movie when I’m seated in the theater and seeing the opening crawl,” says Josh Spiegel, a freelance film critic who specializes in Disney. “There have been so many false starts.”
As a sprawling media conglomerate, Disney is facing issues on all fronts. Bob Iger, who returned as CEO after a brief hiatus and displaced his successor Bob Chapek, is simultaneously battling Wall Street’s unrest over the unprofitability of Disney+, concerns that Disney’s parks business may have alienated customers with its higher prices, and a rise in cord cutting that’s imperiling its cable properties like ESPN. These are all doing more to depress Disney’s share price (which is down nearly 7% year-over-year) than the struggles with its latest movies.
“Streaming was positioned as the greatest business ever, and it didn’t live up to the hype,” says Nispel. “Disney’s losing more money than people thought it would, and the market became saturated more quickly than people expected. At the same time, the ground is shifting under linear TV and the parks business that had been a cash cow hasn’t fully recovered from the pandemic. Those are far bigger problems.”
And yet, Disney’s film business has long been an important stabilizing force, with the studio dwarfing the competition. And there’s been a very successful formula that Disney has deployed — not so much leaning into nostalgia as diving in head first — which may no longer be as effective. Live-action remakes of classics such as “Aladdin,” “Beauty and the Beast” and “The Jungle Book” were theatrical goldmines, even as those films were criticized by some as shot-for-shot remakes of the originals. At that time, the Disney name alone was enough to cut the noise in a crowded market. But the lackluster global turnout for “The Little Mermaid” is a sign that brand familiarity is no longer the ticket to get people to go to theaters. And the failure of the latest “Ant-Man” indicates the studio may need to be more judicious in the sequels it decides to back. That’s an issue because the studio has found less success in launching new original franchises, other than “Frozen.”
“Disney desperately needs to create something new,” Spiegel says. “It does a good job at cannibalizing itself. They remake their movies and echo what they’ve done in the past. At a certain point, there won’t be a whole lot for them to echo.”
More than its competitors, Disney can withstand some of its movies functioning as loss leaders. In addition to racking up ticket sales, the studio’s films are designed to boost interest in toys and theme parks. So although “The Little Mermaid” barely floated past the $500 million mark, the return of Ariel is helping to sell themed Legos, backpacks, dolls, bedding and nail polish. The same goes for underperforming Marvel adventures like “Ant-Man,” which brings an influx of interest to Avengers Campus, a Marvel Cinematic Universe–themed area at the Disney California Adventure park.
“They may not make it at the box office, but Disney will make up for it in merchandise sales and the longevity of the property,” says Bock. “That’s a lot different than Paramount or Sony, who needs to make all their money back at the box office.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvZGlzbmV5LWJveC1vZmZpY2UtZmFpbHVyZXMtaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1lbGVtZW50YWwtYW50LW1hbi0xMjM1NjYwNDA5L9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvZGlzbmV5LWJveC1vZmZpY2UtZmFpbHVyZXMtaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1lbGVtZW50YWwtYW50LW1hbi0xMjM1NjYwNDA5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Indy 5's box office haul a disaster for Disney's Bob Iger,Dial of Destiny could end up with just half the receipts its panned predecessor earned 15 years ago and rival John Carter as Disney's biggest bomb.,"Lucasfilm’s fifth Indiana Jones installment is shaping up to be a disaster of epic proportions for parent company Disney and its veteran CEO, Bob Iger.
Released on June 30, Dial of Destiny earned a disappointing $60 million in its opening weekend in the domestic theaters, and interest dropped off sharply ever since. Just one week later, it surrendered the top spot at the box office, despite being one of the most expensive movies ever made, and now it has sunk to a distant fourth in the table.
The new entry could no longer rely on the goodwill built up by the first three films after the critical disappointment of its predecessor, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Poor reviews and dreadful word of mouth look to now sink Lucasfilm’s first theatrical release since 2019.
Its $302 million global take has only matched roughly the reported costs of its production budget, which suffered from expensive reshoots after test screenings indicated audiences were less than thrilled with the initial ending.
Marketing and promotion are expected to have added easily another $100 million to that bill and Disney still has to pay the theaters their share of the receipts.
“It looks certain to fall short of the global total for 2008’s Crystal Skull: $786.6 million,” wrote Box Office Pro on Sunday.
The situation is far more dire, according to The Hollywood Handle. Dial Of Destiny is not expected to even cross the $400 million mark in global box office receipts—half of what the fourth installment made 15 years ago when a dollar went a lot further than today.
This seems a safe bet given the stiff competition it now faces in the form of spy thriller Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning, Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s biopic Oppenheimer. In reality, the Indy sequel needed to haul in around $800 million just to break even.
Should the grim predictions prove true, the Lucasfilm production could potentially rival John Carter as the Mouse House’s worst-ever live-action commercial bomb and call into question the future of studio boss Kathleen Kennedy, a former Fortune Most Powerful Woman.
Iger has made it clear financial responsibility now goes hand in hand with creative decision-makers.
But it may have consequences for Disney, as well. The share price has been trading near nine-year lows when excluding the 2020 pandemic dip, and speculation continues over whether Iger may be forced to sell the company to Apple.
Disney and Lucasfilm did not respond to a request from Fortune for comment.
Hulu cash call
Iger, who had his original two-year boomerang CEO contract extended last week by two more, can ill afford any box office flops.
He’ll need billions in cash next year to complete the buyout of Comcast’s minority stake in streaming platform Hulu.
The problem is that Disney’s lineup this year, with the possible exception of Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume Three, has so far been middling at best.
Commercial disappointments include Marvel’s Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania, the live-action remake of its animated classic The Little Mermaid, Pixar’s Elemental and now Dial of Destiny.
The upcoming slate looks little better: November’s The Marvels has little positive buzz going for it, especially after a recent string of superhero movies failing to make a profit, including Warner Bros. Discovery’s The Flash.
To drum up cash for Hulu, Iger is now exploring the potential sale of some of his linear networks—whether free-to-air or cable. The Disney CEO has said that the business model that has historically underpinned their distribution of content is ‘definitely broken’ thanks to direct-to-consumer streaming.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8xOS9kaXNuZXktaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1kaWFsLWRlc3RpbnktYm94LW9mZmljZS1ib21iLWx1Y2FzZmlsbS_SAV9odHRwczovL2ZvcnR1bmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTkvZGlzbmV5LWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtZGlhbC1kZXN0aW55LWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYm9tYi1sdWNhc2ZpbG0vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Far from it. During an upcoming interview on CNN and Max’s “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace?” (set to air and stream on June 23), Ford laughs at the idea of retiring from acting. Next month, he will turn 81 years old.
When asked if he plans to retire, Ford replied, “I don’t. I don’t do well when I don’t have work. I love to work. I love to feel useful. It’s my jones. I want to be helpful”
Why does Ford still have the acting bug as he gears up to turn 81 years old? “It is the people you get to work with,” he said. “The intensity and the intimacy of collaboration. It’s the combined ambition somehow forged from words on a page. I don’t plan what I want to do in a scene. I don’t feel obliged to do anything. I’m naturally affected by things that I work on.”
With “Indiana Jones” winding down, Ford has the Apple TV+ comedy “Shrinking” and the Paramount+ drama “1923” heading into second seasons once the writers strike concludes. He’s also spent recent weeks in Atlanta filming the Marvel tentpole “Captain America: Brave New World,” in which he stars as U.S. president Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross.
While age is but a number for Ford, he really wanted his current stage of life to be felt in his fifth and final “Indiana Jones” movie. He told Chris Wallace that the entire allure of coming back to play Indiana Jones was to embrace his age and not make it a joke.
“I wanted it to be character driven,” Ford said about his “Dial of Destiny” return. “And I wanted us to confront the question of age straight on. Not to to hide my age, but to take advantage of it in the telling of the story.”
When asked if it’s bittersweet saying goodbye to Indiana Jones, Ford answered: “No. It’s time for me to grow up.”
“Six years ago, I thought maybe we ought to take a shot at making another one,” Ford said. “And I wanted it to be about age because I think that rounds out the story that we’ve told and we brought it to the right place. I mean, the last one ended in kind of a suspended animation. There was not a real strong feeling of the conclusion or the closure that I always hoped for, the roundness and speaking to this issue of age. Not making jokes about it, but but making it a real thing.”
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” opens in theaters June 30 from Disney.

CNN —
Harrison Ford isn’t an action star. Not according to Harrison Ford, at least. Speaking to Vanity Fair during the press run for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” he explained that the films he’s starred in, rather than depending on kinetic activity alone, had a story. “They had a plot, they had characters, they had conflict,” he said.
Holly Thomas Holly Thomas
Ford’s resistance to being defined by movement is timely. At 80, he’s more than twice the age he was in 1981 when he first assumed the role of Indiana Jones, the daredevil archaeologist whose perpetual motion was ensured by director Steven Spielberg’s unprecedented zeal for death-defying stunts in the earlier installments.
It’s understandable, too. Slimmer and less overtly muscular than 80s contemporaries like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone, Ford’s allure has always been in his personal magnetism, not his brawn. Yet for all his lack of tree trunk biceps, Indiana Jones was always vivacious: outrunning boulders, sparring countless Nazis, and sprinting across collapsing rope bridges.
All that changes in “Dial of Destiny,” which was released in theaters last week. In this (supposedly) final outing, we meet Indy in 1969 at least 25 years past his prime, dozing through the moon landing and sick to the back teeth of his job as a college professor. He’s roused from his stupor by the arrival of his wily goddaughter Helena, played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Together, they embark on a mission to retrieve the Antikythera, a time-traveling device invented by Archimedes (yes).

It’s a mantle-passing in every sense: From Jones to his younger relative, and from a Hollywood legend to the queen of millennial side-eye. The contrast is heightened by Waller-Bridge’s anchorage in the popular imagination as Fleabag — of which we are constantly reminded, thanks to Helena’s naked self-interest occasionally tempered by glimpses of heart. The insertion of such a conspicuous 21st-century yardstick exposes another development: the inflation of supposedly normal people’s physical abilities on our screens.
Helena is not a super athlete, nor endowed with any special powers. Yet she defies physics. The most audacious example comes in the third act, when Helena rides a light motorbike alongside a plane as it’s taxi-ing out of an airport, then leaps from the bike onto the plane’s wheel, and clings on as it’s raised into the body of the aircraft.
The sequence is fun, but at best, it’s a 4/10 on the thrill scale. By this point, we’ve seen Helena fight off crooks, blow up a boatful of Nazis and leap from a racing tuk tuk onto the back of a speeding car. Any anxiety over her welfare has been well and truly cauterized: we know she’s getting on that plane.
That, according to “Dial of Destiny,” is the point. Youth is all-powerful. Age, and its careworn figurehead Indiana Jones, is chastened. When Indy attempts a body tackle, the target remains static, mocking the old man’s futile efforts. It’s far more compelling than Helena’s invincibility.
Indy’s frailty mirrors his more vulnerable emotional state. But it also reintroduces a tension that’s fallen by the wayside in the decades since he first appeared on our screens: that between what the human body can actually do, and what the story asks of them.
Ford’s insistence on acting his age and assurances that he doesn’t do stunts run counter to a trend that has seen characters’ — and actors’ — athleticism amplify in proportion to the sophistication of special effects. Yes, there’s a world beyond Marvel. There are non-superhero action movies that lean less on CGI and tout the extraordinary prowess of their stars — the Mission Impossible series and Tom Cruise being exemplars. But even these understand that to wow audiences, characters’ bodies must become superhuman.
The strength and stamina that used to be explained away by physiques like Schwarzenegger’s are taken for granted no matter how characters look. Rare moments of weakness are quickly subverted by skydives.
So much of the adrenaline of the original Indiana Jones trilogy derived from their massive, intricate sets and intensely choreographed scenes that these days are largely replaced by green screens. Now, acclimated as we’ve become to indestructible characters leaping from animated flames, we need an octogenarian star to reintroduce the idea that the hero might not survive.
In aging Indy by several decades, “Dial of Destiny” brings his abilities more in line with those of a real man in his 40s, rather than one on the verge of retirement.
Ford is atypical as a representative of the elderly, he’s still Harrison Ford, for goodness’ sake. Yet his undeniable limits offer opportunities for jeopardy that don’t depend on outrageous computer-animated explosions, or 20-thousand-foot falls. It would be interesting if similar restrictions were applied to the next generation: If Helena’s character existed within Fleabag’s body. After all, it’s not (just) the age, honey. It’s the mileage.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8wNS9vcGluaW9ucy9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWhhcnJpc29uLWZvcmQtcGhvZWJlLXdhbGxlci1icmlkZ2UtdGhvbWFzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIzLzA3LzA1L29waW5pb25zL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC1waG9lYmUtd2FsbGVyLWJyaWRnZS10aG9tYXMvaW5kZXguaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-15 19:25:28+00:00,"Harrison Ford Reflects on End of His ‘Indiana Jones’ Journey, Says Movies “Have Given Me a Freedom”",Harrison Ford celebrated with his 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' costars Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Mads Mikkelsen at the film's L.,"Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Harrison Ford attend the Los Angeles premiere of Lucasfilm's 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' on June 14 in Hollywood.
After more than four decades, Harrison Ford‘s Indiana Jones journey is coming to an end, with his fifth and final performance as the iconic character in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
Following an emotional world premiere at Cannes, the film made its U.S. debut at the Los Angeles premiere on Wednesday, where Ford reflected on saying goodbye to the famous archaeologist.
“I don’t think I’m going to miss anything. I appreciate all of the opportunities that the character has given me. I have been very grateful and I have enjoyed myself for the 42 years that we’ve been making these,” Ford told The Hollywood Reporter on the red carpet. “The success of these movies have really given me not only a chance to satisfy a broad audience, but they’ve given me a freedom; because of their success, they’ve given me freedom in my chosen profession. And I’m grateful for that, I’m grateful for everything that’s happened to me. I’m a lucky guy.”
The fifth film follows Indiana Jones in a race against time to retrieve a legendary dial that can change the course of history, as he is accompanied by his goddaughter Helena, played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.
“She’s a complicated character, you don’t know if you’re supposed to love her or hate her,” Waller-Bridge said of the role. “She has a nefarious agenda, and she’s an enemy to Indy — well, she’s a friend, then she’s an enemy, then she’s a friend, then she’s an enemy.”
The Fleabag creator also joked that when doing the film’s stunts, “I was surprised how proud I was of my bruises” and she was happy that there “was something that was madcap about the way they wanted it to be done.
“They didn’t want me to be too slick, which was a relief because otherwise I would’ve never gotten the part. I just had to be a kind of scrambled mess jumping from vehicles or jumping out of airplanes,” teased Waller-Bridge. “So I was surprised that I could do it, but I didn’t do any of the super impressive stuff; that was Anna Stephenson, who was my stunt double. So whenever you go, ‘Wow!’ that’s Anna; whenever you go ‘Ah,’ that’s me.”

Mads Mikkelsen, who plays the film’s villain, joked the best part was “that you get to kick the shit out of Harrison Ford.
“He’s fantastic, he’s such a legend. The small details he can do — he brings the camera to him, he doesn’t reach out for it, and it’s just wonderful to watch him work,” Mikkelsen continued. “And then I learned from him also that it’s never too late to be a child. He’s a little boy, he’s 16 years old, there’s so much energy in him and he thoroughly loves what he’s doing and we should all remember that.”
The actor also reflected on Ford’s final day on set and giving Indiana Jones himself a proper sendoff, noting, “We were there when he did his last take on his last scene and just watching him up there being applauded, he wanted to leave and just get out of there, but he also wanted to stay there forever. It was quite beautiful to watch.”

Director James Mangold added that it was important to him to have Ford’s final chapter be “something of quality that represents the kind of integrity that his legacy of work represents” and reflected on stepping into Steven Spielberg’s shoes as the only other director to helm an Indiana Jones film.
Calling Spielberg an idol, Mangold said he was drawn in by “the chance to collaborate with him and also the kind of shared aesthetic, which is I think Steven and George [Lucas] have always been in love with golden age films and mining them and the classic Hollywood style for what is an incredible portfolio of work that has literally changed the course of cinema and business.”

That panned out to be somewhat true in the recently-released “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which opened in theaters just a few weeks before Ford turns 81.
“People will never get tired of that genre,” O’Brien told Ford at the time. “When you’re 80 you could just do ones where they bring the treasures to you.”
Ford burst into laughter, with O’Brien adding that an “Indiana Jones” movie starring an 80-year-old Harrison Ford could be titled, “Indiana Jones and the Comfortable Bed.”
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” marks Ford’s final outing as the iconic archeologist. While he is done with playing Indiana Jones, Ford has no plans to retire from acting as he turns 81. He just joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe in “Captain America: Brave New World,” which recently wrapped production in Atlanta, and he’s got the Apple TV+ comedy “Shrinking” and the Paramount+ drama “1923” heading into second seasons once the writers strike concludes.
When asked last month if he plans to retire, Ford said, “I don’t. I don’t do well when I don’t have work. I love to work. I love to feel useful. It’s my Jones. I want to be helpful”
“It is the people you get to work with,” he added about why he wants to keep acting. “The intensity and the intimacy of collaboration. It’s the combined ambition somehow forged from words on a page. I don’t plan what I want to do in a scene. I don’t feel obliged to do anything. I’m naturally affected by things that I work on.”
Ford’s “Dial of Destiny” promotional tour reunited him with Conan O’Brien on the latter’s “Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend” podcast. Their discussion went viral after Ford roasted O’Brien for having a note reminding him that Ford played Han Solo in “Star Wars.”
“You can’t fucking remember that?” Ford asked O’Brien.
“No I can’t. I can’t remember Han Solo,” O’Brien said. “I wrote it down because I heard that you were in some of the ‘Star Wars’ films, and this was news to me because I’ve seen those films and I don’t exactly think that you ‘pop.’”

2023-06-01 11:49:46+00:00,Harrison Ford told stunt guys to f*** off on Indiana Jones 5 because he wanted character to look his age,Harrison Ford wanted Indiana Jones to look his age in The Dial of Destiny,"Harrison Ford wanted Indiana Jones to look his age in The Dial of Destiny. The actor, who is now 80, is playing a 70-year-old version of Indy in the upcoming movie.
In a new interview with Esquire, Ford shared a particular scene in which he fought to show this. Early on in the movie, Indy is riding a horse on a subway platform in New York City. When he finished the scene, he recalled feeling hands on his legs.
""I thought, 'What the fuck?' Like I was being attacked by gropers,"" he told the magazine. ""I look down and there’s three stunt guys there making sure I didn’t fall off the stirrup. They said, 'Oh, we were just afraid because we thought, you know, and bah bah bah bah.' And I said, 'Leave me the fuck alone, I’m an old man. Leave me alone, I’m an old man getting off a horse and I want it to look like that!'""
It’s certainly refreshing for age to be a central topic in an action movie like this, and Ford has previously spoken about it being one of the main reasons he came back. Chatting to Total Film magazine in our big cover feature on the movie, Ford explained: ""I always wanted to see a completion of the character. I wanted to see [Indiana Jones] at a later stage of his life, when he’s beyond the youthful enthusiasm and capacity, and beset by age and [stifled by academia]. I wanted to see him engage on one more unexpected, unanticipated adventure.""
It was important James Mangold’s version didn’t shy away from the topic, continued Ford. ""I wanted it to concern age, I wanted it to confront the issues of age for a character who had always been adventurous, youthful, and capable, physically. I wanted to see the effects of age on the character.""

Fifteen years after its last installment, the Indiana Jones franchise returns to theaters on June 30 with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Sharing a release date with the film is Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, the latest from animation studio DreamWorks. Early analysis and forecasts for those two films, as well as the latest forecasting updates on June’s releases, are below.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny
Disney / Lucasfilm
June 30, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $81M-$111M
Domestic Total Range: $225M-$380M
PROS:
The prospect of a new chapter in the Indiana Jones saga has ignited fan excitement in the years since Lucasfilm announced they’d pursue the film; Harrison Ford returning to one of his most iconic roles is a big plus, as is the presence of director James Mangold (Ford v Ferrari, Logan) behind the camera.
Social media chatter has been mostly positive throughout the movie’s long production history.
A wave of nostalgia helped Top Gun: Maverick surpass $126M over the first three days of its Memorial Day weekend opening last year; if Dial of Destiny manages to appeal to adult audiences, it could get a similar bump.
If those adult audiences show up with families in tow, as happened with Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in 2008, Dial of Destiny could end up more back-loaded than the typical franchise film.
The fourth of July comes the Tuesday following Dial‘s release—meaning Disney could, essentially, be viewing the Friday-Tuesday window as a five-day opening weekend.
Early pre-sales are respectable when given proper context, i.e. the glut of male- and fan-driven films opening before Dial of Destiny hits theaters in June. The film is currently pacing ahead of John Wick: Chapter 4 and Fast X.
CONS:
A monkey on Dial of Destiny‘s back is the mixed reputation of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the only other Indiana Jones film to come out this century. It’s no secret that Kingdom divided Indiana Jones fans upon its release in 2008, becoming the target of numerous memes and drawing comparisons to the Star Wars prequels.
Early critics’ reviews from the film’s Cannes Film Festival premiere have been mixed; the film currently stands at 49% approval on Rotten Tomatoes.
A mixed critical reception doesn’t always mean family audiences will stay at home—see The Super Mario Bros. Movie—but if families do stay away from Dial of Destiny, Indy’s final adventure could prove more front-loaded than Kingdom.
A gauntlet of summer competition lies ahead of Dial of Destiny, with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning: Part One, Barbie, and Oppenheimer, among others, coming to cinemas in July.
Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken
Universal / DreamWorks Animation
June 30, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $13M-$18M
Domestic Total Range: $38M-$66M
PROS:
The female-leaning animated comedy/adventure could serve as a solid counter-programmer against the more male-focused Dial of Destiny.
Ruby Gillman opens in the third weekend of release for Elemental, the latest from Pixar. That film is currently generating mixed critics’ reviews, which could help Ruby Gillman‘s chances as a potential sleeper hit.
CONS:
Though family audiences have definitely returned to theaters—see the success of The Bad Guys, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie—DreamWorks’ original animated films are challenging to forecast in an era when Illumination has taken over as the dominant brand and films like Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse offer cutting-edge animation that appeals strongly to today’s younger audiences.
The aforementioned Across the Spider-Verse, if it enjoys good word of mouth like its 2018 predecessor, could still be drawing in family audiences a month after its June 2 release.

,New Indiana Jones: Den of Destiny Bar at Disney’s Hollywood Studios,,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny will arrive in theaters on June 30, 2023. In anticipation of the opening, a new limited-time beverage outpost has opened at Disney’s Hollywood Studios.
The new bar is located in the former Indiana Jones Adventure Outpost store, which closed in March 2020. It is near the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular attraction, just off Echo Lake.
The former Indiana Jones Adventure Outpost store contained some themed elements which remain, but props from the new film have been added, primarily housed within glass cases. The Den of Destiny promises “rare antiquities” and “refreshing libations.”
Guests will recognize some costume items within the bar, including Indy’s iconic fedora. You can view movie props and curiosities while preparing to place your order.
Two adult cocktails are available for purchase at the bar: The Adventures Margarita and The Weathered Fedora, in addition to draft beers Lost Coast Tangerine Wheat Ale, and Cigar City Jai Alai IPA. A non-alcoholic beverage L’Atlantique Green Tea is an option as well.
Maps and travel posters dot the walls. Some of the same art can also be found at Jock Lindsay’s Hangar Bar at Disney Springs. The Den of Destiny opens daily at 10:00 am through August 15.
There are some stand-up tables in the shade available for guests. The bar was most recently the location for a Chip & Dale Rescue Rangers Meet & Greet. Chip and Dale have been relocated to make room for The Den of Destiny.

2023-06-30 22:30:00+00:00,Why Isn't Shia LaBeouf in Indiana Jones 5? Mutt's Absence Explained,Indiana Jones' son Mutt Williams isn't in 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.' Here's why Shia LaBeouf didn't return for Indiana Jones 5.,"The following story contains light spoilers for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
WHEN INDIANA Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was first released, back in 2008, there was no bigger rising star in Hollywood than Shia LaBeouf. Fresh off the release of Disturbia and Michael Bay's first Transformers movie, LaBeouf was seen as Steven Spielberg's hand-selected pick to be the industry's next major star. And that was never more evident than in Crystal Skull, where LaBeouf showed up as a Marlon Brando-inspired greaser character named Mutt Williams.
Who the hell is Mutt Williams, you might ask? For anyone who hasn't seen Crystal Skull in a while, or somehow hasn't seen it at all in the 15 years since its release, here's a quick recap: Mutt goes on an an adventure with Indy (Harrison Ford), who slowly-but-surely starts to like him, despite his try-hard attitude and slicked-back hair. Midway through the movie, the two encounter Indy's old flame Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen, last seen in 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark), and she drops a major bombshell: Mutt is Indy and Marion's son, and she just never told him until now.
Welp! The rest of Crystal Skull (not nearly as bad of a movie as its reputation would have you believe) finds the three bonding as they continue on a typically-fun Indiana Jones adventure that involves aliens, alternate dimensions, and villains heads exploding. By the end of the film, Indy marries Marion and embraces Mutt as his son and, hey, who knows, possible successor. Mutt picks up Indy's signature Fedora at the very end of the movie... but Indy takes it back before he could put it onto his hard noggin.
15 years later, and Indiana Jones is back for what will be his final big-screen adventure: Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. But there's one major change—Indy is joined by a new sidekick, his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). And Mutt Williams is nowhere to be found.
What's that all about? Well, as with most things, there's a perfectly reasonable explanation.
Why isn't Shia LaBeouf in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny?
ANNE-CHRISTINE POUJOULAT // Getty Images
The diplomatic answer is that director James Mangold simply wanted to go in a different direction. ""I wanted to capture that wonderful energy between Indy and an intrepid female character,"" he said in a red carpet interview with Variety. ""So, that was my first goal, and there's only so many people you can edge into a picture.""
But, of course, there's a lot more to it than that. In the 15 years since Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was released, there's been lots of drama surrounding LaBeouf's role within the movie (and his own personal life as well).
The movie received a polarized reception from both critics and fans, and the Mutt Williams character was particularly not liked. LaBeouf acknowledged the criticism of both himself and the movie at large in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 2010. ""I feel like I dropped the ball on the legacy that people loved and cherished,"" he said. ""Look, the movie could have been updated. There was a reason it wasn’t universally accepted.""
Ford responded to LaBeouf's comments the following year in an interview with Details. “I think I told him he was a fucking idiot,” he said. “As an actor, I think it’s my obligation to support the film without making a complete ass of myself. Shia is ambitious, attentive, and talented—and he’s learning how to deal with a situation which is very unique and difficult.”
The very next year (lots of back and forth on this!), LaBeouf said that he deeply regretted his comments about the movie, and said that they wound up hurting his relationship with Spielberg—who helped him land his breakout roles in the first place. “He told me there’s a time to be a human being and have an opinion, and there’s a time to sell cars,” he told THR. ""It brought me freedom, but it also killed my spirits, because this was a dude I looked up to like a sensei.”
In addition to all of this dialogue going on after the movie's release, LaBeouf has also been in legal trouble the last few years. There's not good press around his name, and it's not surprising that Mangold, Spielberg, and Disney did not want him to be involved with their latest Indiana Jones outing.
How does Dial of Destiny explain Mutt Williams' absence?
Disney
It's said early on in the movie that Indiana Jones recently lost his son. This is elaborated on later in the movie, when Indy and Helena are discussing the potential power of the titular Dial of Destiny—to travel through time. Helena asks him what he would do with such a dial, and he doesn't take long to come up with an answer. ""Stop my son from enlisting,"" he says solemnly.
Given that the movie takes place in 1969, we can figure out from here that in the time between the end of Crystal Skull and the start of Dial of Destiny, Mutt enlisted, and then was killed in action. Clearly, father and son never got quite on the same page after their alien encounter in the last film. ""He signed up to piss me off,"" he says.
The domino effect is then revealed: Marion held it against Indy that he wasn't able to stop Mutt from enlisting, and following his death, put a splinter into their relationship. Early in the film, we see divorce papers on Indiana's table in his home.
By the end of the movie, though, after one final swashbuckling Indiana Jones adventure—spoiler alert!—Indy and Marion are reunited, together once again, this time, we think, forever.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNoZWFsdGguY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYTQ0MzkwNzMyL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtZGlhbC1vZi1kZXN0aW55LXNoaWEtbGFiZW91Zi1tdXR0LXdpbGxpYW1zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-20 20:44:13+00:00,Lucasfilm Sued in Trademark Dispute Over Backpack in ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’,Lucasfilm has been roped into a legal battle between rival clothing companies over the backpack Indiana Jones wore.,"Lucasfilm has been roped into a legal battle between rival clothing companies over the backpack Indiana Jones wore in the latest installment to the franchise.
In a suit filed on Wednesday in California federal court, Frost River accused Lucasfilm of using its products in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny without permission and then passing off its signature backpacks as a competitor’s product in a deceptive marketing campaign.
“This lawsuit concerns two corporate juggernauts, Filson and Lucasfilm, exploiting the hard work and intellectual property of Frost River, a small American company,” states the complaint.
In the movie, Indiana Jones wears a bag with a knapsack design featuring a drawstring-topped main compartment with a flap cover. Frost River says Lucasfilm never obtained its permission to use its product. Instead, the studio removed identifying marks on the bag in violation of a federal trademark law.
As part of its marketing for the movie, Lucasfilm authorized Filson to run a co-branded campaign to promote the movie and the clothing company’s products, according to the suit. “Lucasfilm and Filson produced a 60 second commercial prominently featuring video clips from the Indiana Jones 5 film intertwined with video clips of actors using Filson’s own products,” writes Devin McRae, a lawyer for Frost River, in the complaint. “Shockingly, one of the intertwined video clips was one from Indiana Jones 5 featuring Frost River’s Geologist Pack.”
Frost River says the marketing is intended to trick consumers into believing that the bags seen in the movie and advertisements are sold by Filson.

2023-07-01 17:00:00+00:00,‘Indiana Jones 5’ Star Shaunette Renée Wilson Asked for Script Changes Over an ‘Offensive and a Bit Problematic’ Scene (EXCLUSIVE),"Shaunette Renée Wilson, one of the stars of ""Indiana Jones 5,"" tells Variety she asked for changes in the first script, which she found ""problematic.""","SPOILER ALERT: This story discusses major plot developments in “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which is now playing in theaters.
Shaunette Renée Wilson (“The Resident,” “Black Panther”) landed the role of a lifetime when she was cast opposite Harrison Ford in his final “Indiana Jones” film.
Wilson was hand-picked by director James Mangold to play Agent Mason in the major summer release. After a Zoom meeting with Mangold, she was cast and didn’t even have to audition, but when she received the script, she wanted to implement some changes.
“I was so jazzed,” Wilson tells Variety recalling her first reaction to receiving the script. “I was quite impressed by a lot of things, but I also had thoughts and wanted to make input about my character in particular. And the brilliance and wonder of James Mangold is his ability to collaborate, and he heard me out and he was very honest about it and took what I said and it was implemented in rewrites. That has been a wonderful part of this process — to actually be able to feel like you are integral and you have a point of view when it comes to what’s being written.”
Wilson spoke to Variety in May at the Cannes Film Festival, where “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” had its world premiere, when she was honored at Variety‘s party with the Golden Globes as a breakthrough artist at the festival. (Due to the spoilery nature of her interview, Variety opted to publish this piece after the film was released in theaters.)
“Well, I don’t want to spoil too much, but my character had a particular way of exiting the film,” Wilson told Variety. “And initially I found it to be a little too offensive and a bit problematic, and I was like, ‘We probably don’t need to say these words or have it done this way, and this is something I’m uncomfortable with.'”
Praising Mangold’s collaboration, Wilson added, “He was like, ‘You know what, you’re completely right, I hear you. That’s something I flagged as well.’ And we were able to work on that.”
Variety has reached out to Disney and Lucasfilm, as well as a representative for Mangold, for comment regarding the script changes.
Reminiscing on her initial meetings for the film, Wilson says, “Funny enough, I didn’t audition for this at all. I literally just had a meeting with James. He sent me the script, they were like, ‘Read this script, see what you think.’ Obviously, it’s ‘Indiana Jones,’ so I was going to do it no matter what.”
In “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” Wilson’s government agent character is shot dead by Nazi-turned-NASA-scientist Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen). Set in 1969, the film follows Indiana Jones (Ford) and his goddaughter (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) who are on a mission to locate a device that could change the course of history, before Mikkelsen’s villainous character can get to it himself and change the outcome of World War II so the Nazis reign supreme.
Speaking at Cannes where the film premiered, Wilson was raving about her time on the film and working with the entire case. “I’m obviously in a wonderful group with Harrison Ford, this being his final ‘Indiana Jones,’ and having my stamp in history. And working alongside Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, Boyd Holbrook, it’s been quite incredible just to be part of that.”
When asked what she learned from working with Ford, she said, “Have fun. You’re never too old to have fun. His inner child is always at play. He loves the craft so much and loves what he does.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LXNoYXVuZXR0ZS1yZW5lZS13aWxzb24ta2lsbGVkLXNjcmlwdC1jaGFuZ2VzLXByb2JsZW1hdGljLTEyMzU2NTkzNjQv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLTUtc2hhdW5ldHRlLXJlbmVlLXdpbHNvbi1raWxsZWQtc2NyaXB0LWNoYW5nZXMtcHJvYmxlbWF0aWMtMTIzNTY1OTM2NC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Chasing Destiny: The Villains and Antagonists of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"Actors Mads Mikkelsen, Shaunette Renée Wilson, and Boyd Holbrook talk about joining Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, in theaters now.","But there’s only one Indy. So, when it came time to sign on for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Mikkelsen got to join his childhood hero for one last adventure, playing the villain — the Nazi Dr. Jürgen Voller, a mathematician for the United States government credited with helping to put astronauts on the moon. “I mean, since I can’t be Indy, I can be the baddie,” he says. “And it’s been a wonderful journey to see this home.”
On Mikkelsen’s first day on set, he arrived for a costume fitting and a script read, but ended up meeting the man with the hat. “I went outside my trailer and Harrison [Ford] was outside. That was the first time I met him.” Ford was in full costume, and Mikkelsen says he felt like a kid again, recognizing not the esteemed actor and co-star but the hero he loved. “It wasn’t Harrison, it was Indiana Jones. He had the hat, the whip, the jacket. [It was] surreal. Watching him work, it’s just been, you know, an experience of my life….Because, all of a sudden, I’m part of it.”
Mikkelsen wasn’t alone. In Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, he’s joined by Agent Mason, a by-the-book special agent played by Shaunette Renée Wilson, and Klaber, Voller’s enforcer played by Boyd Holbrook, an unlikely team-up that led to plenty of inter-personal conflict on screen. But behind the scenes and on a recent press day, the three actors were constantly making each other laugh as they recounted their path to join the franchise.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1Y2FzZmlsbS5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWRzLW1pa2tlbHNlbi1hbmQtY2FzdC1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWludGVydmlldy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-07-01 01:00:47+00:00,‘Indiana Jones 5’ Director James Mangold Explains the Fate of Shia LaBeouf’s Character and the ‘Wild Swing’ Ending,"""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" director James Mangold explains the film's surprising ending and his decision about Shia LaBeouf's character, Mutt Williams.","SPOILER ALERT: This story discusses major plot developments, including the ending, of “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” currently playing in theaters.
When director James Mangold started writing “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” with screenwriters Jez and John-Henry Butterworth, he didn’t know how the movie was going to end. Mangold inherited the film from director Steven Spielberg, who had been developing the project for three years with screenwriter David Koepp. When Mangold took over, he and the Butterworths started effectively from scratch, crafting a story in which Harrison Ford’s titular archeologist and Nazi puncher contends with his own age and irrelevance while chasing after the Antikythera, a mysterious device with the power to find fissures in time, created by the ancient Greek mathematician and inventor Archimedes.
Initially, the screenwriting team thought about ending the movie by returning to the film’s extended prologue in 1944, when a younger Indy and the film’s villain, Nazi scientist Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), first encounter the Antikythera on a Nazi loot train. And indeed, the film’s second act does end with Voller obtaining the device, kidnapping Indy, and flying off in a WWII-era Nazi gunship to travel back in time so Voller can win the war for Germany.
Except, Mangold says, he realized he didn’t want do to that.
“I couldn’t find a way to wrap my head around going back to the past and stopping Mads from doing his nefarious deeds to continue the Third Reich,” Mangold told Variety in early June. “It lacked wonder and was going to turn into kind of a cat and mouse thing. I felt like we’d be better off if that’s what people are anticipating, but that we really pull the tablecloth out from under the dishes at the last minute.”
At the same time, Mangold knew that if you’re going to have a device that can help its user manipulate time, “You’re going to have to see the power.” So rather than go back to WWII, Mangold and the Butterworths looked to Archimedes for their ending, and sent Indy and Voller — as well as Indy’s compatriots Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) and Teddy (Ethann Isidore) — back to the Roman siege of Archimedes’ home of Syracuse on the island of Sicily in roughly 213 BCE.
The moment is foreshadowed early in the film, when we see Indy lecturing a class of indifferent college students about how Archimedes invented a series of ingenious mechanisms to repel the invading Roman navy. Mangold saw in the ending a chance to give Indy the opportunity — after a lifetime spent seeking out relics of bygone eras in history — to actually witness that history first hand.
“He’s suddenly in the midst of it,” the director said. “I also thought it presented us with a kind of audacious turn which I thought was a staple of these movies.”
Putting a Nazi warplane alongside a fleet of Roman triremes is certainly a big swing, but Mangold thought it of a piece with the climaxes of 1981’s “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and 1989’s “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.”
“It’s no more of a wild swing in my mind than ghouls flying out of a box and melting people’s heads through the sheer power of dark angels, or a 700-year-old knight existing in a cave for perpetuity,” Mangold said. “These are all beyond the scope of all physical belief.”
More importantly, it provided Indy with a chance to express an almost existential grief. We learn in “The Dial of Destiny” that Indy’s son, Mutt Williams — first introduced in 2008’s “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” as played by Shia LaBeouf — was killed in the Vietnam War, and the anguish over that loss shattered Indy’s marriage to his beloved Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). As an injured Indy looks over the battlefield, he tearfully tells Helena that he doesn’t want to go back to his home in 1969. He believes he has nothing to go home to.
“That seemed to me to be right emotionally,” Mangold said, “that a disillusioned hero could end up at this wonderful tumultuous moment in world history and — with his son gone and his wife gone — that he’d picture himself staying in the place he loves best, which is this imagining these worlds.”
Paramount / Courtesy Everett Collection
The decision to kill off Mutt evokes some baggage that has nothing to do with “The Dial of Destiny.” Two years after the release of “Crystal Skull,” LaBeouf told the Los Angeles Times that the movie “dropped the ball” and that “there was a reason it wasn’t universally accepted.” In 2016, LaBeouf went even further, telling Variety that “I don’t like the movies that I made with Spielberg,” and that he found working with the filmmaker to be disillusioning: “He’s less a director than he is a fucking company.”
But Mangold said LaBeouf’s scorched earth interviews did not factor into his decision about Mutt’s fate.
“It’s separate from all past studio, political intrigue on movies I didn’t make,” he said. “You were either going to make a movie all about the two of them” — meaning, Indy and Mutt — “or you’re going to have to find a way to not have [Mutt] around, because he was too significant a player in the previous film to just pretend he didn’t exist.” Besides, Mangold said, “I didn’t think his whole thing worked that well in the previous film. I just went towards something else because it was what was more interesting to me.”
For Mangold, that was getting to explore what it meant for Indy to look back a lifetime of regret and loss and find himself ready to disappear into history, quite literally. But he also never entertained the possibility of fulfilling Indy’s desire to stay behind.
“Unless we established him healing and setting up shop and remarrying and finding a beautiful Sicilian house to live in — I guess there was a way of doing it, but I didn’t imagine it,” he said. “I felt like he had to come home. He had to clean things up. He had to own what happened to him and Marion, and the amount of loneliness and disappointment in himself he’s carrying about his inability to navigate that between them.”
With Indy intractably set on remaining stuck in antiquity, Helena cold cocks him to get back on the plane and through the time fissure so they can all return to 1969. In the next scene, he wakes up in his New York City apartment, and discovers that Helena has called Marion and convinced her to come back to see him again.
Asked about working with Karen Allen, Mangold broke into a wide grin.
“She’s so wonderful,” he said. “She’s such a beautiful soul. And I can’t imagine how hard it was for her because she’s stepping into a movie that had been shooting for a long time. But it was really moving to me.”
The film ends with a reprise of the famous scene from “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” when an injured Indy cajoles Marion into kissing the parts of his body that don’t hurt. In “The Dial of Destiny,” the roles are reversed, with Indy tenderly apologizing for the heartache he’s caused Marion, and kissing the parts of her she says don’t hurt.
Mangold credits the Butterworths for coming up with the callback. “I thought it was just brilliant,” Mangold says. “I didn’t know what to do. It just seemed like a gift the second they showed me this idea. It’s one of the great encapsulations of their relationship and a memory that everyone knows the second they hear that, ‘Where?’ They remember that movie.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LWVuZGluZy1zaGlhLWxhYmVvdWYtbXV0dC13aWxsaWFtcy1qYW1lcy1tYW5nb2xkLTEyMzU2NTk3NzMv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLTUtZW5kaW5nLXNoaWEtbGFiZW91Zi1tdXR0LXdpbGxpYW1zLWphbWVzLW1hbmdvbGQtMTIzNTY1OTc3My9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-18 16:24:19+00:00,‘Haunted Mansion’ Could Save Disney After ‘Indiana Jones 5’ Flop - Inside the Magic,"The reviews are in for Disney's 'Haunted Mansion' and so far, it looks like it may have the potential to make people forget about the strike.","In what might be the surprise winner of the summer box office, Disney’s Haunted Mansion (2023) is already earning rave reviews from critics following its star-devoid premiere, which went on as scheduled despite the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike.
It’s been a big year for Walt Disney Studios—for better or worse. While some blockbusters like The Little Mermaid (2023) and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) fared well with fans, others missed the mark entirely.
Harrison Ford’s last rendezvous as the titular adventurer in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) is on track to be the biggest flop in Disney/Lucasfilm history after failing to break even on its rumored $350 million budget, while Pixar’s Elemental missed the mark with critics while failing to draw in audiences. There’s also director David Lowery’s live-action remake of J.M. Barrie’s beloved fable, Peter Pan & Wendy (2023), which was released directly to Disney+ in April. Critics heavily scrutinized the film for being a bland, washed-out, and generally unremarkable retelling of the animated original.
However, the studio’s upcoming release, which isn’t a remake as much of an adaptation, might just rescue Disney from an uncertain year at the global box office. Based on the beloved Disney Parks ride, Director Justin Simien’s Haunted Mansion is slated to arrive in theaters later this month and promises a spooktacular adventure full of ghosts, ghouls, and other things that go “bump” in the night.
Check out the official trailer for Walt Disney Studios’ Haunted Mansion below:
The new Haunted Mansion will tell a different story than the Eddie Murphy-led 2003 movie of the same name, though it will echo many similar comedy-thriller elements. It also features an all-star cast including Owen Wilson, Rosario Dawson, LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, and Danny DeVito. Oscar-winner Jamie Lee Curtis is also joining in on the fun, proving that we’re in for a scary good time with this ensemble.
Stacked cast aside, the story itself looks especially intriguing, following single mom Gabbie (Dawson) and her son, Travis (Chase W. Dillon), as they hire a tour guide, a psychic, a priest, and a historian to help exorcise her newly-bought mansion after discovering supernatural entities inhabit it. Along the way, there’s sure to be plenty of mayhem and mischief, and according to early reviews, lots of callbacks to the Disney Parks ride.
Haunted Mansion held its premiere at Disneyland Resort on Saturday, where actors were replaced with Park actors and Disney characters amid the historic SAG-AFTRA strike, which advises stars to skip premieres and press events in solidarity with the movement. And considering how highly-publicized the protest has been so far, crossing the picket line would surely bruise an actor’s reputation, especially in the eyes of fellow performers.
In lieu of big-name celebs, Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Maleficent, and Cruella de Vil strutted down the red carpet during the event. And despite nearly everything working against the film and its chances, it hit a surprising home run with critics.
After the premiere, critics took to social media to share their immediate reactions and reviews for Disney’s Haunted Mansion, and so far, the reception leans overwhelmingly positive. Many early viewers praised the movie’s stunning VFX, while others noted LaKeith Stanfield’s scene-stealing performance.
On Twitter, MiceChat proclaimed that the movie “was a spectral spectacle that brought the iconic ride to life,” accompanied by a clip of the premiere event, which was held at Disneyland California Adventure’s Hyperion Theater:

On the other hand, Collider‘s Steven Weintraub praised the film’s ability to appeal to both children and adults, teasing some major Easter eggs for fans of the Disney Parks ride:
Happy to report #HauntedMansion is one of those family films that will spook kids, make adults laugh (a lot), and fans of the ride will keep pointing at the screen because it’s loaded with Easter eggs. Director Justin Simien & screenwriter Katie Dippold did great work. pic.twitter.com/07MfbUUCFC — Steven Weintraub (@colliderfrosty) July 16, 2023
Shannon McGrew specifically complimented screenwriter Katie Dippold, who she credited with weaving together a story that ” rides a fine line [between] humor/horror” while tacking more mature themes of death and grief in a way that’s palpable to viewers:
I’m still gathering my thoughts on #HauntedMansion but I will say this, the amount of heart it has couldn’t have been achieved without the writing of Katie Dippold. She weaves together a story that tackles death/grief in a palpate way while riding a fine line btwn humor/horror. pic.twitter.com/hgaLAIS5hK — Shannon McGrew 🎃 (@shannon_mcgrew) July 16, 2023
POC Culture also promised some “fun cameos” and references to the ride, while also teasing a “healthy dose of jump scares” for fright fanatics:
I got to watch the #HauntedMansion (before the strike). It’s a love letter to the iconic Disney ride & a family friendly thriller. The cast, led by LaKeith Stanfield, is outstanding & hilarious. Full of fun cameos, references to the ride & a healthy dose of jump scares. pic.twitter.com/rj92ujOMU7 — POC Culture 🔜 #SDCC (@POCculture) July 16, 2023
Although some critics weren’t completely sold on the story, citing a slow first act and weak efforts to “be deep,” most seemed to enjoy their time with Disney’s latest outing. Haunted Mansion will be Disney’s final live-action film for a while, with the next movie in the slate being the Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot-led Snow White (2024). From the sounds of it, Haunted Mansion might be the perfect Disney pallet cleanser to hold us over until then.
For now, it’ll be interesting to see if the movie’s Rotten Tomatoes score will reflect early viewers’ generally positive opinions and if audiences will agree. Regardless, one thing’s for sure: the Walt Disney Company can’t afford another box office “boo” as the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike continues to bring their productions to a screeching halt.
You can decide if Haunted Mansion lives up to the hype when it arrives in theaters on July 28, 2023.

Now that the flick, which has since been confirmed to be the final movie in the iconic Indiana Jones franchise, has hit theaters, director James Mangold has opened up on some juicy new details about how the movie could have ended.
The popular film series first kicked off in 1981 with Raiders of the Lost Ark and has been going strong for more than 40 years now.

The first film in the franchise saw Harrison Ford’s archaeologist-adventurer hunt for the ancient Ark of the Covenant.
Since then, fans have seen the iconic figure take on just about everything, from the Nazis and Soviet KGB agents to even aliens.
The latest adventure, The Dial of Destiny, sees the daredevil archaeologist race against time to retrieve a legendary dial that can change the course of history.

Accompanied by his goddaughter, Helena Shaw, played by Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge, he soon finds himself squaring off against Jürgen Voller - played by Mads Mikkelsen - a former Nazi who works for NASA.
Now for the spoiler alert - you've been warned.
The final act of the film unravels Voller's plot to use the dial to travel back in time to 1939 and kill Hitler in the hopes that another leader would go on to bring about Germany's victory during the war.
However, the former Nazi's ploy doesn't go to plan as he ends up accidentally travelling to the Siege of Syracuse in 212 BC.

Speaking in an interview with Inverse, director Mangold revealed that he did have an alternative ending in mind for the monumental end to the saga.
He mused over the idea that the Nazis did in fact succeed in time-traveling to Nazi Germany but ultimately decided against it over issues with 'emotional resonance'.
Mangold told the outlet: ""I would never make this choice without ruminating over lots of choices.""

He continued to explain the other possible ending: ""The other interesting thing was that one of the things I thought about was even if we did travel in time, would Mads' theory be right, and they’d land in Nazi Germany?
""And the last act of the movie would be Indy trying to foil Mads' plan?""
However, according to the director, the more he 'sketched' that alternative ending out in his mind, the more it 'became kind of just a spy movie at the end'.
""I couldn't find a way to achieve emotional resonance,"" he added.

2023-06-23 15:24:46+00:00,Forgotten 'Indiana Jones' Project Will Now Compete With 'Spider-Man' - Inside the Magic,Indiana Jones will have to fight Spider-Man in a war most fans don't know exists as Disney offers the two characters to the highest bidder.,"Indiana Jones might be one of the more iconic characters in pop culture, and now he will have to duke it out with Spider-Man on a different war front.
What type of war will Indy and Spidey fight in? The Console Wars. For some reason, Disney is in talks to make the long-awaited Indiana Jones project, an exclusive for Xbox, which would mean thousands, if not millions, of fans, won’t be able to experience a brand-new adventure with Indy.
Harrison Ford’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) will be the final movie for the franchise, but Indiana Jones will still be seen in video games, at the very least. Ford might not voice the lines, and some other voice actor will replace him, but that doesn’t mean the game wouldn’t be worth checking out.
Unfortunately, Xbox is starting a Console War using Disney against PlayStation. Star Wars and Marvel have exclusive games on Playstation for fans, but if Xbox does the same with Indiana Jones, things might get ugly. Exclusivity for video games has always existed, but now it means that certain games like Indiana Jones and Star Wars will compete against each other for the different studios.
Disney is fine with this, and if fans aren’t careful, there may be more exclusive games than fans might realize, meaning that these types of experiences would require both consoles or else you won’t have a chance to play them. If you only care about Indiana Jones, an Xbox is all you need.
One fan shared how Disney reportedly changed their agreement to make the game exclusive and pointed out how this could be bad for fans in the long run:
“The agreement with Disney was later amended” HUGE NEWS, the Indiana Jones game is confirmed to be Xbox and PC exclusive, day one Game Pass. Given this and the KOTOR Remake, Lucasfilm and Disney clearly will do exclusivity for the right price…

It’s clear that Disney only wants to make as much profit as possible, but having exclusive games doesn’t do that. Disney might get paid more by the company to have the game be exclusive, but they don’t lose half of the sales, if not more, depending on what platform has the game. It’s a serious problem that might persist past Spider-Man and Wolverine for the PlayStation.
Exclusive games are starting to creep back into the spotlight, and that’s not good for fans who might want to experience the Indiana Jones game. They might need to get the right console just do it, which isn’t fun for anyone.

2023-07-01 15:21:27+00:00,"Movie review: Nostalgic, yes, but ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ lacks adventure",This dose of “Indiana Jones” is a disappointingly diluted version of this favorite hero.,"It’s been 15 years since we last encountered Indiana Jones, the whip-cracking archaeologist made iconic by star Harrison Ford, director Steven Spielberg, and George Lucas, who conceived of the story while seeking to update the classic adventure serial. Audiences fell for the brainy, blunt and brave Indy in his globe-trotting adventures explored in the original trilogy, which started with “Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark” in 1981. Even the fourth installment, arriving in 2008, “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” was profitable, and warmly received despite its goofy story.
It’s no surprise that in a filmmaking landscape where legacy sequels, or “legasequels,” roam the box office, the powers that be would take ol’ Indy out for another spin. Ford had returned to both “Star Wars” and “Blade Runner” to positive notices, so it made sense to get the band back together for one more gig, to see if there’s any juice left to squeeze. Enter “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” in which James Mangold takes the reins from Spielberg.
Mangold also co-wrote the script with Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and David Koepp, and, true to the spirit of the legasequel, it’s about time travel — the story reflecting the nostalgic desire of both filmmakers and audiences to utilize movies as vehicles to revisit the emotions we felt when we were young. Lucas and Spielberg used “Indiana Jones” to recreate the feeling of their favorite childhood serials, and Mangold is tasked with delivering a film that brings us back to that feeling of falling in love with “Raiders of the Lost Ark” back in the ‘80s. He approaches the task so literally that he seems to have overlooked the goal of simply making a great adventure movie.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” hits the nostalgia button from minute one, with an almost creepy, fetishistic reanimation of Indy’s appeal. These reminders of what was are like constant jabs in the ribs, as if the filmmakers are saying, “Remember this? You like this.” It’s cameos from beloved characters, reminders of Indy’s well-known idiosyncrasies (he hates snakes and enjoys punching Nazis), and do-overs of famous bits from the previous films. They try so hard to recapture the original charm but haven’t actually thought about what made it charming in the first place, and the result is a sloggy, dull sequel that’s more “Bogus Journey” than “Excellent Adventure.”
It opens with a sequence that takes place toward the end of World War II, as Jones and fellow archaeologist Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) sneak around piles of treasure looted by Nazis, trying to liberate a few historically significant — and potentially powerful — baubles. Fast forward to the late ‘60s, where Indy is a grumpy professor in New York City. He has no groupies, no wife and no child when a strange woman, Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), ambushes him at a dive bar. She’s Indy’s goddaughter, the daughter of dear departed Bas, and she wants a mysterious dial crafted by Greek mathematician Archimedes that her pop pilfered from the Nazi loot train. Can Indy help her?
He doesn’t have much of a choice when they’re suddenly pursued through the city by two bloodthirsty blondes with buzz cuts (Boyd Holbrook and Olivier Richters). These menaces are in the employ of Dr. Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), a shadowy figure from Indy’s past and a rocket scientist/former Nazi who needs the dial to “fix Hitler’s mistakes.” Yes, the plot itself is a rather hackneyed pop culture meme.
Mangold is a slick filmmaker, and in “Dial of Destiny,” he alternates the nostalgia bumps and surprise cameos with extremely fast set pieces; the entire film feels like one long car (horse, boat, tuk-tuk) chase. All of the action sequences are capably crafted, and a total snooze. As Indy and Helena — and a precocious poppet (Ethann Isidore) they pick up in Morocco — dart around the globe retrieving various items, the bad guys chase them and relieve them of said items. Helena quips annoyingly, Indy grumbles predictably, and Mangold stuns us into a stupor with his perfectly competent filmmaking. It is a crushingly dull film until it becomes jaw-droppingly cartoonish.
Perhaps a swig of something familiar in an air-conditioned theater will be just the ticket for a summer weekend. However, this dose of “Indiana Jones” is a disappointingly diluted version of this favorite hero that has the power to put a fan off the franchise forever.

2023-06-30 00:06:16+00:00,Harrison Ford Is Actually So Cute Playing With ‘Indiana Jones’ Toys,This 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' promo is actually just too cute. Watch Harrison For truly enjoy playing with his action figure!,"Credit: Lucasfilm
Most would describe actor Harrison Ford‘s approach to life as ‘dry wit.’ He’s sarcastically stoic in many of his most iconic roles, like Han Solo in the Star Wars series and, of course, Indiana Jones. Every Ford fan is dying to see the newest installment in the Indiana Jones film franchise, and finally, Dial of Destiny debuts in theaters tonight and is fully released tomorrow! Disney and Lucasfilm have done a bunch of promotions for Indiana Jones 5, but you can’t help but smile at this latest video featuring Indiana Jones action figures.
Lucasfilm uploaded an absolutely adorable video to YouTube featuring Harrison Ford and Dial of Destiny co-star Phoebe Waller-Bridge. With the Indiana Jones soundtrack playing in the background, the video opens on a table holding action figures of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones and Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Helena Shaw. The dolls are surrounded by the Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Lego set.
The first question the director asks the co-stars is, “Did they get the likeness okay?” After inspecting his figure on the table, Harrison Ford replies, “I’m actually bigger than that.” Hilarious. Classic Harrison Ford. Phoebe and the crew laugh as Ford gives a shrugging smirk.
Waller-Bridge is impressed at all the different Indy figures from all the different ages. She lists out Lego Indy, Big Indy, and Car Whipping Indy. You’ll have to watch the video to see what she’s referring to. She asks which of those three Ford feels most drawn to, and he replies casually but CLEARLY into it, “The biggest one.” Waller-Bridge does a Fleabag-style reaction to the cameras.
Later, Phoebe can’t get her action figure to stand up, and they wonder if Indy’s hat can come off. Ford nearly removes the doll’s head when he tries. Perhaps the cutest part of the interview is when Ford and Waller-Bridge march the action figures around while they sing Indiana Jones’ iconic theme music.
The video ends with intercut scenes from the new Indiana Jones movie, but you have to watch the hilarity for yourself below!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpc25leWRpbmluZy5jb20vaGFycmlzb24tZm9yZC1pcy1hY3R1YWxseS1zby1jdXRlLXBsYXlpbmctd2l0aC1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLXRveXMtbGYxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

,Flying Lessons from Harrison Ford: Ethann Isidore on Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"Ethann Isidore, Teddy in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, tells Lucasfilm.com about joining Indy on his last adventure in theaters now.","When Isidore got the chance to audition for the role of Teddy, a street-wise kid from Morocco who teams up with Waller-Bridge’s Helena Shaw, he was convinced he wouldn’t get the part; he didn’t mind. “I just wanted to have fun during the audition,” he says. “I had a piece of the script and I was like, ‘I know what’s going to happen in the next Indiana Jones!’ I didn’t think that I was going to be the one chosen, I was just so excited to be part of an Indiana Jones audition.”
To his surprise and awe, Isidore landed the part and the chance to work with Waller-Bridge, Ford, and director James Mangold.
“Life is actually good”
To get into character, Isidore walked the streets of Fes, Morocco, on location to take in the environment and step into Teddy’s shoes. It wasn’t much of a stretch to imagine other aspects of the character, however, like Teddy’s desire to be seen as an equal and a partner in Helena’s schemes despite his youthfulness. “Teddy’s a kid like me and he’s always trying to be an adult,” Isidore says. “He’s trying to find his place between Helena and Indiana Jones and I think that’s pretty much how I feel as a kid with adults.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1Y2FzZmlsbS5jb20vbmV3cy9ldGhhbm4taXNpZG9yZS1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLWludGVydmlldy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-13 13:17:10+00:00,"Disney pulling back on making Marvel, Star Wars content, Iger says",Disney CEO Bob Iger said Thursday on CNBC that the company will cut back on its content creation for major franchises Marvel and Star Wars.,"Disney is slowing down when it comes to making movies and TV series for its Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm franchises, CEO Bob Iger said Thursday on CNBC.
The move comes as the company is looking to cut costs during a time when its recent films, from Marvel to animation, have underwhelmed at the box office.
""You pull back not just to focus, but also as part of our cost containment initiative. Spending less on what we make, and making less,"" Iger said Thursday.
Earlier this year, Disney rolled out a broad reorganization of the business that included $5.5 billion in cutting costs, of which $3 billion would be slashed from content excluding sports.
Iger said Thursday that a lot of decisions were made to prop up the company's flagship streaming service, Disney+, and beckon more customers.
While also noting that Disney had some Pixar animation misses in recent months, he called out Marvel as being a particular example of the company's ""zeal"" to pump up its original content on streaming.
""Marvel is a great example of that. It had not been in the television business at any significant level, and not only did they increase their movie output, but they ended up making a number of TV series,"" said Iger. ""Frankly, it diluted focus and attention.""

“Elemental” debuted with £3.049 million ($3.876 million), according to numbers from Comscore. In its second weekend, “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” whipped up £3.046 million ($3.873 million) for a close second and now has a total of £13.1 million.
If looking at weekend numbers alone, Harrison Ford’s last adventure as the man in the hat won the race as the “Elemental” numbers include “limited secret sneak previews from across the market,” according to Disney.
Sony’s “Insidious: The Red Door” scared up £2.2 million in a third place debut. In its sixth weekend, Sony’s “Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse” swung to £964,566 in fourth position for a total of £27.7 million.
Rounding off the top five was Disney’s “The Little Mermaid,” which splashed to £490,836 for a total of £25.9 million.
There were no other debuts in the top 10.
Monday, July 10 saw the release of potential juggernaut “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” starring Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Esai Morales, Vanessa Kirby, Pom Klementieff and Henry Czerny. The Paramount release has opened wide and is almost certain to be the top film in the territory come the weekend.
Given the mighty presence of Ethan Hunt and Indiana Jones, the films releasing in the more traditional weekend slot are mostly limited openings.
Trinity CineAsia is opening “Lost in the Stars,” one of China’s biggest hits of the year, starring Zhu Yilong, Ni Ni, Janice Man, Du Jiang, while Metfilm distribution is bowing Busan and Toronto winning Indian press freedom documentary “While We Watched,” featuring veteran broadcast journalist Ravish Kumar.
ICA Films is releasing documentary “Where Is This Street? or With No Before and After,” a tribute to Paulo Rocha’s 1963 classic “The Green Year” and Bulldog Film Distribution is opening comedy crime drama “A Kind Of Kidnapping,” which won big at the Manchester International Film Festival.

2023-07-06 18:22:52+00:00,"Disney Almost Went Too Far, 'Indiana Jones 5' Fixed ""Problematic"" Scene - Inside the Magic",Indiana Jones almost created a troubling scene that almost sparked a huge problem for disney that required one actress to beg for a revision.,"James Mangold nearly caused an uproar from fans over one scene that required one actress to beg for a revision in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023).
Harrison Ford’s Indiana Jones always ends up facing the same enemy. Nazis. While Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Crystal Skull (2008) pitted the legendary archaeologist against the Soviets, all the other movies involved some form of Nazis. Sadly, each adventure ends in misfortune for the enemy, but one scene almost went too far.
Now that the archaeologist is almost 80, Indiana Jones isn’t a spry young man. He’s old, and his age definitely shows. Some have claimed the movie is too depressing seeing an older Indy, but the adventure with his god-daughter Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) pits him against Mads Mikkelsen’s Jurgen Voller, a Nazi scientist who worked in NASA. After helping America win the Space Race, Voller goes all in on finding a lost artifact he once held in World War II.
Sadly, the movie isn’t bringing back the magic for every fan. The box office numbers have been troublesome, with Disney potentially not making enough and creating another failure in the process. The movie isn’t perfect either, but it could have been a lot worse, according to Variety, if Shaunette Renée Wilson didn’t demand a revision for one scene she felt was too problematic:
“Well, I don’t want to spoil too much, but my character had a particular way of exiting the film and initially I found it to be a little bit problematic and offensive. I was like we probably don’t need to say these words or have it done this way, and this something I am uncomfortable with.”
This led to Mangold revising the script to make her final scene different, and the film still doesn’t do enough. Without spoiling the scene, it’s clear that Wilson’s character is a vocal black woman in the script, and she is dealing with Nazis working for the American government. Most likely, the original script included more racist comments about the Aryan race, or had Wilson made another comment about how racist Nazis could be. These moments aren’t necessary, and funny enough, Wilson’s character still throws a racial slur earlier in the movie.
This scene didn’t ruin Indy 5, but it could’ve been avoided, as the movie’s first act could’ve followed a different set of events to place Indiana Jones on his final adventure. Sadly, this is it for the iconic hero, and fans might one day enjoy Indy’s final ride, but most will wish the character’s legend was left alone.
Do you think Indy 5 was originally more racist? Let Inside the Magic know what you think!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbWFnaWMubmV0LzIwMjMvMDcvZGlzbmV5LWFsbW9zdC13ZW50LXRvby1mYXItaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LWFjdHJlc3MtZ290LXByb2JsZW1hdGljLXNjZW5lLXJldmlzZWQta2IxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Review,Sonny Bunch reviews the latest Indiana Jones movie and finds that the problems start before the action does.,"Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (Courtesy of Walt Disney Pictures)
THIS IS GOING TO SOUND LIKE A SILLY, petty complaint. And maybe it is. But you get a glimpse of everything that’s wrong with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny in the opening moments. Specifically, the order of the credited production companies. Even more specifically: the refusal to start the film as every other Indiana Jones movie has started: by dissolving from the Paramount logo to a mountain or mountain-like shape on the screen.
You know what I mean: going from the logo’s rendering of the Ben Lomond Mountain to a peak in South America in Raiders, or an engraving on a gong at the start of the musical sequence in Temple, or the butte in the American Southwest at the start of Last Crusade. Even Crystal Skull kept the gag going, though its rendering—a poorly animated gopher hole—betrayed some of that film’s problems as well.
It’s a little thing—one might even call it hokey—but it’s important because it sets the whole mood. This is a movie, that dissolve says. Not just any kind of movie. An old-timey action-adventure romp of the sort we, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, grew up watching. Go get your nickel’s worth of popcorn and kick up your feet.
Dial of Destiny doesn’t start on that dissolve because it can’t start on that dissolve because starting on that dissolve would defeat the entire purpose of this picture: for Disney to lay claim to the Indiana Jones property and all it stands for going forward. That’s why Lucasfilm and Disney share the first title card. Paramount gets the next one—an “in association with” credit, adding insult to injury—and one can only imagine the negotiations that went into securing that, as Paramount is no longer the distributor of these films.
Again: this is potentially dumb and possibly petty, but for a movie that is almost purely a nostalgia play—and a frequently charming one at that—it’s a sour note to start on. I couldn’t help but feel the same sort of pang I felt when John Williams’s opening Star Wars theme blared out of the theater speakers during The Force Awakens without the 20th Century Fox fanfare preceding it. The movie felt … naked. Exposed. It’s just wrong.
Anyway. After a prelude in World War II during which a de-aged Harrison Ford fights with Nazis for control of an ancient artifact supposedly built by Archimedes, the titular dial, we move to the late 1960s. The Beatles are on the radio. Ticker tape litters the street, as astronauts take their victory lap. Indiana Jones (Ford) lives alone in a messy one-bedroom, passed out in his easy chair, annoyed by the kids making a racket down the hall. A quick pan shows everything we need to know: a folded flag by a photo of a boy in uniform, presumably Mutt (Shia LaBeouf in the fourth movie), rests next to a faded picture of Indy’s dad (Sean Connery in the third). The sad story of this little apartment practically tells itself.
Indy—he of Arks and Temples and Crusades—is about to retire in lonely obscurity. On his way out the door, he’s stopped for drinks by his goddaughter, Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), who has some questions about the Antikythera, the Greek name for the eponymous dial. Where she might find the other half, for starters. So she can sell it. (She believes in the importance of museums a bit less than her godfather, particularly since she has some debts to pay.) A bit of hubbub later, and Indy and Helena are off to track down the Antikythera in its entirety, racing with Nazi physicist-turned-U.S.-rocket-scientist Dr. Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen).
I won’t talk much more about the plot; you deserve to see if the film’s big swing connects or not. What I will say is that it rides much less smoothly than Raiders of the Lost Ark, a perfect movie that just zips along from scene to scene and moment to moment, or Last Crusade, which is nearly as efficient. At more than two and a half hours, the picture drags, though it’s never quite boring. Ford remains incredibly charismatic, even as the broken, somewhat-hangdog Indy, and his repartee with Waller-Bridge is natural. Sallah’s (John Rhys-Davies) back! Antonio Banderas plays a diver pal of Indy’s! We may be missing the Paramount peaks, but there’s still a mountain of charm on the screen.
I just don’t think that’s quite enough. Dial of Destiny has the same problem that Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had: It looks phony throughout, and not only during effects-heavy scenes. I can’t tell if we’ve regressed when it comes to the technology of rear projection and green screen or what, but the sequences in which people are driving simply look fake, poorly done, the lighting and shadow and shading all wrong. At least with Crystal Skull we still had Spielberg behind the camera, meaning there’s a motion, a liveliness, a vibrancy to the proceedings. James Mangold is a solid, competent director—and there are moments, as in that aforementioned pan across the apartment, when you appreciate his restraint—but he’s not Spielberg. He doesn’t have that innate sense of visual movement or the ability to translate it to the big screen. No one does.
The only reason for this film to exist, then, is as an exercise in intellectual property propagation. Indy already got his sendoff in Crystal Skull; they even nodded at the passing of the torch to come. But now the character’s owned by a new distributor with new priorities. And so, Indiana Jones is pressed into duty once again at the behest of the raiders of the lost IP. When their faces melt at the sight of the nine-figure loss headed their way, one imagines they’ll wish they never tried to turn back time.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vcGx1cy50aGVidWx3YXJrLmNvbS9wL2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Explore the world like Indiana Jones at these 11 destinations,"From Petra to Glasgow to a few surprising film locations, Hollywood’s favorite archaeologist inspired a generation of adventurers.","The line that perhaps best sums up Indiana Jones is delivered deadpan, midway through 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark. Battered, bruised, and weary, the archaeologist-adventurer says: “It’s not the years… It’s the mileage.”
Five films and 42 years later, that mileage has seriously racked up. Aside from fedoras and Harrison Ford, one of the franchise’s now iconic visual hallmarks is a map—a red line scrolling across seas and continents as Dr. Jones excavates, romances, and punches his way across the world by boat, plane, bike, or submarine.
The character’s last cinematic crack of the whip, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is now set to inspire a new generation of adventurers—that is, if previous installments are anything to go by.
“Imagine how less wondrous things might be if you didn’t feel like there was a world of adventure and discovery beyond your building or the streets of your city?” says Albert Lin, a National Geographic Explorer, scientist, and presenter of Lost Cities with Albert Lin. “When I was a kid growing up with Indiana Jones, you saw those different worlds. And these places are really out there. There is a city built into the walls of cliffs in Jordan. There are mummies in the mountains of Peru. There are chambers under the desert in Egypt.”
But some of the locations—most, in fact—across the five-film series aren’t quite where they appear. Politics, logistics, and the complications of shooting required some innovative location scouting. The result is a trail of often unlikely destinations across the planet.
Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)
The “jungles of Peru” were actually filmed on United States soil on Kauai, Hawaii. Kalalea Mountain provided the very first shot in the drama. Other locations around Huleia National Wildlife Refuge and the historic Kipu Ranch near Puhi stood in for the territory of the Chachapoyan warriors.

The Egyptian street scenes—including that famous non-starter of a sword fight—were filmed in the Tunisian city of Kairouan (“little Cairo”), famous for its carpet making and historic mosque.
(Here are eight places to visit if you love Star Wars.)
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)
The Club Obi Wan (a nod to Lucasfilm’s other franchise) wasn’t in Shanghai, as billed—nor was it on a studio backlot. The monsoon- and neon-soaked streets that host the opening scenes of Dr. Jones’s sophomore outing were actually in Macau, the island often referred to as the “Las Vegas of Asia.” Resplendent with flamboyant architecture and a glitzy gambling culture, Macau became a Special Administrative Region of China in 1999 after almost 500 years as a Portuguese colony.
Although set in India, The Temple of Doom shifted production south to Sri Lanka, due to sensitivities around potential cultural stereotyping (a criticism upheld by modern viewers). A tea plantation near the island country’s central city of Kandy was transformed into the rural village depicted in the film, which has since become the site of the Ceylon Tea Museum. The climactic rope bridge scene was filmed near the Victoria Dam on the Mahaweli River—a location today very much off the beaten track.

First glimpsed, as in the movie, through the Siq—a sandstone gorge—the resplendent Al-Khazneh (The Treasury) in Jordan’s ancient rock city of Petra exudes majesty and mystery. Historians believe this cliff-cut 2,000-year-old architectural triumph has links to the real Crusades, where it may have been used as an outpost in the 12th century. But beyond the door is no vaulted chamber, as in the film: A modest, bare room of uncertain function is all you will see.
Doubling for the Middle East, southern Spain had the infrastructure and arid aesthetic the production team needed for some key action sequences. Locations include the beach at Cala De Monsul and the spectacular Desierto de Tabernas, a dramatic badlands home to tarantulas, eagle owls, and north African hedgehogs. The region was also famously utilized by scores of “spaghetti” Westerns in the 1960s. A preserved Western set called Fort Bravo is now a surreal theme park.

Nowhere can convincingly double for Venice, Italy’s most distinctive city—and nowhere did. Shooting at the height of the tourist season in August, the production crew briefly gained control of the Grand Canal—from “7 a.m. to 1 p.m., on one day,” remembered producer Robert Watts, speaking in 1999.
But if the building hiding the bookish entrance to the rat-infested catacombs “doesn’t look much like a library,” that’s because it isn’t; it’s the church of San Barnaba, in the Dorsoduro district. The site has hosted a church since the ninth century, with the distinctive neoclassical frontage added around 1776.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)
Professor Jones’s work place is a piecemeal of locations. But the wholesome university vibe that forms the backdrop to the motorcycle chase at the beginning of the fourth Indiana Jones movie has some authenticity. “Marshall College” is none other than Yale, the historic Ivy league university in New Haven, Connecticut.
One of America’s oldest cities, the cultural capital of the New England state has a historic harbor, a thriving restaurant scene, and a brace of important institutions—including the Peabody Natural History Museum and the venerable university itself. In the movie, spot the neo-Gothic Old Campus Courtyard, which dates to 1718.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023)
In the series ender, the towering architecture of St. Vincent Street in Glasgow, Scotland’s biggest city, convincingly doubles for 1969 New York, where a ticker tape parade celebrating the successful Apollo 11 moon landing makes its way down this grand thoroughfare.
Farther south, England’s North Yorkshire Moors Railway has been recruited for some blistering train-top action. Another balmier location is the medieval city of Cefalù, Sicily, the set piece for a critical scene in The Dial of Destiny. Home to a 13th-century cathedral, dazzling spiaggia (beaches), and archaeological diversions aplenty, it’s an easy fit for Indy’s final bow.

2023-07-20 15:40:00+00:00,Boyd Holbrook Breaks Down His ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ and ‘Justified: City Primeval’ Baddies,"Boyd Holbrook talks about his villains in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Justified: City Primeval opposite Harrison Ford, Timothy Olyphant.","[This story contains spoilers for Justified: City Primeval‘s two-episode premiere and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.]
From Logan and Sandman to Indiana Jones and Raylan Givens, Boyd Holbrook has a knack for being a thorn in the hero’s side.
Holbrook recently returned to the big screen in James Mangold’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which marked the conclusion of Harrison Ford’s 42-year tenure as the title character of Indiana Jones. The Kentucky native played Klaber, a neo-Nazi wannabe who served as Jürgen Voller’s (Mads Mikkelsen) top lieutenant, resembling Holbrook’s role as Donald Pierce in Mangold’s Oscar-nominated film, Logan (2017). Despite some early reservations over the similar parts, Holbrook couldn’t resist the opportunity to work with Ford and help say goodbye to his iconic and daring archaeologist.
“Jim [Mangold] called and said, ‘Listen, I don’t want to offend you, but have a look at it,’” Holbrook told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike. “So the character was a similar second-in-command bad guy who does all the bidding. That was the similarity, and that was my hesitation when I read it. But then there’s the pull of, ‘Wow, this is the last hurrah. This is the last run of Indiana Jones.’ So I didn’t want to repeat anything for Jim, and we were very adamant about that.”
Dial of Destiny revolves around the decades-long pursuit of Archimedes’ time dial, the Antikythera, as Klaber (Holbrook) wants to help Voller travel back to 1939, so he can replace Hitler and lead Nazi Germany to victory during World War II. Voller ultimately commandeered the Dial from Indy but severely miscalculated along the way, resulting in a group trip to the Siege of Syracuse in 212 BC. Despite Holbrook’s first-hand involvement, Indy’s voyage to the past still moved him as an audience member.
“It’s so elegantly done that it’s not farcical whatsoever,” Holbrook said. “It bottlenecks to a really touching moment where you feel that Indiana has earned this moment and wants to stay. When I saw it, I was surprised that it grabbed me by the throat. I was a little emotional, even though I’m so close to it.”
Holbrook also plays the main villain on Justified: City Primeval, FX’s revival of one of its most beloved television properties. Timothy Olyphant’s affable U.S. Marshal character, Raylan Givens, ends up having to pass through Detroit while on a road trip with his now-teenage daughter, Willa (Vivian Olyphant), and their stay in the Motor City is quickly extended due to a double murder involving Holbrook’s Clement Mansell.
Written by co-showrunners Michael Dinner and Dave Andron, the second episode of the two-episode premiere, “The Oklahoma Wildman,” ends with Raylan beating Mansell to a pulp for threatening Willa, and Holbrook wants to make it clear that this is only the beginning of the lawman’s showdown with his murderous conman.
“Clement can’t get enough of it. He loves it. He loves screwing around with this guy to a point, and then it gets a little too serious. But it is a totally different dynamic than Boyd Crowder [Walton Goggins]. Those guys knew each other, and there’s more longevity between the characters. Being that this is a limited series, the structure is built from the get-go that these guys are gonna collide.”
Below, during a spoiler-filled conversation with THR, Holbrook talks Indy and Justified, while also looking ahead to Jeff Nichols’ long-awaited sixth film, The Bikeriders, co-starring Tom Hardy, Austin Butler, Jodie Comer and Michael Shannon.
Well, it’s an exciting time for you right now.
Yeah, it is. I did a lot of things over the pandemic, and now they’re all bottlenecking.
When I last spoke to you for The Fugitive (2020), the key point you made was that you wouldn’t have said yes to the project if you were asked to play the fourth version of Dr. Richard Kimble. So when you were eventually cast in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny alongside the second Dr. Richard Kimble, Harrison Ford, I said to myself, “I bet Boyd is even more glad that he didn’t end up playing Richard Kimble.” Did that ever cross your mind once you knew you’d be working with Harrison?
Yeah, for sure. I wondered if he was aware of things and what he would say, because there’s always a predecessor to something. And I guess you always want a little bit of approval if you’re in it for the right reasons. But it never came up. We stuck to the business at hand. And watching Harrison work, there’s a reason why I had that initial reservation.
There’s even a stretch of the film where Indy is a fugitive and you’re the one chasing after him.
I didn’t even think about that. It’s funny how everything just gets thrown in a blender and all of our soups kind of come together.
Other actors have told me that you get over the Harrison Ford of it all rather quickly just because he’s pretty cool and whatnot. Was that your experience as well?
Absolutely. Harrison cuts the mustard, man! He gets it off the plate really quick. It’s like a construction site. That’s what I also love about Jim Mangold. He’s just very to the point; direct, blunt and has a good sense of humor while doing it, which makes for a great work environment. Harrison had this saying on set, “Alright, let’s shoot this piece of shit,” and it just cut the air out of everything. So we gave it 10 tries, two tries, 20 tries until we got it. And that’s what acting is all about.

When James Mangold came to you with this role, it was probably an easy sell on one level because it’s Harrison Ford’s final Indiana Jones movie. But the flip side is that you had just played another lead henchman of sorts for Jim in Logan. So did he carefully differentiate these guys to you, assuming you would probably notice the similarity?
You’re a hundred percent right. You hit the nail on the head, man. Jim called and said, “Listen, I don’t want to offend you, but have a look at it.” I don’t know if it was because of what the character did or who he’s associated with or the size of the part. We talked about doing another project before this, but I looked at it and it was Indiana Jones. So the character was a similar second-in-command bad guy who does all the bidding. That was the similarity, and that was my hesitation when I read it. But then there’s the pull of, “Wow, this is the last hurrah. This is the last run of Indiana Jones.” So I didn’t want to repeat anything for Jim, and we were very adamant about that.
I think the character was even written as German in the beginning, but I couldn’t figure out why this guy was hanging out with these neo-Nazis. Why was he not in Haight-Ashbury, smoking a spliff or something? (Laughs.) But then I got into it and thought, “Well, he wants to be a part of this gang or club because nobody else wants the guy. He’s just a vagrant mess.” And then he’s trying to learn German to fit in; he’s eager. So I just had to figure out how to humanize it and make a character that I could actually believe, instead of just the surface or veneer of whatever. So we talked a lot about that.
The term “trigger-happy” feels like an understatement in regard to Klaber, so he really did drink Voller’s Kool-Aid if he was that quick to kill for him.
Yeah, I thought about it as Voller being this enterprise that was starting up, and Klaber was getting equity in the startup as the first on board. So the loyalty and the dedication comes from, “Well, I’m gonna be first in line and at the top of the totem pole when we get to the new island.” He was a mad lapdog.
I based it all upon being accepted by Voller. It’s a classic archetype of approval. You’ve gotta find something real in there. Birds of a feather flock together, but I don’t think Voller’s ideology came first. I think Klaber was just desiring a real primitive acceptance that he’s never had. So, somebody didn’t love him.
Were you pretty blown away when you found out the characters would be time traveling to the Siege of Syracuse in 212 BC?
I was. I thought it was a bold, earned choice. It’s so cleverly speckled in throughout the film. Those seeds are planted, and it’s preparing you for it, subliminally. You don’t really know it until it’s happening and it’s so elegantly done that it’s not farcical whatsoever. It bottlenecks to a really touching moment where you feel that Indiana has earned this moment and wants to stay. When I saw it, I was surprised that it grabbed me by the throat. I was a little emotional even though I’m so close to it.
Many decades from now, what day on Dial of Destiny are you going to tell your grandkids about first?
Good question, bud. And God, there are a lot. You remind yourself every day that this is the last one, and so there’s a really special feeling that it puts off. There was a fantastic scene, and just watching Harrison work was a true master class. It’s mainly a scene between Dr. Schmidt [Voller’s American alias] and Indiana where he’s shot, and Dr. Schmidt is about to transform back into Voller. And Harrison just used the rocking motion of the [plane] to come up into this line of dialogue. So there were just moments like that that I got to be around all the time and soak up, and so it was a great experience. A real experience.
Before we get into Justified: City Primeval, I would love to hear about your time on The Bikeriders because I’m a Jeff Nichols fanatic.
Oh, I couldn’t be more excited about something. I did a little run here with The Sandman, Indiana Jones and then Justified, which was a dark period, I guess. That’s just the way it happened, but with The Bikeriders, it’s a totally different character and color to all of this other stuff that we’re talking about. And Jeff is a national treasure of a director. He is Americana filmmaking. He’s exceptional. We had a great cast, and it’s an excellent time in history. It’s the early ‘60s when biker clubs were getting put together and culture was really developing. It’s great. I’ve seen most of it, and it’s really good.

So, from one trigger-happy lunatic to the next one, we’ve now arrived at Justified’s Clement Mansell. He’s a sadistic killer and thief, but the oddest detail about him is that he’s apparently a musician who refuses to share demos of his own White Stripes covers with anyone but himself. Sandy said that he doesn’t play his stuff for her. Could you make sense of that?
Well, the reason why I got into the show was because a friend of mine who worked on season five asked me if all the same people were still involved, and I said yes. And he said, “Run, don’t walk, to the project.” So that [detail] wasn’t in the book. I don’t know which brilliant dude created it, whether it was [co-showrunner] Dave Andron, [co-showrunner] Michael Dinner or [EP] Graham Yost. But they gave Clement so much humanity. He just really thinks he’s gonna make it. He really thinks he’s this undiscovered talent. And when all of this stuff comes up about his past, he thinks it’ll just legitimize him as this outlaw, disillusioned singer. But he’s really just mentally ill.
Do you think he genuinely loves Sandy (Adelaide Clemens), or does he just need her for the game they run on wealthy marks?
He trusts Sandy. He can trust Sandy, and that’s a big thing. That’s got a lot of traction on it, but Sweety [Vondie Curtis-Hall] is the one that he admires. Sweety is somebody he really looks up to, because he’s done the things musically that he’s looking to do. So there’s a lot of great relationships in the show. It’s fantastic writing.
So was it a painful day when Quentin Tarantino had to drop out as director?
Yeah, that was tough. That was how I discovered the project. I was offered the part, and things happened. We had a great time, and I hope to still work with Quentin one day. That’d be great. I know [Justified] is one of his favorite shows, so hopefully he’ll be tuning in. But yeah, it was great, man. It was a great experience. I can’t really complain. Things happen.
In the first episode, Clement instigates a high-speed car chase involving guns, and it’s quite eerie considering a very similar real-life situation happened to cross paths with your set. Were you anywhere near this incident?
Yeah, I had wrapped up my scene, and it took place in between my scene and the next one up. So I was a couple football fields away, maybe. But these things happen in big cities, sometimes, and luckily, no one was hurt. Fiction does imitate life.
Well, in the second episode, Raylan confronts Clement in relation to the murders of a judge (Keith David) and his assistant. And then Clement declares war by seeking out and threatening Raylan’s daughter, Willa (Vivian Olyphant), without her realizing it. Raylan then proceeds to unload a few fists on him in retaliation. Was this encounter just the tip of the iceberg for what’s to come between them?
Yeah, Clement can’t get enough of it. He loves it. He loves screwing around with this guy to a point, and then it gets a little too serious. But it is a totally different dynamic than Boyd Crowder [Walton Goggins]. Those guys knew each other, and there’s more longevity between the characters. Being that this is a limited series, the structure is built from the get-go that these guys are gonna collide.

You’ve mentioned wanting to find humanity in both Klaber and Mansell, but could you really pull that off, especially with a guy like Mansell?
I dissect the script and figure out what I am getting out of it. If it has heart, then it has heart. If it’s not that, then what else is it? Because it can’t be one note. I don’t want to give one note. And the great thing about Justified is that it’s fucked up and funny. That balances the show out.

,“The Chance to Collaborate with My Heroes”: Director James Mangold on Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"James Mangold tells Lucasfilm.com how Raiders of the Lost Ark led him to direct Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, in theaters June 30.","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is more than Indy’s last adventure — it’s a love letter from a kid who became enthralled with filmmaking while watching Raiders of the Lost Ark on opening day in 1981.
Director James Mangold was a teenager when he saw the first Indiana Jones adventure in theaters. “It inspired me,” Mangold tells Lucasfilm.com. “I mean, I was already making Super 8 films at that point; I was already a crazy filmmaking geek. My room was a double-system editing room and cameras galore, and I was devising how to make special effects, building models, animating, and shooting movies in my high school.” But to the aspiring young filmmaker, the cast and crew of Raiders was already firmly ensconced among his personal heroes. “You’re talking about George Lucas and Steven Spielberg [who executive produced this film]. You’re talking about Harrison Ford and John Williams. These were my North Star.”
Now more than 40 years later, Mangold has helmed Indy’s final ride, an epic send-off for one of cinema’s legendary action-adventure heroes, once again played by the incomparable Harrison Ford. The story finds Indy at the end of his teaching career, confronted by his past, at a crossroads in a life filled with some significant disappointments. To put it bluntly: “He’s lost.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1Y2FzZmlsbS5jb20vbmV3cy9qYW1lcy1tYW5nb2xkLWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtaW50ZXJ2aWV3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Harrison Ford may say he’s done with Indiana Jones, but look out for Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Helena Shaw, the archeologist’s goddaughter, who makes her debut in the franchise’s fifth title, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
With a Disney+ Indiana Jones series planned and the notion that franchises never die many deaths, it stands to reason that Waller-Bridge is picking up the whip and the hat, right?
“First, I ever heard of it!” confessed the 3x Fleabag Emmy winner to Deadline tonight at the Disney premiere.
In the wake of the success of Amazon’s Fleabag, fans have been eagerly waiting for Waller-Bridge’s next big act on Prime Video. Amazon promptly signed her to a deal post Fleabag‘s Emmy wins. A new series was greenlit in March 2022 and set to shoot at the end of that year. Then in January she renewed her overall deal with the streamer with a series adaptation of the Claudia Lux novel, Sign Here, being first in development.
So what’s next at Amazon for Waller-Bridge? And when?
Says multi-hyphenate tonight at the Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny premiere, “It’s all very much the Writers Strike at the moment, so, we’re all taking a break. But if that all gets sorted, I’m working on Tomb Raider.”
Amazon Studios back in January tapped Waller-Bridge to write a TV series as part of a potential Tomb Raider universe that would span television, film and games. She’d also be involved in the potential movie.
Tonight, Waller-Bridge called Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny a “beautiful closing chapter.”
When it came to joining the franchise, she said “It’s not something I’d ever imagine I’d be a part of, so every single day felt like a dream.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvcGhvZWJlLXdhbGxlci1icmlkZ2UtaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy10b21iLXJhaWRlci1hbWF6b24tMTIzNTQxNzc4OC_SAWJodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2L3Bob2ViZS13YWxsZXItYnJpZGdlLWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtdG9tYi1yYWlkZXItYW1hem9uLTEyMzU0MTc3ODgvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

It’ll be more than enough for the Harrison Ford action-adventure film to land in the top spot on domestic charts, setting itself up to draw crowds through the Fourth of July holiday — but it’s not exactly the victorious tone-setter for one of the most expensive American blockbusters ever made. With a whopping $295 million production budget, “Indiana Jones 5” faces quite the trek to theatrical profitability.
The skies have been cloudy for “Dial of Destiny” for some weeks now, ever since the franchise finale made a splashy debut at the Cannes Film Festival and earned reviews that could kindly be described as mixed. After weathering that mediocre buzz for more than a month, the film has balanced out at a 58% approval rating from top critics on Rotten Tomatoes. In Variety‘s review, chief film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote that “James Mangold’s action epic is made in the style of Steven Spielberg, but the exhilaration is gone.”
The first round of ticket buyers are more positive, as indicated by the “B+” grade through research firm Cinema Score, but that’s still not a level of excitement that’s appropriate for a beloved franchise homecoming, especially one of this scale.
The last feather in Indy’s cap was “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” which opened to $100 million over the Memorial Day holiday in 2008 and legged out a $790 million worldwide gross. That film drew its own middling reception, which may have taken away some of the thrill of the franchise for audiences. It’ll be difficult for “Dial of Destiny” to match the final gross of its predecessor.
James Mangold took the director’s seat for this outing after franchise co-creator Steven Spielberg bowed out during a lengthy development process. “Dial of Destiny” sees a weathered Indiana Jones searching for a mystical artifact with the power to change the course of history. The professorial globe-trotter is accompanied by his goddaughter, Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), in a race against a former Nazi (Mads Mikkelsen) for the treasure.
While Disney is facing an underwhelming arrival for “Indiana Jones,” it can take some solace in the fact that it’s not laying the biggest box office egg this weekend. Universal’s “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken” is likely opening outside of the top five after earning $2.3 million from 3,400 theaters on Friday. A finish around $6 million over the three-day frame seems to be where things are headed.
Nobody in the industry has been projecting good numbers for the DreamWorks Animation film and this pin-drop opening represents the proverbial Band-Aid getting ripped off. Facing strong competition for family audiences in “Indiana Jones” and animated holdovers “Elemental” and “Across the Spider-Verse,” “Ruby Gillman” doesn’t have any hope to recoup its $70 million production budget. For what it’s worth, ticket buyers have been positive, as indicated by the “A-” grade on Cinema Score.
Sony looks to take silver with “Across the Spider-Verse,” projecting an $11.7 million gross for its fifth weekend of release. The “Spider-Man” sequel is looking at another soft drop around 40% or so; arachnids have eight legs and this movie is using all of them to keep its numbers climbing. Total domestic gross should push to $340 million through Sunday.
Disney and Pixar’s “Elemental” is looking at third place. The animated romance added $3.4 million on Friday to push its North American total to $80 million. “Elemental” still won’t be able to justify its $200 million production budget after debuting with the worst opening numbers in Pixar’s history, but it’s held well since then. The film will almost certainly push beyond a $100 million domestic gross — a milestone that seemed beyond reach two weeks ago.
Sony’s “No Hard Feelings” is projecting $7.1 million through the weekend, which would push its domestic total to $28 million. That would be a modest 51% drop from its opening numbers, but the Jennifer Lawrence comedy still cost $45 million to produce.
“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” looks to round out the top five, projecting a 43% drop in its fourth weekend of release. The Paramount sequel should reach a $135 million domestic gross through the three-day frame.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LW9wZW5pbmctZGF5LWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS0xMjM1NjU5NjEyL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LW9wZW5pbmctZGF5LWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS0xMjM1NjU5NjEyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-26 19:54:34+00:00,Disney's 'Haunted Mansion' Needs Hundreds of Millions to Avoid 'Indiana Jones' Flop - Inside the Magic,"Amid a tumultuous year at the box office, Disney will need to scare up some seriously impressive ticket sales for 'Haunted Mansion.'","The release of Disney’s Haunted Mansion (2023) is right around the corner, promising audiences a spooktacular time at the movies ahead of the Halloween season. So far, the new thriller-comedy has earned generally positive reviews from critics, but according to new projections, it’ll have to do a bit more heavy lifting to scare up enough numbers at the box office to break even on its staggering $150+ million budget.
Following in the footsteps of the iconic Eddie Murphy-led The Haunted Mansion (2003) and the more recent Muppets Haunted Mansion (2021), director Justin Simien’s new adaptation of the beloved Disney Parks ride is set to arrive on the big screen later this month.
Check out the official trailer for Walt Disney Studios’ Haunted Mansion below:
Featuring an all-star cast from the likes of Owen Wilson, LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Rosario Dawson, Danny DeVito, and Jamie Lee Curtis, 2023’s Haunted Mansion might just be the unexpected hit of the summer box office—unlike the lackluster performance of Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023). Despite some memorable moments, Harrison Ford’s final go-around as the eponymous adventurer generally missed the mark with audiences, with the Disney-distributed action flick barely breaking even on its reported $350 million production budget.
To avoid a similar fate, Haunted Mansion will have to score some significant ticket sales, especially considering its surprisingly big budget of $157.75 million, according to The Numbers. This tracks with Disney’s recent history of shelling out upwards of $200 million on big-name projects like Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt’s Jungle Cruise (2021) and even Disney+ TV series like Marvel’s Secret Invasion, which reportedly cost $200 million to make.
For reference of just how mind-boggling this reported $157.75 million truly is, this summer’s other top-grossing blockbusters, Oppenheimer (2023) and Barbie (2023) had budgets of $100 million and $145 million, respectively. Both movies have already shattered opening weekend records, putting them on track to score big at the box office. But can Haunted Mansion follow suit?
Well, to be considered a box office success, a film needs to make at least 2 to 3 times its production budget, meaning Haunted Mansion needs to make around $314 million at the box office to be a hit for Disney. Given that Dial of Destiny, which comes as the final installment in one of the most recognizable franchises of all time, has grossed just a little over $330 million after nearly a month in theaters, it’s not looking promising for Haunted Mansion. Although the ride it’s based on is famous within the Disney community, it’s hard to predict whether or not this IP has widespread appeal in a cinematic setting.
Its 2003 predecessor was also a notorious box office bomb for Disney, earning only 1.7 times its $90 million budget. The Haunted Mansion also boasted similar star power to the upcoming 2023 film, meaning big names alone aren’t enough to tempt audiences into theaters.
So, is this $330 million haul attainable for Haunted Mansion? Unless there’s some sort of miracle in store, all signs point toward no. Despite rave reviews, there’s bound to be a challenging road ahead for the latest from the House of Mouse, with the state of moviegoing still being somewhat unpredictable in the wake of the pandemic. It’ll also be up against the affectionally-dubbed “Barbenheimer” and Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (2023), meaning there’s some stiff competition for who can fill the most seats.
Only time will tell if this Disney underdog can scare up a decent performance in its opening weekend, or if frightful Haunted Mansion box office numbers will mean the end of ride adaptations moving forward.
Haunted Mansion arrives in theaters on July 28, 2023.

,Indiana Jones Has Arrived on Disney+!,"Before Indy's next big-screen adventure, you can now watch his original stories, including The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones.","Indy will soon head off on one last adventure. Before he does, you can check out all of his previous escapades right now.
As announced earlier this month, the first four Indiana Jones films — Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull — as well as the fan-favorite The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones TV show are now streaming on Disney+. This is the debut of the Indy movies on the streaming service, and the first official release of Young Indy by Lucasfilm in 15 years.
Set in the 1930s, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, and The Last Crusade were the first stories to introduce viewers to Indiana Jones. They established the series’ penchant for action-packed chases, supernatural mysteries, irreverent humor, and unforgettable characters (including a fair number of alluring villains). Moviegoers waited nearly 20 years before Indy returned in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which brought the character into a rapidly-changing, 1950s world.
The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones was one of Lucasfilm’s first live-action television series, first debuting on ABC in 1992. Winning multiple Emmy Awards, Young Indy was created as an educational adventure that inspired viewers (especially younger ones) to learn about history, science, and the arts. A passion project for executive producer George Lucas, its 22 feature-length episodes were shot in some two-dozen countries around the world.

“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny”
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 18. It will open in theaters on June 30.
The MPAA rates the movie PG-13. According to their classification, the rating is due to “sequences of violence and action, language and smoking.” While the rating itself doesn’t add much to what can be expected in the fifth and final film, it is an interesting reminder that the second film of the franchise, “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,” was a main catalyst (alongside “Gremlins”) that led the MPAA to create the PG-13 classification in the first place.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” will take place in 1969, amidst the space race. Indiana Jones will encounter his old enemy, the Nazis, again. Voller is a villain inspired by Wernher von Braun, a real Nazi who became a NASA engineer.
The teaser trailer and artwork for the film debuted in December. A second teaser for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” premiered during Super Bowl LVII.
Harrison Ford, now 80 years old, stated this will be the last “Indiana Jones” movie.
Before the film’s full title was announced, Empire shared behind-the-scenes photos and interviews with the cast last November.
“It’s full of adventure, full of laughs, full of real emotion. And it’s complex and it’s sneaky,” Ford said at the time. “The shooting of it was tough and long and arduous. But I’m very happy with the film that we have.”
It’s rumored that an Indiana Jones TV series could be in development for Disney+. It remains unclear if the storyline of this series would be a prequel to the films, set somewhere inside the franchise narrative, or following a totally new character rather than Henry Jones Jr. If this series is developed, it would not be the first TV show about Indiana Jones. In 1992-1993, “The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles” aired on ABC. Harrison Ford made a cameo appearance in one episode.

2023-07-02 23:20:48+00:00,‘Indiana Jones & The Dial Of Destiny’ Star Mads Mikkelsen Prefers Playing “Losers” Over “Cutie Pie” Characters,"Mads Mikkelsen talks about playing ""losers"" in films as he stars in 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.'","Mads Mikkelsen stars opposite Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny playing Nazi scientist Dr. Jürgen Voller. The actor recently opened up about the roles that he likes to play opting to play “losers” on-screen versus “cutie pie” characters.
“To combine it — to do something real and also be a cutie pie — I don’t really find it interesting,” Mikkelsen told GQ in a recent interview. “I’m not into the ‘hair falling in your eyes, be cute in a corner.’ Not me. The losers are fun. Because we know them. You might have been in that situation yourself sometimes.”
The Danish actor has made a name for himself in the U.S. playing villains. Other notable performances include Hannibal Lecter in the Hannibal series, the evil wizard in Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore and the accountant in Rihanna’s “Bitch Better Have My Money.”
“If there’s nothing else, I’ll definitely do this, because it’s fun,” he said of playing villains. “And then I can do whatever I want back in Europe.”

Indiana Jones director James Mangold praised Mikkelsen’s acting skills saying that the actor “inhabits whatever character he plays with a hundred percent commitment to their perspective.”
“This takes a certain kind of artistic bravery, a fearlessness that Mads possesses,” Mangold added. “In all honesty, I think he has been offered the roles of ‘villains’ in movies simply because he is so fearless about taking them on and humanizing them”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3L2luZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1kaWFsLW9mLWRlc3RpbnktbWFkcy1taWtrZWxzZW4tcHJlZmVycy1wbGF5aW5nLWxvc2Vycy1vdmVyLWN1dGllLXBpZS1jaGFyYWN0ZXJzLTEyMzU0MjkwMTQv0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1hbmQtdGhlLWRpYWwtb2YtZGVzdGlueS1tYWRzLW1pa2tlbHNlbi1wcmVmZXJzLXBsYXlpbmctbG9zZXJzLW92ZXItY3V0aWUtcGllLWNoYXJhY3RlcnMtMTIzNTQyOTAxNC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"Harrison Ford reflects on replacing Tom Selleck as Indiana Jones, first impression of 'Raiders' and his 'Dial of Destiny' farewell",Legendary actor says he never imagined playing iconic archaeologist for 40-plus years.,"What if Tom Selleck hadn’t turned down the role of swashbuckling, Nazi-slugging archeologist Indiana Jones in 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark?
Such is one of Hollywood’s great sliding-door moments. Selleck was the first choice for the adventure film helmed by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. Selleck wanted the part. Unfortunately, he had to give it up because he was contractually obligated to a new drama that CBS just picked up for series, Magnum, P.I. — a show that would eventually catapult him to stardom.
Harrison Ford had no idea at the time.
The actor had recently completed The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Star Wars boss Lucas, who conceived the character of Jones in 1973, asked his Han Solo to read the Raiders script.
“I didn’t know that it was a script that someone else had read and was unable to take the job of Indiana Jones because of a contract, Tom Selleck,” Ford, 80, tells us in a new interview. (Selleck would eventually get his shot as a big-screen action hero in 1983’s High Road to China, one of the many Indy-inspired films that flooded theaters following the blockbuster success of Raiders.)
Ford says he was “enthusiastic” about the Lawrence Kasdan-penned screenplay and excited to work with director Spielberg — but he also couldn’t have imagined that he’d be donning Indy’s famed fedora and cracking that signature whip for four decades. After Raiders became an instant classic in ’81, there have been four sequels: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), and this week’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which marks Ford’s swan song in the series.
“As far as I knew, it was a one-off,” Ford says now about Raiders. “I mean, I didn’t really have my head around anything but that job at work right there. I never thought of continuing on to make a four films over 42 years now. But the opportunity came because the films were so satisfying for an audience, and they were made with such skill and ambition, and so I was delighted to be along for the ride.”
Set primarily in 1969, Dial of Destiny finds Indy on the brink of retiring from his day job as a college professor when he’s lured back into action by his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). She’s in a race against an ex-Nazi scientist (Mads Mikkelsen’s Jürgen Voller) to recover the mythical Archimedes Dial, a device thought to be capable of time travel.

“One thing I asked for in each of them was to further embrace a complication of the character,” Ford says of his evolution as Indy. “I wanted to know more about Indiana Jones. I wanted the things that he did to be generated out of his character, out of his nature, out of his experience. I didn’t want it just to be pinned on like a merit badge.
“I wanted these films to inspire people, to make them laugh, to make them cry. And so for me it’s been just an unbelievable experience to have this opportunity. And the last one, I wanted to be about character. I wanted it to be about what it's like to be an older archeologist.”
Dial of Destiny is written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, David Koepp and James Mangold, the Oscar-nominated filmmaker behind Walk the Line, Logan and Ford v. Ferrari. Like seemingly every other major director who came of age with 1980s movies, Mangold was deeply influenced by Raiders, particularly for its boldness.
“There’s so many risks in that movie,” he says of the original film. “It’s such a wild anachronism. It’s screwball, it’s kind of comedic. It’s about an archeologist who carries a whip, who is brilliant, but also scared of snakes, who can take on action, but kind of gets freaked out in social environments. It’s such a bunch of contradictions that no one would go, ‘That smells like a hit, George.’ It’s such an amalgam of wonderfully eccentric things that, in the alchemy of [Ford] in the role and [Spielberg] directing and Larry Kasdan writing and George producing and guiding, something happened, which was bigger than the sum of the parts.
“And that thing is something that can instruct all of us who make movies now. And for me, there was the opportunity to be part of this world and try to understand that alchemy. But it’s also an inspiration for the projects I do beyond the world of this franchise, which is that you can take these swings. They don’t have to always make sense by the standard rules of the day of what a hero is or what a protagonist does.”
One thing’s for sure about the Indiana Jones franchise. There are few 80-year-old action stars out there that can still do what Harrison Ford — or “the bionic man,” as franchise producer and Lucasfilm President Kathryn Kennedy called him — does in Dial of Destiny.

“Harrison said to me quite early on, he was like, ‘You are just doing all the [action] that I used to do ’cause I can’t do them anymore,’” Waller-Bridge recalls. “But then every time I was doing anything, Harrison was always there, on the wall next to me or in the boat [or] jumping out the plane. Like he did all the same stuff as me.
She adds laughing, “I was like, ‘This is not a passing of the baton. This is a war over it.’ He does not let go. It was amazing.”
Recalls Shaunette Renée Wilson, who plays a government agent caught in the middle of Jones’s battle with Voller: “He’d just be jumping on a horse and galloping away. … My mind was just like, ‘What is happening?’ It was like the Indiana Jones [of old].”
“Yeah, try to get off the floor with hands cuffed and not touch the ground,” adds Boyd Holbrook, who plays Klaber, Voller’s lead henchman. “Harrison’s got the body of a 40-year-old, it’s just bizarre. Unfortunate for me. Good for him.”
“Obviously his age has been mentioned a lot,” says Mikkelsen. “But I think we underplay the talent we’re dealing with. He’s just a tremendously talented person and you don’t think about [his age] one second when you’re working with him. He’s just a very talented man.”
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny opens Friday, June 30.

,Indiana Jones and the fedora boom,Indy’s latest caper proves a help to hatters | Business,"Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the <audio> element.
I n a summer crowded with blockbusters, Disney may sweat to recoup the $295m it reportedly spent making “Dial of Destiny”, the fifth and final Indiana Jones film, out on June 30th in America. But the movie is already a hit for a firm in another industry. Herbert Johnson, a 134-year-old London hatmaker, is fielding soaring demand for a certain fedora.
“It’s been just glorious,” says Michelle Poyer-Sleeman, the master hatter who designed the latest iteration of the Poet, the hat first donned by Harrison Ford in “Raiders of the Lost Ark” in 1981. The firm had to keep the product under its hat until a couple of weeks before the movie’s launch. But already the “Destiny Poet” has caused a seven-fold rise in Herbert Johnson’s revenue since June last year. A backlog of over 300 orders waits to be handmade in a workshop that hums with the sound of fans, steam and irons.
The boom marks a sharp turnaround for the firm. After the success of “Raiders” it provided Indy’s hats in the follow-ups, “Temple of Doom” (1984) and “Last Crusade” (1989). But a downturn in hat-wearing brought hard times. Venerable hatters such as Italy’s Borsalino went bust. Herbert Johnson was sold and for a while stopped making its hats in-house. For “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull”, Indy’s fourth adventure, in 2008, the producers went elsewhere.
After a rethink in 2016 the firm went back to handmaking and focused on the Poet, which today accounts for three-quarters of sales. The internet brought new customers, many of them American (and many women). Customers wait up to six months for their £495 ($630) rabbit-felt Poet, which comes with an optional “Raiders turn”, a 25-degree twist of the crown to match the jaunty angle at which Mr Ford wore his (supposedly to keep it on during stunts). The firm advises keeping it out of heavy rain and heat and to brush it only anticlockwise. Dr Jones would surely scoff.
Swaine, the 273-year-old luxury-goods firm that owns Herbert Johnson, hopes for success with other on-screen products. It sells a £520 umbrella of the sort twirled by Gene Kelly in “Singin’ in the Rain” and a £3,200 attaché case used by James Bond in “From Russia with Love” (minus the concealed knife). In March it opened a new flagship shop. Hat-wearing is making a comeback, says Ms Poyer-Sleeman, who spotted several clients at the “Dial of Destiny” premiere. There is also a “swing back to quality”, she says. People want something that will last, “and we’re in that niche.”■

,‘The Force has left Lucasfilm’: What has gone wrong for the studio behind ‘Star Wars’ and ‘Indiana Jones’—and how Disney’s Bob Iger can salvage his $4 billion investment,"""Dial of Destiny"" is one of the most expensive films ever made and initial reviews suggest it could bomb big at the box office, meaning the match made in heaven risks becoming an albatross around Disney’s neck.","Taking time out of his busy schedule running Disney, Bob Iger flew to the Cannes film festival in support of Harrison Ford’s latest movie, even posting on social media snapshots of the aging action hero on the red carpet.
Lucasfilm Ltd. had just premiered the fifth installment in its Indiana Jones franchise and a lot is riding on the fedora-sporting, bullwhip-toting archeologist portrayed by the now 80-year-old Hollywood star. At nearly $300 million, Dial of Destiny is one of the most expensive films ever made and initial reviews suggest it could bomb big at the box office when it lands on June 30.
When Iger acquired Lucasfilm for just over $4 billion a decade ago, it paired the century-old animation company with the studio behind Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet the match made in heaven now risks becoming an albatross around Disney’s neck.
The third Skywalker trilogy started off with a bang in late 2015 with The Force Awakens, only to end with a whimper four years later as fans deserted the franchise. The studio hadn’t produced a theatrical release of any kind since, allowing the Marvel Cinematic Universe—despite recent setbacks—to supplant it as Disney’s cash cow.
“The Force has left Lucasfilms,” said Eric Schiffer, CEO of private equity firm Patriarch Organization, in an interview. “That emotional connection it enjoyed with fans has been damaged.”
The Los Angeles-based media industry investor and self-admitted Star Wars fan still counts the deal a success for Iger, but he believes it got lost producing too much subpar content for Disney.

At Disney, less is now more
“To get the Force back, Lucasfilm needs to reconnect with its Joseph Campbell roots—the inner set of mythologies we’re all hardwired to that motivated Lucas to create Star Wars in the first place,” said Schiffer.
He argues the constant hunger to feed the streaming business with fresh material helped sow the seeds for the current malaise.
Even as The Mandalorian—“the series that started it all for Disney+” in Iger’s words—helped the CEO attract subscribers and catch up quickly to Netflix, it came at a cost of stretching the Star Wars brand beyond recognition.
Story continues
Now that growth has faltered, with 4 million customers canceling their membership in the three months through March, and Wall Street is pushing Iger to end the scattergun approach of showering creators with money for new content. Instead, investors want him to end the over $10 billion in cumulative streaming losses since the launch of Disney+ three and a half years ago.
The idea that less is often more could apply to Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones films, which enjoyed their heyday in the 1980s. Fans were largely satisfied when the titular character finished on a high note, literally riding off into the sunset at the end of the third film.
And so, when Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls was released fifteen years ago, the spectacle of seeing an aging Ford emerge unscathed from a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator left no one asking for more.
But they will get a sequel nonetheless when Dial of Destiny swings into theaters a full 42 years after the first installment. Factoring in marketing and distribution costs, including the cinemas’ cut of receipts, it will likely have to pull in around $800 million at the box office just to break even.
Franchises cannot be measured in box office receipts alone
Iger didn’t come out of retirement in November just to watch his prize possessions wither on the vine. The board expects him to right the ship, breathe life back into the dormant stock and resume paying a cash dividend to shareholders.
To do so, he’ll need to churn out family-friendly fare full of iconic characters and thrilling settings capable of being repurposed into immersive experiences for his amusement parks.
“The value of intellectual property cannot be measured simply in a franchise’s box office receipts,” said Guy Bisson, co-founder of the media industry research firm Ampere Analysis. “You need to take into account its contribution in streaming, in merchandising, in the characters and rides at parks.”
For example, Disney finance chief Christine McCarthy explained to investors something seemingly mundane as refreshments can squeeze more revenue out of each Disney World visitor if they can be turned into a Star Wars-themed experience.
But Lucasfilm, which did not respond to Fortune’s requests for comment, knows it is running out of excuses now that a movie based on a Nintendo video game proved you can still rake in over $1 billion post-pandemic as long as you have the right concept.
For this very reason, Iger notably started off his fiscal Q2 earnings call this month by congratulating Universal for the success of Super Mario Bros: “It gives us reason to be optimistic about the movie business.”
Lucasfilm's first return to the theatres in years opens to poor reviews
The pressure on Dial of Destiny to perform for the Disney CEO became apparent through a telling exchange at Cannes, which he was attending for the first time.
Film critic Pete Hammond recounted Iger’s reaction when informed Deadline just published a rave review of the fifth Indiana Jones movie: “You could see the absolute relief on his face. ‘You have made me very happy to hear that,’ he told me, and he meant it.”.
That’s probably because first impressions have otherwise been dreadful, with a franchise-low 50% score on Rotten Tomatoes as of writing. Vanity Fair proclaimed it “not worthy of the whip”, while the BBC felt Ford’s globe-trotting adventurer had been relegated to a background figure in his own film, included mainly for the purpose of being upstaged by younger co-star Phoebe Waller-Bridge.
“I’m not sure how many fans want to see Indiana Jones as a broken, helpless old man who cowers in the corner while his patronizing goddaughter takes the lead, but that’s what we’re given, and it’s as bleak as it sounds,” the BBC wrote, branding it a “gloomy and depressing” final act.
With Disney needing to shell out $9 billion at least to buy Comcast out of Hulu as early as next year, the last thing Iger needs is bad word of mouth building over the next four weeks to asphyxiate any hopes of blockbuster success.
Right now, though, grim news is all that Lucasfilm has to offer the Disney CEO. An attempt to expand on the lore of its 1988 fantasy tale Willow flopped hard when the series debuted on Disney+ in November.
Not only was it canceled after the first of three seasons, but the show was banished entirely from the platform as part of a thorough spring cleaning. Critics argued Willow in retrospect would have been more valuable to Disney as a tax write-off than as actual content for subscribers.
Fans desert Disney Star Wars
At the heart of this mess is Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. A member of Fortune’s 2015 class of Most Powerful Women, the youthful 69-year-old is an accomplished industry veteran in her own right, producing dozens of classic feature films including Jurassic Park and E.T.: the Extra-Terrestrial.
Yet even being George Lucas’ hand-picked successor has not shielded her from hefty criticism. A number of fans begrudge her along with Last Jedi writer-director Rian Johnson for deconstructing Luke Skywalker in the third trilogy.
Actor Mark Hamill distanced himself from the creative choices Johnson and Kennedy took with his iconic character in a rare industry rebuke.

Antagonized by the perceived shabby treatment of their childhood heroes, fewer and fewer fans showed up from one movie to the next. The third and final installment, Rise of Skywalker, only took in half of the $2 billion that premiere film The Force Awakens made for Disney.
It’s perhaps no wonder that the company’s $5,000-per-package Star Wars-themed hotel, the “Galactic Starcruiser”, is shutting down. The tactical mistake of placing it in the timeline of the Disney sequel trilogy doomed it to a lifespan of just 18 months after opening.
Those wealthy enough to fork over thousands of dollars just to role-play their heroes tend to be middle-aged fans of the original films who want to do battle against the sinister Darth Vader they remember as kids, not the bland and forgettable Kylo Ren.
Could Kennedy go?
Following the disappointment of 2019’s The Rise of Skywalker, no further theatrical films got off the ground despite past proclamations.
Numerous Hollywood creatives like Lost’s Damon Lindelof, Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins and Thor: Ragnarok’s Taika Waititi were all reportedly attached to new Star Wars projects—to no avail. As a result, the Star Wars universe has only lived on in Disney’s streaming platform with mixed critical success.
Because of the drop-off in interest, Iger and his studio boss Alan Bergman are now in a difficult position. The Disney CEO has not spared high-ranking figures like Marvel’s Ike Perlmutter or Victoria Alonso from the axe, and he has demanded results from his teams in exchange for greater creative control.
""There needs to be a direct connection between what’s being spent and what’s being earned from a revenue perspective. It’s all about accountability,"" Iger said in March.
Older Star Wars fans want to see Kennedy go in favor of someone like Jon Favreau, the Iron Man director and creator of The Mandalorian. Allegedly negotiations over whether to renew her contract, due to expire next year, are slated for this August.
“My bet is she stays, just with a different mission,” wagers Schiffer. “The problem isn’t Kathleen Kennedy.”
Everything can be fixed with the right script
If Indiana Jones does flop, what then? Disney is 18 months away from getting a new CEO. Could Iger’s successor, unwilling to mop up his Lucasfilm mess, consider a disposal?
Unlikely, argues Ampere Analysis’ Bisson. Ingenious storytellers can always dream up more compelling Star Wars content—so long as they own the IP.
“I cannot personally see Disney offloading Lucasfilm in the immediate future,” the industry expert told Fortune.
Perhaps sensing the need to deliver after a long creative drought, Kennedy announced in April that not one but three new Star Wars films were in the works.
Yet even those show the Lucasfilm boss is unwilling to commit to any one overarching narrative in favor of spreading her bets. The trio are conceived as separate standalone stories each set in a different period.
Should any one or all three survive development and go into actual production, the damage can still be fixed with the right script and creative vision.
“This is not forever. If another film turned out to be good, the fans will be there,” said Schiffer. “In fact, we’d be there first.”

,"'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' PEOPLE REVIEW: Indy's Last Hurrah Starts Slow, Finishes Strong","Read PEOPLE's review for 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,' starring Harrison Ford and Phoebe Waller-Bridge","Admirably stoic and unfussy, Harrison Ford has played Indiana Jones for more than 40 years—running, riding, jumping and tumbling this way and that, up and down as the physically challenging role demanded. If he hadn’t been a Hollywood star he could have been a battle-scarred Norse legend—Beowulf with a fedora.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the fifth and final film in this astonishingly successful franchise, starts with a long, clunky and somewhat dull prologue that’s also a bit of a bait-and-switch. We’re back in World War II Europe: Young Indy (Ford, de-aged with great skill) has been captured by the Nazis and foiled in his attempt to keep Hitler from getting hold of a legendary artifact, the Lance of Longinus. But there’s a second object of antiquity in play, a device that could upend world history (no one in an Indiana Jones movie is ever itching to discover something as insignificant as a painting from Picasso’s lost ""purple"" phase). Created by the Greek mathematician Archimedes, this mythical doohickey is a dial with wheels as meticulously engineered as those in a modern watch. It would have required an enormous Swatch band!
At any rate, Indy escapes, and the dial becomes the engine of a 2 hour, 20-plus minute film that alternately ambles and races to its conclusion, with John Williams’s brassy theme blaring out from time to time like a strategically administered dose of Viagra.
The story jumps forward to 1969. Indie is now more rumpled and taciturn than ever, living in a messy, ugly Manhattan apartment that could have been rented to Richard Dreyfuss in an old Neil Simon rom-com. He’s still having to contend with that Greek thingie: His goddaughter Helena (Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge) wants to find it and make a fortune. So off they go!
Waller-Bridge and Ford. Jonathan Olley / Lucasfilm Ltd.
Waller-Bridge is a brilliant talent, but she’s wrong here — she lacks the right cynical brassiness. It’s like casting Emma Thompson when you need Barbara Stanwyck. Okay, sure, that actress died in 1990, but who’s to say that digital magic and Archimedes’ genius couldn’t resurrect her? Meanwhile, the movie squanders Antonio Banderas in a tiny role and under-utilizes Mads Mikkelsen in a bigger one: Voller, Indy’s Nazi rival for the disc. Then again, Mikkelsen doesn’t necessarily have the hammy vitality to capitalize on a role like this. His performances tend to be immaculately precise, as if the emotions were measured by pipette.
The movie delivers some satisfying if unsurprising action sequences — the customary boobytrapped tomb — before suddenly springing to thrilling life in its concluding third. There have been grumblings online that this final twist, which is both crazy and inspired, isn't too far off from shark-jumping, but that’s scarcely fair: Let's not forget that Raiders of the Lost Ark reconfigured the Ark of the Covenant as a nuclear device.
Even as time itself spins on its invisible axis, Ford always seems completely sane. That may have been key to this whole franchise. Imagine if it had starred Jack Nicholson.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is now playing in theaters.

2023-06-21 21:16:26+00:00,"Disney ""Panics"" Over New 'Indiana Jones' Film as Worst Nightmare Unfolds - Inside the Magic","Disney and Lucasfilm are reportedly in a ""panic"" as the Harrsion Ford film, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny', is about to be released.","Things are not looking promising for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023).
The beloved Lucasfilm franchise is just a matter of days away from releasing its final installment. The franchise currently boasts four movies, which include Raiders of the Lost Ark(1981), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008).
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which was released more than 15 years ago, received terrible ratings from critics and audiences alike. The movie, which starred Harrison Ford reprising his role as Dr. Henry Jones Jr. for the first time in nearly 20 years alongside Shia LaBeouf (Mutt Williams) was okay at the box office but was horribly rated. Though the film brought in $790.7 million at the box office, it received just a 53% approval rating from audiences and a 77% rating from critics, which is actually surprisingly high considering the reviews that were released following the film’s release.
Now, Disney and Lucasfilm have joined forces to produce Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which is set to be released on June 30, 2023. The film debuted at the 76th Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2023, and has been quite a controversial topic since well before then.
Disney was originally planning a spinoff series for Indiana Jones that could have starred the likes of Phoebe Waller-Bridge taking over the lead role in the place of Harrison Ford. However, after much backlash, the series was reportedly canceled. If that weren’t enough, the new film has faced controversy for scenes that have been released, including a couple of moments that have opponents believing the movie will be part of Disney’s reported “woke agenda.”
Still, the film– which will be Harrison Ford’s swansong in the role with Waller-Bridge and Mads Mikkelsen (Jurgen Voller) playing his key supporting roles– is barrelling into its debut weekend, where it’s expected to earn big.
However, Disney’s biggest nightmare might be upon them. Reviews continue to come in for the movie and early screeners for the film several months ago reportedly had the company “in a panic” after hearing feedback. Now, it seems that the fears that the film might be a “bust” could be walking straight into reality. With Rotten Tomatoes showing a 77% rating from critics for the Shia LaBeouf Indiana Jones film, you might be surprised to know that critics hate this upcoming movie even more. With 93 reviews, Rotten Tomatoes shows an abysmal 58% approval rating, which is noticeably low.
A review from Express shared that the film “should’ve stayed buried.” Though the review shared that James Mangold did an excellent job stepping in for Steven Spielberg as the director of the film, the publication said that they did not think this is how Harrison Ford’s character should ride off into the sunset.
“If we never see Ford as Indy again, it’ll be a crying shame, because frankly his story is not finished just yet,” they said.
Several other reviews from critics have noted many of the same feelings toward the ending of the film.

2023-06-15 18:26:16+00:00,Mads Mikkelsen On The Possibility Of Returning To ‘Hannibal’ & Going Up Against Indiana Jones In ‘The Dial Of Destiny’,"Mads Mikkelsen hasn't ruled out reprising his role as Hannibal Lecter, he told Deadline","Mads Mikkelsen attends the Los Angeles Premiere of LucasFilms' ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny""

Could Mads Mikkelsen ever reprise his role as Hannibal Lecter? Don’t count out the possibility just yet.

“There’s always a chance. It’s all about finding a home for it,” Mikkelsen told Deadline of returning for more seasons of the crime drama Hannibal, on which he played the infamous serial killer for three seasons.

During the Los Angeles premiere for Indiana Jones & The Dial of Destiny, Mikkelsen explained that it’s all about the timing.

“Of course, we’re running out of time. We can’t wait 20 years, but in the next couple of years, if somebody finds a home, I think we are all ready to take it up again,” he said.

Audiences are well aware by now that Mikkelsen excels at playing the bad guy on screen. He wouldn’t give much away about his character in the new Indiana Jones flick, other than to say “he’s after a certain item, that unfortunately Harrison Ford is after as well. So, we will clash eventually.”

In the film, he plays former Nazi turned scientist and mathematician Jürgen Voller. As for where he is on the adversary scale against Indy, Mikkelsen says Voller is “a badass,” but he doesn’t think his character would consider himself to be “a baddie.”

“Nobody starts out in the morning saying, ‘I’m going to be the baddie.’ They see themselves as good people in their own world,” he said.

Well, it looks like director James Mangold thinks Voller is pretty bad, and Mikkelsen was the perfect person for the role. While introducing the film, Mangold told the audience on Wednesday night that Mikkelsen’s skills as a villain are apparent on screen.

“They always ask him why he likes playing bad guys but I think you’ll see the answer on the screen — because he is damn good at it,” he said.

2023-06-30 10:00:01+00:00,"Indiana Jones hits theaters for one last adventure, but box office prospects look shaky","Box office analysts predict Disney's ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" will open to between $60 million and $65 million at the domestic box office.","It's Harrison Ford's final bow as the boulder-dodging, whip-wielding, Nazi-punching Indiana Jones.

On Friday, ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" arrives in theaters, marking the fifth and likely final chapter in the Lucasfilm movie franchise.

Disney spared no expense in bringing the film to the big screen, starting with a nearly $300 million production budget. Factor in marketing costs, which are typically equal to half the production budget, and a swanky premiere and after-party at the Cannes Film Festival, and ""Dial of Destiny"" has quite a hole to dig itself out of.

Box office analysts are predicting the film will capture between $60 million and $65 million during its first three days in theaters and around $90 million for the five-day holiday weekend. That would mark the latest mediocre opening in the summer blockbuster season, following disappointing bows for ""The Flash,"" ""Elemental"" and ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" earlier this month.

It would also fall well short of the $100 million ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" secured during its first three days in theaters in 2008. Previous Indiana Jones installments, released in the 1980s, saw significantly lower box office openings because tickets were significantly less expensive at that time and the films were released in fewer theaters.

For instance, ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was released in more than 4,200 theaters, while 1989's ""The Last Crusade"" was released in 2,300 cinemas, according to Comscore data. In 2023, blockbuster features are generally opening in 4,200 locations, with some films, such as Marvel's ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3,"" opening in as many as 4,450 locations.

""Dial of Destiny"" also marks the first time Steven Spielberg hasn't directed an Indy movie, although the musical score was written by franchise stalwart John Williams. James Mangold, who helmed ""Logan"" and ""Ford v Ferrari,"" directed the new one.

The sequel comes 15 years after the ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" which ended up with a 77% ""Fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes but was widely panned by audiences. Despite a solid opening, the fourth Indiana Jones film tallied only $317 million domestically. It did manage to reach $786 million globally, according to data from Comscore.

The lackluster audience response resulted in a pause in future films, including the potential for a spinoff featuring Shia LaBeouf as Indiana Jones' son Mutt Williams. In 2012, Disney bought Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion, eventually taking the franchise away from its previous studio partner Paramount Pictures. Disney kept the character on ice while it worked on new Star Wars and Willow content — two other franchises that came from Lucasfilm.

Now, in 2023, the fifth installment in the swashbuckling archaeologist's movie adventures has generated a 67% ""Fresh"" score as of Friday morning, with critics saying ""Dial of Destiny"" doesn't quite capture the thrill of earlier adventures. Still, with Ford donning his iconic hat and whip combo, the film gives audiences a nostalgic rush, according to the critical consensus.

It's unclear whether that will result in a ton of ticket sales, however.

""The target audience of men over 35, who grew up on the entire series, will need to show up with their families and, perhaps, introduce the iconic character to their little ones who weren't even around for the previous movie,"" said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. ""The franchise has overcome stalled pop culture relevance before, but this time it also has to face that added challenge of winning back viewers who weren't as keen on 'Crystal Skull' as they were for the original films.""

Hollywood has had mixed results with nostalgia plays in recent years. While ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" and ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" captured healthy box office sales, others have floundered on the big screen. ""Blade Runner 2049,"" ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" and ""Terminator Genisys"" came up short with old fans and new audiences in North America.

""Dial of Destiny"" could benefit from audiences keen to see Ford, who will turn 81 next month, hang up his fedora and potentially even pass off the torch to a new generation.

Even with tepid reviews heading into Friday's release, Robbins notes that critics and audiences don't always agree.

""Indiana Jones' nature as a traditionally less front-loaded franchise compared to the comic book blockbusters we're used to seeing play with a short fuse also means a sizable portion of its audience could opt to see the film after the initial fan-driven previews and opening day,"" he said.

She dialed it back to 1999.

Calista Flockhart rewore a stunning skirt from more than two decades ago while supporting her husband, Harrison Ford, at the Los Angeles premiere of “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” on Wednesday.

The “Ally McBeal” alum, 58, walked the red carpet in the same floor-sweeping Ralph Lauren style she wore to the 1999 Emmy Awards, according to her stylist, Elizabeth Stewart.

“Cherish and rewear your clothes people! 😉😊💛💛💛💛💛💛💛 (and yes we’ve worked together that long!)” the red carpet stylist wrote on Instagram on Wednesday.

That year, Flockhart received an Emmy nomination for “Outstanding Lead Actress In A Comedy Series” for her role in “Ally McBeal.”

While Flockhart paired the skirt with a casual white blouse tied at the waist 24 years ago, she opted for a chic off-the-shoulder black top this time around. The actress then finished her look with silver hoop earrings and black heels.

Meanwhile, the “Indiana Jones” stud, 80, dressed in a navy suit layered over a blue-and-white striped collared shirt.

Ford and Flockhart looked smitten as they held hands at the premiere, which happened to be held the evening before their 13th wedding anniversary.

The loved-up couple kept close as they posed together and beamed for the shutterbugs.

He also posed with his co-star Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who stunned in a sexy cutout blazer and matching pants by Alexander McQueen.

Ford and Flockhart got married on June 15, 2010 in New Mexico, where Ford was filming “Cowboys and Aliens” at the time.

And the lovebirds clearly still have the hots for each other more than a decade later. Last month, Ford was snapped checking out his wife ahead of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.

While attending the star-studded French film event, Ford revealed how he still finds himself to be quite appealing as well. The Hollywood hunk playfully shared that he was “blessed with this body” after a journalist called him “hot.”

Flockhart adopted her 22-year-old son Liam in 2001, a year before meeting Ford at the Golden Globe Awards. After the pair tied the knot nine years later, Ford adopted Liam as his own.

Their son is rarely seen in public, though the couple was photographed attending his graduation from Amherst College in May.

Ford also has four other children. He and his first ex-wife, Mary Marquardt, share sons Benjamin, 55, and Willard, 54. Ford also shares his only daughter, Georgia, 32, and son Malcolm, 35, with his second ex-wife, Melissa Mathison.

Just weeks ago, two stunt performers from Walt Disney World got the chance to attend the Hollywood red carpet premiere and meet with Harrison Ford.

You could say that Kevin Brassard and Michele Waitman both have a rich history with the famed archaeologist and adventurer.

[TRENDING: Become a News 6 Insider]

Brassard originated the role of Indiana Jones more than three decades ago at the Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular! at Disney’s Hollywood Studios.

Brassard, who is originally from San Diego auditioned for Disney Live Entertainment in 1987. Following a two-year stint at the Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue at Disney’s Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground, Brassard was asked to audition for a role that went under the name “Jack.”

“I didn’t know anything about it except that it was a huge secret that was being kept,” Brassard explained. “I auditioned and didn’t think anything of it. About three months later, I got a call from casting asking if I would like to be Indiana Jones and I said, ‘I never auditioned for Indiana Jones,’ and they said, ‘Yes, you did, you just didn’t know it.”

Just six months after Brassard started practicing for the show, Waitman joined as Marion, the “Raiders of the Lost Ark” character.

“One of the tumblers I was working with, he said, ‘You would be a great Marion,” Waitman said. “He got me into that audition which was the first year with Kevin. I had no clue what I was getting into, but it was 100% the best thing for me and my career.”

Waitman, an Orlando-native with a gymnastics background, said she knew nothing about the show when she started.

“We were taught by the best in the business! Glenn Randall, Larry Holt, Bob Yerkes who, at that time, were the foremost in the stunt world,” Kevin explained.

During the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular, stunt performers see thrilling moments as stunt performers safely throw and take punches, fall from tall buildings, and even wield whips in the midst of complex action sequences. The show has been a staple at Disney’s Hollywood Studios since the park opened in 1989.

“That opening day, it was just filled with magic! George Lucas, Michael Eisner - they were both there,” Brassard said. “We did scene one, and Michael Eisner and George Lucas came out after I got runover by the boulder just to see if I was OK.”

Throughout the past 34 years, Brassard and Waitman said they have come into contact with many people who have grown up with the show - some, even joining the stunt team to bring the show to life everyday for thousands of guests at the park. Michele said her own twin boys grew up watching the show - and are now a part of it to this day.

“We have a lot of fans that keep coming back,” Waitman said. “I have pictures of me holding a little baby and then the next thing you know they’re 18 years old.”

Brassard said his love for Indiana Jones began after his father took him to the movies to see the film on the big screen. Not long ago, Disney gave the Indy stunt performer a big surprise. One day when he was playing the role of “The Director” on the show, Disney announced he was going to the Hollywood red carpet premiere for the new film.

Disney said he could bring a plus one, and his wife recommended he take his good friend and colleague, Michele.

During the red carpet event, Brassard and Waitman got to meet with fans of the show and even talk with Indiana Jones himself – Harrison Ford.

“Meeting Harrison Ford - WOW - that was right up there with the birth of my children. He knew who we were,” Brassard said. “It was incredible, he was so nice and genuine and he was so grateful,” Waitman said.

Kevin and Michele said attending the premiere of “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” will always be an unforgettable experience, saying the movie was great.

Today, Kevin continues to play a key role as the comical “Director,” and as a trainer, passing the torch to all the Indiana Jones stunt performers who follow in his carefully choreographed footsteps. Meanwhile, Michele can still be seen playing and training other Marions on stage.

“Kevin and I have been using our experience, stunts and acting to train these new people coming on to be safe, how to keep the show fresh and give them the knowledge of everything we went through and keep it going. I say we keep it going for the next generations,” Waitman concluded.

The Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular! runs multiple times a day at Disney’s Hollywood Studios.

2023-07-04 13:43:45+10:00,Indiana Jones and the Hollywood experiment with AI de-ageing technology,"Actors used to just play characters of their own age when reprising earlier roles – but that is now changing, for better or worse.","By Ben McCann, University of Adelaide

Saddle up, don the fedora and crack that whip: Harrison Ford is back as the intrepid archaeologist in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. The film premiered at Cannes, where Ford was awarded an Honorary Palme d’Or in recognition of his life’s work.

Reviews for the fifth film in the franchise have been mixed, and it is the first Indy film not to be directed by Steven Spielberg (this time, it’s James Mangold, best known for his motor-racing drama Ford v Ferrari).

But this is ‘event’ cinema that combines nostalgia, old-school special effects and John Williams’ iconic score.

So, Ford is back, aged 80. What draws actors back after all this time?

Role returns

Ford first played Indy in 1981 and last played him in 2008. That is a full 15 years since the most recent film in the series, and 42 years since his first outing in Raiders of the Lost Ark.

Ford has form in returning to celebrated characters. One of the great pleasures of watching The Force Awakens back in 2015 was seeing Ford play Han Solo again for the first time in over 30 years.

Actors return to roles for numerous reasons:

financial (Ford was reportedly paid US$25 million for Dial of Destiny)

protection of their brand, image and star persona (Michael Keaton returning to play Batman after three decades and three other actors who have embodied the role)

professional (Tom Cruise admitted over the 36 years between Top Gun films he wanted to make sure the sequel could live up to the original)

personal (once-huge stars are working less and less, and only feel the need to return to a built-in fan base every few years – Bill Murray in the 2021 Ghostbusters sequel springs to mind).

It’s not always a successful endeavour.

Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone – two of the biggest action stars of the 1980s off the back of iconic roles as The Terminator, Rocky Balboa and John Rambo – have repeatedly returned to those roles, and critics have been particularly harsh.

It did not work for Sigourney Weaver in Alien: Resurrection in 1997, 18 years after her first time as Ripley; nor for Keanu Reeves in The Matrix Resurrections in 2021, 23 years after the original.

And still, I’m intrigued to see what Michael Mann could do with his long-rumoured sequel to Heat, his definitive 1995 crime film. Ever since Mann published his novel Heat 2 last year – a kind of origin story for Heat’s key protagonists – fans have been hoping a de-aged Al Pacino (now aged 83) might return as LA cop Vincent Hanna.

Undoing time

‘Digital de-ageing’ first entered the Hollywood mainstream in 2019 with The Irishman and Captain Marvel.

Via this process, older actors (Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Samuel L. Jackson have all been subject to the technology) move back and forwards in time without younger actors having to play them.

Films still tend to cast two actors to play older and younger versions of the same character, a choice that dates back at least to 1974’s The Godfather Part II, in which a young Robert de Niro plays Vito Corleone, portrayed by the much older Marlon Brando in the first film.

In 1989, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade features a delightful opening scene where River Phoenix plays the young version of Indiana Jones, before Ford takes over for the rest of the film.

Actors used to just play characters of their own age when reprising earlier roles. Paul Newman finally won a Best Actor Oscar for his role as ‘Fast Eddie’ Felson in The Color of Money (1986), a quarter of a century after first playing him in The Hustler.

The sequel plays on Newman’s age, and his role as a mentor to an upcoming Tom Cruise, and bathes viewers in nostalgia and memories of a younger Newman.

But actors no longer have to exclusively play their age.

The first part of Dial of Destiny is an extended flashback, set in 1944, in which Ford has been digitally de-aged to appear in his 40s. This process used an AI system that scanned used and unused reels of footage of Ford from the first three Indy films to match his present-day performance.

Here, it is as if we are getting two Fords for the price of one: the ‘younger’, fitter Indy and the older, more world-weary version. It makes for a powerfully emotional connection on screen.

Yet there are some pitfalls to de-ageing. Some viewers complain that the whole process is distracting and that the hyper-real visual look of de-aged scenes resembles a video game.

Even so, de-ageing in Hollywood cinema is here to stay. Tom Hanks’s next film is using AI-based generative technology to digitally de-age him.

Given its reduced cost, speed and reduced human input, AI-driven innovation might have industry-changing ramifications.

The star of Ford

Harrison Ford remains a bona fide ‘movie star’ in an industry profoundly buffeted by Covid, the rise of streaming platforms, the demise of the monoculture, and the changing nature of who constitutes a star.

In the midst of all this industry uncertainty, it seems there is no longer a statute of limitations on actors returning to much-loved characters.

The next big ethical issue for the film industry as it further embraces AI is whether to resurrect deceased actors and cast them in new movies.

Still, I’m looking forward to seeing more actors de-aged as the technology improves and audiences acclimatise to watching older actors ‘playing’ younger versions of themselves. We are only at the start of Hollywood’s next big adventure.

Harrison Ford Admits Lucasfilm Reworked Ending Of ‘Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny,’ Appears To Confirm Leaks James Mangold Previously Denied

Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in Lucasfilm's INDIANA JONES AND THE DIAL OF DESTINY. ©2023 Lucasfilm Ltd. & TM. All Rights Reserved.

Actor Harrison Ford, who reprises his role as Indiana Jones in the upcoming Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny film, recently admitted that Lucasfilm did indeed rework the ending to the film.

It was rumored back in June 2021 by YouTuber Overlord DVD that “Two endings are supposedly being considered in this script. I guess they’ve been written and they are going to shoot both of them. Both endings allegedly have old Indiana Jones dying at the end of this movie.”

“But in one of the rumored endings, young Indiana Jones dies alongside old Indiana Jones and Phoebe Waller-Bridge swoops in like a vulture, picks the hat up, and takes his place moving forward,” he adds.

A separate rumor from The Daily Mail in September 2021 claimed, “Phoebe Waller-Bridge is being tipped to replace the veteran actor as a female version of the fictional professor of archaeology in the adventure movie franchise.”

An anonymous source told The Daily Mail’s Showbusiness Editor Katie Hind about the rumor, “It would be a huge statement, and a great role for Phoebe.”

Another source stated, “The gossip on the set is that this character will slot into the leading role.”

Overlord DVD would follow-up his initial rumor claiming that the film actually had six endings in November, “We’ve been told out of the six endings they tested the best one gets a 35% approval from test audiences.”

“We’ve been told that Bridge put the hat on in every ending,” he added.

Overlord DVD then clarified, “All my spies actually said was Phoebe Waller-Bridge puts on Indy’s hat, takes Indy’s whip, and in a brave and stunning display of girl power she becomes the besest Indy evar at the end of all six version of the movie.”

Mangold denied the rumors of Indiana Jones being replaced writing on Twitter in December, “One more time. No one is ‘taking over’ or replacing Indy or donning his hat nor is he being ‘erased’ thru some contrivance— and he never was, not not in any cut or script — but trolls will troll — that’s how they get their clicks.”

He added, “And please don’t exhaust me pointing out how once in a while a troll is ‘right’. Even a blind squirrel finds a nut now & then. All one has to do is look at set photos & interviews & u get enough info to make wild guesses about a movie plot.”

“The diff between trolling a-holes & everyone else is they r trying to make $ off your feelings about other films & culture war politics. They push contoversial guesses as coming from “sources” to gin up clicks. Let it go. END,” he concluded.

Mangold’s denial of the rumors was previously called into question when the film’s composer John Williams revealed that Mangold and Lucasfilm planned to film a different ending.

Williams said, “Here are three pieces from Indiana Jones 5. I felt we would be finished with Indiana Jones after four. You know Harrison Ford. You all know who Harrison Ford is. And Harrison is 78 years old, but he’s much younger than am. Well, I thought, ‘Aw if he can do five of them, I have to try to do the final five also.”

He then states, “So, we have just about completed the film. We have maybe another ending to shoot and to record. Maybe in a couple weeks.”

Last night, John Williams told his audience that they are shooting a new ending to Indiana Jones V in a couple weeks. Thanks to @doomcock for the find. Added captions for you.@wdwpro1 @ValliantRenegad pic.twitter.com/FZUOpjOpX7 — Jonas J. Campbell (@JonasJCampbell) December 14, 2022

RELATED: ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Director James Mangold Claims Composer John Williams Is “Mistaken” About New Ending To Film, But Then Claims “He’s Fully Informed”

Mangold attempted to refute Williams’ comments writing on Twitter, “John was mistaken. Maybe read Twitter too much.”

He then declared, “We’re not shooting new endings. Never did. The film is 99% finished & being rated by MPAA.”

Mangold concluded, “This imagined zany ending w/ Indy being erased & replaced is a fever dream of wounded folks angry about other films I did not make.”

When asked for clarification on Williams’ comments, Mangold answered, “Joking, mistaken or misinformed. Not happening.”

However, when further pressed on the issue, Mangold claimed Williams was “fully informed” just after claiming he was either “joking, mistaken, or misinformed.” He tweeted, “I agree that he’s one of the greatest composers in the history of film. And also one of the most lovely people on earth. And he’s fully informed.”

It now appears that it was Mangold who was mistaken or he was intentionally trying to mislead people.

Actor Harrison Ford admitted to Spanish-language outlet Espinof, “We did a little work on the ending, which is the last thing I shot with Karen Allen, who has been in a substantial part of the whole thing, but appears in this story only briefly, at the end, but with a very strong, emotional hook. I felt nostalgia, a sense of accomplishment. I’m proud of the film, happy with the film.”

“Every good thing, you know, there comes a right time to go on to something else. I really enjoyed the process of making this film. I’m very happy with it. So I left the set that day content,” Ford concluded.

RELATED: Harrison Ford Admits Indiana Jones Is “Not So Strong, Not So Brave, Not So Attentive” In ‘Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny’

In a video on WDW Pro’s channel, Midnight’s Edge founder Andre Einherjar reacted to Ford’s comments and noted that fans need to hold Mangold accountable for disparaging them.

He said, “Hold him accountable for it. Retweet his earlier statements and don’t let him get away with it. Simple as that. Now of course, no one should do anything more than that. When you blatantly lied and you have unfairly maligned and attacked your own audience and you were lying in doing so then I see no problem with reminding them of that fact especially when the movie fails as it is going to.”

WDW Pro added, “Matt Kadish and Doomcock, they deserve apologies at this point. They reported correctly.”

It’s unclear what the exact ending for the film will be, but an alleged leaked ending by Reddit user LunekJones claims that Indiana Jones, Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Helena, and Mads Mikkelsen’s Doctor Jürgen Voller end up in in the distant past during the Roman siege of Syracuse. Voller and his compatriots end up dying in a plane crash over the battle while Indiana Jones and Helena are able to escape.

Upon landing they encounter Archimedes who retrieves the Dial of Destiny from Voller’s corpse and ensures that it can only be used to travel back in time to him in Syracuse during the siege. He also takes possession of one of Voller’s watches that gives him knowledge of the device.

LunekJones explains, ““As Helena tells him that Archimedes has ‘rigged’ the dial, in making sure it only sends back to Syracuse on the day of the siege so that they could save him, we understand it’s thanks to this jump in time that he found his knowledge about watches and on how to complete the dial.”

RELATED: Alleged ‘Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny’ Plot Leak Claims Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Character Makes The Heroic Choice To Knock Out Indiana Jones To Protect History

From there, LunekJones details that Indiana Jones does not want to return to his present, but would rather stay in Syracuse because he believes there is “nothing for him in 1969.” In contrast, Helena attempts to convince Indy to return to the present believing if he stays in the past “he would change the course of history.”

Indy apparently is unconvinced by Helena’s arguments so she resorts to punching him and knocking him out.

When Indy awakes he’s back in 1969 in New York City in his bed. He then “reproaches [Helena for] having brought him back to the present although there is nothing for him there.”

However, Helena counters that there is something for him to continue living for and Marion shows up in his apartment with a number of groceries. The film earlier made it clear that Marion and he were either divorced or on the brink of divorce as divorce papers were pinned to Indy’s fridge held up by a picture of Marion.

The two eventually appear to reconcile whatever contrived issues the film gives them to have them embrace in a kiss with the plot synopsis explaining “they re-enact the boat scene from Raiders in reverse before Indy kisses her.”

Finally, the film reportedly ends with a shot of Indiana Jones’ hat on a drying line outside the apartment with what appears to be Jones’ hand eventually grabbing it off the line as the camera zooms onto the hat in a small circle similar to old Warner Bros. cartoons.

LunekJones details, “The screen reduces into a small circle like in the Tom & Jerry cartoons, circling the hat and appearing to end there… just before we see Indy’s hand (can’t be sure 100% sure it was his now that I think back about it but it makes sense that it was) getting the hat back inside. The end !!”

What do you make of Ford appearing to confirm the rumors that they reshot or reworked the ending of the film?

Given the critic scores for previous films in the franchise (93% for Raiders of the Lost Ark, 84% for Last Crusade, 77% for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and 76% for Temple of Doom), this makes it the lowest Tomatometer rating of the series to date by a large margin.

The recently released Sound of Freedom film starring Jim Caviezel defeated Lucasfilm and The Walt Disney Company’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny at the box office on Independence Day.

As reported by The-Numbers the Angel Studios distributed Sound of Freedom was the top film at the box office on July 4, the day that the film released. It grossed $14.2 million while in 2,634 theaters. The film grossed an average of $5,407 per theater.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny came in second with a daily gross of $11.6 million while being in 4,600 theaters. The film only grossed $2,543 per theater.

Rounding out the top five were Elemental, which grossed $2.7 million, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse grossed $2.6 million and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts grossed $1.6 million.

The box office haul comes after Angel Studios co-founder Jeffrey Harmon indicated numerous potential moviegoers were actually being turned away from theaters because showings were sold out.

He tweeted yesterday night, “Sound of Freedom and Angel Studios are in a full on theatrical dogfight this week for additional showtimes and larger auditoriums against the biggest studios in the world. We are having sellouts nationwide, but so many are being turned away because there are no seats left.”

Harmon added, “This was exactly the strategy. But it’s a miracle it’s actually working. The only way for an startup studio to enter theatrical on the 4th of July is by brute force. Our team has voluntarily put in calculable hours because they can sense this can rescue many children. It’s an honor to get a small part of such a significant movement.”

In a follow-up he elaborated, “A couple of weeks ago one of my co-workers did a 100+ hr work week. I called and asked him how he was holding up. He said, “I know this isn’t good for my longterm health, but I just keep thinking if I can move the needle a little more, maybe I can save another child.'”

“It makes my heart take courage to see so much self sacrifice for these kids. To see celebrities, and influencers, and businesses, and families stepping up to take beatings on social media for angel and sound of freedom. It’s astonishing and miraculous to see this wave of support,” Harmon concluded.

In a press release celebrating the box office achievement, Angel Studios CEO Neal Harmon stated, “Thanks to fans around the country, SOUND OF FREEDOM earned the top spot as America’s number one movie on Independence Day. We’ve received numerous messages telling us theaters are either packed or sold out. This movie has now taken on a life of its own to become something more than that, a grassroots movement.”

He also remarked, “With an A+ CinemaScore rating, we’re the top-rated movie in America, and we’re going to see word-of-mouth spread even further going into the weekend. The world needs to see SOUND OF FREEDOM, and we know that our biggest competitive advantage—our incredible fans and investors—are going to make sure that happens.”

The company noted that they grossed $11.5 million directly through the box office and added another $2.6 million through their Pay It Forward ticket campaign for a total of $14.2 million.

The press release explains the Pay It Forward technology “empowers moviegoers to purchase tickets for other people whom they want to see a particular film.”

Ironically, Sound of Freedom defeating Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny comes after Angel Studios President Jordan Harmon remarked that Disney shelved the film after they acquired the rights when they purchased Fox.

He said, “Fox was originally going to distribute it. Then Disney buys Fox and for whatever reason Disney shelves it.”

“And it took you, and your team, and Eduardo a year to basically get the rights back,” he remarked to the film’s director Alejandro Monteverde.

Harmon would later clarify these comments in an email communication to Bounding Into Comics telling us, “To clarify my earlier comment, Disney didn’t distribute Sound of Freedom for reasons unknown to us. We are grateful to be the distributor for this important film.”

Following Harmon’s comments, the film’s star Jim Caviezel, who plays former DHS agent Tim Ballard, noted the film lost all of its funding due to Disney’s purchase of Fox.

He told Drew Mariania on The Drew Mariani Show, “At one point we lost all of our money because Fox got bought out by Disney. So Disney is holding the purse strings here. We lose the film. Eddie goes out and gets us $5 million bucks and saves the movie.”

“You weren’t supposed to see this. This is a movie they do not want you to see,” Caviezel asserted. “And we are fastly selling out our theaters right now and we need the people to call to get more theaters.”

While the film beat Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, it is unlikely it will best The Walt Disney Company’s domestic box office for the film. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny had an opening weekend of $60 million and has since gone on to earn a total of $83.8 million at the domestic box office. Overall the film has globally grossed $153.4 million.

Sound of Freedom is the highest grossing film from Angel Studios. It best the distributors first release earlier this year His Only Son. That film grossed $12 million over the course of 17 days at the box office in the beginning of April.

What do you make of Sound of Freedom besting Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny at the box office on Independence Day?

2023-07-13 15:00:49+00:00,Oscars: Will Harrison Ford get a farewell hug for playing Indiana Jones?,"Harrison Ford lost the 1985 Best Actor Oscar race for ""Witness"" to William Hurt (""Kiss of the Spider Woman"").","Harrison Ford is a legend. Indiana Jones is a legend. But despite the marriage between actor and character generating a legacy spanning five movies, multiple generations, billions of dollars, and the hearts of so many, the combination has never produced an Oscar nomination.

Ford himself has only ever been nominated for one Academy Award. That was for “Witness” all the way back in 1986 when Ford was nominated for playing a detective protecting an Amish eyewitness in Amish country. He lost that year to William Hurt, who won for “Kiss of the Spider Woman.” However, the real tragedy is that Ford wasn’t nominated for any of his performances as Indiana Jones. Sure, those aren’t the type of movies to land Best Actor bids, and hindsight is 20/20 of course, but when an actor with such star power comes along to play a character with such charisma, you have to sit up and take note of the talent it takes to pull that off.

How many actors could pull off the role of Indy with such casual charm? Not many, and the easy, light-hearted spirit of the role is captured so beautifully by Ford that he makes the craft of his performance look so easy. It’s a much more technical performance than people give him credit for, not to mention the fact that he did all of his own stunt work and strenuous physicality for the role. If actors are given credit for doing their own singing in biopics, then they should be appreciated for doing their own stunt work, too (stunt performers should also be given credit in their own right, but that’s a different story).

And Ford’s performance hasn’t dwindled with age. At 80 years old, Ford is still as charming and physical as ever and still possesses that playful gleam in his eye. But this time around, in “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” the franchise’s fifth and final movie, Ford gives Indy aching loneliness and gruffness that suits the character’s aging tenure as the true adventurer of his time. He is a man out of time — the opening sequence showing Indy in his prime via de-aging technology juxtaposes with the harsh imagery of him struggling to get out of bed as an old man and yelling at his neighbors to keep the music down.

This ties in with the movie’s exploration of time, as Indy and Phoebe Waller-Bridge‘s Helena Shaw race Madds Mikkelsen‘s Nazi villain to find the titular Dial of Destiny, a device created by Archimedes that plays with time. The final act, as all Indy films do (some more literally than others), takes a leap of faith into a jaw-dropping narrative left-turn. If you stay with it and push past the fantastical plot, at its center is an old man who is looking to avoid feeling out of place and time by willingly staying behind in the past. Helena doesn’t let him do this, of course, but it’s an emotional moment for Indy and viewers — those of us in the audience were shouting in our heads, “No, please don’t stay there, Indy. You’ll always have a place with us.”

It’s as if the film, directed by James Mangold, knew this itself and thankfully transported Indy back to his present day and reunited him with Karen Allen‘s Marion. It was another emotional moment, with a great throwback to “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” and was some of Ford’s finest work as an actor. We’ve never seen Indy, or Ford, for that matter, this vulnerable on screen and it felt like a seminal moment for Jones, Ford, and us. All of that culminates in what is a genuinely good performance, as critics have noted.

Peter Travers (ABC News) observed: “The wow factor in ‘Dial of Destiny’ comes totally from Ford, whose humor and humanity cuts through digital effects… Ford, working deep and true, sees to it that Indy goes out in a blaze of glory.” He continued: “Indiana Jones has given Ford something better than a gold statue — that’s movie immortality, an honor bestowed on very few. That’s why watching him take a final bow to the thrilling thrum of the John Williams score — a roguish gleam flashing in his eyes and inimitable crooked grin — is an occasion for cheers and tears. One word: Respect.”

The positive critical reception is one thing. The fact that Ford has only been nominated once for an Oscar is another. And the nostalgia surrounding this role is a third thing. Ford returning to play this role for one final time may be a narrative that may prove too powerful for voters to ignore. Ford’s “Temple of Doom” co-star Ke Huy Quan had a powerful narrative last year (so did Brendan Fraser, Michelle Yeoh, and Jamie Lee Curtis, for that matter) on his way to a Best Supporting Actor win and Ford could benefit from his own narrative this year. There is precedence, too. Sylvester Stallone returned to play the role of Rocky Balboa in “Creed.” That was a big, bold action movie, too, but voters still found heart in it thanks to Stallone’s performance as an aging Rocky and they nominated him for Best Supporting Actor.

That could happen to Ford here, particularly as the “Indiana Jones” franchise is actually steeped in pedigree. In total, the “Indiana Jones” film series has won six Oscars and been nominated 13 times across four movies. The last entry failed to reap any nominations at all from the Academy — and that, like “Dial of Destiny,” was a nostalgic sequel released decades after the previous movie. That doesn’t bode well for “Dial of Destiny.” However, this entry carries so much nostalgic power that they may just forget about that. The film could get snubbed in every other category but still land a bid for Ford, just like Stallone and “Creed.”

Plus, Ford is showing his skill as an actor now more than ever. He stars in the TV drama “1923” and the Apple TV+ comedy “Shrinking,” both of which could nominate him for an Emmy very soon. Those shows will help to boost him towards the Oscar ballot, the same way that Laura Dern‘s Emmy win for “Big Little Lies” helped her to win Best Supporting Actress in 2020 for “Marriage Story.”

Currently, however, Ford is not in our lineup of predicted nominees for Best Actor, which is at the moment made up of Paul Giamatti (“The Holdovers”), Colman Domingo (“Rustin”), Cillian Murphy (“Oppenheimer”), Bradley Cooper (“Maestro”), and Leonardo DiCaprio (“Killers of the Flower Moon”). It is very, very early days, however. If Disney mounts a campaign for Ford and starts pressing down on that nostalgic narrative, there could easily be a route for Indy and Ford. Here’s hoping.

,’Elemental’ debuts with £2.9m at UK-Ireland box office; ‘Indiana Jones 5’ top for second week,Also opening this weekend was ‘Insidious: The Red Door’ which made £2.3m for Sony.,"Rank Film (distributor) Three-day gross (June 30-July 2) Total gross to date Week 1.

Disney titles went head-to-head at the UK-Ireland box office this weekend after Pixar animation Elemental narrowly missed out on knocking Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny off the top spot.

While previews helped push the Elemental over the £3m mark, its three-day total of £2.9m was not quite enough to match the Harrison Ford franchise which made £3m in its second weekend.

Elemental, which centres around the four elements (earth, wind, fire and air) co-existing together, opened in 625 sites – dropping unexpectedly after cinema chain Empire announced the immediate closure of its 14 locations on Friday (July 7). Directed by Peter Sohn, the title is down on previous Pixar film Lightyear which opened with £3.7m in 2022 and ended on £7.6m.

Meanwhile, The Dial Of Destiny dropped 43% in its second week and stands at £13.2m in total. Its box office has only just overtaken the opening figures of its predecessor The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull which debuted with £12m back in 2008.

In third place is the latest edition in the paranormal horror franchise, Insidious: The Red Door, which opened strong on £2.3m for Sony. Opening in 485 sites, the fifth instalment is just shy of Insidious: Chapter Two which debuted with £2.9m, and remains the highest opener of the series, but is up on the fourth film - 2018’s The Last Key - which opened on £1.8m in 2018.

Actor Patrick Wilson makes his directorial debut with The Red Door and returns to star alongside Rose Byrne and Ty Simpkins.

Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse dropped just 36% in the sixth weekend as the Sony animation added a further £964,646 to bring its total to £27.7m.

In its seventh weekend, Disney’s The Little Mermaid added £490,133 and is now just shy of £26m.

Gone in a Flash

For Universal, Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City nabbed £460,880 in its third session to bring its total to £3.8m.

Jennifer Lawrence comedy No Hard Feelings made £348,815 for Sony and stands at £3.2m after three weeks of play.

In its second weekend, Universal animation Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken collected £296.930 and now totals £1.6m.

Paramount’s Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts dropped just 39% in its fifth weekend to add another £284,000 to its £7.7m total.

The Flash dropped another 61% in its fourth weekend with takings of £241,260. The Warner Bros superhero title now stands at £8.6m.

After 14 weeks, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is still going strong as the Universal animation added £40,016 to its £53.8m takings.

Disney’s Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 made £39,602 and is now on £36.6m after 10 weeks of play.

Also for Disney is horror The Boogeyman which collected £26,972 in its sixth session for a £18m cume.

Elysian Film Group’s musical Greatest Days added £19,052 and stands at £1.5m after four weeks on release.

On Friday (July 7), Trafalgar Releasing had live conerrt Odesza: The Last Goodbye Cinematic Experience which collected £13,955 from 39 venues.

Quentin Dupieux’s 2022 Cannes title Smoking Causes Coughing made £13,199 over the weekend for Picturehouse and £29,637 including previews.

Curzon’s The Damned Don’t Cry opened to £8,974 and has made £11,394 including previews. Fyzal Boulifa’s second feature, following Lynn + Lucy, premiered in Venice’s Giornate degli Autori in 2022 and explores a complicated mother-son relationship.

Edward Lovelace’s Name Me Lawand opened to £6,780 for BFI Distribution. The documentary, which follows a young Kurdish refugee learning to communicate, has made £16,455 including previews.

For Modern Films, Jean-Paul Salome’s thriller La Syndicaliste added £6,774 to bring its cume to £45,157.

Ziggy Stardust: The Global Premiere made £4,549 over the weekend for Unique X. The last performance of David Bowie’s alter ego from a 1973 concert has made a total of £263,125 since opening on Monday (July 3).

T A P E Collective opened Shamira Raphaela’s documentary Shabu to £3,346 (£4,735 including previews).

The main contender this week will be Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One which opens today (July 10).",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY3JlZW5kYWlseS5jb20vbmV3cy9lbGVtZW50YWwtZGVidXRzLXdpdGgtMjltLWF0LXVrLWlyZWxhbmQtYm94LW9mZmljZS1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLTUtdG9wLWZvci1zZWNvbmQtd2Vlay81MTgzODk3LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Fun Facts About Indiana Jones Movies

Henry Jones Jr. is the character’s real name, nicknamed Junior by his father in the 3rd movie. It turns out the dog was named Indiana…

Indiana has 1 son from marriage to Marion Ravenwood named Henry Jones III, nicknamed Mutt.

Indiana Jones gets his hat after Garth, a villain from the 3rd film, takes a prized artifact from Indy.

Indiana Jones famously hates snakes (Snakes, why did it have to be snakes?) but his father has a major fear of rats.

Oscar award winner Ke Huy Quan starred as Short Round in the 2nd movie. He reunited with Harrison Ford at D23 Expo in September of 2022 before going on to win awards for his role in Everything All At Once.

“Nazis. I hate these guys…” Don’t we all, Indy? The Nazis are the main villains in 3 of the 5 movies.

Harrison Ford performs most of his own stunts in the early movies.

Renowned playwright Tom Stoppard stepped in to pen some of the dialogue between Indy and Dr. Henry Jones in the 3rd movie.

2023-07-09 18:01:13+00:00,"‘Indiana Jones 5’ and ‘Insidious: The Red Door’ Tie at International Box Office, ‘Transformers’ Hits $400 Million Globally","""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is facing an unexpectedly close race with ""Insidious: The Red Door"" on international box office charts.","Disney’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is barely winning an unexpectedly close race with “Insidious: The Red Door” on international box office charts, with each film collecting roughly $31 million over the weekend.

Based on Sunday’s estimates, “Indiana Jones 5” is ever-so-slightly ahead of “Insidious 5” with $31.8 million for Harrison Ford’s swashbuckling adventure and $31.4 million for Sony’s paranormal horror story.

“The Red Door” easily took town “Dial of Destiny” at the domestic box office, with the former earning $32.6 million in its debut. It marked the second-best opening weekend of the franchise behind 2013’s “Insidious: Chapter 2” ($40 million).

Overseas, the newest “Insidious” movie managed to secure the best start for a horror film in pandemic times, as well as the biggest start of the supernatural-horror series in comparable markets. Top markets include Mexico ($5.8 million) the Philippines ($3.7 million) and the U.K. ($2.8 million).

With $64 million in global ticket sales to date, the $16-million budgeted “Insidious 5” is already reaping big rewards in its box office run. “The Red Door,” which is positioned as the conclusion to the horror franchise, brings back original cast members Patrick Wilson (who also directed the film) Ty Simpkins, Andrew Astor and Rose Byrne.

Meanwhile, “Dial of Destiny” has collected $127 million internationally so far, boosting its global tally to $248 million. For Disney and Lucasfilm, which shelled out an eye-popping $300 million to make the latest globe-trotting adventure, it’s catastrophic that ticket sales have yet to cross $250 million.

Disney and Pixar’s “Elemental” trailed “Dial of Destiny” and “Insidious 5” on international charts, bringing in $30 million from 48 markets. That takes its total to $142 million overseas and $250.9 million globally. The animated family film got off to a rocky start on the big screen, but it’s remained a draw for families in subsequent weeks. It cost $200 million, so it’ll need to keep playing in theaters to justify that price tag.

Also this weekend, Paramount’s “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” crossed the $400 million mark globally. With another $7.6 million over the weekend, the seventh “Transformers” installment has earned $261 million overseas and $407 million worldwide to date. “Rise of the Beasts,” which cost $200 million, has stuck around on movie theater marquees despite an unremarkable start at the box office.

Elsewhere, Warner Bros. and DC’s comic book adventure “The Flash” is running out of steam with $5 million from 78 markets in its fourth weekend of release. This weekend’s ticket sales take the international tally to $156 million and the worldwide total to $261 million. It’s a catastrophic result given the film’s $200 million price tag.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy01LWluc2lkaW91cy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtdGllLTEyMzU2NjQ4MjUv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vYm94LW9mZmljZS9pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLTUtaW5zaWRpb3VzLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYm94LW9mZmljZS10aWUtMTIzNTY2NDgyNS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Indiana Jones vs. the Subway

There were a few things I knew before seeing Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny—and, after seeing it, can now confirm.

The CGI de-aging of Harrison Ford is spectacular. I question the more insidious implications of how well the effects team were able to pull off this digital approximation, but it has to be said: Harrison Ford, you will always be hot!

The movie is also endless (derogatory); the two-and-a-half-hour running time is offensive and unnecessary. But the ending is one of the silliest things I’ve had the pleasure of witnessing on a big screen. I was genuinely delighted at how ridiculous the time-travel finale is. I won’t spoil the specifics, but envisioning director James Mangold, Ford, and esteemed auteur/actress Phoebe Waller-Bridge filming it with a straight face recontextualized for me the shameless power of money, and for that I am grateful.

But there is one scene that early reviewers have not talked enough about, which I am here to shout about through any speaker phone on any platform I can: the subway horse scene.

This is not a spoiler, as it happens in the first act of the movie, but there is a SUBWAY HORSE SCENE IN INDIANA JONES that, by virtue of its unapologetic ridiculousness and commitment to seriousness, may just be the pinnacle of any action sequence we’ll see this year.

Ford, as Indiana Jones, is living in New York City in 1969 and just celebrated his retirement, when his connection to an artifact leads to him being kidnapped by Nazis. He escapes them, in the middle of a Manhattan parade celebrating the astronauts from the moon landing. In order to further evade the baddies, he has few options: He must steal a police horse, and he must take that police horse into the subway.

From there, Jones and said horse gallop through the tunnels, evading multiple trains that would surely hit and kill anyone not protected by John Williams’ Indiana Jones score. The whole sequence is thrilling, and yet hilarious. It ends perfectly, with Jones tossing off a grumpy one-liner. I don’t ever endorse going to see a movie of this length, but, for this scene, it is worth it.

Consonant Professional?

Listen: I don’t know if Vanna White wanted the job of replacing Pat Sajak as the host of Wheel of Fortune. I would hope that, if she did, execs would have given it to her. But in lieu of that, we’re left wondering whether or not Ryan Seacrest is the right choice to take over the institution. (And we’re also starting a rallying call to give Vanna a raise.)

The thing about Seacrest being hired to host anything is: yeah, sure. It’s obvious. Seacrest hosts things. Is there any way to be more imaginative in hiring?

But as someone who has watched Seacrest host things for over 20 years, and who has watched other people try and wildly fail at the same job, I think we take for granted how easy he makes it look.

Based on how many celebs have flopped harder trying to host a game show than Carrie Bradshaw working the runway at a fashion show, this is a more complicated job than it seems. I don’t love that someone as problematic as Sajak is being replaced with someone who also has skeletons in his closet. So it’s not like I’d cheer this news. But an obvious choice is sometimes a good choice, something that Jeopardy! favorite James Holzhauer elucidated in this tweet:

Fall Out Boy Started the Fire

Every time I write this sentence, I still don’t believe it’s real: Fall Out Boy wrote and recorded a sequel to Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire,” updating the lyrics to account for the nearly 35 years since Joel released the original.

The song is atrocious, obviously. But it is my journalistic duty to point out some of the most hilarious (abhorrent) lyrics:

“Oklahoma City bomb / Kurt Cobain, Pokémon / Tiger Woods, MySpace / Monsanto, GMOs / Harry Potter, Twilight / Michael Jackson dies / Nuclear accident, Fukushima, Japan.”

There’s also:

“More war in Afghanistan / Cubs go all the way again /Obama, Spielberg / Explosion, Lebanon / Unabomber, Bobbitt, John / Bombing, Boston Marathon / Balloon Boy, War On Terror / QAnon / Trump gets impeached twice / Polar bears got no ice.”

But then there’s the height of songwriting, a moment in music (and history!) I will never forget:

“Self-driving electric cars / SSRIs / Prince and the Queen die / World Trade, second plane / What else do I have to say?”

What else do I have to say?

What Would Zenu Say?

I would truly love to hear all of Tom Cruise’s thoughts on the Barbie movie.

The fifth and final film in the series and the first to not be directed by Steven Spielberg — he handed the baton to James Mangold — Dial of Destiny embraces the rich mythology that stems from the 1981 original Raiders of the Lost Ark, while making allowances that even Indiana Jones must age and his search becomes about solace and inner peace, after all those wild archaeological adventures. In his way is the need to thwart one last attempt by the Nazis to use a time travel invention by Archimedes to change history and once again plunge the world into darkness.

After giving a proper shout out thank you to Tom Selleck for being unable to get out of his Magnum P.I. series commitment that gave him his most iconic role, Ford recounts winning the job and knowing early that between a great script and the brain trust of his Star Wars director George Lucas and Jaws director Spielberg that Ford might well be catching lightning in a bottle.

Four decades later and “Indiana Jones” is still a trending household name.

Most recently, there was even an Indiana Jones 2023 film release. Marking Indiana Jones 5 in the film franchise, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but it’s still a testament to the enduring legacy and lasting popularity of the Indiana Jones saga. Other prominent examples include all the themed pop culture incorporations of the films and their titular protagonist through the years in everything from apparel to LEGO Indiana Jones sets. On the Disney Parks scene, we’ve seen plenty of Indiana Jones–themed attractions emerge, too, including the longtime Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular! at Disney World in Orlando, Florida, and Disneyland’s own Indiana Jones ride, Indiana Jones Adventure, in Anaheim, California.

Here at Inside the Magic, we’re taking a closer look at the Indiana Jones movies—start to finish. In our breakdown, we will highlight every inception, from the most popular to the somewhat obscure, summarizing the facts and details to know about in a comprehensive source guide.

A Bit of Indiana Jones History

The basis for the Indiana Jones character, as well as his many quests, were mainly inspired by the action-hero series of the 1930s and 1940s, including Zorro, Flash Gordon, and others. Both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg were also fans of Alan Ladd and Charlton Heston films in particular, as we can see very distinct parallels to Indiana Jones in such movies as China (1943), in which Ladd’s character even sports the name “David Llewellyn Jones,” and Heston’s portrayal of Harry Steel in Secret of the Incas (1954).

As such, Indiana Jones is a culmination of all these inspirations in one embodiment. Portrayed on screen by actor Harrison Ford, who has faithfully reprised his role in every film inception to date, Indiana Jones (real name Henry Walton Jones, Jr.) doubles as a bold, adventurous archeologist and college professor. He is well-versed in ancient history, artifacts, and languages and is best recognized by his signature fedora hat, leather jacket, and accompanying bullwhip. He’s also renowned for his fear of snakes—a repeatedly inconvenient and ironically significant burden throughout the series.

Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)

Set in 1936, this first film in the adventure series centers around the titular protagonist and his search for the legendary Ark of the Covenant—the gold-plated chest said to contain the original stone tablets on which Moses inscribed the Ten Commandments. But the Nazis are after it too, believing it to possess divine powers, which they long to use in their quest for obtaining world domination.

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)

While technically the second production in the Indiana Jones movie order, this film’s premise is set a year earlier than the events in the first installment. The year is 1935, and upon the opening, the title hero escapes an assassination attempt in Shanghai in the company of a singer/actress and 12-year-old sidekick. After crash-landing in India, the primary mission of this adventure turns into a two-fold quest to rescue the kidnapped children of a Punjabi village while also retrieving a stolen sacred stone.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)

For this third adventure, set in 1938, we find Indiana Jones searching for the famed Holy Grail. He’s also on a quest to find his estranged father, who has recently gone missing while on his own pursuit of the Grail. Again, it becomes a race against the Nazis, who are also after the Grail and the legendary powers of immortality it is rumored to possess.

The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles (1992 to 1996)

The popularity of the Indiana Jones films even led to the creation of a spinoff series chronicling the life and adventures of the title hero in his earlier days. Rightfully named The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, the series primarily follows the adventures of Indiana Jones as a boy between the ages of 8 and 10 and as a teenager/young man. His adventures often put him in the company of some famous people from the early 20th century, with a (now) 93-year-old Jones narrating each episode. Harrison Ford even appeared in an episode featuring Indy in his mid-years.

While as a series, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles only ran from 1992 to 1993, four follow-up made-for-television movies were produced between 1994 and 1996. In 1999 the entire series was re-edited into 22 television films, titled The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones. Fans can now enjoy all these installments of Indiana Jones streaming on Disney+ under the rightfully named Indiana Jones Collection.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)

Just when everyone thought Indiana Jones had hung up his fedora for good, a fourth film arrives on the scene, set in 1957. This time around, though, things literally take an out-of-this-world turn, with the powerful artifact in question being an alien crystal skull. With the Soviets after the skull for its telepathic powers, the quest leads Indy on a continental grand tour through the Americas, including Peru and the Amazon rainforest in Brazil.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023)

At last, we arrive at the most recent film in the series—the one we can only assume is the conclusion to the now-geriatric action hero’s adventures. Set in 1969, the story here centers around the mysterious Archimedes’ Dial—a relic Indiana Jones and his now-deceased friend Basil retrieved from the Nazis back in 1944. Now Basil’s daughter Helena Shaw, who also happens to be Indy’s goddaughter, arrives on the scene asking for the dial. But a former Nazi-turned-NASA scientist is also after it and its time-travel properties in hopes of changing the outcome of World War II.

This is the only film in the Indiana Jones movie franchise directed by James Mangold instead of Steven Spielberg. And in truth, not everyone is sold on the idea. Furthermore, some longtime fans debate whether to even see this film, not wanting to be disappointed over any potential Indiana Jones movie woke incorporations or other deviations from what has been integral all along in each preceding film. Remember, this is the first Indiana Jones installment since Disney purchased Lucasfilm, meaning it’s really Disney who owns Indiana Jones now. And reviews are already mixed among those who have seen the film. Still, you won’t know until you see it yourself and then form your own opinions on how it compares to the others.
