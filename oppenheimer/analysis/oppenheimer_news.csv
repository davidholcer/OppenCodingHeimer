2023-07-19 16:16:08+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’ Review: A Man for Our Time,"Christopher Nolan’s complex, vivid portrait of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb,” is a brilliant achievement in formal and conceptual terms.","The story tracks Oppenheimer — played with feverish intensity by Cillian Murphy — across decades, starting in the 1920s with him as a young adult and continuing until his hair grays. The film touches on personal and professional milestones, including his work on the bomb, the controversies that dogged him, the anti-Communist attacks that nearly ruined him, as well as the friendships and romances that helped sustain yet also troubled him. He has an affair with a political firebrand named Jean Tatlock (a vibrant Florence Pugh), and later weds a seductive boozer, Kitty Harrison (Emily Blunt, in a slow-building turn), who accompanies him to Los Alamos, where she gives birth to their second child.
It’s a dense, event-filled story that Nolan — who’s long embraced the plasticity of the film medium — has given a complex structure, which he parcels into revealing sections. Most are in lush color; others in high-contrast black and white. These sections are arranged in strands that wind together for a shape that brings to mind the double helix of DNA. To signal his conceit, he stamps the film with the words “fission” (a splitting into parts) and “fusion” (a merging of elements); Nolan being Nolan, he further complicates the film by recurrently kinking up the overarching chronology — it is a lot.
It also isn’t a story that builds gradually; rather, Nolan abruptly tosses you into the whirl of Oppenheimer’s life with vivid scenes of him during different periods. In rapid succession the watchful older Oppie (as his intimates call him) and his younger counterpart flicker onscreen before the story briefly lands in the 1920s, where he’s an anguished student tormented by fiery, apocalyptic visions. He suffers; he also reads T.S. Eliot’s “The Waste Land,” drops a needle on Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring” and stands before a Picasso painting, defining works of an age in which physics folded space and time into space-time.
This fast pace and narrative fragmentation continue as Nolan fills in this Cubistic portrait, crosses and recrosses continents and ushers in armies of characters, including Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), a physicist who played a role in the Manhattan Project. Nolan has loaded the movie with familiar faces — Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Gary Oldman — some distracting. It took me a while to accept the director Benny Safdie as Edward Teller, the theoretical physicist known as the “father of the hydrogen bomb,” and I still don’t know why Rami Malek shows up in a minor part other than he’s yet another known commodity.
As Oppenheimer comes into focus so does the world. In 1920s Germany, he learns quantum physics; the next decade he’s at Berkeley teaching, bouncing off other young geniuses and building a center for the study of quantum physics. Nolan makes the era’s intellectual excitement palpable — Einstein published his theory of general relativity in 1915 — and, as you would expect, there’s a great deal of scientific debate and chalkboards filled with mystifying calculations, most of which Nolan translates fairly comprehensibly. One of the film’s pleasures is experiencing by proxy the kinetic excitement of intellectual discourse.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTkvbW92aWVzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXJldmlldy1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 12:49:00+00:00,"Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' Is Terrifying, But Irresistible","Nolan's latest film, if not his best, is certainly among his grandest spectacles—one that is immense, assaultive, and full of eye-enveloping abstraction.","Short of Tom Cruise, there’s been no more vocal advocate for the theatrical experience than Christopher Nolan in recent years. He’s penned impassioned op-eds, battled with studios over release strategy, and his movies have consistently boosted the box office's bottom line. Nolan, though, is not just a champion of theaters—but one of their greatest beneficiaries. His latest, Oppenheimer, is, if not his best film, certainly among his grandest spectacles—one made many times more powerful if witnessed in the largest, loudest venue possible.
As you might expect in a movie about the father of the atomic bomb, there is a great—and I do mean great—explosion in Oppenheimer. But in this three-hour biopic, it’s not just the booms and blasts that are worthy of IMAX. It is Cillian Murphy’s oceanic eyes bulging out of his chainsmoker’s cheekbones. It is the alien emptiness of the New Mexico desert. And it is, perhaps most of all, Ludwig Göransson’s relentless score. The fireworks in this movie are constant, if not always literal.
You feel them going off even in seemingly minor moments. For instance: Early in the film, when a young J. Robert Oppenheimer (Murphy, giving a career performance) observes a Picasso painting. The scene is barely even a scene; it's more of a montage fragment. But as this wunderkind takes in this masterpiece, you glean the primary point Nolan wants to make about his subject: That Oppenheimer’s perception of the world was inherently Cubist. Which is to say that Oppenheimer was simultaneously able to see a subject’s many different angles—and this ability allowed him to justify his sometimes dubious, ultimately world-shaking actions.
If the painting, though, is an early window into Oppenheimer’s kaleidoscopic mind, it’s also an approximation of the film’s nonlinear structure. Nolan never met a clock he didn’t think would benefit from multiple dials, and Oppenheimer certainly employs some of Cubism’s disjointedness as it jumps across timelines. Nolan distinguishes different periods through the use of color (the bulk of the narrative) and black-and-white (Oppenheimer antagonist Lewis Strauss’s 1959 cabinet confirmation hearing).
For the most part, all the time-jumping doesn’t inspire confusion, and rather contributes to the film’s athletic pacing. Oppenheimer’s third act revolves around a pair of hearings: one, in 1954, over whether to renew Oppenheimer’s security clearance; and the other, over Strauss’s (Robert Downey Jr., your 2024 Best Supporting Actor) confirmation. Nolan sprinkles the various depositions earlier in the film as narration. We hear different characters describe why Oppenheimer was eventually chosen to run the Manhattan Project (his unparalleled genius at theoretical physics) despite being a risky choice for the position (his womanizing, plus his flirtations with communism).
Oppenheimer is immense, assaultive, and full of eye-enveloping abstraction.
Along the way, Nolan’s technique brought to mind another early 20th century master of modern art: Jackson Pollock. Oppenheimer is immense, assaultive, and full of eye-enveloping abstraction. It’s these qualities that allow the director to pull off an exceedingly difficult task: Making complex theory cinematic. Nolan doesn’t spend much time on the nitty-gritty of fusion and fission, and instead conjures these ideas’ sublimity with quick cuts to dazzling depictions of particles, stars, and light. It’s during these moments when Göransson’s score is loudest, thrumming with the at once frightening and exciting momentum of world-shaking ideas.
For all its experimental flourishes, though, if you rearranged Oppenheimer in a chronological order, you’d be left with a fairly traditional biopic. The film’s underlying conventionality is most glaring in its use of lofty dialogue to characterize—and mythologize—its complicated hero. Characters constantly tell Oppenheimer things like, “You’re not just self-important, you’re actually important” and “Robert, you see beyond the world we live in. Of course we’ll help you.” My favorite, though, is: “How could the man who saw so much be so blind?”
Overall, Oppenheimer is a sympathetic, though not altogether uncritical, portrait of the atomic bomb’s inventor. Universal Pictures
In Nolan’s framing, naivete is Oppenheimer’s fatal flaw. He underestimated the ill-intentions of other people, or he overstated how much smarter he was than them. And in the film’s final hour, he learns his lesson the hard way. Following the successful Trinity Test, Truman drops the atom bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and we glimpse the emotional fallout of Oppenheimer’s incredible achievement—the feelings of guilt, suppression of feeling, and the intellectual rationalizations. “I feel that I have blood on my hands,” Oppenheimer tells President Truman (a hammy Gary Oldman) when he visits the Oval Office. Nolan hammers this feeling home, literalizing the internal detonation during adulatory public appearances. Later, we see Oppenheimer imagining the victims. But in a critical omission, Nolan never shows the devastation to the viewer—a choice that shrouds the violence, leaving it almost theoretical. The urge to keep the focus on Oppenheimer is understandable, but in this instance is a disservice; it makes it too easy for a Western audience to make their own rationalizations.
Overall, Oppenheimer is a sympathetic, though not altogether uncritical, portrait. Nolan, who has called Oppenheimer “ the most important person who ever lived ,” is clearly enamored by his subject’s mind, charisma, and appearance. In his baggy, high-waisted pants and soft-brimmed hat, Murphy cuts a striking figure. Though, it’s not just him. Like all Nolan movies, Oppenheimer is consumed with a classical handsomeness. Hoyte Van Hoytema’s elegant compositions lend a warranted import to these events. But while visually stunning, the film’s serious aesthetic has one downside: It counteracts the inherent camp of Florence Pugh’s Jean Tatlock (an early love), making Oppenheimer quote the Bhagavad-Gita during sex.
The passage she opens to is, “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” The passage reverberates in Oppenheimer’s mind during the Trinity Test. That explosion, Oppenheimer suggests, is the crowning achievement of Oppenheimer’s life’s work. It’s also the zenith of this film. Nolan orchestrates it like a world-class conductor, producing an orgasmic symphony of awe, wonder, and catastrophic power. It’s terrifying, but also irresistible. As such, it brings you closer to understanding Oppenheimer: Who doesn’t want to play God for a moment?",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcXVpcmUuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbW92aWVzL2E0NDYwOTkzNy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-19 16:00:04+00:00,Oppenheimer review – Nolan’s atom bomb epic is flawed but extraordinary,Christopher Nolan’s account of the physicist who led the Manhattan Project captures the most agonising of success stories,"The wartime Soviet intelligence services had a codename for the Manhattan Project, the US’s plan to build an atom bomb: Enormoz. Christopher Nolan’s new film about it is absolutely Enormoz, maybe his most enormoz so far: a gigantic, post-detonation study, a PTSD narrative procedure filling the giant screen with a million agonised fragments that are the shattered dreams and memories of the project’s haunted, complex driving force, J Robert Oppenheimer, a brilliant physicist with the temperament of an artist who gave humanity the means of its own destruction.
The main event is that terrifying first demonstration: the Trinity nuclear test in the New Mexico desert in July 1945, when Oppenheimer is said to have silently pondered (and later intoned on TV) Vishnu’s lines from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds …”
This is the big bang, and no one could have made it bigger or more overwhelming than Nolan. He does this without simply turning it into an action stunt – although this movie, for all its audacity and ambition, never quite solves the problem of its own obtuseness: filling the drama at such length with the torment of genius-functionary Oppenheimer at the expense of showing the Japanese experience and the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Nolan moves back and forth in time, either side of the historic 1945 firebreak, giving us Oppenheimer’s beginnings as a young scientist, lonely and unhappy, electrified by the new developments in quantum mechanics, the young leftist who never became a Communist party member but whose anti-fascism galvanised his desire to develop the bomb before the Nazis could, directing the work of hundreds of scientists.
Watch a trailer for Oppenheimer
Later in the 50s, there is the disillusioned, compromised administrator, hounded by the McCarthyites for his communist connections, nauseated by his own pointless celebrity, by his failure to establish postwar international atomic control and by a single denied thought: the Nazis surrendered long before there was any suggestion they had the weapon, and bombing the defeated Japanese at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was merely to cow the Russians with a ruthless demonstration of the US’s nuclear mastery.
Cillian Murphy is an eerily close lookalike for Oppenheimer with his trademark hat and pipe, and is very good at capturing his sense of solitude and emotional imprisonment, giving us the Oppenheimer million-yard stare, eyeballs set in a gaunt skull, seeing and foreseeing things he cannot process.
Matt Damon is the boorish Lt Gen Leslie Groves, Oppenheimer’s exasperated military minder; Kenneth Branagh is his genial scientific hero and mentor Niels Bohr; Robert Downey Jr is the duplicitous Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss; Florence Pugh plays his lover Jean Tatlock, whose heart he broke, while Emily Blunt is his wife, Kitty, also badly treated. Tom Conti plays the sorrowfully detached Albert Einstein, and it has to be said that Nolan, rightly or wrongly, uses non-Jewish actors for Oppenheimer and Einstein, two of the most famous Jewish people in history and in fact doesn’t quite get to grips with the antisemitism that Oppenheimer faced as an assimilated secular American Jew.

There is a horribly gripping scene showing Oppenheimer’s formative experience as an unhappy graduate student in England at Christ’s College, Cambridge. He suffered what amounted to a psychotic breakdown and left a poisoned apple on the desk of his testy supervisor Patrick Blackett (James D’Arcy), which Blackett fortunately didn’t notice and didn’t eat. Nolan coolly invites to see this as a parable for the lost Eden of a more innocent prewar physics, with Oppenheimer as a serpent with Adam’s foolish innocence. And of course there is the creeping biographical irony: how terribly close Oppenheimer came to … killing someone.

The purest payload of fear is delivered in a scene that Nolan handles with forthright gusto. After the successful detonation of the Hiroshima bomb, Murphy shows us Oppenheimer in shock, but also realising he has to address an audience of cheering colleagues and subordinates. He knows it is his duty as a leader to congratulate them and be upbeat, stammering out some fatuous remark about how the Japanese “didn’t like it”, then realising how callous that was, and beginning to hallucinate the horror. Of course, Oppenheimer did not witness the actual use of his weapon, he never saw anything becoming death, the destroyer of worlds, and Nolan takes the decision to look away from it too, to stay in the US, to stay with Oppenheimer himself in all his sudden tragic irrelevance.
Perhaps the film’s most important moment is the one that addresses its own flaw: the legendary postwar encounter in the White House Oval Office between Oppenheimer and President Harry S Truman (played by Gary Oldman), the man who took the final executive decision to drop the bomb. Nolan and Murphy show how Oppenheimer shrinks and cringes into the couch in front of him, like a scared little boy, apparently wanting something like absolution from the president and mumbling that he feels he has “blood on his hands”. Angry and baffled, Truman tells him curtly that all this is his responsibility as president and asks a very pertinent question: does Oppenheimer think the Japanese care who made the bomb? No, they want to know who dropped it. It’s true: concentrating on Oppenheimer is simultaneously fascinating and beside the larger historical point.
In the end, Nolan shows us how the US’s governing class couldn’t forgive Oppenheimer for making them lords of the universe, couldn’t tolerate being in the debt of this liberal intellectual. Oppenheimer is poignantly lost in the kaleidoscopic mass of broken glimpses: the sacrificial hero-fetish of the American century.
Oppenheimer is released on 20 July in Australia, and 21 July in the US and UK.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjMvanVsLzE5L29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXJldmlldy1ub2xhbnMtYXRvbS1ib21iLWVwaWMtaXMtZmxhd2VkLWJ1dC1leHRyYW9yZGluYXJ50gFxaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2ZpbG0vMjAyMy9qdWwvMTkvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItcmV2aWV3LW5vbGFucy1hdG9tLWJvbWItZXBpYy1pcy1mbGF3ZWQtYnV0LWV4dHJhb3JkaW5hcnk?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-24 20:28:59+00:00,‘Barbenheimer’ Weekend Was a Real Team Effort,"The bumper box office broke the usual pattern for blockbuster opening weekends, with several films contributing to the big numbers.","The incongruous duo of “Barbie,” a hot-pink comedic romp, and “Oppenheimer,” a brooding period drama, combined to sell far more movie tickets than expected over the weekend, pushing the overall domestic box office to $311 million, according to Box Office Mojo, an online database. It was the biggest weekend haul in North America since 2019, and the fourth-largest ever, before adjusting for inflation.
It is a sign that Hollywood has, maybe, finally bounced back from the pandemic. (Whether the film business, which is dealing with dual writers’ and actors’ strikes, can keep the momentum going is another question.)
The weekend was also noteworthy for its variety, with “Barbie” collecting $162 million, “Oppenheimer” $82.4 million and the rest of the features, including “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” and “Sound of Freedom,” adding more than $66 million.
Typically, the biggest weekends for domestic ticket sales have been dominated by a single blockbuster. During the highest grossing weekend, in April 2019, “Avengers: Endgame” accounted for nearly 90 percent of the box office. “Barbie,” by comparison, accounted for just over half of the box office over the weekend.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMjQvYnVzaW5lc3MvYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXdlZWtlbmQtYm94LW9mZmljZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-23 14:40:58+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Barbie’ Opens to Record-Setting $155 Million, ‘Oppenheimer’ Shatters Expectations With $80 Million Debut","""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" shattered expectations, fueling the fourth-biggest box office weekend in history.","“Barbenheimer” is more than just a meme. It’s a full-fledged box office phenomenon.
Over the weekend, moviegoers turned out in force for Greta Gerwig’s neon-coated fantasy comedy “Barbie,” which smashed expectations with $155 million to land the biggest debut of the year. But they also showed up to see Christopher Nolan’s R-rated historical drama “Oppenheimer,” which collected a remarkable $80.5 million in its opening weekend.
Hundreds of thousands of ticket buyers refused to choose between the two seemingly different auter-driven blockbusters with sprawling casts and twin release dates. So they opted to attend same-day viewings of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” turning the box office battle into a double feature for the ages.
“This is an unequivocally great weekend for moviegoing,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ are complementing each other at the box office, not taking audience from each other.”
The cultural craze known as “Barbenheimer” worked to fuel the biggest collective box office weekend of the pandemic era, as well as the fourth-biggest overall weekend in history. It’s worth noting the top three weekends of all time were led by the debuts of sequels in massive franchises (“Avengers: Endgame,” “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”).
“Studios gave audiences two uniquely different, smart and original stories that were meant for the big screen, says Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners, the industry’s trade organization. “People recognized that something special was happening, and they wanted to be a part of it.”
In the end, though, it wasn’t a competition as “Barbie” loomed large over box office charts, thanks to an inescapable marketing campaign, as well as quality to match the stratospheric hype. At the international box office, the film added $182 million for a stunning global tally of $337 million.
The $145 million-budgeted movie, backed by Warner Bros. and Mattel, dominated the zeitgeist in the weeks leading up to its debut (even reportedly causing a shortage of the color pink) to a degree that’s rare for original fare. (Yes, Barbie is perhaps the world’s most famous doll, but the movie isn’t a sequel or part of a pre-existing film franchise.)
“We have a pink unicorn here,” says Jeff Goldstein, the president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros. “We thought it would be $75 million for the opening weekend. Nobody saw $155 million coming. This doll has long legs.”
Audiences and critics dug the PG-13 film, which landed an “A” CinemaScore and 90% on Rotten Tomatoes. Initial crowds were 65% female (which, duh…), but that’s notable because it’s almost always the inverse for any movie that generates over $100 million in its debut.
Among its many records, “Barbie” also scored the biggest opening weekend ever for a film directed by a woman. “Captain Marvel,” which was co-directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, previously held the title with $153 million in 2019. “Wonder Woman,” from filmmaker Patty Jenkins, stood as the record-holder for a movie solely directed by a woman with $103 million in 2017.
Gerwig, the Oscar-nominated director of “Lady Bird” and “Little Women,” co-wrote the screenplay with her partner Noah Baumbach. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling star as the stereotypical versions of Barbie and Ken, who leave behind the Dreamhouse on a quest for self-discovery in the real world. The cast also includes Issa Rae, Dua Lipa, Simu Liu, Michael Cera, Helen Mirren, John Cena and Will Ferrell.
“Oppenheimer” may be settling for second place — not that Universal or Nolan is complaining. Buoyed by stellar reviews and premium large formats, the biopic about the so-called “father of the atomic bomb” is wildly outperforming expectations for a three-hour-long period piece with little action and lots of talking.
Heading into the weekend, analysts were anticipating a $50 million start, which already would have been notable given the grim film’s subject matter and style. With the bigger-than-projected debut, Nolan has only solidified his status as a box office draw, no matter the genre. And his appeal as a filmmaker spans continents. At the international box office, “Oppenheimer” added $93.7 million for a global tally of $174 million.
“This is a 1940s period piece,” says Universal’s president of domestic distribution Jim Orr. “That speaks volumes to the appeal of Nolan and his prowess as a filmmaker. He has an amazing reputation for storytelling in the biggest format possible.”
Nolan, the blockbuster director of “The Dark Knight” and “Inception,” is known to evangelize about Imax — and moviegoers have taken note. Premium large formats (PLFs, as they are known in the industry) contributed a massive 47% of the film’s domestic tally. Imax alone accounted for $35 million of global ticket sales.
“Around the world, we’ve seen sellouts at 4 a.m. shows and people traveling hours across borders to see ‘Oppenheimer’ in Imax 70mm,” says Imax CEO Rich Gelfond. “This is a phenomenon beyond compare in Imax, and we’re just getting started.”
Universal is backing the $100 million- budgeted “Oppenheimer,” which is notable because it marks the first time in more than two decades that Nolan isn’t working with Warner Bros. (Yes, the backers of “Barbie.”) He parted ways with the studio over its ill-fated decision to put its entire 2021 movie slate simultaneously on HBO Max.
Adapted from the Pulitzer Prize-winning book “American Prometheus,” “Oppenheimer” is a star-studded character study about theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy plays the man who led the action at Los Alamos, alongside an ensemble of Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Alden Ehrenreich.
With “Barbenheimer” taking up most of the oxygen at multiplexes, the other movies that were playing in theaters had to fight for scraps.
Tom Cruise’s big-budget sequel “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” took third place, tumbling by 64% with $19.5 million in its second weekend of release. It didn’t help that “Oppenheimer” is all but monopolizing the country’s PLF footprint, where tickets are pricier than standard screens.
The seventh installment in Paramount and Skydance’s globe-trotting action franchise has generated $118.7 million in North America and $370 million globally to date. However, it cost a mammoth $291 million before marketing, so it’ll need to hold its own against “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” to justify that price tag.
In fourth place, the independent juggernaut “Sound of Freedom” added $18.8 million from 3,285 theaters in its fourth weekend of release. The thriller about child sex trafficking has generated $124 million to date, making it the 14th-highest grossing domestic release of the year.
Disney’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” rounded out the top five, bringing in $6.7 million from 2,885 venues. After four weeks on the big screen, Harrison Ford’s action-adventure movie has grossed $159 million domestically and $335 million worldwide. The only trouble? It cost $300 million (and remember, theater owners get a share of ticket sales), meaning Indiana Jones is still deep in the red.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItb3BlbmluZy13ZWVrZW5kLXNoYXR0ZXItcmVjb3Jkcy0xMjM1Njc3NjAxL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItb3BlbmluZy13ZWVrZW5kLXNoYXR0ZXItcmVjb3Jkcy0xMjM1Njc3NjAxL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-23 19:17:29.926000+00:00,Barbie and Oppenheimer Blow Up the Box Office,"With a combined take of $244.5 million domestically and nearly $537 million total worldwide, Barbenheimer has officially broken several box-office records.","Update, July 24: The final numbers are in, and they’re huge: Barbie wound up earning $162 million domestic, with Oppenheimer coming in at $82.5 million. Internationally, Barbie made $194.3 million, with Oppenheimer earning $98 million. Math is hard, but let’s just say that’s a lot of money.
The original story continues below.
For weeks now, movie pundits have wondered just how much money Barbie and Oppenheimer would make on their combined opening weekend. As of Sunday, we have the answer: enough to buy a lot of Dreamhouses (and/or kitchen-free homes in Los Alomos).
The actual numbers are nothing short of staggering. Though final tallies won’t be available til Monday, it seems that Greta Gerwig’s Barbie has raked in about $155 million domestically and another $182 million internationally, exceeding even sky-high expectations. Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer has earned about $80.5 million domestic and $93.7 million internationally—a pretty stunning take for a three-hour drama about men in hats discussing theoretical physics.
That means together, the phenomenon known as Barbenheimer has made about $511 million worldwide, $235.5 million of which was earned domestically—enough to make this the fourth-highest grossing weekend in American history, and the only one of those four weekends not driven by a Disney-released sequel. (The openings of Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens occupy the no. 1, 2, and 3 slots, respectively.)
Deadline has a rundown of all the box office records that have just been broken: Barbie now boasts the biggest opening weekend ever for a female director. It's also the largest opening weekend for a movie based on a toy (beating out Transformers: Dark of the Moon). Oppenheimer has the biggest global opening for a biopic.
But those stats undersell what really was, and is, special about Barbenheimer. Heavily marketed as both these films have been, their massive success feels like an organic phenomenon, driven by actual enthusiasm from actual people. (What a concept!) Yes, Barbie is based on IP, and so, in a sense, is Oppenheimer. Both films are nevertheless idiosyncratic, auteur-driven projects, and not the sort of high-octane action franchise continuations studios seem to believe are the only sort of movie capable of making big money anymore. Both are also being received better than most wannabe blockbusters: critics (including Vanity Fair’s!) have reacted warmly to each film, while audiences have given each film an A Cinemascore.
What’s more, the apparent contrast between Barbie and Oppenheimer wound up working in both films' favor; scores of moviegoers elected to see not one movie but both, dressing up in midcentury hats and suits as well as their Barbie best. “People recognized that something special was happening and they wanted to be a part of it,” Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners, told CNBC. “Our partners in the creative community and at the studios gave audiences two uniquely different, smart and original stories that were meant for the big screen, and movie lovers responded by gathering friends and family and heading to their local movie houses across the nation.”
The singularity of Barbenheimer will be difficult if not impossible to recreate, though that doesn’t mean studios won’t try. We can only hope, then, that they take the right lesson from this weekend: as Nicole Kidman keeps telling us, people want to go back to movie theaters. They’re simply more willing to return if it means getting to see something they haven’t seen a million times before.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbml0eWZhaXIuY29tL2hvbGx5d29vZC8yMDIzLzA3L2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLXJlY29yZHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
7/13/2023 13:33,"In ‘Oppenheimer,’ Christopher Nolan builds a thrilling, serious blockbuster for adults",Christopher Nolan has never been one to take the easy or straightforward route while making a movie.,"NEW YORK (AP) — Christopher Nolan has never been one to take the easy or straightforward route while making a movie.
He shoots on large-format film with large, cumbersome cameras to get the best possible cinematic image. He prefers practical effects over computer-generated ones and real locations over soundstages — even when that means recreating an atomic explosion in the harsh winds of the New Mexico desert in the middle of the night for “Oppenheimer,” out July 21.
Though, despite internet rumors, they did not detonate an actual nuclear weapon.
And as for the biography that inspired his newest film, Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s riveting, linear narrative “American Prometheus” was simply the starting point from which Nolan crafted a beguiling labyrinth of suspense and drama.
It’s why, in his two decades working in Hollywood, Nolan has become a franchise unto himself — the rare auteur writer-director who makes films that are both intellectually stimulating and commercial, accounting for more than $5 billion in box office receipts. That combination is part of the reason why he’s able to attract Oscar winners and movie stars not just to headline his films, but also to turn out for just a scene or two.
“We’ve all been so intoxicated by his films,” said Emily Blunt, who plays J. Robert Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty. “That exploration of huge themes in an entertaining way doesn’t happen. It just doesn’t happen. That depth, the depth of the material, and yet on this massive epic scale.”
In the vast and complex story of the brilliant theoretical physicist who oversaw the Manhattan Project and the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, Nolan saw exciting possibilities to play with genre and form. There was the race to develop it before the Germans did, espionage, romance, domestic turmoil, a courtroom drama, bruised egos, political machinations, communist panic, and the burden of having created something that could destroy the world.
And then there was the man himself, beloved by most but hated by enough, who, after achieving icon status in American society, saw his reputation and sense of self annihilated by the very institutions that built him.
“It’s such an ambitious story to tell,” said Matt Damon, who plays Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. “Reading the script, I had the same feeling I had when I read ‘Interstellar,’ which was: ‘This is great. How the hell is he going to do this?’”
It’s not so disconnected from Nolan’s other films, either. As critic Tom Shone noted in his book about the director, “Looked at one way, Nolan’s films are all allegories of men who first find their salvation in structure only to find themselves betrayed or engulfed by it.”
Nolan turned to Cillian Murphy to take on the gargantuan task of portraying Oppenheimer. Murphy had already acted in five Nolan films, including the Batman trilogy, “Dunkirk” and “Inception,” but this would be his first time as a lead — something he had secretly pined for.
“You feel a responsibility, but then a great hunger and excitement to try and do it, to see where you can get,” said Murphy, who prepped extensively for six months before filming, working closely with Nolan throughout. “It was an awful lot of work, but I loved it. There is this kind of frisson, this energy when you’re on a Chris Nolan set about the potential for what you’re going to achieve.”
It would be an all-consuming role that would require some physical transformation to approximate that famously thin silhouette. A complex, contradictory figure, Oppenheimer emerged from a somewhat awkward youth to become a renaissance man who seemed to carry equal passion for the Bhagavad Gita, Proust, physics, languages, New Mexico, philosophical questions about disarmament and the perfectly mixed martini. But Murphy knew he was in safe hands with Nolan.
“He’s the most natural director I’ve ever worked with. And the notes that he gives to an actor, are quite remarkable. How he can gently bring you to a different place with your performance is quite stunning in such a subtle, low-key, understated way,” Murphy said. “It can have a profound effect on the way you look at a scene from one take to another take.”
Nolan wrote the main timeline of the film in the first person, to represent Oppenheimer’s subjective experience.
“We want to see everything through Oppenheimer’s point of view,” Nolan said. “That’s a huge challenge for an actor to take on because they’re having to worry about the performance, the truth of the performance, but also make sure that that’s always open to the audience.”
The other timeline, filmed in black and white, is more objective and focused on Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a founding member of the Atomic Energy Commission and a supporter of the development of the more destructive hydrogen bomb.
“Oppenheimer” is Nolan’s first R-rated film since 2002’s “Insomnia,” which after years of working exclusively in PG-13, he’s comfortable with. It fits the gravity of the material.
“We’re dealing with the most serious and adult story you could imagine — very important, dramatic events that changed the world and defined the world we live in today,” Nolan said. “You don’t want to compromise in any way.”
Much of the filming took place in New Mexico, including at the real Los Alamos laboratory where thousands of scientists, technicians and their families lived and worked for two years in the effort to develop the bomb. Nolan enlisted many of his frequent behind-the-scenes collaborators, including his wife and producer Emma Thomas, cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, composer Ludwig Göransson and special effects supervisors Scott Fisher and Andrew Jackson, as well as some newcomers like production designer Ruth de Jong and costume designer Ellen Mirojnick to help bring this world to life.
“It was a very focused set — fun set as well, not too serious. But the work was serious, the sweating of the details was serious,” Blunt said. “Everyone needs to kind of match Chris’ excellence, or want to.”
When it came to recreating the Trinity test, Oppenheimer’s chosen name for the first nuclear detonation, art and life blended in a visceral way.
“We wanted to put the audience there in that bunker,” Nolan said. “That meant really trying to make these things as beautiful and frightening and awe inspiring as they would have been to the people at the time.”
Though no real nukes were used, they did stage a lot of real explosions to approximate the blindingly bright atomic fire and mushroom cloud.
“To do those safely in a real environment out in the nighttime desert, there’s a degree of discipline and focus and adrenaline and just executing that for the film that echoes and mirrors what these guys went through on the grandest scale in a really interesting way,” Nolan said. “I felt everybody had that very, very tight sense of tension and focus around all those shooting nights.”
The weather also “did what it needed to do, as per history,” Murphy said, as the wind picked up and whipped around the set.
“I’m rumored to be very lucky with the weather and it’s not the case. It’s just that we decide to shoot whatever the weather,” Nolan said. “In the case of the Trinity test, it was essential, central to the story that this big storm rolls in with tremendous drama. And it did. That really made the sequence come to life.”
He added: “The extremity of it put me very much in the mindset of what it must have been like for these guys. It really felt like we were out in it.”
Then, of course, there is the experience of watching “Oppenheimer.”
“When you’re making a movie, I feel like you’re on the inside looking out,” Blunt said. “It’s really overwhelming to see it reflected back at you, especially one of this magnitude. ... I just felt like my breastplate was going to shatter, it was so intense.”
The hope is that when “Oppenheimer” is unleashed on the world, audiences will be as invested and will seek it out on the biggest screen they can find. The film has a run in IMAX theaters around the country, not something often afforded serious-minded, R-rated movies in the middle of the busy summer season. But this is also the essential Nolan impossibility. As more and more auteurs have had to compromise — to either go smaller or team with streamers to get the kind of budget they might once have had at studios, like even Ridley Scott and Martin Scorsese have had to do this year — Nolan continues to make his movies on the grandest scale.
“Each of his films has been revolutionary in their own way,” Murphy said. “It’s an event every time he releases a film, and rightly so.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLTQ2OWNjODFlMDk4OWY0MTRhMjBkYjU1MDhjNzYzMGEw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-28 17:38:45+00:00,Nolan’s Oppenheimer treats New Mexico as a blank canvas,"There is no acknowledgement in the film of the existence of downwinders from the test, in New Mexico or elsewhere.","In Christopher Nolan’s three-hour biopic “Oppenheimer,” released last week, the Manhattan Project comes to New Mexico largely because J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) wishes it so. The film was shot in the Land of Enchantment with a hastily assembled Ghost Ranch set serving as the film’s freshly constructed Los Alamos. “Oppenheimer” features New Mexico as setting, backdrop, and refuge for the transplant scientists and military men who spent World War II developing the atom bomb. The film does not show the people already living in New Mexico, neither before the first shovel hits the dirt nor after Trinity’s radioactive fallout creates the first downwinders.
Audiences leaving “Oppenheimer” will come away with a sense of the biography of the foundational figure in atomic history. Nolan’s film runs parallel narratives of Oppenheimer’s life from graduate school through Trinity, the 1954 closed-door hearing which upheld his security clearance revocation, and the 1959 confirmation hearing for Lewis Strauss’ nomination to be President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s commerce secretary.
The film capably describes how Oppenheimer built the first theoretical physics department at the University of California, Berkeley in the 1930s, next door to the radiation laboratory founded by Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett). It’s on a vacation with Lawrence and his brother Frank Oppenheimer (Dyland Arnold) in northern New Mexico that Oppenheimer quips that he would be truly happy if he could find a way to combine his two passions, New Mexico and Physics.
The discovery of atomic fission makes this possible, as Oppenheimer and others quickly realize a split atom can theoretically become the core of a powerful bomb. Soon, wartime demands and concern that German physicists might have a year head start lead the War Department to fund the creation of a secret research complex. Oppenheimer, together with General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) settle on the Los Alamos mesa.
“New Mexico was not remote and uninhabitable. Those were the very words that were used when they sited Los Alamos, that it was remote and inhabitable,” said Myrriah Gomez, assistant professor at UNM, at a panel after a Saturday screening of the film in Santa Fe. “Neither the project-wide site nor the Trinity site met the stipulations that the government required for either site.”
In the film, Oppenheimer and Groves find only a ranch school in their way. Left out of the film are the New Mexicans who lost land to the lab, did manual labor for it, and would be caught in the fallout from the world’s first atomic test.
“I knew clearly that this movie would be an over-glorification of the science and scientists, and there would be no reflection on the fact that without the people of New Mexico, we would not even have a Manhattan project for a trinity test,” said Tina Cordova, one of the founders of the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium.
They don’t talk about how New Mexicans did the dirtiest jobs, how we were part of building the roads and the bridges and the buildings. And then when that was completed, they sent us into the dirtiest jobs inside of the labs handling radioactive waste. – Tina Cordova, Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium
The panel was put on by a collection of nuclear threat reduction groups, led by Aligning Action in partnership with Nuclear Watch New Mexico, Ploughshares Fund, and Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium. The attendance, as remarked upon by a panelist, was largely white, and gray hair predominated among the crowd. There was an audience for a critique of New Mexico’s nuclear policy, but the scene at the panel was somewhat different than the crowds making “Barbenheimer” a historic weekend for multiplexes.
Uranium mined in New Mexico was part of that refined and used to fuel Gadget, the Trinity Test bomb, as well as Little Boy, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, and Fat Man, the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. The miners are not depicted in the film, and only slight mention is given to the work of uranium enrichment undertaken at Oak Ridge Tennessee or plutonium refining that occurred at the Hanford reactors in Washington State.
“They don’t talk about how New Mexicans did the dirtiest jobs, how we were part of building the roads and the bridges and the buildings. And then when that was completed, they sent us into the dirtiest jobs inside of the labs handling radioactive waste,” said Cordova. “They also didn’t depict the women that they bussed up there, Native women and the Hispanic women that literally cooked every meal, cleaned every house, changed every diaper, and made every baby bottle. They won’t show that in a film like this.”
After the second act of the film builds to the Trinity detonation, it takes careful detail capturing the reaction to the flash and then the sound wave from the assembled scientists. The thousands of residents of New Mexico who lived within 50 miles of the blast are given no screen time, or mention. The fallout, which the New York Times reported reached 46 states as well as Canada and Mexico, is not depicted or mentioned on screen.
“I have been dealing with a great deal of angst before watching this movie. It has left me with continued anger over the idea that they came to New Mexico when they established the Manhattan Project, invaded our lands and our lives, and they walked away. And when they made the Oppenheimer movie, they came here and took advantage of our tax incentives, they invaded our lands and our lives, and they walked away,” said Cordova. “It would’ve taken nothing away from this movie if they had added a panel at the very end and acknowledged our sacrifices.”
There is no such acknowledgement in the film of the existence of downwinders from the test, in New Mexico or elsewhere. Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” once assigns a number to the atomic dead, offering the 110,000 estimate produced by the US military in the 1940s. A higher estimate, of at least 210,000, was produced in the 1970s, and was the number used by panelists.
John C. Wester, Archbishop of Santa Fe, spoke against the continued and renewed development of nuclear weapons in the world and in his diocese. The Basilica of St. Francis “is only about roughly a hundred footsteps away from 109 East Palace Avenue, which was the gateway during the Manhattan Project,” said Wester, repeating a line he has honed in his appeals for disarmament. “And the secret was the Los Alamos lab that, as we just saw very dramatically, developed the atomic bomb that incinerated more than 200,000 souls at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In response, I seek to make the St. Francis Cathedral, in downtown Santa Fe, a gateway to universal, verifiable, global nuclear disarmament.”
The perils of the Atomic Age are not just the past harm done through bomb development, use in World War II, and testing before and after. It is the continued legacy of the bomb and its development, with Los Alamos as a crucial node in the nuclear enterprise, that adds urgency to righting the wrongs of the past.
“We’ve been slept-walked into a new nuclear arms race, arguably far more dangerous than the first,” said Wester. “I grew up in the duck-and-cover generation. Perhaps some of you remember that. I felt chills many decades later when I read that Robert McNamara, defense secretary during the Cuban Missile Crisis, said that we survived that crisis only by luck. Luck is not a sustainable strategy for the survival of the human family.”
Jay Coghlan, of Nuclear Watch New Mexico, emphasized the danger from renewed plutonium pit production at Los Alamos, which he sees as both unnecessary for nuclear deterrence, and as risking development of new nuclear weapons.
In the shadow of “Oppenheimer,” with its close focus on the policy fights at the dawn of the Atomic Age, it was clear that everyone felt the film, flaws and all, at least afforded a moment for the nation and the world to challenge the status quo on nuclear weapons. Still, another way to make that point stick home would have been to include what happened to the people of New Mexico, the first victims of nuclear colonialism and nuclear weapons.
When Gomez began her research, she interviewed her great aunt, in her 90s at the time, to ask what it was like when the Manhattan Project came to land where her family had lived.
“She had her hands about two feet apart. She said the bean plants were this high when the federal government came and bulldozed over them,” said Gomez. “These were people’s livelihoods. My great-grandfather took his crops and took them into town, and traded them or sold them. They were subsistence farmers. It wouldn’t have taken a lot of work to do that research to represent that New Mexico was not remote and uninhabited.”
In the blast sequence, too, Nolan could have found room to tell the stories of the people who lived in New Mexico long before Oppenheimer and Groves ever set to work on building a secret lab.
“It would’ve been fantastic if they would’ve included the histories that have been shared with us by the people that lived through the blast,” said Cordova. “The fact that I know people who told me stories about how they dropped to their knees, they got out of their car, they dropped to their knees and they started praying the rosary because they thought they were experiencing the end of the world. Or the mother that gathered up all of her children in bed with her and said, ‘If we’re gonna die, we’re all gonna die together.’”
“Those kinds of stories could have been easily depicted as part of this,” continued Cordova, “because I think some people are going to ask the question, maybe not, but some people will, you know: What happened to the surrounding area?”
In Nolan’s telling, that’s left up to the audiences’ imagination. It didn’t have to be.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc291cmNlbm0uY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMjgvbm9sYW5zLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXRyZWF0cy1uZXctbWV4aWNvLWFzLWEtYmxhbmstY2FudmFzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The cast of director Christopher Nolan’s hotly anticipated war-era drama “Oppenheimer” is standing united in the effort to support the SAG-AFTRA strike.
Stars of the film appeared on the red carpet of the film’s UK premiere on Thursday before the strike was officially announced, but they ended up walking out of the event “to write their picket signs,” according to Nolan.
Addressing the audience inside the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square theater before the screening began, as seen in videos posted to social media, Nolan acknowledged the work of Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh and Robert Downey Jr., among other “Oppenheimer” cast members.
“We have to acknowledge (that) you’ve seen them here earlier on the red carpet,” Nolan said, adding “unfortunately they’re off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by SAG.”
Nolan continued that the actors who left the “Oppenheimer” premiere in support of the union that represents them join “one of my guilds, the Writer’s Guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of the union, and we support them.”
The Writers Guild of America (WGA) has been on strike since May.
Blunt told Deadline on the “Oppenheimer” red carpet Thursday, prior to the cast walking out of the screening and prior to the strike’s official commencement, that her hopes were that “everyone makes a fair deal and we are here to celebrate this movie.”
“And if they call (the strike), we’ll be leaving together as a cast in unity with everyone,” Blunt said, adding, “We are gonna have to. So we will see what happens. Right now it’s the joy to be together.”
The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)’s president Fran Drescher announced in an impassioned speech during a press conference in Los Angeles on Thursday that the union will go on strike.
The strike is set to go into effect at midnight PT Thursday night.

As of Aug. 14, “Barbie” — a comedy starring Margot Robbie as the iconic doll who goes through an existential crisis — has crossed the $1 billion mark worldwide (earning $1.18 billion so far), making Gerwig the first solo female director to do so. But “Oppenheimer,” in which Cillian Murphy portrays the father of the atomic bomb, has also stood its ground, making $648 million globally — an amazing feat for a three-hour-long film based on a historical figure.
Though “Barbie” has held tightly onto the No. 1 spot at the domestic box office since its release, “Oppenheimer” has fought its way to the top in other major markets, including India and Hong Kong. And, both films have stirred up some controversy in various countries due to their themes — specifically, “Barbie’s” feminist undertones and “Oppenheimer’s” depiction of the creation of the bombs that were dropped in Japan — oftentimes making one the winner by default.

2023-07-20 09:00:39+00:00,Christopher Nolan and the Contradictions of J. Robert Oppenheimer,The biopic director argues that the physicist who oversaw creation of the atomic bomb was both the most important person who ever lived and hopelessly naïve.,"A quick question about the Trinity test, when Oppenheimer, Groves and the physicists and engineers set off the first nuclear bomb. How did you get that shot? Was some of it old footage from the test itself?
The way we approached [the] Trinity test was to forgo computer graphic imagery because I think computer graphics are inherently a bit safe, a bit anodyne, so I challenged my effects crew to come up with analog, real-world types of imagery that we could use to pull this off because we knew the Trinity test had to be a showstopper in the film. Some of the things they came up with were extremely small and microscopic that play as bigger. Some were absolutely massive and required all kinds of complicated safety protocols and involved the actors in some very small version of what it must have been like to be there out in the desert at night in those bunkers waiting to detonate that device.
It’s hard to believe you ginned this up in the short time since “Tenet.”
I wrote the script relatively quickly once I started writing, but I had a lot worked out beforehand.
Many years ago, I had written a script about the life of Howard Hughes that never got made because I wrote it right as Scorsese was making his own film. [Laughs] But I cracked the script to my satisfaction, and that gave me a lot of insight on how to distill a person’s life and how to view a person’s life in a thematic way, so that the film is more than the sum of its parts. So in some ways, the script, yes, it took me a few months, but it was really a culmination of 20 years of thinking.
As I do interviews and the film’s coming out, I’m always asked, do you know what you’re doing next?
And the answer is always the same. For me, I do one thing at a time and I put everything into it obsessively, and the film is not finished. Well, the way I like to put it is, the audience finishes the film.
So when the film goes out in cinemas that’s when the film is done and it becomes what it’s going to be in the culture. And that usually has a profound impact on where I go next. It’d be much more sensible to work on three things at once and have the next thing all lined up. A lot of filmmakers do that. I’ve just never been any good at it.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMjAvbW92aWVzL2NocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-20 20:23:42+00:00,"Could ‘Oppenheimer’ Finally Win Christopher Nolan, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Oscars?","""Oppenheimer"" could be a major Oscars player for Christopher Nolan, and stars Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt.","“Oppenheimer” has burst into the Oscar race.
With the earnest and urgent cultural fabric of “To Kill a Mockingbird” and the philosophical measure of “The Tree of Life,” writer, director and producer Christopher Nolan‘s chronicle of the creation of the most destructive weapon ever used stands as the most ambitious and vital piece of filmmaking of his career. Adapted from the book “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, “Oppenheimer” tells the complicated and morally fraught story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer who led the effort to develop the atomic bomb.
Nolan and his stellar ensemble of actors have amassed 27 Oscar nominations collectively throughout their careers. One of those who surprisingly hasn’t nabbed one is Irish actor Cillian Murphy, who plays the titular scientist. With dry wit and womanizing charm that effectively makes him the scientific version of Michael Fassbender in “Shame,” Murphy is an effective vehicle to lead the viewer through reams of scientific terminology. In addition, his tour-de-force performance, which is sure to be in real consideration for best actor, is best displayed when showcasing the emotional toll such a creation can have on a person. Lead actors from competitive best picture players, especially from biopics, have been consistently recognized over the past few decades in Oscar history (see Benedict Cumberbatch for “The Imitation Game” or Christian Bale for “American Hustle”). Murphy could find his time has come after decades of memorable turns in “28 Days Later” (2002) and “Breakfast on Pluto” (2006).

“Iron Man” himself, Robert Downey Jr., is afforded the best material to chew on of the supporting players as Lewis Strauss, one of the founding commissioners of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and a hostile figure to Oppenheimer following the hydrogen bomb development. A two-time nominee for “Chaplin” (1992) and “Tropic Thunder” (2008), the role and awards pathway could mimic Oliver Stone’s “JFK” (1991) and its supporting actor nominee Tommy Lee Jones who played Clay Shaw. Only one actor from a Nolan movie has ever won and been nominated for Oscar recognition, Heath Ledger for “The Dark Knight,” coincidentally beating RDJ for “Thunder.” Very early in the awards race, only Robert DeNiro from Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon” seems to be considered a viable contender after the film debuted at Cannes.
In what has been a consistent criticism of Nolan’s oeuvre, the women in “Oppenheimer” are given very little agency to the central narrative. Oscar nominee Florence Pugh (“Little Women”) is arguably one of the most exciting actors in Hollywood, and she is relegated to a brief storyline about her emotional instability in her mere minutes of screen time as Oppenheimer’s girlfriend and later mistress Jean Tatlock, a re-engineered Marion Cotillard from “Inception.”

Emily Blunt, who has been overdue for her first Oscar nom after multiple snubs for “The Devil Wears Prada” (2006), “A Quiet Place” (2018) and “Mary Poppins Returns” (2018), plays Kitty, Oppenheimer’s alcoholic wife, who is sufficiently depressed so as to ask a family friend to take their baby for a while. However, during a critical cross-examination scene, Nolan offers Blunt the opportunity to showcase the skill and biting line deliveries she’s displayed throughout her career. With a smirk and swag, Blunt may finally be able to snag her first nom for supporting actress, especially in a film that is an across-the-board contender.
Nolan himself has received five Oscar nominations during his career — “Memento” (2001) in original screenplay, “Inception” (2010) for original screenplay and best picture and “Dunkirk” (2017) for directing and picture. His second directing nom is well within arm’s reach in what I would call the most “un-Nolan” movie he’s ever made. Box office and strong reviews will only help Universal’s quest to get one of the leading filmmakers of the 21st century his first statuette (it would also help keep him happy to make more movies with them in the future). One noteworthy point: An “Oscar hat-trick” of winning picture, director and screenplay has only been achieved nine times, most recently by the Daniels for “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”
The technical artists will also be highly competitive in their respective races, notably production design (Ruth De Jong, Claire Kaufman), cinematography (Hoyte van Hoytema), costumes (Ellen Mirojnick), editing (Jennifer Lame), sound (Richard King, Michael W. Mitchell, Kevin O’Connell, Gary A. Rizzo) and original score (Ludwig Göransson).
Of all the movies screened up to this point this year, Nolan’s movie is one of two films that could have all the key ingredients to win the Academy Awards’ most coveted prize. It’ll be a colossal guild player (watch out for the SAG ensemble), and the regional critics could make it a darling during the precursor season. The ongoing strikes could have a ripple effect on films that are dropping in the later months, since their teams won’t be able to promote them in the same way as earlier titles.
“Barbenheimer” may be an internet sensation, but only one resonates with Oscar voters, and it’s the one without pink. It’s okay; the pink one will make all the bucks.
Of Nolan’s 11 previous movies, only three have been shut out of the Academy Awards — his debut “Following” (1998), “Insomnia” (2002) and “The Dark Knight Rises” (2012).

The collective force of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” continued to rule the box office in their second weekends of release, providing another needed jolt as two Hollywood strikes threaten the fragile exhibition industry.
Greta Gerwig’s cotton candy-colored fantasy comedy again led the way, adding a massive $93 million between Friday and Sunday. Ticket sales for “Barbie” declined just 43% from its debut and resulted in the seventh-biggest second weekend in history. The only movies that enjoyed bigger sophomore outings were billion-dollar behemoths “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” ($149 million), “Avengers: Endgame” ($147 million) and “Infinity War” ($114 million), “Black Panther” ($111 million), “Jurassic World” ($106 million) and “The Avengers” ($103 million).
Christopher Nolan’s dark historical drama also had a stellar sophomore outing, taking in a mighty $46.6 million over the weekend. According to Universal, it became the first R-rated film to gross more than $10 million for 10 days in a row.
“Weekend two proves the outpouring of interest in ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ a week ago was not a fluke,” says Paul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore analyst. “Both films put up second weekend numbers that would have been considered solid as debuts and reflect two of the best sophomore session holds in box office history.”
After two weeks on the big screen, “Barbie” has generated $351.4 million in North America to stand as the fourth-biggest domestic release of the year. Globally, the Warner Bros. film has grossed $774 million and ranks as the third-largest film of 2023.
“Oppenheimer,” meanwhile, has earned $174 million at the domestic box office and $400 million at the global box office. It has already outperformed the lifetime grosses of two prior Nolan efforts, “Tenet” ($365 million) and “Batman Begins” ($373 million).
Two new movies, Disney’s remake of “Haunted Mansion” and A24’s violent thriller “Talk to Me,” attempted to entice audiences in the wake of “Barbenheimer,” to varied results. (Of course, nobody could predict the dominant punch of the two blockbusters when release dates were set.)
“Haunted Mansion” debuted in third place with $24.6 million from 3,700 North American theaters. The film added $9.1 million at the international box office, bringing its worldwide tally to $33 million. It’s not a great result for a kid-centric tentpole and it probably didn’t help that the Halloween-esque film opened in July. Disney spent $150 million to produce the film and tens of millions on promotional efforts. So, the film has a high bar to reach profitability, at least in its theatrical run.
It doesn’t bode well that audiences were mixed on “Haunted Mansion,” which has a “B+” CinemaScore. Directed by Justin Simien and starring LaKeith Stanfield, Rosario Dawson, Tiffany Haddish and Owen Wilson, the film takes inspiration from the Disney theme park ride and follows a single mother and her son, who move into… a haunted mansion.
“Disney gets additional value from its productions for its other divisions — in this case, the film promotes its theme parks,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “But setting that aside, the movie has a long climb to break-even.”
The low-budget “Talk to Me” generated a healthy $10 million from 2,340 theaters across the U.S. Those ticket sales exceeded expectations and were enough to land in sixth place. It’s the second-biggest start in wide release ever for A24, following “Hereditary” with $13.6 million.
“Talk to Me” is the feature debut of Australian YouTube stars Danny and Michael Philippou. Reviews and word-of-mouth have been positive, which helped the film to break out at the box office. It centers on a group of friends who discovers how to conjure spirits, which is all fun and games until one of them unleashes a horrifying supernatural force.
“This is an excellent opening for an indie horror picture made on a budget of $4.5 million,” says Gross. “The horror genre continues to be a very creative space for new and developing talent.”
Elsewhere at the domestic box office, the independent juggernaut “Sound of Freedom” added $13.6 million from 3,411 theaters in its fifth weekend of release. The thriller about child sex trafficking has generated $150 million to date, making it the 12th-highest grossing domestic release of the year. Remarkably, “Sound of Freedom” has earned more money in North America than big-budget tentpoles like “Fast X” ($145 million), Pixar’s “Elemental” ($142 million) and Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” ($139 million).
“Mission: Impossible” took the No. 5 spot on domestic charts with $10.7 million from 3,191 venues in its third outing. Internationally, the film has generated $309.4 million for a global total of $448 million. Despite positive reviews, the $291 million-budgeted blockbuster has stumbled in the wake of “Barbenheimer” and will struggle to recover in its theatrical run.
Overall, the month of July was ahead by 1.4% compared to pre-pandemic times, while the entire box office for the year remains down roughly 20%.
“July would have been a lukewarm month, but then ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ arrived; moviegoing exploded,” says Gross. “Within one week, July caught up to its pre-pandemic average.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYmFyYmllLWJveC1vZmZpY2Utb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc2Vjb25kLXdlZWtlbmQtcmVjb3Jkcy0xMjM1NjgxMDM5L9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYmFyYmllLWJveC1vZmZpY2Utb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc2Vjb25kLXdlZWtlbmQtcmVjb3Jkcy0xMjM1NjgxMDM5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-05 20:42:53+00:00,Review: Oppenheimer is pure visual poetry,"Technically it's a biopic, but it doesn't play like one.","I'll admit I had my doubts when I first heard that director Christopher Nolan was planning to make a film about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the research effort to develop the first atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project. This is one of the most well-documented periods of 20th-century American history, after all, and there have already been so many books, films, and TV series about the race for the bomb, of varying quality. (As always, let me give a shout-out to Manhattan, a stellar fictional series that was tragically canceled after just two seasons.) How would Nolan make this very well-trodden material his own?
I needn't have fretted. With Oppenheimer, Nolan has gifted us a truly unique, unflinching, nuanced portrait of the enigmatic, complicated man who spearheaded the Manhattan Project and subsequently ran afoul of the ""red-baiting"" politics of the McCarthy era. Technically it's a biopic, but it doesn't play like one. It's more like Nolan carefully selected various threads running through Oppenheimer's life and wove them into a richly textured tapestry that somehow transcends those raw materials. The result is pure visual poetry.
(Spoilers below, although this is very well-documented history.)
Nolan's film is largely based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin (which I highly recommend). The trailers understandably focused on the drama surrounding the birth of the atomic bomb leading up to the Trinity Test, but I had hoped that the film as a whole would follow the book's arc and include Oppenheimer's subsequent fall from grace. And so it does. In fact, that later, darker part of Oppenheimer's life provides the lens through which his earlier successes play out in Nolan's film.
There are two basic storylines, and the film shifts back and forth between them; Nolan has never been one to strictly adhere to a chronological timeline. ""Fission"" is shot in color and follows Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) through his early years as a graduate student and college professor; his leadership of the Manhattan Project culminating with the Trinity Test; his simultaneous triumph and torment in the wake of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; and the eventual loss of his security clearance thanks in large part to early Communist connections and his outspoken opposition to developing a hydrogen bomb.
""Fusion"" is shot in IMAX black-and-white analog photography and follows the 1959 Senate confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission who—as the film gradually reveals—played a critical role in stripping away Oppenheimer's security clearance five years earlier, angering many in the physics community. The black mark against Oppenheimer's name wasn't fully cleared until December 2022—right around the time the first trailer for Oppenheimer appeared.

Nolan has assembled an amazing cast. David Krumholtz is almost unrecognizable as I.I. Rabi, and Benny Safdie is perfection as Edward Teller, who sharply disagrees with Oppenheimer about the hydrogen bomb and eventually betrays him during the security hearings. Emily Blunt shines in a relatively small role as Kitty Oppenheimer, who suffered from depression and had a volatile relationship with her philandering husband, but remained fiercely loyal to him. (She really did refuse to shake Teller's hand when Oppenheimer was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award in 1963.) But the film ultimately belongs to Murphy and Downey Jr., both of whom give Oscar-worthy performances. Their mutual antagonism is arguably the heart of the film.
Physics fans should have fun picking out the various physics luminaries who make brief cameos. Jack Quaid's Richard Feynman has few lines but is recognizable due to his bongos—an anachronism, since Feynman didn't take up the bongos until later in life, but an entertaining anachronism. Hey, there's Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer), Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), Leo Szilard (Máté Haumann), Enrico Fermi (Danny Deferrari), Luis Alvarez (Alex Wolff), Hans Bethe (Gustaf Skarsgård), Vannevar Bush (Matthew Moline), Kenneth Bainbridge (Josh Peck), and the infamous Klaus Fuchs (Christopher Denham).
Nolan brings an impressive degree of historical accuracy to the film without resorting to a slavish recitation of facts, seeding it with oodles of throwaway details and characters as ornamental flourishes. For instance, the truth about whether a young Oppenheimer really injected cyanide into an apple intended for one of his professors (future Nobel Prize winning physicist Patrick Blackett) is hotly debated by historians, but it was not invented for the film. I was pleased to see mention of the paper Oppenheimer co-authored with a student while at Berkeley in 1939 predicting black holes—a topic largely forgotten until John Wheeler's work in the 1960s. Even his signature cocktail gets a shout-out.
Oppenheimer's mistress, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), did commit suicide, and there is an assassination conspiracy theory that she was murdered and her suicide staged—something barely hinted at in the film, but present nonetheless. There was a certain amount of online shock at the nudity and sex scenes between Murphy and Pugh, but I thought they were carefully handled and weren't remotely gratuitous—especially the touching post-coital scene where the pair are simply sitting naked, having an intensely intimate conversation.
President Truman did call Oppenheimer a ""crybaby"" (albeit not to his face) when the latter met with him after the war and confessed he felt he had blood on his hands. It's also true that Oppenheimer never publicly expressed regret for his role in building a bomb that killed between 100,000 and 200,000 people. (The exact number is still a matter of debate.) As he says in the film, his thinking was that it would be better to make dropping the first nuclear weapon so horrifying that nobody would ever want to use them again.

The dialogue during the openly hostile interrogation of Oppenheimer at the security hearings was drawn almost verbatim from the official transcripts—delivered to dramatic perfection by Nolan's outstanding cast. One of the most powerful scenes is the (verbatim) testimony of physicist David Hill (Rami Malek) during Strauss' Senate confirmation hearing to be Eisenhower's Secretary of Commerce.
Strauss had hoped Hill, then chair of the Federation of American Scientists, would speak in his favor. Instead, Hill declared that ""most of the scientists in this country would prefer to see Mr. Strauss completely out of the Government,"" and went on to provide a devastating critique of Strauss, citing his arrogance, lack of integrity, and personal vindictiveness toward Oppenheimer in particular. (Nolan dug up the transcript himself from Senate records.) Strauss was not confirmed—the first failure of a Cabinet nomination since 1925—and the rejection effectively ended his political career. He remained bitter about that for the rest of his life. Some might call it karma.
That said, this is not a documentary, and naturally a few liberties were taken. Most notably, the powerful final conversation between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), referencing a conversation they'd had in the past, is entirely fictional. Nor is the actual physics front and center, since thematically, Nolan is far more interested in exploring questions of power, politics, patriotism, and personal internal paradoxes. Still, the film handily captures the world of physics and physicists. Case in point: in one scene, Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) questions Oppenheimer about the possible risk of igniting the atmosphere and destroying the world when they push the detonator button for the Trinity Test. ""Chances are near zero,"" Oppie responds. ""What do you want from theory alone?"" Groves responds, ""Zero would be nice.""
Those less familiar with this period in history might not pick up on all the ornamental details, but that shouldn't hamper their enjoyment of the film. Ars Senior Technology Editor Lee Hutchinson had quibbles with the sound quality, however, citing ""mumbling, background noise obscuring the dialog, and putting VFX behind dialog so the sound overpowered everything else."" That wasn't the case at the screening I attended (or at least, I didn't notice). Still, forewarned is forearmed, and there was also criticism about the sound mixing for Nolan's 2020 film, Tenet. Audiophiles, take note.
Clocking in at three hours' running time, with many scenes featuring a bunch of white men sitting around talking about physics and defense strategy, Oppenheimer is the antithesis of what is usually deemed summer fare. Yet Nolan's skill in telling the story is such that it never seems to drag. Small wonder audiences have been flocking to theaters to see the film. (Many made it a double feature with Barbie, hence the ""Barbenheimer"" phenomenon.) Oppenheimer greatly exceeded its initial box office projections and has already grossed over $400 million worldwide. It's my pick for best film of 2023 thus far, and a worthy addition to my growing list of films about the atomic bomb.

2023-07-10 19:00:32+00:00,"AMC Theatres Says More Than 20,000 Moviegoers Have Already Booked ‘Barbie’-‘Oppenheimer’ Double Features","Plenty of moviegoers are watching Christopher Nolan's atomic drama “Oppenheimer” and Greta Gerwig's colorful romp ""Barbie"" on the same day.","In the battle of the bomb vs. the bombshell… why not both?
Plenty of moviegoers are making the decision to watch Christopher Nolan’s atomic drama “Oppenheimer” and Greta Gerwig’s colorful romp “Barbie” on the same day when the two tentpoles hit theaters on July 21.
With two weeks to go until the big day, AMC Theatres, the world’s largest cinema chain, is reporting that more than 20,000 AMC Stubs members have purchased tickets to see “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” on the same day.
Though it was apparently significant enough for AMC to issue a press release, it’s hard to contextualize the statistic because there aren’t a lot of comparable data points for guests purchasing tickets to see multiple movies on the same day — at least not ones that are publicly available. Moreover, the total number of AMC Stubs members, which includes A-List, AMC Stubs Premiere and AMC Stubs Insider, is unclear. Adam Aron, the CEO of AMC, said in early 2020 there were between 900,000 and 1 million A-List subscribers, which starts at $19.95 per month.
“That more than 20,000 moviegoers have already made plans and purchased tickets to see Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day is a great sign that the growing online conversation around seeing both of these incredible films is turning into ticket sales,” says Elizabeth Frank, executive VP of worldwide programming and chief content officer at AMC Theatres. “Just as exciting, with 10 days to go until these movies open, this may only be the beginning. From Friday to today, we saw a 33% increase in the number of guests who decided to create their own double feature by purchasing tickets to see both movies on the same day. We are thrilled to see this momentum.”
On paper, it may not seem like these films are catering to similar audiences. “Oppenheimer,” starring Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt, is a dark and gritty three-hour-long story about the American theoretical physicist who led the efforts to build the weapons of mass destruction that ended World War II. Meanwhile, “Barbie,” led by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is a neon-hued fantasy comedy about Barbie-Land expats Barbie and Ken, who go on a quest of self-discovery in the real world.
But the clash of the blockbuster-hopefuls, which hail from two beloved filmmakers and happen to be scheduled on the same day, has become a full-fledged phenomenon known as “Barbenheimer.” The seemingly stark contrast between the $100 million-budgeted films has inspired countless memes, fan art and apparel.
According to early tracking, “Barbie” is expected to outpace “Oppenheimer” in terms of inaugural ticket sales. But there’s a chance that Tom Cruise’s big-budget sequel “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” which opens a week prior on July 12, could end up again in the top spot on domestic box office charts over the weekend.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVtaWVyLWRvdWJsZS1mZWF0dXJlcy1hbWMtdGhlYXRlcnMtMTIzNTY2NTYzMi_SAWJodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9uZXdzL2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlbWllci1kb3VibGUtZmVhdHVyZXMtYW1jLXRoZWF0ZXJzLTEyMzU2NjU2MzIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Any story about Oppenheimer has to also be a story of the many scientists who came together for the Manhattan Project — whom Thomas calls “the rock stars within the scientific framework of the day.” Nolan was adamant about not creating composite characters, and to make sure audiences could keep track, he wanted each figure to be played by not just great actors but also those with recognizable or distinctive faces. Rami Malek, who plays physicist David Hill, only appears in the film for several minutes, for example, and yet he makes a remarkable impression.
For Oppenheimer himself, a real rock star served as partial inspiration. Cillian Murphy says that the director would send him pictures of David Bowie from the late 1970s — “when he was so skinny and kind of emaciated but had these wonderful tailored suits with the trousers,” Murphy says. “That was the Oppenheimer silhouette.”
Of course, screen time wasn’t an issue for him; his character dominates the film. “I’ve played a physicist before, in a movie for Danny Boyle called Sunshine, so I must have resting physicist face,” Murphy says. “What became clear to me really quickly was that there’s no point in me trying to understand quantum mechanics. I don’t have the intellectual capability. My job is to go after the humanity.” Others arrived armed with a surprising amount of knowledge. Benny Safdie, who plays Edward Teller (now known as the father of the hydrogen bomb), studied nuclear physics in high school. “I was working with a physicist at Columbia University,” Safdie says. “I was doing cosmic rays. It is a deep passion of mine.”
Safdie, an acclaimed filmmaker himself, was stunned by how quickly Nolan and his crew were able to move through scenes of various physicists and politicians arguing, debating, and questioning. He recalls sitting in one location thinking, “We’re going to be here for a while because this is like seven, eight scenes, it’s a hundred people, it’s period. But we moved to a new location before lunch! I said, ‘I have no idea how you did that.’”
The constant hubbub of scientific activity is one of the engines of the film, and Nolan was determined to give his actors a lot of freedom to talk and move. “You look down, there’s no marks on the floor,” Downey says. “You wonder if you shouldn’t pace it up. And Chris says, ‘Don’t worry about that. That’s my problem.’”
Because everything in Oppenheimer moves so fast, Nolan and editor Lame later went through the film repeatedly for what they called “character passes” – watching each cut of the picture to make sure individual characters weren’t getting lost in the shuffle. Nolan likens it to making a bed and pulling on each corner of a sheet, or changing a tire and tightening lug nuts. “You have to tighten the corners opposite so that everything stays in balance.”
Many of the real-life figures had written books, so cast members came in with a broad sense of their lives. “I always like to empower the actors to try things if they have an idea,” Nolan says. “In the script, the scenes are very, very stripped down. So you have to push your actors to come in with a bigger sense of the world, and walk through the door into the scene knowing what they just said to the security guard outside or whatever coming in.”
The director points to a scene in the office of U.S. secretary of war Henry Stimson, played by James Remar, in which a group is picking targets for the atomic bomb. Remar learned that his character had honeymooned in Kyoto, and it’s a matter of record that the city was taken off the initial list of targets – but Remar and Nolan added a line about the honeymoon being one of the reasons why. “It has this bureaucratic quality of a group of men discussing massive destruction and how they’re going to do these awful things. And you’re suddenly seeing a human face to these negotiations,” Nolan says. “There are some nice awkward silences in the movie, and that’s one of my favorite.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktYmVoaW5kLXRoZS1zY2VuZXMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-24 14:28:33+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’: Robert Downey Jr. Says Cillian Murphy Made the Greatest ‘Sacrifice by a Lead Actor’ He’s Ever Seen in His 53-Year Career,"Robert Downey Jr. has raves for his ""Oppenheimer"" co-star.","Cillian Murphy is earning some of the best reviews of his career for leading Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer, but no praise might be higher than this rave from co-star Robert Downey Jr.: “I have never witnessed a greater sacrifice by a lead actor in my career,” the “Iron Man” star told People magazine about Murphy’s performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer.
“He knew it was going to be a behemoth ask when Chris called him,” Downey Jr. added. “But I think he also had the humility that is required to survive playing a role like this. We’d be like, ‘Hey, we got a three-day weekend. Maybe we’ll go antiquing in Santa Fe. What are you going to do?’ ‘Oh, I have to learn 30,000 words of Dutch. Have a nice time.’ But that’s the nature of the ask.”
“Oppenheimer” shot for 57 days, one of Nolan’s quickest film shoots, and Murphy is front and center in nearly every scene. The cast and crew lived together in the same hotel during the film’s production, but Murphy never joined his fellow ensemble for dinner due to the intensity of playing the lead role.
“Of course he didn’t want to come and have dinner with us,” Matt Damon previously told People magazine. “He couldn’t. His brain was just too full.”
Emily Blunt reasoned that Murphy did not attend cast dinners because “the sheer volume of what he had to take on and shoulder is so monumental.”
For Murphy, “Oppenheimer” marks the biggest leading role of his film career thus far. That kind of pressure isolated the actor. “You know that when you have those big roles, that responsibility, you feel it’s kind of overwhelming,” he told People.
Murphy also lost weight for the role, although he has not disclosed how much. The actor stars in the film as theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who was tasked with leading the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico in the effort to create the atomic bomb. Downey Jr. stars as Lewis Strauss, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission who later persecuted Oppenheimer for being a Soviet spy.
“Chris had one of the most incredible leads in Cillian,” Florence Pugh added to People. “He is an actor that I have been watching for quite some time and have been desperate to work with for ages. You’d have to be mad to say no. It was truly one of the best experiences that I’ve had.”
“Working with him was hugely impressive,” she added. “Every single day he shows up knowing every single possible way, intonation, inflection of how to bring this character to life. That was hugely impressive to me. There’s a reason why he is one of the greats.”

2023-07-17 22:31:23+00:00,Christopher Nolan and the ‘Oppenheimer’ cast discuss the atomic bomb and its chilling echoes today: ‘Humanity can only deal with one apocalypse at a time’,Christopher Nolan wants us to be wary of nuclear threat – and he’s not the only one.,"CNN —
“The bomb, Dimitri. The hydrogen bomb,” an exasperated US president reminds his Soviet counterpart in Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 classic “Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.”
As if the bomb could ever be forgotten. At the height of the Cold War, when mutually assured destruction was at its crazed height, nuclear warfare found itself abstracted through humor – perhaps the only reasonable way to treat something so fearsome. The bomb was a sick joke to be ridden, sometimes metaphorically, sometimes literally, a totem of mankind’s ingenuity and stupidity riveted shut and let fly. To look at it head-on was to be blinded by its glare; the power it wrought was too absurd — and too close — to countenance. Best to send in the clowns.
It would have seemed inconceivable then, but the atomic bomb did fade out of mind. In the 21st Century, other existential threats have reared their heads. Yet the nuclear threat feels closer today than it has for generations. And it’s precisely at this moment that Christopher Nolan is asking audiences to look it soberly in the eye.
“Our relationship with nuclear weapons is very complicated,” Nolan told CNN. “The fear ebbs and flows. It’s almost like humanity can only deal with one apocalypse at a time, and there’s so many issues to worry about.”
But worry many will after watching “Oppenheimer,” his latest and perhaps greatest film to date. As the name suggests, Nolan has taken on the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientific genius and conflicted godfather of the atomic bomb. Working in IMAX, the director conjures an overwhelming, altogether haunting retelling of the story of the bomb’s creation and its fallout across three taut hours that pushes the limits of the medium itself.

Nolan’s screenplay – written, unusually, in the first person – drew from definitive biography “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin, but stops short of its forensic take on the physicist. Flitting between color and monochrome – the director has described the former as a subjective and the latter an objective lens on events – we mostly experience the narrative through Oppenheimer’s eyes.
“We have to get the facts right. We have to be guided by history. But we’re trying to give the audience an experience. We’re trying to really entertain and engage in a meaningful way,” Nolan explained.
“It’s a subjective telling,” he added. “We’re trying to not judge the man. We’re trying to experience things with him and understand.”
Oppenheimer’s piercing blue stare is inhabited by Cillian Murphy, the director’s long-time collaborator and first-time leading man. “Oh, there was a man,” Murphy said of his character. “I was so exhilarated to be given the opportunity – it’s kind of a dream part. But it’s so multifaced and massive, so you just dive in.”
Murphy plays Oppenheimer from a young student in Cambridge in the 1920s through to the post-war McCarthy era and beyond, without the aid of distracting de-aging CGI (the physicist died in 1967). Around him swirls a who’s who of impeccably suited scientists, military men and politicians, along with the women in his life, wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) and lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) – a vast supporting cast in the truest sense.
“Watching Cillian and Chris together, it was two people at the height of their abilities,” said Matt Damon, who stars as Leslie Groves, the brusque general overseeing the Manhattan Project.
“It felt the most like watching when Spielberg did ‘Saving Private Ryan,’” he added, “watching Chris Nolan with a story that’s worthy of his vast ability. Everybody could feel it, so everybody came with everything they had and was like, ‘Alright, how do we support this?’”
A threat renewed
For most of Nolan’s considerable cast, Oppenheimer’s invention set the backdrop for their upbringings. “This was our existential threat growing up,” recalled Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and later a political operator.
“We did grow up at this time, but it’s almost too much to engage with, so you push it out,” said Damon. “It’s like we’ve all been living under this sword of Damocles for 80 years … Our kids, it’s not part of their experience to the extent that it should be.”

Nolan knows this only too well. “I told one of my teenage sons what I was working on,” he recalled. “He said to me, ‘Well, does anybody really worry about that anymore?’ This was a couple of years ago. By the time we finished shooting the film, unfortunately he wasn’t asking that question anymore.”
Russia invaded Ukraine days before cameras started rolling, noted Murphy, and it was under that cloud that filming began in New Mexico, at a stand in for the Los Alamos HQ for the Manhattan Project.
The film has taken on troubling relevance, especially the passages set post-war, documenting an arms race that Oppenheimer warned against. Its examination of his legacy, from the physicist’s perspective and the people around him, forms a devastating and complex coda.

Today, the ethical debate surrounding the bomb remains undimmed. But even if a war involving a nuclear power hadn’t erupted in Europe in 2022, Nolan believes “Oppenheimer” contains crossover anxieties.
“(Nuclear war) is unique in the threats that we face, but it also relates to a lot of our relationship – and particularly young people’s relationship – with technology and technological innovation,” he said. “Because ultimately, the atomic bomb, awful though it is and was, it was an incredible technological innovation.”
Eighty years after the Trinity Test, technological innovation looks like artificial intelligence (AI), he offered, and the potential dangers of “unleashing those things on the world.”
“A lot of the scientists I speak to, a lot of the people who work in the tech sector I speak to, they worry about this,” he added. “They see what they’re doing as their Oppenheimer moment, and they look to his story to give some kind of guidance as to how the relationship between science, technology, government and society should function.
“I don’t know whether Oppenheimer’s story has answers to that,” he added. “It certainly raises the questions, and in a way that I think we will find quite chilling.”
""A lot of the scientists I speak to ... they see what they're doing as their Oppenheimer moment,"" Nolan said of the rise of AI. Universal Pictures
Kubrick had us laugh at the bomb because it felt like an appropriate coping mechanism. Now Nolan’s fierce and sincere contemplation will awaken a new generation to its horrors – and that feels appropriate too.
For a director obsessed with the workings of time, the arrival of his latest movie is uncanny. But one senses the film will outlive this moment, and only burnish his reputation as one of the few blockbuster directors with the clout to pull off working at this scale.
“There’s always been this mystique around Nolan,” Downey Jr. shared. “The spring-into-summer that the first ‘Iron Man’ came out (in 2008), people were like, ‘Oh, this will do until “The Dark Knight” comes out.’ So, you’re like, ‘Oh, it’s not a Chris Nolan.’”
“He’s a master filmmaker, there’s no denying it,” he added, “and you don’t get many of those per generation.”
“I think this film is kind of the apotheosis of his talent as a director,” said Murphy. “To have had the privilege of working with him over the years and seeing him move towards this, it’s phenomenal to witness.”

,Robert Downey Jr. Declares 'Oppenheimer' the 'Best Film I've Ever Been In',"Robert Downey Jr. said the Christopher Nolan-directed historical drama 'Oppenheimer' is the ""best film I’ve ever been in"" at the movie's London premiere on July 13, before walking out in solidarity with the SAG strike.","Marvel fans, cover your ears!
According to Robert Downey Jr., Oppenheimer is the best film he has acted in.
At the London premiere of the Christopher Nolan-directed historical drama on Thursday, the Iron Man star, 58, revealed that the movie is a career-best for him, according to a video shared by Deadline on Twitter.
“Just going to flat out say it: This is the best film I’ve ever been in,” he said in the video, a declaration that was met with cheers from the premiere audience at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square. “I cannot wait for you all to experience it.”
Downey — who portrays Lewis Strauss, primary antagonist of titular physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) — goes on to say that “no matter what your expectations are” going into the dark period piece, which follows the effort to create an atomic bomb during World War II, it “transcends that.”

""This is what a summer blockbuster, when I was growing up, used to be,” he continued. “It just kind of, like, changed your life. But again, you know, it’s why Chris Nolan is who he is.
Downey’s interview came just before he and his castmates walked out of the premiere in solidarity with the Hollywood actors' strike.
When he and his Oppenheimer costars including Murphy, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett and Emily Blunt left the theater after walking the red carpet, Nolan, 52, addressed their sudden absence in relation to SAG-AFTRA's then-looming strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP).
""We have to acknowledge, you've seen them here earlier on the red carpet,” the director said, as captured by another Deadline-shared video. “Unfortunately, they're off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by SAG.”
He continued, ""Joining one of my guilds, the Writers Guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of their union, and we support them.”
Before her departure, Blunt, 40, who plays Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty, told Deadline, “If they call [a strike], we’ll be leaving together as a cast in unity with everyone. We're gonna have to.""
“But right now, it’s the joy to be together,” the A Quiet Place star added.

In a new interview with The New York Times Magazine, Downey opened up about his journey as an actor post-Iron Man, which began with Dolittle — a film that flopped hard following its 2020 release.
“I finished the Marvel contract and then hastily went into what had all the promise of being another big, fun, well-executed potential franchise in Dolittle,” he told the magazine. “I had some reservations. Me and my team seemed a little too excited about the deal and not quite excited enough about the merits of the execution.”

“But at that point I was bulletproof,” he explained. “I was the guru of all genre movies.”
Thankfully, Downey told the outlet, his post-Marvel career eventually led him to Oppenheimer. “Then old Chris Nolan calls, and getting to see the spartan, almost monastic way he approaches this art form, it was like going to the other side of the moon,” he said.
Oppenheimer premieres in U.S. theaters July 21.

6/22/2023 19:52,Early word on 'Oppenheimer' is that it's horrifying,"Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer,"" which filmed several scenes in the Bay Area, has drawn emotional reactions from early screenings.","Cillian Murphy stars as physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer in the 2023 film, “Oppenheimer.” The scientist was the leader of America's Manhattan Project, which created the first nuclear weapons. Universal Pictures
Few things are more terrifying than nuclear war, and it’s looking like Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” film captures that terror.
“Oppenheimer” has been shaping up to be one of the summer’s largest blockbusters (although it will have stiff competition on opening weekend from Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie”). The biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer, one of the primary scientists behind the creation of the atomic bomb, was filmed partially in Berkeley, where Oppenheimer taught as a professor. In a lesser-known local connection, Oppenheimer’s brother Frank also founded San Francisco children’s museum the Exploratorium.
Wednesday, Variety reported that early reactions to the film have been visceral, to say the least. The accounts come from a Wired interview with Nolan himself, so they should be taken with a grain of salt, but he noted that those who’ve seen the film have had intense emotional reactions. One of Nolan’s fellow filmmakers, who was not named in the story, said, “It’s kind of a horror movie.”

“Some people leave the movie absolutely devastated,” Nolan said to Wired. “They can’t speak. I mean, there’s an element of fear that’s there in the history and there in the underpinnings. But the love of the characters, the love of the relationships, is as strong as I’ve ever done.”
Oppenheimer biographer Kai Bird, whose 2005 book served as the source material for the film, echoed Nolan’s sentiments in an interview with the Institute for Advanced Study. “I am, at the moment, stunned and emotionally recovering from having seen it.”
The film is set to be released July 21, and given that it was filmed specifically for IMAX, audiences would do well to view it on the biggest screen possible. Tickets are available for IMAX showings at AMC Bay Street 16 in Emeryville, Veranda Luxe in Concord, AMC Dine-In Sunnyvale 12, Cinemark Century Daly City 20, and AMC Santa Clara. It will be presented in IMAX in San Francisco at AMC Metreon 16.

2023-07-21 19:56:20.827000+00:00,"‘Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds.’ The Story of Oppenheimer’s Infamous Quote","The Robert Oppenheimer quote, from the Hindu sacred text the Bhagavad Gita, has come to define the father of the atomic bomb, but its meaning is more complex than many realize","Seeking his counsel, Arjuna asks Krishna to reveal his universal form. Krishna obliges, and in verse 12 of the Gita he manifests as a sublime, terrifying being of many mouths and eyes. It is this moment that entered Oppenheimer’s mind in July 1945. “If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one,” was Oppenheimer’s translation of that moment in the desert of New Mexico.
In Hinduism, which has a non-linear concept of time, the great god is involved in not only the creation, but also the dissolution. In verse 32, Krishna says the famous line. In it “death” literally translates as “world-destroying time,” says Thompson, adding that Oppenheimer’s Sanskrit teacher chose to translate “world-destroying time” as “death,” a common interpretation. Its meaning is simple: Irrespective of what Arjuna does, everything is in the hands of the divine.
“Arjuna is a soldier, he has a duty to fight. Krishna, not Arjuna, will determine who lives and who dies and Arjuna should neither mourn nor rejoice over what fate has in store, but should be sublimely unattached to such results,” says Thompson. “And ultimately the most important thing is he should be devoted to Krishna. His faith will save Arjuna’s soul."" But Oppenheimer, seemingly, was never able to achieve this peace. “In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no overstatements can quite extinguish,” he said, two years after the Trinity explosion, “the physicists have known sin; and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.”
“He doesn’t seem to believe that the soul is eternal, whereas Arjuna does,” says Thompson. “The fourth argument in the Gita is really that death is an illusion, that we’re not born and we don’t die. That’s the philosophy, really. That there’s only one consciousness and that the whole of creation is a wonderful play.” Oppenheimer, perhaps, never believed that the people killed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki would not suffer. While he carried out his work dutifully, he could never accept that this could liberate him from the cycle of life and death. In stark contrast, Arjuna realizes his error and decides to join the battle.
“Krishna is saying you have to simply do your duty as a warrior,” says Thompson. “If you were a priest you wouldn’t have to do this, but you are a warrior and you have to perform it. In the larger scheme of things, presumably, the bomb represented the path of the battle against the forces of evil, which were epitomized by the forces of fascism.”
For Arjuna, it may have been comparatively easy to be indifferent to war because he believed the souls of his opponents would live on regardless. But Oppenheimer felt the consequences of the atomic bomb acutely. “He hadn’t got that confidence that the destruction, ultimately, was an illusion,” says Thompson. Oppenheimer’s apparent inability to accept the idea of an immortal soul would always weigh heavy on his mind.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tYW5oYXR0YW4tcHJvamVjdC1yb2JlcnQtb3BwZW5oZWltZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Matt Damon told his wife he would take a break — unless Christopher Nolan called,Matt Damon negotiated a 'Nolan exemption' in couples therapy with his wife. He and Cillian Murphy reveal how Christopher Nolan recruited them for 'Oppenheimer.',"Matt Damon likes to stay busy.
Over the last couple of years, the actor has starred in Air (which he also produced), The Last Duel (which he produced and co-wrote), and Stillwater, and also made cameo appearances in Thor: Love and Thunder and No Sudden Move. Before Christopher Nolan called Damon to offer him the role of General Leslie Groves in his historical drama-thriller Oppenheimer (out July 21), the actor — who previously appeared in Nolan's 2014 science fiction epic Interstellar — had told his wife, Luciana, that he would take some time off. So how did Damon play the role of Groves in the movie, about ""father of the atomic bomb"" J. Robert Oppenheimer, without breaking his word? Turns out the actor had secured what future generations may well call ""the Nolan exemption"" in this spousal agreement.

""This is going to sound made up, but it's actually true,"" Damon reveals in EW's Around the Table with Nolan and costars Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr. ""I had — not to get too personal — negotiated extensively with my wife that I was taking time off. I had been in Interstellar, and then Chris put me on ice for a couple of movies, so I wasn't in the rotation, but I actually negotiated in couples therapy ­— this is a true story — the one caveat to my taking time off was if Chris Nolan called. This is without knowing whether or not he was working on anything, because he never tells you. He just calls you out of the blue. And so, it was a moment in my household.""
""So, even modern psychology has a caveat…"" says Downey in the video, which you can watch above.
""For Chris!"" says Damon.
""Just checking,"" says Downey. ""You heard it here first!""

As a result, Damon can be seen in the film playing Groves, the general who oversaw the Manhattan Project, where the United States' atomic weapons were created, alongside costars Murphy as Oppenheimer, Blunt as the physicist's wife Kitty, and Downey as Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss.
Murphy has been a stalwart supporting player in several of Nolan's previous movies, including 2005's Batman Begins and 2010's Inception. But, like Damon, the Irish actor was unaware the director had even written a script about Oppenheimer until Nolan called him up and asked if he was interested in playing the movie's titular physicist.

""Chris' way of operating is that he just calls you out of the blue,"" says Murphy. ""I genuinely had no idea. He said he was making a movie about Oppenheimer and he said, 'I'd like you to play Oppenheimer.' I had to sit down. It was kind of overwhelming.""
Nolan admits that his habit of phoning Murphy without warning to offer him roles does have a downside. ""[It's] a fun way to do it,"" says the director to the actor. ""But it means that it's very difficult to call you to go out to dinner or something. Because every time you answer the phone it's like, what's it going to be?""

2023-07-24 13:00:00+00:00,Is Oppenheimer Streaming on Netflix or Peacock? How to Watch Oppenheimer Now,"'Oppenheimer,' Christopher Nolan's highly anticipated new film, premieres on July 21. Here's how to watch and stream the movie online.","If you're anyone who's been on the Internet within the past month, you've definitely, definitely heard of Oppenheimer and Barbie. The two films are set to face off at the box office on the same massive weekend for cinema, as both officially were released into the world on July 21. While some moviegoers plan to see just one film or the other, some are determined to see both, potentially even on the same day. The weekend is likely the biggest movie event since the pandemic began.
At the heart of the fanfare is Christopher Nolan's newest film, Oppenheimer. The biopic follows J. Robert Oppenheimer, the famed theoretical physicist who helped create the atomic bomb. The film delves into both his personal and professional life, along with the internal turmoil of creating and utilizing the deadliest weapon known to man. The film boasts a stacked cast, including Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr.
Reviews are in from Rotten Tomatoes, and it's clear the film is one of Nolan's best (although as we've found in our ranking, he has yet to make a true dud). Anyone who's a fan of masterful cinema, or just a history buff, should enjoy watching Oppenheimer. You won't want to miss it, especially because you can combine it with the lighthearted Barbie to brighten your day after watching such a serious film.
So if you're convinced and want to watch Oppenheimer, buckle up. The excitement for the film has made it near impossible to grab a seat for the film's first weekend, which means you might have to wait later in the theatrical run to see it, or wait until it heads to a streaming platform. Here's when that may happen.
How to Watch Oppenheimer
Right now, Oppenheimer is only available to watch in theaters. Movies usually have a theatrical run of at least a month, and it can be extended if the film does particularly well. Oppenheimer may be in theaters for a while yet, so if you want to see it, snag your tickets now.
When Will Oppenheimer Head to Streaming?
While it's not clear when the film will go to streaming, it's possible to guess where the film will go when it does inevitably head to a platform. The film is distributed by Universal Pictures, which is owned by NBCUniversal. It's likely Oppenheimer will head to Peacock when it does go to a streaming platform. As for when that may be, it's possible by the fall the film will be available, but on-demand and streaming transition is at the discretion of the distributor.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNoZWFsdGguY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYTQ0NTkxMjY3L2hvdy10by13YXRjaC1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1zdHJlYW1pbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-15 13:20:24-04:00,My Reason for Not Watching Oppenheimer (A Perspective from Hiroshima),"On August 6, my mind kept going back to where my grandfather was the day the US bombed Hiroshima.","Read more of UCS’s critical analysis of Oppenheimer and the global security issues it examines here.
As we approached August 6 this year, the 78th anniversary of the US atomic bombing of Hiroshima, my mind kept going back to the basement of Chugoku Electric Power Company, 800 meters (half a mile) from the hypocenter, where my grandfather was that day. I witness how the force of the nuclear bomb can destroy the human body, how the vacuum of a nuclear explosion can gouge out a child’s eyeballs, how the atomic burns peel the skin, swell and corrode the face in ways humanity had never seen. According to one review , the filmmaker focuses on the face of Oppenheimer rather than showing the carnage of his bomb.
From a few minutes of an interview with the ﬁlmmaker, I can see that spectators of his movie will safely assume that the characters have all the possible means to escape to minimize their exposure to radiation. Such a space was never offered to people at ground level in Hiroshima and Nagasaki on those critical days. The mushroom-shaped cloud created by the explosion was depicted over and over again in the trailer for the film. But this is a symbol of ashes to the people of my community. That cloud contained the flesh and bones of our grandparents.

The G7 Summit
This past May, I was in Hiroshima, the city where I was born and raised, and witnessed the G7 summit from ground level. Six Western nations–Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, and Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who had survived a murder attempt by a fisherman one month prior, gathered to strengthen their ties. The city was paralyzed. Police from all over Japan were there, schools were closed for five days, and there were so many road closures that people stayed home and watched it on TV.
Biden entered Japan through Iwakuni, a US military base, while others used Japanese airport/gate of the independent nation. Other leaders also stayed in a Japanese hotel in Ujina near the Setouchi sea shore where they had the summit. Biden headed straight to an American-owned hotel (Hilton) in the city center, stopping all the traffic at the center of the city near ground Zero. Local TV camera persons were trying to capture a presidential aide who carried the “nuclear football,” which is always with the US President and enables him to launch a nuclear strike anywhere in the world.
People watched as Prime Minister Kishida spoke of progress in nuclear disarmament talks. Leaders promised the president of Ukraine to provide weapons, including depleted uranium munitions, “for as long as it takes” said Biden, to win the war. This was said in the city of Hiroshima –where people have shared a common understanding for 78 years that they must never betray the hibakushas (atomic bomb sufferers) who pray for World Peace, and live with the fear of radiation illness and dying of cancer with excruciating pain.
During the Summit, Biden paid a visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, known to locals as Atomic Bomb Park, a memorial to those who experienced the massive force of the atomic explosion. It is a landmark of human tragedy and our entering of the nuclear age. Kazumi Matsui, the Mayor of Hiroshima, visited the US Embassy in Tokyo soon after the summit to sign a Sister Parks Agreement between the Atomic Bomb Park and Pearl Harbor National Memorial Park.
Pearl Harbor Memorial Park commemorates the battle between the United States and Japan that began with the attack by Japanese forces on Pearl Harbor. It commemorates the deaths of over 2,000 U.S. sailors and soldiers, as well as 68 civilians caught in the crossfire. The Sister Park Agreement indicates an official consensus between the City of Hiroshima and the United States that the war began with an (unjustified) attack on Pearl Harbor and ended with the (justified) dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The Hiroshima Alliance for Nuclear Weapons Abolition (HANWA) is a local group formed by descendants of hibakushas and allies. They warned citizens of Hiroshima, in the midst of the festive G7 Summit, that agreements like this put the city on the fast track to being transformed beyond recognition, with a narrative that lacks historical accuracy, and obliterates the past.
Ms. Haruko Moritaki, a descendant of hibakusha and Representative of HANWA facing the final stages of cancer, sat in a Citizens’ Assembly meeting on May 17th, 2023. She commented on President Obama’s remarks during his brief visit to the Atomic Bomb Park in 2016, the first sitting US president to visit Hiroshima since the war. Obama delivered a brief speech, saying: Seventy-one years ago, on a bright, cloudless morning, death fell from the sky and the world was changed. Ms. Moritaki said, “Death didn’t fall from the sky. The death was brought by the United States dropping of the bomb …over human beings.”
President Biden didn’t deliver a speech when he visited the Atomic Bomb Park. He had nothing to say to the people of Hiroshima.
My role as an artist
As a visual artist, educator, and a third-generation hibakusha who now lives in the United States, I have visited many nuclear sites in the country over the years to grasp the American nuclear narrative. I have witnessed how development of nuclear technology forever changed the land and continues to divide communities and oppress the vulnerable.
As an artist in the year 2023, I am part of a community asked constantly to address ethical questions regarding what is at stake in a work of art: Who is telling the story? Who is silenced in the process? Who is assumed to be the viewer in a given context? I wonder, was the filmmaker asked, or did he ask himself these same questions?
We have heard enough from those benefiting from the current power structure who can relate to the man responsible for leveling two cities but not to the more than 200,000 people who were killed, along with the rest of the city’s inhabitants who were left injured, facing slow and horrible deaths from radiation exposure.
So again, I ask: What is the framework around the production of a film that constitutes historical suffering? How do you address the issue while being respectful of the difficult and often painful feelings triggered by the film? It is a filmmaker’s moral duty to decide how these images are purveyed without reinstating trauma.
In solidarity with those not pictured
In an article titled “The Racial Underpinnings of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings,” Elaine Scarry notes that on September 18, 1944, US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met at Roosevelt’s Hudson Valley estate. A written recording reveals that Japan had been designated as the target for the bombings nearly seven months before Germany surrendered on May 7,1945. The training taking place in the Pacific for the mission to drop the bomb on Japan was initiated in that same month, which further supports the content of the meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill. The historical records indicate yet again the way nuclear development prevents white nations from becoming victims of nuclear atrocities.
Scarry quotes Langston Hughes, who commented in 1953: (Until racial injustice ceases in the United States), “it is going to be very hard for some Americans not to think the easiest way to settle the problems of Asia is simply dropping an atom bomb on colored heads there.”
Scarry goes on: The cruelty daily inflicted on people of color in our own city streets acts as a mental rehearsal for carrying out large-scale slayings abroad. It keeps our capacity for cruelty limber; it dulls the mind and gives us practice in pronouncing the word “expendable.”
My friend Petuuche Gilbert of Acoma Pueblo in New Mexico, who works tirelessly to draw attention to the ongoing contamination of his people from uranium mining, said to me, “I want to see the film acknowledges [sic] the entire story of the nuclear bomb’s impact not only upon its first victims but upon the lives of indigenous peoples also living with its legacy of development and application. I want the film to mention indigenous peoples whose land was taken to build and test the bomb. I want it to tell and comprehend the tragedies of the nuclear fuel chain.”
He added “Manifest destiny was necessary to build America and have what it is today—American power and supremacy.”
At the G7, in Obama’s speech, in the Sister Park Agreement, and now yet again in Oppenheimer, we see the erasure of the hibakusha and their experiences, the supremacy of war and national power over the people harmed by that supremacy.
No, I do not need to watch the film and be retraumatized.
My solidarity is with the people not pictured, those who continue to suffer.

Christoper Nolan’s latest epic “Oppenheimer” began its domestic box office marathon with a whopping $10.5 million in Thursday preview grosses. That’s a staggering total for what is essentially a 3-hour, R-rated grimdark drama mostly concerned with men in suits having cryptic conversations about science and politics.
It’s also around double the preview grosses for “Interstellar” ($4.8 million in 2014) and “Dunkirk” ($5.5 million in 2017), pointing toward an opening weekend figure well above those films’ respective $49 million and $50 million Fri-Sun debuts.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXRodXJzZGF5LWJveC1vZmZpY2UtY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

This time Nolan wanted him to be the titular character, the iconic, charismatic, controversial theoretical physicist who oversaw the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. “Oppenheimer” opens in theaters on July 21 and features a starry cast including Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr. Much of it remains shrouded in secrecy until then.","By LINDSEY BAHR (AP Film Writer)
The day Christopher Nolan called Cillian Murphy about his new film, “Oppenheimer,” Murphy hung up the phone in disbelief.
The Irish actor, though a regular presence in Nolan films going back almost two decades, had always been a supporting player. This time, Nolan wanted him to lead.
“He’s so understated and self-deprecating and, in his very English manner, just said, ‘Listen, I’ve written this script, it’s about Oppenheimer. I’d like you to be my Oppenheimer,’” Murphy, 47, told The Associated Press earlier this year. “It was a great day.”
For Murphy, it is never not exciting to get a call from Nolan. It’s just hard to predict if he’s going to. He knows there are some movies he’s right for and some movies he isn’t.
“I have always said publicly and privately, to Chris, that if I’m available and you want me to be in a movie, I’m there. I don’t really care about the size of the part,” he said. “But deep down, secretly, I was desperate to play a lead for him.”
Murphy first met Nolan in 2003. He was brought in to screen test for Batman — not just the movie, the character. Murphy knew he wasn’t right for the Dark Knight, but he wanted to meet the man who’d directed “Insomnia” and “Memento.” They hit it off and Murphy got to tap into a sinister intensity to play the corrupt psychiatrist Dr. Crane/Scarecrow, who would go on to appear in all three films. Nolan would also call on Murphy to be the conflicted heir to a business empire in “Inception” and a traumatized soldier in “Dunkirk.”
“We have this long-standing understanding and trust and shorthand and respect,” Murphy said. “It felt like the right time to take on a bigger responsibility. And it just so happened that it was a f—ing huge one.”
Soon after the phone call, Nolan flew to Dublin to meet Murphy and hand him a physical copy of the script, which he devoured right there in Nolan’s hotel room. It was, he said, the best he’d ever read.
Then the scale of it started to sink in.
This would be a film about the charismatic and controversial theoretical physicist who helped create the atomic bomb. Oppenheimer and his peers at Los Alamos would test it on July 16, 1945, not knowing what was going to happen. There was a non-zero chance that the heat from the explosion could set off a chain reaction that would ignite the atmosphere and literally set the world on fire.
It didn’t, but several weeks later the United States would drop those bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing tens of thousands of people and leaving many with lifelong injuries. Soon, the United States was at work to strengthen its nuclear arsenal, developing plans to work on an even more catastrophic weapon: the hydrogen bomb.
As Nolan has said, “Like it or not J. Robert Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived.”
“Oppenheimer,” which opens in theaters on July 21, features a starry cast including Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty, Matt Damon as the man who hired Oppenheimer for the job at Los Alamos, Robert Downey Jr. as a founder of the Atomic Energy Commission and many more rounding out the pivotal players in and around this tense moment in history.
“You realize this is a huge responsibility. He was complicated and contradictory and so iconic,” Murphy said. “But you know you’re with one of the great directors of all time. I felt confident going into it with Chris. He’s had a profound impact on my life, creatively and professionally. He’s offered me very interesting roles over and I’ve found all of them really challenging. And I just love being on his sets.”
Murphy continued: “Any actor would want to be on a Chris Nolan set, just to see how it works and to witness his command of the language of film and the mechanics of film and how he’s able to use that broad canvas within the mainstream studio system to make these very challenging human stories.”
Over the years, Murphy has come to appreciate that with Nolan there’s always something deeper to discover than what’s literally on the page. “Dunkirk,” he recalled, was only 70 pages and there wasn’t much to his character, not even a name.
“He said, ‘Look, let’s figure it out together and you and me can find an emotional journey for the character.’ And we did it. We did it out in the water on that boat. That comes from trust and respect,” Murphy said. “I’m really proud of that performance.”
As with all Nolan endeavors, secrecy around “Oppenheimer” is vitally important. Murphy loves the “old-fashioned approach” that builds interest and anticipation.
“There’s an awful lot to talk about when we can talk freely,” Murphy said with a smile.
The difference from other Nolan originals, even “Dunkirk,” is that “Oppenheimer” is rooted in historical fact and actual transcripts. You can read the book it’s based on, Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.” You can watch the 1981 documentary “The Day After Trinity” on The Criterion Channel.
And you can try to parse Nolan’s words for clues. He’s talked about recreating the Trinity test, the fascinating paradoxes, the twists, turns and ethical dilemmas; for him, the story is cinematic and both dream and nightmare. But ultimately, it’s something that just needs to be seen.
“The question will be how Chris presents it,” Murphy said. “I think people will be very surprised and wowed by what he does. Anything I say will just seem a bit lame as compared to seeing this in an IMAX theater.”
The time for discussions will be after the movie comes out. But Murphy did offer up that they worked hard to get Oppenheimer’s look right, from the narrow silhouette to the pipe and the porkpie hat. Oppenheimer, he said, “seemed aware of his own potential mythology.” But, again, those conversations will have to wait.
“I’m really proud of the movie and I’m really proud of what Chris has achieved. This was, for sure, a special one, certainly because of the history with me and Chris. We were not walking around the set high-fiving, but it did feel special.” Murphy said. “It’s an event every time he releases a film, and rightly so. Whether I’m in them or not, I always go to see his movies.”

,Oppenheimer’s science beyond the Manhattan Project,Explore everything Los Alamos is doing,"What about J. Robert Oppenheimer as a scientist stands out after all these years? Mark Paris, a theoretical physicist at Los Alamos, takes a look at some of the high points in a column for Physics Today, tracing Oppenheimer’s important contributions to the emergence of quantum theory. Oppenheimer achieved influential work in the spectral properties of molecules, offered an understanding of cosmic rays and neutron stars, and predicted what would come to be called “black holes.” Much of that work came while founding the leading school of theoretical physics in America.
Paris traces that work while also exploring Oppenheimer’s relationship with experimental physics, an appreciation that would serve him well as director of the Manhattan Project.

At the age of 20, he walked up to the door of the Corcadorca Theatre Company in his hometown of Cork, Ireland, and knocked. He told the person who answered that he’d be interested in getting involved in any upcoming shows, and the man suggested he try out for a new play called “Disco Pigs,” about a pair of reckless teenagers. It was Murphy’s first audition, and he got the part.
The Enda Walsh play was a big success, moving to larger and larger theaters and eventually leading to a film adaptation in 2001 from director Kirsten Sheridan. That film caught the eye of filmmaker Danny Boyle, then looking to cast a fresh face for his post-apocalyptic thriller “28 Days Later.”
The rest is history — or history in the making as, 20 years later, Murphy is continuing to seek out bold projects with some of the best filmmakers working today. That includes Christopher Nolan, who first brought Murphy to supervillain stardom in “Batman Begins” and who directs the actor in the titular role in “Oppenheimer,” now in theaters. It’s their sixth collaboration, and Murphy’s biggest role yet, playing the complex physicist and “father of the atomic bomb” over a course of several years and a three-hour runtime. It’s one of Murphy’s finest performances, which is saying a lot.
There isn’t a genre or a medium the actor has shied away from over the years. And while some films might not always work as a whole, Murphy always shines. He’s also a true actor’s actor, one who understands every role is integral and is comfortable taking on supporting parts.

On the same day “Barbie” passed its billion-dollar box office milestone, the other half of the viral “Barbenheimer” phenomenon blew past the half-billion-dollar mark.
Since its release three weeks ago, Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” has made $552.9 million worldwide, according to official estimates from Universal Pictures.
It is now the highest grossing R-rated movie of 2023, and “marks the fastest a Universal R-rated film has hit the $200 million threshold domestically,” the studio said in a news release Sunday. It’s also the highest grossing movie set during World War II, according to Universal.
In its third weekend, “Oppenheimer” has had incredible stamina as the No. 3 movie in both domestic and international box offices.
Nolan’s blockbuster has had “an astounding theatrical run made all the more impressive by the R-rating, running time and subject matter which, in the hands of a lesser filmmaker and absent a spectacular marketing and release strategy, would have likely wound up as a mere footnote when referencing the performance of historical dramas at the box office,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.
The box office numbers are impressive for a three-hour biography about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project physicist. The movie is one of only four biopics to earn more than half a billion dollars globally, alongside “Bohemian Rhapsody,” “Passion of the Christ,” and “American Sniper.”
“‘Oppenheimer’… (has) become one of the most revered, talked about and successful summer movies ever to be released by a major studio,” said Dergarabedian, adding the movie “demonstrates the power of great filmmaking and of course a bit of unforeseeable ‘Barbenheimer’ magic.”
“Oppenheimer” and “Barbie” had a symbiotic relationship in the lead-up to their shared debut on July 21, perhaps helped by their very different styles and tones.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8wNi9idXNpbmVzcy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1zdXJwYXNzZXMtNTAwLW1pbGxpb24tYXQtYm94LW9mZmljZS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMy8wOC8wNi9idXNpbmVzcy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1zdXJwYXNzZXMtNTAwLW1pbGxpb24tYXQtYm94LW9mZmljZS9pbmRleC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Given the “Barbenheimer” craze that’s sweeping the nation, Murphy has naturally been asked a lot about Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie.” Omelete (via Cinéfilos) even asked the “Oppenheimer” actor if he’d play a Ken in a potential sequel to Gerwig’s now historic comedy blockbuster.
“Sure, yeah. Let’s read the script, let’s have a conversation,” Murphy responded about playing Ken. “I can’t wait to see [‘Barbie’]. I can’t wait to see the movie. I think it’s great for cinema to get all these great movies happening this summer.”
“Barbie” opened to a massive $162 million during its opening weekend, but “Oppenheimer” was no slouch. The film debuted to a huge $82 million, a staggering number considering Nolan’s latest is a talky, three-hour biographical drama that’s also rated R.
Nolan told IGN ahead of both films opening in theaters that “it’s terrific” to have two summer tentpoles being released together.
“Summer, in a healthy marketplace, is always crowded, and we’ve been doing this a long time,” Nolan said. “I think for those of us who care about movies, we’ve been really waiting to have a crowded marketplace again, and now it’s here and that’s terrific.”
Murphy agreed with Nolan, telling IGN: “I think it’s great. I mean, I’ll be going to see ‘Barbie.’ I can’t wait to see it. I think it’s just great for the industry and for audiences that we have two amazing films by amazing filmmakers coming out the same day. Could spend a whole day in the cinema, what’s better than that?”
Whether or not Murphy becomes a Ken remains to be seen. For now, he’s still processing everything that went into becoming J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who created the atomic bomb during World War II. Murphy went through dramatic isolation periods and weight loss during filming, so much so that Robert Downey Jr. said he’s never seen an actor sacrifice more for a role than Murphy in “Oppenheimer.” Is Oppenheimer a hero or a villain? The discussion is a nuanced one for Murphy.
“I do think that he believed it would be the weapon to end all wars,” Murphy recently told NME. “He thought that [having the bomb] would motivate countries to form a sort of nuclear world governance. He was naive.”
Murphy added that Nolan helped him unlock the more nuanced parts of Oppenheimer’s character. “Chris used this amazing phrase,” he said. “We were talking about Oppenheimer’s arc and he said, ‘You know, he’s dancing between the raindrops morally.’ That unlocked something in my mind when I was preparing.”
“Oppenheimer” is now playing in theaters nationwide from Universal Pictures.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHkta2VuLWJhcmJpZS0yLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLW5haXZlLTEyMzU2Nzk0NjEv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1rZW4tYmFyYmllLTItb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbmFpdmUtMTIzNTY3OTQ2MS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-03 14:52:36+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’ Dialogue Might Be Hard to Hear Because Christopher Nolan Refuses to Re-Record Actors: ‘An Artistic Choice Some Disagree With’,"Having trouble understanding ""Oppenheimer"" dialogue? That might be because Christopher Nolan does not re-record his actors in post-production.","Are Christopher Nolan movies too loud? It’s a question that’s asked every time the director releases a movie, and “Oppenheimer” is no exception. Nolan’s sound mix is once again a point of contention among viewers, with some complaining that it’s hard to understand the dialogue against Ludwig Göransson’s booming score and other sound design choices. In a recent interview with Insider, Nolan explained that one reason it may be hard to hear the dialogue in “Oppenheimer” is because he refuses to re-record his actors in post-production.
“I like to use the performance that was given in the moment rather than the actor re-voice it later,” Nolan said. “Which is an artistic choice that some people disagree with, and that’s their right.”
Nolan refuses to record ADR, so whatever vocal takes he gets on the day of filming are what go into the film’s theatrical cut. That can be a risk in a movie like “Oppenheimer” considering the IMAX cameras used to shoot the film are incredibly loud on set, although Nolan said they are getting better.
“There are certain mechanical improvements,” Nolan said. “And actually, Imax is building new cameras right now which are going to be even quieter. But the real breakthrough is in software technology that allows you to filter out the camera noise. That has improved massively in the 15 or so years that I’ve been using these cameras. Which opens up for you to do more intimate scenes that you would not have been able to do in the past.”
Whatever dialogue issues some “Oppenheimer” viewers are having with the film aren’t stopping moviegoers from flocking to see the atomic bomb epic. “Oppenheimer” has soared past the $400 million mark at the worldwide box office in less than two weeks of release, a huge accomplishment for a three-hour biopic that’s rated R.

His latest epic undertaking, Oppenheimer, based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, attracted one of the starriest casts the Oscar-nominated director has ever assembled, headlined by Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh and Robert Downey Jr.
The biopic follows J. Robert Oppenheimer, played by Murphy, the scientist who famously led the Manhattan Project — the effort to create an atomic bomb during World War II.

In a group interview with PEOPLE, Blunt equated filming the movie with the sprawling cast in New Mexico to being at ""summer camp.""
""We were all in the same hotel in the middle of the New Mexican desert,"" she recalls. ""We only had each other. Me and Matt were roommates and we were like, 'Let's go to have dinner.' ""
Sadly for Murphy, he rarely got to join in on the fun due to the daunting task of leading Nolan's film.
""The sheer volume of what he had to take on and shoulder is so monumental,"" marvels Blunt. ""Of course he didn't want to come and have dinner with us."" Damon agrees, saying, ""He couldn't. His brain was just too full.""
Adds Murphy, ""You know that when you have those big roles, that responsibility, you feel it's kind of overwhelming.""
Oppenheimer will hit theaters on July 21. Moviegoers can see it on standard and IMAX screens.

,“Oppenheimer” is a one-of-a-kind cinematic immersion into history,"Dramatic as it is educational, Nolan provides an authentic portrayal of The Manhattan Project and goes above and beyond by displaying the scrutiny Oppenheimer faced from the U.S. government after WWII.","While much excitement for the film was built around the spectacle of nuclear explosion, Nolan thankfully dives into much greater depths during his depiction of the Oppenheimer security hearing that occurred after World War II.
Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, “Oppenheimer” is a biopic that explores the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, portrayed by Cillian Murphy. The two work hand in hand, with Nolan creating a realistic cinematic odyssey of the invention that came out of the Manhattan Project , while Murphy’s haunted expression — sensitized by his bright blue watery eyes — embodies the once passionate and later demoralized creator of the atomic bomb used on Japan in 1945 during World War II. From its astounding portrayal of historic events to the dedicated cast, “Oppenheimer” is not a movie but an experience from beginning to end.
Within seconds of the opening scene, Nolan foreshadows the intensity of the film with audio that sends vibrations throughout the theater, shaking viewers' seats. Despite its three-hour duration, the film’s astonishingly fast-paced narrative makes the experience engaging throughout. With time jumps, black and white shots and a nonlinear plot, “Oppenheimer'' quickly throws its viewers into the mix of events. The theme of change is a vital tool for Nolan, keeping the film fresh while adding to the concept that the Manhattan Project was a vital race between nations to build the first atomic bomb.
As explosive as the film’s score is, it frustratedly dilutes some of the fast-paced dialogue. Poor sound mixing has been a consistent issue faced by Nolan, tracing back to his second film “Memento.” Nolan has gone on record with The Hollywood Reporter to say that his choice of thunderous scores is completely intentional.
""Many of the filmmakers I've admired over the years have used sound in bold and adventurous ways,” Nolan said. “I don't agree with the idea that you can only achieve clarity through dialogue. Clarity of story, clarity of emotions — I try to achieve that in a very layered way using all the different things at my disposal — picture and sound.""
From talks of radioactive isotopes, countless names of scientists and the at times overbearing background sound, salient plot details are hard to keep track of. While “Oppenheimer” is nowhere near the conceptual complexity of time travel in “Interstellar,” nor the manipulation of dreams in “Inception,” viewers should be advised to pay close attention throughout the biopic still.
While the sound slightly muddles the film’s clarity of expression, it is simultaneously the most captivating component. The score displays the dichotomy of moral questions in the Manhattan Project from moments of soothing orchestra harmony that reflect Oppenheimer's elegance in pursuit of a new scientific discovery, to screeching violins in times of urgency and trauma. While the score alone is enough to pierce through the screen, it is merely a rehearsal for the climax of the film — The Trinity Test — which was the first-ever detonation of a nuclear explosion.
Just as the timer ticks to zero for The Trinity Test, a deafening silence roams, leaving only the sound of deep breathing to fill the air. The silence astutely displays the dissonance between the speed of sound and light, emphasizing the unscalable size of the explosion and serving as a brilliant tactic of excitement and horror when the explosion is finally heard. As the screen is slowly filled with red, yellow and fiery smoke, it is an astounding experience that is perfectly fitted for IMAX.
While much excitement for the film was built around the spectacle of a nuclear explosion, Nolan thankfully dives into much greater depth of the physicist in the less explosive second half of the film. One emotional yet horrific scene dives into the mind of Oppenheimer where he envisions the incinerated victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Murphy’s performance during the scene wonderfully displays the evolution of Oppenheimer and the subsequent trauma faced as a result of his own invention.
Along with Murphy comes a brilliant performance by Robert Downey Jr. who plays Lewis Strauss — chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission — and brings forth the security hearing on Oppenheimer due to his previous ties to the communist party. Combined with the mental stress of the bombings, it is at this point where Oppenheimer is completely defeated, where even his wife —played by Emily Blunt — is begging for him to fight back.
While what results from the security hearing may seem minimal, Nolan’s underlying messages shine throughout this moment. Nolan brings to light the U.S. government’s exploitation of scientists after WWII, displaying their ignorance towards Oppenhiemer’s request of enforcing international regulation on nuclear weapons and deeming him as a threat to U.S. security once no longer needed for the war. “Oppenheimer” goes beyond the Trinity Test, educating modern audiences on this untold dramatic story of betrayal and the double-edged significance of Oppenheimer’s contribution to society.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhdmFsaWVyZGFpbHkuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMy8wNy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1pcy1hLW9uZS1vZi1hLWtpbmQtY2luZW1hdGljLWltbWVyc2lvbi1pbnRvLWhpc3RvcnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,‘Oppenheimer’ in 70mm is the hottest ticket in town. Sometimes way out of town too.,"With the Regal in King of Prussia booked up through mid August, and the Franklin Institute IMAX shut, Philly filmgoers are traveling across the country to catch the new Christopher Nolan film","In some way or another, you’ve likely been drawn in by the “Barbenheimer” hype.
Summer blockbusters Barbie and Oppenheimer reached historic box office figures on opening weekend, raking in a combined $235.5 million in domestic sales.
While the Greta Gerwig-directed Barbie edged out the Christopher Nolan-directed film, Nolan fans are crossing state lines to experience Oppenheimer on 70mm.
“Oppenheimer’s story is one of the biggest stories imaginable. Our film tries to take you into his experience, and IMAX for me is a portal into a level of emotion that you can’t get from other formats,” Nolan said in a video urging audiences to watch the movie in a 70mm film projection in an IMAX theater. “It allows you to fully immerse yourself in the story.”
The only IMAX theater in Philadelphia showing the 70mm version of Oppenheimer is the Regal King of Prussia, and seats beyond the first two rows are booked through mid-August.
To avoid the neck-snapping view, Center City resident Nick Greco bought tickets to Los Angeles’ TCL Chinese Theater. He’ll see the film, starring Cillian Murphy, on Monday.

“I was already going to [Los Angeles] to meet up with some of my friends,” Greco, 26, said. “Since L.A. is the place to be for movies, of course, they had openings at some of the most well-known theaters in the world. If I didn’t have tickets to L.A., there is probably no way I could have seen the movie in 70mm IMAX. I was even looking in New York to drive up there and see the film there.”
Which is exactly what South Jersey resident Zach Marsh, 26, did. He traveled more than two-and-a half hours to catch a showing at the AMC Lincoln Square 13 theater in New York City. The “nearest” 70mm IMAX experience after New York is the AMC Waterfront 22 at West Homestead, Pa. — an over five hour drive from Center City.
Nolan shared his theater seating preferences with AP News: “When I’m in a theater that’s Cinemascope ratio, I like to be right near the front, middle of the third row,” Nolan said. “When I’m in a stadium, IMAX 1.43:1, then I actually like to be a little behind the center line right up at the middle. So, a little further back.”
Marsh could’ve grabbed center-seat tickets at the King of Prussia Regal, but he decided to see the film on the Lincoln’s 100-foot IMAX screen instead.
“It was so surreal,” he said. “It was cool to see the hairs on the screen every once in a while. There’s just something about film that’s really special, and there’s nothing like IMAX. The quality is insanely high quality.”
Tyler Johnson of Fishtown doesn’t mind a little discomfort — or being the butt of his friends’ jokes.
After searching for 70mm showings for a week, Johnson settled for front-row tickets at the Regal, and he plans to lay back as far as his seat will allow to enjoy the three-hour movie, on Wednesday night.
“I was like, whatever, let’s do it,” he said earlier in the week. “My friends have been sending me memes of what it’s going to look like sitting [in] front row. They’re all pictures of a giant chin of Cillian Murphy. But like, this version [of the movie] is playing in 19 theaters in the U.S., so I figured I might as well give it a shot.”
While Marsh enjoyed the film, he said Philly should have more IMAX theaters, especially with the Franklin Institute closing its doors. “There are a lot of film buffs in this general area, and many of them would love to see these movies the way the filmmakers intended them to be shown. Unfortunately, because of the way certain buildings are built, or the way the economy has gone, there doesn’t seem to be any push to build a single-screen IMAX theater [in the Philly area]. If a building was able to get like an 80-foot screen, that would be ideal.”
Johnson doesn’t mind the drive to King of Prussia. His friend in Santa Fe, N.M., he said, doesn’t have the option to go to an IMAX because there aren’t any nearby. So “King of Prussia feels like a luxury. Having one in Philly would be nice, but I’m happy to take the 35-minute drive if that’s what I’m going to do.”
If you don’t mind watching the film in other formats and want to save yourself a commute, Oppenheimer is playing in 35mm and digital formats at Philadelphia Film Center, Ritz Five, and PFS Bourse Theater, among other theaters in the city.
In the future, Greco said he’s hopeful more cinema houses capable of playing 70mm films pop up in the city. “It’s nice that King of Prussia has a huge theater, but that’s not Philly,” he said. “We can and should have nice things, too. Who doesn’t want dinner and movie in the city? It’s like peanut butter and jelly.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L21vdmllcy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1pbWF4LXBoaWFsZGVscGhpYS03MG1tLW5vbGFuLTIwMjMwNzI3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-28 21:15:49+00:00,The Darkest Memes of the Barbie-Oppenheimer Double Feature,The internet is at its best and its worst after it was announced that a film about the making of the atomic bomb would debut on the same day as Barbie.,"Adam Perocchi’s Oppenheimer-inspired reimagining of the Barbie Dreamhouse (image courtesy Adam Perocchi)
She’s Everything. He’s Death, the destroyer of worlds. She’s Mattel. He’s the Manhattan Project.
Directors Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach’s summer blockbuster Barbie (2023) is set to open in theaters on July 21, the same day as Christopher Nolan’s long-anticipated film Oppenheimer (2023), a movie about the development of the atomic bomb. Many theaters across the country are screening these polar opposite movies back-to-back, and the notion of a double feature has the internet in absolute shambles. So what better way to cope than with a deluge of absurdly dark memes?

In the weeks leading up to the dual blockbuster opening, people are preparing for the emotional wreckage that will undoubtedly besiege them from the confluence of these films. Notably, Christopher Nolan told Wired reporters that some early viewers of Oppenheimer (2023) “left the movie absolutely devastated,” which is, you know, super uplifting to hear.

Those who are seeing Oppenheimer (2023) before Barbie (2023) are calling the mash-up “Oppenbarbie,” and those who are wrong and seeing the films in the reverse order are calling it “Barbieheimer.”
This meme from The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent (2022) has yet to get old for me. (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)
Like many others on the internet, I have strong opinions about how theatergoers should spend the day. The following meme is giving “No sleep. Bus. Club. Another club. Another club. Plane. Next place. No sleep”:
The internet has opinions about how to spend the day. (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)
The pairing of the two films has led some to make interesting observations of real-world phenomena that could fit the Barbie-Oppenheimer theme — such as this pair of surreal houses:
As they say, art imitates life. Or in this case, life imitates art? I don’t know anymore. (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)
… Or this strange pink cloud that’s either another hazardous “gender reveal” or (hopefully) an incredible PR stunt by the Barbie (2023) marketing team:

Speaking of the Barbie (2023) marketing team, can we just take a moment to appreciate this bubble gum pink Xbox console? I, myself, was a Wii stan growing up, but even this video game set-up would have me begging my mom to drive me to the nearest Toys-R-Us. (RIP!)
Please, Mom? I need the Xbox Barbie Dream Edition. Everyone at school has one! (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Instagram)
Of course, this wouldn’t be a proper meme round-up if I didn’t include this spot-on Sopranos reference:

But whether you decide to see Barbie (2023) then Oppenheimer (2023), or Oppenheimer (2023) then Barbie (2023), just remember that David Lynch did it first.

,"Christopher Nolan: ""Bittersweet"" to have ""Oppenheimer"" cast leave London premiere amid SAG-AFTRA strike",The film is scheduled to be released in theaters on Friday.,"During the London premiere of the highly anticipated film ""Oppenheimer,"" some stars left early to join the picket lines in support of the SAG-AFTRA strike.
""It was very bittersweet to have the actors there supporting the film, and then understanding that they needed to then leave and go on strike,"" the film's writer and director, Christopher Nolan, told ""CBS Mornings"" in an interview that aired on Thursday.
Nolan emphasized the significance of the actors' strike and a parallel one held by the Writers Guild of America since May.
""It's an important moment,"" he said. ""It's a kind of moment that comes along every few decades.""
As a writer, Nolan has been on strike for over two months and hopes the movement will compel companies to promptly reassess their deal structures. The strikes largely focus on issues related to financial compensation amid disputes with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), a trade association that represents companies including Paramount Studios, which has the same parent company as CBS News.
Nolan is known for films including ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Dunkirk"" and ""Interstellar."" His latest creation, ""Oppenheimer,"" has been described as his most impressive yet. It is scheduled to be released in theaters on Friday.
The film delves into the life of famed physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who oversaw the development of the first atomic bomb during World War II. One notable aspect of the movie is its commitment to authenticity. Nolan said he avoided relying on computer-generated imagery to create a textured and real atmosphere. The film uses old-school methods and practical effects to heighten the immersive experience for viewers, especially during pivotal moments like the depiction of the Trinity nuclear test, which was the first detonation of a nuclear weapon and took place in 1945.
""We knew the Trinity test had to be the showstopper. It's the key thing in the film. It had to have incredible beauty and incredible threat. It's difficult to make computer graphics threatening,"" he said.
Nolan said the film highlights a cautionary tale, reflecting on Oppenheimer's public acclaim as the father of the bomb, while also recognizing the turmoil he faced due to the changed world and the ongoing threat of nuclear weapons.
In an emotional scene, Oppenheimer envisions the potential horrors of future nuclear explosions, portrayed through the face of Nolan's own daughter.
""For me, yes, it was about looking to people you love, looking to the things that you love, the world around you that you love and value and imagining the destructive force of these weapons,"" said Nolan.
Some CBS News staff are SAG-AFTRA or Writers Guild members. But their contracts are not affected by the strikes.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc2FnLWFmdHJhLXN0cmlrZS_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1zYWctYWZ0cmEtc3RyaWtlLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-03 16:00:46-04:00,"Barbenheimer Explained: Yes, People Really Are Making Oppenheimer & Barbie a Double Feature","You can see Oppenheimer or Barbie on July 21...or, as viral ""Barbenheimer"" buzz suggests, you could just see both movies back to back.","When you think of pink, is it the fun cotton-candy kind that colors the sunset over Barbie’s Malibu skies? Or is it the hue that glows like a haunting pall over the blasted aftermath of a nuclear-devastated landscape?
For moviegoers this month, that won’t just be a fanciful mental exercise. Both Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer are opening in theaters on the same July day — the former about Mattel’s California-cool toy doll come to life, the latter about the conflicted physicist who helped usher in the age of atomic warfare.

Obviously, the two movies couldn’t be more different. Starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (as Ken), Barbie brings the toy icon’s happy-go-lucky fluff to the same box office as Nolan’s gravely serious (and cinematically epic) nuclear spectacle in Oppenheimer, with each film expected to do blockbuster numbers as audiences pick their summertime movie flavor. But instead of showing up to the theater to see just one, fans are buzzing online over a novel concept in moviegoing: Why not ride the whole thematic roller coaster all at once and just watch Oppenheimer and Barbie back to back... at the same theater... and on the same day?
The Latest Craze in Moviegoing: Barbenheimer

Memes celebrating the chance to do just that are spilling across social media, as fans hyped by the idea of an Oppenheimer / Barbie movie mash-up have begun to cheekily tout the striking contrast between the two films. As The New York Times reports, the audience thirst for such a high-contrast double feature isn’t just a niche thing, either. Searching online for “Barbenheimer T-shirt,” the paper notes, “brings tens of thousands of results, and sellers on Etsy have designed their own versions” — some of which playfully juxtapose the bubbly pink “Barbie” logo with the sinister imagery of an expanding mushroom cloud.
That’s the sort of fan-powered viral marketing that no studio can buy (or even really plan for), and it’s created a rising-tide environment of buzz ahead of the two films’ July 21 release. “They’re so vastly different,” film industry analyst Robert Mitchell told NYT, “that they allow for the narrative that popped up organically: This would be strangest double bill ever” — an attention-stealing concept, he added, that’s “pretty much a gift for distributors.”

As anyone who's spent recent time on the entertainment-oriented side of social media knows, a lot of folks are tweaking their schedules to arrange an Oppenheimer and Barbie double-feature date. The real question, though, is in the details: Do you start off the day with Oppenheimer’s weighty themes and then shift over into pink fantasy mode with Barbie? Or Do you treat Barbie more like a high-calorie appetizer that you mindlessly munch on ahead of the IMAX-worthy Oppenheimer main course?

2023-07-15 23:25:28+00:00,Christopher Nolan Warns of ‘Terrifying Possibilities’ as AI Reaches ‘Oppenheimer Moment’: ‘We Have to Hold People Accountable’,"After a screening of ""Oppenheimer,"" director Christopher Nolan offered warnings about artificial intelligence technology.","Christopher Nolan expressed caution about artificial intelligence after a special screening of “Oppenheimer,” drawing a comparison between the rapidly developing technology and his new dramatic feature about the creation of the atomic bomb.
Nolan’s remarks came during a conversation following a preview screening of “Oppenheimer” in New York. Moderated by “Meet the Press” anchor Chuck Todd, the panel included Nolan, as well as Los Alamos National Laboratory director Dr. Thom Mason, physicists Dr. Carlo Rovelli and Dr. Kip Thorne, plus author Kai Bird, who co-wrote “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” which Nolan’s film is based on.
“The rise of companies in the last 15 years bandying words like algorithm — not knowing what they mean in any kind of meaningful, mathematical sense — these guys don’t know what an algorithm is,” Nolan shared at the screening. “People in my business talking about it, they just don’t want to take responsibility for whatever that algorithm does.”
“Applied to AI, that’s a terrifying possibility. Terrifying,” Nolan continued. “Not least because, AI systems will go into defensive infrastructure ultimately. They’ll be in charge of nuclear weapons. To say that that is a separate entity from the person wielding, programming, putting that AI to use, then we’re doomed. It has to be about accountability. We have to hold people accountable for what they do with the tools that they have.”
Nolan’s new feature retells how J. Robert Oppenheimer was tapped by U.S. military powers to develop the atomic bomb during World War II. Cillian Murphy plays the theoretical physicist, leading a cast that includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr. and Florence Pugh.
Nolan’s comments come as the entertainment industry is at a near-complete halt, with SAG-AFTRA ordering a strike on Thursday to join WGA members on the picket lines. Among numerous other disagreements with studios, a primary issue for both unions is the matter of AI and its potential existential impact on labor practices in the entertainment industry.
“With the labor disputes going on in Hollywood right now, a lot of it — when we talk about AI, when we talk about these issues — they’re all ultimately born from the same thing, which is when you innovate with technology, you have to maintain accountability,” Nolan stated.
“Do you think we’ll keep re-examining Oppenheimer? As our understanding of quantum physics continues, as our taming of the atom continues,” Todd asked at one point in the panel.
“I hope so,” Nolan stated. “When I talk to the leading researchers in the field of AI right now, for example, they literally refer to this — right now — as their Oppenheimer moment. They’re looking to history to say, ‘What are the responsibilities for scientists developing new technologies that may have unintended consequences?'”
“Do you think Silicon Valley is thinking that right now?” Todd interjected. “Do you think they say that this is an Oppenheimer moment?”
“They say that they do,” Nolan said after a pause and then chuckled. “It’s helpful that that’s in the conversation and I hope that that thought process will continue. I am not saying Oppenheimer’s story offers any easy answers to those questions, but it at least can show where some of those responsibilities lie and how people take a breath and think, ‘Okay, what is the accountability?'”
In a piece published by the New York Times in May, AI pioneer Dr. Geoffrey Hinton expressed regret regarding his life work. Hinton’s work at the University of Toronto laid the groundwork for the tech industry’s investment in generative artificial intelligence, which powers chatbots such as ChatGPT.
“I console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn’t done it, somebody else would have,” Dr. Hinton told the Times. “It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things.”

7/14/2023 0:00,Who was Oppenheimer? What to know about Christopher Nolan’s new film,"Temple University professors Alan McPherson and Bernd Surrow discuss the mysterious subject of Christopher Nolan’s newest film, ""Oppenheimer.""","Award-winning filmmaker Christopher Nolan is poised to once again leave moviegoers thrilled, entertained and scrambling to Google explanations about his latest film Oppenheimer, which releases in theaters on July 21. The film stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb” who led the United States’ development of the first nuclear weapons during World War II. Alongside Murphy is a star-studded cast that includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr. and Florence Pugh.
Nolan’s films are famous for their twists and turns, complex plots and puzzling characters, and from the sounds of early reviews Oppenheimer will be no different. The nuclear weapons Oppenheimer developed through the Manhattan Project famously helped bring World War II to an end. Weapons capable of such devastation, evident following the 1945 bombing of Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki, have not been used in war since. Yet there remain plenty of questions about these weapons and the man who helped develop them.
Alan McPherson, professor of history and director of the College of Liberal Arts’ Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy, answers some of the biggest questions about Oppenheimer. Bernd Surrow, professor of physics and senior associate dean at the College of Science and Technology, discusses atomic bombs and the way Oppenheimer and his team developed them.
Key takeaways
Known as the “father of the atomic bomb,” Oppenheimer was a theoretical physicist, and in 1942 he became the top scientist in charge of developing the atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project.
To develop the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer and his team found a way to bombard neutrons with plutonium and uranium that caused a nuclear fission reaction. During a nuclear fission reaction, the heavy plutonium or uranium nucleus splits into smaller nuclei while releasing energy and other neutrons. Those neutrons can split other nuclei and release more neutrons causing a chain reaction. This chain reaction, when unchecked, can lead to an atomic bomb.
Though he never received the Nobel Prize for his work, Oppenheimer did receive the Medal for Merit in 1946 and the Enrico Fermi Award in 1963.
What exactly did Oppenheimer do?
Oppenheimer was a theoretical physicist and the top scientist in charge of developing the atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project, which was a World War II-era government project to develop a nuclear weapon before the Germans. He was responsible for the team that researched and designed the bomb. This is why he’s known as the “father of the atomic bomb.” His formal role was director of the Los Alamos Laboratory.
–Alan McPherson
How did Oppenheimer feel about the atomic bomb?
Oppenheimer saw developing the bomb as a necessary evil. He took the job of top scientist for the Manhattan Project armed with the knowledge that such a weapon would almost certainly be used against the Germans or the Japanese. The son of German Jews, Oppenheimer would have preferred the bomb be ready earlier so that it could be used against the Nazis, but he still understood that his government would use it against Japan.
Once he witnessed the test detonation in person, Oppenheimer famously quoted the Bhagavad Gita: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” The devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki weeks later only increased his concern. Oppenheimer had an interest in communism during the 1930s, so he anticipated how this weapon, and especially the development of a more powerful hydrogen or “super” bomb, would intensify the confrontation with the Soviet Union and, perhaps, cause a civilization-ending war.
–Alan McPherson
What is the difference between a nuclear bomb and an atomic bomb?
Atomic bomb and nuclear bomb are actually synonyms. The more accurate term is nuclear bomb, since the physical process takes place not in the atomic shell, but in the atomic nucleus.
There are, however, two types of atomic bombs—a fusion bomb and a fission bomb. The type of atomic bomb developed by Oppenheimer was a fission bomb, which is named for the nuclear fission reaction that was discovered by Germans Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938. The Manhattan Project produced and used two different fission bombs, which were code-named Little Boy and Fat Man. Little Boy was a uranium-based bomb that was dropped over Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6, 1945, and Fat Man was a plutonium-based bomb that was dropped over Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945.
–Bernd Surrow
How did Oppenheimer create the atomic bomb?
To develop the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer and his team needed to bombard neutrons with an element that can undergo nuclear fission, in this case plutonium or uranium. A large part of the development process involved producing enough plutonium and uranium-235, a uranium isotope, to create the weapons.
Once the elements were acquired, Oppenheimer’s team bombarded neutrons with plutonium or uranium-235 to begin the nuclear fission reaction. During a nuclear fission reaction, the heavy plutonium or uranium nucleus splits into smaller nuclei while releasing energy and other neutrons. Those neutrons can split other nuclei and release more neutrons causing a chain reaction. If left unchecked, this chain reaction can create an atomic bomb.
–Bernd Surrow
Where did Oppenheimer test the atomic bomb?
Trinity, the name of the test detonation for the atomic bomb, took place in an area near Alamogordo, New Mexico, now known as the White Sands Missile Range. The test site was about 200 miles south of the Los Alamos Laboratory that Oppenheimer directed.
It is important to note, however, that more than 30 sites across the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada were involved in research and production as part of the Manhattan Project. These sites included Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the Hanford Site in Washington state and Los Alamos Laboratory.
–Bernd Surrow
Did the Oppenheimer movie use a real atomic bomb for the detonation scene?
I categorically say no. Using a real atomic bomb would have severe domestic and political implications, which the U.S. government wouldn’t risk. More likely, the film used a combination of conventional explosives and video editing.
–Bernd Surrow
Did Oppenheimer win a Nobel Prize?
Oppenheimer was never awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on the Manhattan Project. However, he was awarded a Medal for Merit in 1946, and in 1963 he was given the Enrico Fermi Award, awarded to scientists of international stature for their lifetime achievement in the development, use or production of energy.
–Bernd Surrow
What happened to Oppenheimer after the atomic bomb?
After the war, Oppenheimer worked as an advisor for the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) where he lobbied for arms control. In 1947, he became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, where Einstein had also worked. It’s a center that still exists and gathers scholars from every field to share research. McCarthyite politicians suspected Oppenheimer of disloyalty because of his political opinions, due to his communist leanings, and in 1954 the AEC stripped him of his security clearance. This decision was vacated in December 2022 by the Department of Energy, successor to the AEC. In her official statement, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm deemed the 1954 AEC decision biased, unfair and flawed.

After 1954, Oppenheimer continued lecturing around the world and eventually helped establish the World Academy of Art and Science. It’s important to understand that while the U.S. government shunned Oppenheimer during the Red Scare, the world of science, whether in the United States or abroad, always recognized Oppenheimer’s contributions to developing the bomb and trying to limit its spread.

A map that identifies hotspots where wildlife trade could cause the most damage might help conservation scientists and policymakers to decide where to focus resources. Species’ evolutionary histories and information about their ecological roles were mapped onto data about illegal and legal trade of birds and mammals. The map shows the potential impact of removing a species from an ecosystem.

A Neolithic farming community from 6,500 years ago in modern-day France was mostly one big family. DNA analysis of 94 individuals found at a burial site revealed that two-thirds were members of a single family that spanned seven generations. No half-siblings were uncovered, suggesting that monogamy was standard. And most adult women were not closely related to others in the group, which indicates that male descendants tended to stay put, whereas women moved around.

“All in all, a really good job,” says atomic-bomb historian Richard Rhodes about Oppenheimer. The film is right in portraying US theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer as both remorseful and proud for his involvement in creating the first nuclear weapons, says Rhodes. He suggests that the portrayal of Oppenheimer’s downfall, after he opposed the hydrogen bomb, is an intentional message to scientists today: standing up in the political arena comes with consequences. Overall, Rhodes says, scientists in the film seem to be the “good guys … which is quite an achievement when you think of what they were working on”.

An important part of Earth's climate system could shut down around the middle of the century, two researchers warn. Collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation could decrease temperatures in northern Europe and increase warming in the tropics. There have been signs that cold water from melting ice sheets has already weakened the current. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that it won’t collapse this century, and other climate scientists say the timing suggested in the new analysis should be taken with a pinch of salt. It’s based on extrapolating data on sea surface temperatures in one region of the Atlantic, which represents “only one part of a highly complex, dynamical system”, says oceanographer Marilena Oltmanns.

Cities must work to provide cooling cover and eliminate the ‘shade deserts’ that disproportionately affect low-income communities, argue three urban-geography and climate researchers. Shade is one of the most efficient and cost-effective ways to reduce heat-related health risks outdoors. And it’s simple to create with trees, buildings, canopies, shade sails, awnings and walls — but it is “frequently overlooked in urban planning and climate-change mitigation strategies,” the trio writes.

Large language models (LLMs), a type of artificial intelligence (AI), can write poetry, code and pass tough exams. Often, the precise reasons why they behave the way they do are not known — even to their own creators. “Revealing their true nature is urgent and important,” argues a Nature editorial. To really assess LLMs’ abilities and limitations, researchers need to understand how they work and find new ways of testing them. “Similar to the processes that medicines go through to attain approval as treatments and to uncover possible side effects, assessments of AI systems could allow them to be deemed safe for certain applications,” the editorial suggests.

2023-07-16 10:45:28+00:00,At the heart of the film ‘Oppenheimer’ is a clash between real-life Jews,,"(JTA) — In 1945 physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer was a national hero, hailed as the “father of the atomic bomb” and the man who ended World War II.
Less than a decade later, he was a pariah, after the United States Atomic Energy Commission revoked his security clearance following allegations about his left-leaning politics at the height of the anti-communist McCarthy era.
Christopher Nolan’s biopic, “Oppenheimer,” which opens in theaters on July 21, will star Irish actor Cillian Murphy as the famous scientist. But it will also feature Robert Downey Jr. as a lesser known real-life character, Lewis Strauss (pronounced “Straws”), the chairman of the AEC and one of Oppenheimer’s chief inquisitors.
The clash between the scientist and the bureaucrat was a matter of personalities, politics and the hydrogen bomb (Strauss supported it, Oppenheimer was opposed). But according to amateur historian Jack Shlachter, the two represented opposites in another important way: as Jews. Shlachter has researched how Oppenheimer’s assimilated Jewish background and Strauss’ strong attachment to Jewish affairs set them up for conflict as men who represented two very different reactions to the pressures of acculturation and prejudice in the mid-20th century.
Shlachter is in a unique position to explore the Jewish backstory of Oppenheimer: A physicist, he worked for more than 30 years at Los Alamos National Laboratory, the New Mexico complex where Oppenheimer led the Manhattan Project that developed the bomb. Shlachter is also a rabbi, ordained in 1995, who leads HaMakom, a congregation in Santa Fe, New Mexico, as well as the Los Alamos Jewish Center.
“A hero of American science, [Oppenheimer] lived out his life a broken man and died in 1967 at the age of 62,” The New York Times wrote last December, after the secretary of energy nullified the 1954 decision to revoke Oppenheimer’s security clearance. Lewis Strauss died in 1974 at age 77; his funeral was held at New York’s Congregation Emanu-El, where he had been president from 1938 to 1948.
When I asked Shlachter what drew him to the story of Oppenheimer and Strauss, he told me, “At this later stage of my life, I realized that things are not black and white. The common narrative that I think I have heard in town puts Oppenheimer at 100 and Strauss at zero. I just tried to balance that a little bit, and I thought that their Jewishness was one way to see that there’s some nuance in the relationship.”
Our conversation was edited for length and clarity.
There has been a lot of talk about Oppenheimer in anticipation of the Christopher Nolan film, but I haven’t seen much on his Jewish background. I guess as a rabbi and a physicist at Los Alamos this was a subject you couldn’t resist.
I am speaking as a private citizen, not on behalf of Los Alamos National Laboratory or anything like that. Oppenheimer was the first director of what is now Los Alamos National Laboratory. He was the scientific leader of the Manhattan Project. And it was really his doing that the laboratory ended up in northern New Mexico. He has been out here as a late teen and really fell in love with the desert Southwest.
His Jewishness is a bit complicated. His father was an immigrant from Germany in the late 1800s. And his mother was a first-generation American but her parents had emigrated to the United States. And in their approach to religion, they became enamored with the Ethical Culture Society of Felix Adler.
That’s the non-sectarian movement that had roots in Reform Judaism and is based on the idea that morality does not need to be grounded in religious or philosophical dogma.
Correct. Samuel Adler, Felix’s father, was brought over from Germany to serve as the rabbi of New York’s Temple Emanu-El, then and now a major Reform synagogue. They sent Felix back to Germany to study and he got his PhD in Heidelberg, and the plan had been for Felix Adler to succeed his father at some point. He came back in his 20s and gave what was his first and last sermon at Temple Emanu-El. He had adopted and absorbed some ideas while he was in Germany that were completely anathema to the Reform community, and he spun off the Ethical Culture Society.
Julius Oppenheimer, Robert’s father, was a trustee of the Ethical Culture Society, and Felix Adler conducted the wedding ceremony of Julius to Ella Oppenheimer, Robert’s mother. J. Robert Oppenheimer was educated at the Ethical Culture school. It was supposed to be non-religious and yet it was clearly dominated by Jews. It was one of these things about being American through and through, and somehow not having Judaism stand in the way. I think that really shaped Oppenheimer’s approach to Judaism.
Was there an ethos that he might have absorbed from the Ethical Cultural school that would have been important either in his left-wing politics or in his approach to the Manhattan Project?
My suspicion is yes, because Felix Adler in his training in Germany had become quite interested in Karl Marx and in the plight of the working class, and it seems impossible to me that that didn’t get somehow transmitted at the Ethical Culture school. It does not surprise me that Oppenheimer’s politics were left leaning.
As an adult, did Oppenheimer ever talk about his Judaism publicly or explain what his connection was to either the people or the faith?
Almost not at all, although there are some quite interesting quotes from other people. The Nobel laureate physicist Isidor Isaac Rabi and Oppenheimer were quite close, and Rabi testified on Oppenheimer’s behalf at the security hearing in 1954. According to Ray Monk’s massive biography of Oppenheimer, Rabb says that “what prevented Oppenheimer from being fully integrated was his denial of a centrally important part of himself: his Jewishness.” And Felix Bloch, who was another Jewish physicist who went on to win the Nobel Prize, said that Oppenheimer tried to act as if he were not a Jew, and succeeded because he was a good actor. You know, when you can’t integrate yourself and you’re trying to distance yourself from your roots, you can become conflicted. That’s Rabi’s assessment of Oppenheimer’s connection to Judaism.
But you also found a few instances of Oppenheimer positively engaging with Jews and Judaism.
In 1934, when Oppenheimer was a professor at Berkeley, he earmarked 3% of his salary for two years to help Jewish scientists emigrate from Germany. I think the fact that they were scientists was the important thing, and of course they were Jewish, because they’re the ones who were trying to get out in 1934. I don’t know that he was doing this because they were Jews or because they were scientists. Supposedly, Oppenheimer sponsored his aunt and cousin to emigrate from Germany, and then he continued to assist them after they came to the United States.
And then in 1954, at the security clearance hearing, Oppenheimer said that starting in late 1936, he developed “a continuing, smoldering fury about the treatment of Jews in Germany.” I don’t know if you had gone back to 1936 that you would have found any evidence of him saying that at the time. I doubt it. But one thing to remember is that in Oppenheimer’s lifetime, antisemitism was not non-existent. Antisemitism shaped how people dealt with their Judaism and this was the way he dealt with it.
So fast forward, Oppenheimer grew up well-to-do in New York and was educated at Harvard and then in Europe, where he studied physics at the University of Cambridge and the University of Göttingen. He joins the staff at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley, and he begins socializing with leftist professors — both communists and so-called fellow travelers, deeply involved in workers’ rights and supporting the anti-fascists in the Spanish Civil War — in ways that are going to come back to haunt him in the 1950s. In the “American Prometheus” biography, which Nolan’s film is based on, we learn that Oppenheimer’s political activities came to the attention of the FBI at this point, years before his work on the atom bomb project.
That’s correct. He clearly had sympathy for those causes. And I would say understandably. There was a depression going on in this country, and the workers’ condition was not perfect.
There are now historians who are claiming Oppenheimer really was a card-carrying communist despite his denials. He certainly was a fellow traveler, his brother Frank was clearly a card-carrying communist as was Robert’s future wife Kitty.
In 1942 Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Grove was appointed director of what became known as the Manhattan Project, and selected Oppenheimer to head the project’s secret weapons laboratory.
Groves and Oppenheimer seem to have a chemistry which was critical for the success of the project. Why Groves figured that Oppenheimer was the guy to lead it is a little bit of a mystery. Oppenheimer had not led anything even remotely like this. He was a theoretical physicist, and you’re talking about huge experimental facilities for the project. And he wasn’t yet 40. But Oppenheimer rose to the occasion.
You mentioned earlier what Oppenheimer later described as his “smoldering fury” over the Nazis treatment of the Jews. Did working on a bomb to defeat Nazi Germany assuage whatever pangs of conscience he might have had over developing a bomb of such massive destructive potential?
I do think so. And that was probably true for many of the scientists who worked on the project, many of whom were Jewish. There was also a suspicion that the Nazis were working on a bomb as well and then God forbid that they should get there first. I think that was really the driver.
I’vre read that Oppenheimer did not feel guilt over his contribution to developing nuclear weapons or the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki but he did feel a sense of responsibility for what had been unleashed.
Oppenheimer realized that a lot of people lost their lives as a result of this. But I will tell you, my father was a GI during World War II, he enlisted in 1943 and fought until ’45. He was in Europe when V.E. Day came, and then came back to the United States for leave before he was going to be shipped out to the Pacific. And my father was convinced to his dying day that the bomb saved his life [by ending the war with Japan]. And, you know, that was a widespread sentiment.
After the war, Oppenheimer ends up in Princeton directing the famous Institute for Advanced Study and that’s going to bring him into the crosshairs of Lewis Strauss. Tell us who he is and how these two Jewish figures contrasted.
Three of Strauss’ four grandparents emigrated from Germany/Austria, probably in the 1830s, 1840s. Somebody ended up in Virginia and Strauss grew up in the South. His connection to Judaism is quite different from Oppenheimer’s. Strauss was a valedictorian of his high school and in his autobiography says that he was absolutely fascinated by physics. But the family had no money so rather than go to college Strauss became a traveling shoe salesman. And even though merchants he sold to would be closed on Sunday, he insisted on [also] taking Saturday off because of his Judaism, and he took the financial hit. He ended up volunteering to work for Herbert Hoover, the future Republican president, who was organizing European relief efforts after World War I. Hoover becomes a lifelong friend, advocate and supporter. Strauss managed to push Hoover — no friend to the Jews — to lodge a formal complaint when some Jews were slaughtered by the Poles.
He had a pretty meteoric rise. He gets connected to the Kuhn, Loeb investment firm, marries the daughter of one of the partners and he makes money hand over fist. But he stayed connected with his Judaism through all this, eventually becoming the president of Temple Emanu-El for 10 years from 1938 to 1948. So just like there are political differences between Oppenheimer and Strauss, there are religious differences: Oppenheimer grows up in the Felix Adler breakaway and Strauss is mainstream Reform Judaism.
Strauss was a trustee of the Institute for Advanced Studies when it hired Oppenheimer. What else came between the two men? I’ve read that Strauss was a proponent of the hydrogen bomb, and Robert Oppenheimer was hesitant because he felt the astronomically greater power of the H-bomb was not necessary.
The H-bomb was physicist Edward Teller’s idea — he called it “the super” — and Oppenheimer appropriately sidelined Teller at Los Alamos, saying “this is a distraction from what we’re trying to accomplish.”
The animosity between Strauss and Oppenheimer had probably several different dimensions. But I think Strauss also had to navigate being Jewish in an American society that didn’t totally embrace Jews, and I think it was somewhat of a threat to him to have somebody like Oppenheimer whose approach to dealing with his Judaism was to hide it, basically. Here’s Strauss, you know, president of Temple Emanu-El, he’s clearly not hiding that he’s Jewish, and he’s trying to survive and thrive in a Washington establishment that’s not so embracing of Judaism. So that was another dimension. I’d even read that Strauss was offended by Oppenheimer’s alleged marital infidelity.
The animosity also includes the fact that Oppenheimer could be mean. Generally, people who worked at the laboratory loved him, but he could also be mean, and he made Strauss feel like a fool in a public hearing in 1949 — sort of like, “You’re an amateur physicist. You don’t know what you’re talking about,” and that really cut to the quick.
Whatever the reason, Strauss is not a good enemy to have when he becomes a trustee of the Atomic Energy Commission. It’s Strauss who in 1953 told Oppenheimer that his security clearance had been suspended, and led Oppenheimer to request the hearing that led to his security clearance being revoked.
Strauss was appointed one of the five members of the original Atomic Energy Commission. The chair at the time was David Lilienthal, also Jewish by the way, and there’s a photograph of the five members of the Commission that’s absolutely perfect because there are four people on one side on the left, and one person sort of off by himself on the right — and it’s Strauss who’s off by himself. And there were apparently a few dozen votes of the Commission in its early years, mostly having to do with security matters, where the vote was four to one and Strauss was the lone dissenting voice. He was focused on security and was probably very anti-communist.
I want to shift gears and talk about your background, and how a physicist becomes a rabbi.
I was a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego, and my thesis advisor sent me to Los Alamos for the summer of 1979 to learn a certain piece of physics. My connection to Judaism at that stage in my life was almost nil. I had done the classic sort of Conservative American Jewish upbringing of post-bar mitzvah alienation. When I came to Los Alamos I didn’t know a single person in town, so I thought I could go to the synagogue and meet some people. And because my training was reasonably thorough in the liturgy, I started leading some things at the synagogue while I was here.
Instead of going back to UC San Diego, I ended up continuing my graduate studies at the laboratory and completing my PhD while I was still here, and then got hired as a staff member at the laboratory. And all that time there was a rabbi who was coming up from Santa Fe to Los Alamos, and would teach an adult education class and I got interested. I had the arrogance of a newly minted PhD physicist that if you can learn physics, you can learn anything. So I started doing a lot of self-teaching in Judaism.
And what I discovered, which is my passion in the rabbinate, is that adult Judaism is not taught to kids because kids are kids. And most people reject Judaism like I did because they don’t know that Judaism is much richer than what most people reject. I spent my entire physics career here at the lab and in parallel, as I became more knowledgeable in Judaism, I came to know that I didn’t know anything. Then it turns out that there was a rabbi, Gershon Winkler, who moved to New Mexico and took me on as a private student, and that process led to my private ordination through him.
To pull the threads together, I’m curious how you as a physicist think about your responsibility for the uses of science, and how they mesh or clash with what you are learning in Torah.
I’ll steer your question slightly, if that’s okay. [The medieval Jewish philosopher] Maimonides says clearly that we’re given brains and the ability to do rational thought. Judaism is, it seems to me, inherently compatible with the idea of using your brain to understand how the world works, which is what physics is all about. Physics can help us see the beauty in the universe. And that beauty is part of what we’re given as a responsibility to appreciate in Judaism as well.
But science can also be applied for destructive purposes.
We are in a world that is not perfect. And, you know, there have been wars since time immemorial. Atomic weapons were used to end a war, and that was important. Like I said, my father to his dying day felt that his life was saved because of the atomic bomb, and you know, who’s to say that he was wrong?
In Los Alamos, how does the community process their legacy? Is it one of unmitigated pride or is it always leavened by regret about the destructive forces that were unleashed?
I think Oppenheimer is generally viewed very positively. What happened in Los Alamos was an important part of the history of the world. And it’s inspiring to be here at a place where, 80 years ago, there was basically nothing but a small boys’ school.

As the movie Oppenheimer is released, Ben Platts-Mills explores the true story of the enigmatic Manhattan Project scientist, and the atomic bomb that made him a ""destroyer of worlds"".
It was the early hours of 16 July 1945, and Robert Oppenheimer was waiting in a control bunker for a moment that would change the world. Around 10km (6 miles) away, the world's first atomic bomb test, codenamed ""Trinity"", was set to proceed in the pale sands of the Jornada del Muerto desert, in New Mexico.
Oppenheimer was a picture of nervous exhaustion. He was always slender, but after three years as director of ""Project Y"", the scientific arm of the ""Manhattan Engineer District"" that had designed and built the bomb, his weight had dropped to just over 52kg (115lbs). At 5ft 10in (178cm), this made him extremely thin. He'd slept only four hours that night, kept awake by anxiety and his smoker's cough.
That day in 1945 is one of several pivotal moments in Oppenheimer's life described by the historians Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin in their 2005 biography American Prometheus, which provided the basis for the new movie biopic Oppenheimer, released 21 July in the US.
In the final minutes of the countdown, as Bird and Sherwin report, an army general observed Oppenheimer's mood at close-quarters: ""Dr. Oppenheimer... grew tenser as the last seconds ticked off. He scarcely breathed...""
The explosion, when it came, outshone the Sun. With a force matching 21 kilotonnes of TNT, the detonation was the largest ever seen. It created a shockwave that was felt 160km (100 miles) away. As the roar engulfed the landscape and the mushroom cloud rose in the sky, Oppenheimer's expression relaxed into one of ""tremendous relief"". Minutes later, Oppenheimer's friend and colleague Isidor Rabi caught sight of him from a distance: ""I’ll never forget his walk; I’ll never forget the way he stepped out of the car... his walk was like High Noon... this kind of strut. He had done it.""
In interviews conducted in the 1960s, Oppenheimer added a layer of gravitas to his reaction, claiming that, in the moments after the detonation, a line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita, had come into his mind: ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""

In the following days, his friends reported he seemed increasingly depressed. ""Robert got very still and ruminative during that two-week period,"" one recalled, ""because he knew what was about to happen."" One morning he was heard lamenting (in condescending terms) the imminent fate of the Japanese: ""Those poor little people, those poor little people."" But only days later, he was once again nervous, focussed, exacting.
In a meeting with his military counterparts, he seemed to have forgotten all about the ""poor little people"". According to Bird and Sherwin, he was instead fixated on the importance of the right conditions for the bomb drop: ""Of course, they must not drop it in rain or fog… Don’t let them detonate it too high. The figure fixed on is just right. Don’t let it go up [higher] or the target won’t get as much damage."" When he announced the successful bombing of Hiroshima to a crowd of his colleagues less than a month after Trinity, one onlooker noticed the way Oppenheimer ""clasped and pumped his hand over his head like a victorious prizefighter"". The applause ""practically raised the roof"".
The combination of nervous fragility, ambition, grandiosity and morbid gloom are hard to square in a single person
Oppenheimer was the emotional and intellectual heart of the Manhattan Project: more than any other single person he had made the bomb a reality. Jeremy Bernstein, who worked with him after the war, was convinced that nobody else could have done it. As he wrote in his 2004 biography, A Portrait of an Enigma, ""If Oppenheimer had not been the director at Los Alamos, I am persuaded that, for better or worse, the Second World War would have ended... without the use of nuclear weapons.""
The variety of Oppenheimer's reported reactions as he witnessed the fruition of his labours, not to mention the pace with which he moved through them, might seem bewildering. The combination of nervous fragility, ambition, grandiosity and morbid gloom are hard to square in a single person, especially one so instrumental in the very project provoking these responses.
Bird and Sherwin also call Oppenheimer an ""enigma"": ""A theoretical physicist who displayed the charismatic qualities of a great leader, an aesthete who cultivated ambiguities."" A scientist, but also, as another friend once described him ""a first-class manipulator of the imagination"".
Oppenheimer: The movie The movie Oppenheimer, released 21 July in the US, is based on the Pulitzer prize-winning book American Prometheus. Oppenheimer is played by Cillian Murphy. Several other real people are portrayed, such as Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), the general who recruited Oppenheimer, as well as figures from his personal life, including Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), a psychiatrist who he dated in the 1930s, and his wife Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt). Read BBC Culture's review of Oppenheimer and why it is a deserving masterpiece.
By Bird and Sherwin's account, the contradictions in Oppenheimer's character – the qualities that have left both friends and biographers at a loss to explain him – seem to have been present from his earliest years. Born in New York City in 1904, Oppenheimer was the child of first-generation German Jewish immigrants who had become wealthy through the textiles trade. The family home was a large apartment on the Upper West Side with three maids, a chauffeur, and European art on the walls.
Despite this luxurious upbringing, Oppenheimer was recalled as unspoiled and generous by childhood friends. A school friend, Jane Didisheim, remembered him as someone who ""blushed extraordinarily easily"", who was ""very frail, very pink-cheeked, very shy..."", but also ""very brilliant"". ""Very quickly everybody admitted that he was different from all the others and superior,"" she said.
By the age of nine, he was reading philosophy in Greek and Latin, and was obsessed with mineralogy – roaming Central Park and writing letters to the New York Mineralogical Club about what he found. His letters were so competent that the Club mistook him for an adult and invited him to make a presentation. This intellectual nature contributed to a degree of solitude in the young Oppenheimer, write Bird and Sherwin. ""He was usually preoccupied with whatever he was doing or thinking,"" recalled a friend. He was uninterested in conforming to gender expectations – taking no interest in sports or the ""rough and tumble of his age-group"" as his cousin put it; ""He was often teased and ridiculed for not being like other fellows."" But his parents were convinced of his genius.
""I repaid my parents’ confidence in me by developing an unpleasant ego,"" Oppenheimer later commented, ""which I am sure must have affronted both children and adults who were unfortunate enough to come into contact with me."" ""It’s no fun,"" he once told another friend, ""to turn the pages of a book and say, 'yes, yes, of course, I know that'.""
When he left home to study chemistry at Harvard University, the fragility of Oppenheimer's psychological make-up was exposed: his brittle arrogance and thinly-masked sensitivity appearing to serve him poorly. In a letter from 1923, published in a 1980 collection edited by Alice Kimbal Smith and Charles Weiner, he wrote: ""I labour and write innumerable theses, notes, poems, stories and junk… I make stenches in three different labs…I serve tea and talk learnedly to a few lost souls, go off for the weekend to distill low grade energy into laughter and exhaustion, read Greek, commit faux pas, search my desk for letters, and wish I were dead. Voila.""

Subsequent letters collated by Smith and Weiner reveal that the problems continued through his post-graduate studies, in Cambridge, England. His tutor insisted on applied laboratory work, one of Oppenheimer's weaknesses. ""I am having a pretty bad time,"" he wrote in 1925. ""The lab work is a terrible bore, and I am so bad at it that it is impossible to feel that I am learning anything."" Later that year, Oppenheimer's intensity led him close to disaster when he deliberately left an apple, poisoned with laboratory chemicals, on his tutor's desk. His friends later speculated he could have been driven by envy and feelings of inadequacy. The tutor didn't eat the apple but Oppenheimer's place at Cambridge was threatened and he kept it only on condition that he see a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist diagnosed psychosis but then wrote him off, saying that treatment would do no good.
Recalling that period, Oppenheimer would later report that he seriously contemplated suicide over the Christmas holidays. The following year, during a visit to Paris, his close friend Francis Fergusson told him he had proposed to his girlfriend. Oppenheimer responded by attempting to strangle him: ""He jumped on me from behind with a trunk strap,"" Fergusson recalled, ""and wound it around my neck... I managed to pull aside and he fell on the ground weeping.""
It seems that where psychiatry failed Oppenheimer, literature came to the rescue. According to Bird and Sherwin, he read Marcel Proust's A La Recherché du Temps Perdu while on a walking holiday in Corsica, finding in it some reflection of his own state of mind that reassured him and opened a window on a more compassionate mode of being. He learned by heart a passage from the book about ""indifference to the sufferings one causes"", being ""the terrible and permanent form of cruelty"". The question of attitude towards suffering would remain an abiding interest, guiding Oppenheimer's interest in spiritual and philosophical texts throughout his life and eventually playing a significant role in the work that would define his reputation. A comment he made to his friends on this same holiday seems prophetic: ""The kind of person that I admire most would be one who becomes extraordinarily good at doing a lot of things but still maintains a tear-stained countenance.""

He returned to England in lighter spirits, feeling ""much kinder and more tolerant"", as he later recalled. Early in 1926, he met the director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Göttingen in Germany, who quickly became convinced of Oppenheimer's talents as a theoretician, inviting him to study there. According to Smith and Weiner, he later described 1926 as the year of his ""coming into physics"". It would prove a turning point. He obtained his PhD and a postdoctoral fellowship in the year to follow. He also became part of a community that was driving the development of theoretical physics, meeting scientists who would become life-long friends. Many would ultimately join Oppenheimer at Los Alamos.

Returning to the US, Oppenheimer spent a few months at Harvard before moving to pursue his physics career in California. The tone of his letters from this period reflect a steadier, more generous cast of mind. He wrote to his younger brother about romance, and his ongoing interest in the arts.
At the University of California in Berkeley, he worked closely with experimentalists, interpreting their results on cosmic rays and nuclear disintegration. He later described finding himself ""the only one who understood what this was all about"". The department he eventually created stemmed, he said, from the need to communicate about the theory he loved: ""Explaining first to faculty, staff, and colleagues and then to anyone who would listen ... what had been learned, what the unsolved problems were."" He described himself as a ""difficult"" teacher at first but it was through this role that Oppenheimer honed the charisma and social presence that would carry him during his time at Project Y. Quoted by Smith and Weiner, one colleague recalled how his students ""emulated him as best they could. They copied his gestures, his mannerisms, his intonations. He truly influenced their lives.""
All things which evoke discipline: study, and our duties to men and to the commonwealth, war... ought to be greeted by us with profound gratitude; for only through them can we attain to the least detachment; and only so can we know peace – Oppenheimer
During the early 1930s, as he strengthened his academic career, Oppenheimer continued to moonlight in the humanities. It was during this period that he discovered the Hindu scriptures, learning Sanskrit in order to read the untranslated Bhagavad Gita – the text from which he later drew the famous '""Now I am become Death"" quotation. It seems his interest was not just intellectual, but represented a continuation of the self-prescribed bibliotherapy that had begun with Proust in his 20s. The Bhagavad Gita, a story centred on the war between two arms of an aristocratic family, gave Oppenheimer a philosophical underpinning that was directly applicable to the moral ambiguity he confronted at Project Y. It emphasised ideas of duty, fate and detachment from outcome, emphasising that fear of consequences cannot be used as justification for inaction. In a letter to his brother from 1932, Oppenheimer specifically references the Gita and then names war as one circumstance that might offer the opportunity to put such a philosophy into practice:
""I believe that through discipline... we can achieve serenity... I believe that through discipline we learn to preserve what is essential to our happiness in more and more adverse circumstances... Therefore I think that all things which evoke discipline: study, and our duties to men and to the commonwealth, war... ought to be greeted by us with profound gratitude; for only through them can we attain to the least detachment; and only so can we know peace.""
In the mid 1930s, Oppenheimer also met Jean Tatlock, a psychiatrist and physician with whom he fell in love. By Bird and Sherwin's account, Tatlock's complexity of character equalled Oppenheimer's. She was widely read and driven by a social conscience. She was described by a childhood friend as ""touched with greatness"". Oppenheimer proposed to Tatlock more than once but she turned him down. She is credited with introducing him to radical politics and to the poetry of John Donne. The pair continued to see each other occasionally after Oppenheimer married the biologist Katherine ""Kitty"" Harrison in 1940. Kitty was to join Oppenheimer at Project Y, where she worked as a phlebotomist, researching the dangers of radiation.

In 1939, physicists were far more concerned about the nuclear threat than politicians were and it was a letter from Albert Einstein that first brought the matter to the attention of senior leaders in the US government. The reaction was slow, but alarm continued to circulate in the scientific community and eventually the president was persuaded to act. As one of the preeminent physicists in the country, Oppenheimer was one of several scientists appointed to begin looking more seriously into the potential for nuclear weapons. By September 1942, partly thanks to Oppenheimer's team, it was clear that a bomb was possible and concrete plans for its development started to take shape. According to Bird and Sherwin, when he heard that his name was being floated as a leader for this endeavour, Oppenheimer began his own preparations. ""I’m cutting off every communist connection,"" he said to a friend at the time. ""For if I don’t, the government will find it difficult to use me. I don’t want to let anything interfere with my usefulness to the nation.""
Einstein would later say: ""The trouble with Oppenheimer is that he loves [something that] doesn’t love him – the United States government."" His patriotism and desire to please clearly played a role in his recruitment. General Leslie Groves, the military leader of the Manhattan Engineer District, was the person responsible for finding a scientific director for the bomb project. According to a 2002 biography, Racing for the Bomb, when Groves proposed Oppenheimer as scientific lead, he met with opposition. Oppenheimer's ""extreme liberal background"" was a concern. But as well as noting his talent and his existing knowledge of the science, Groves also pointed out his ""overweening ambition"". The Manhattan Project's chief of security also noticed this: ""I became convinced that not only was he loyal, but that he would let nothing interfere with the successful accomplishment of his task and thus his place in scientific history.""
In the 1988 book The Making of the Atomic Bomb, Oppenheimer's friend Isidor Rabi is quoted as saying he thought it ""a most improbable appointment"", but later conceded it had been ""a real stroke of genius on the part of General Groves"".

At Los Alamos, Oppenheimer applied his contrarian, interdisciplinary convictions as much as anywhere. In his 1979 autobiography, What Little I Remember, the Austrian-born physicist Otto Frisch recalled that Oppenheimer had recruited not only the scientists required but also ""a painter, a philosopher and a few other unlikely characters; he felt that a civilised community would be incomplete without them"".
I became convinced that not only was he loyal, but that he would let nothing interfere with the successful accomplishment of his task and thus his place in scientific history – Manhattan Project chief of security
After the war, Oppenheimer's attitude seemed to change . He described nuclear weapons as instruments ""of aggression, of surprise, and of terror"" and the weapons industry as ""the devil's work"". At a meeting in October 1945, he famously told President Truman: ""I feel I have blood on my hands."" The President later said: ""I told him the blood was on my hands – to let me worry about that.""
The exchange is an arresting echo of one described in Oppenheimer's beloved Bhagavad Gita, between Prince Arjuna and the god Krishna. Arjuna refuses to fight because he believes he will be responsible for the murder of his fellows, but Krishna takes away the burden: ""View in me the active slayer of these men... Arise, on fame, on victory, on kingly joys intent! They are already slain by me; be you the instrument.""
During the development of the bomb, Oppenheimer had used a similar argument to assuage his own and his colleagues' ethical hesitations. He told them that, as scientists, they were not responsible for decisions about how the weapon should be used – only for doing their job. The blood, if there was any, would be on the hands of the politicians. However, it seems that once the deed was done, Oppenheimer's confidence in this position was shaken. As Bird and Sherwin relate, in his role at the Atomic Energy Commission during the post-war period, he argued against the development of further weapons, including the more powerful hydrogen bomb, which his work had paved the way for.
These efforts resulted in Oppenheimer being investigated by the US government in 1954 and having his security clearance stripped, marking the end of his involvement with policy work. The academic community came to his defence. Writing for The New Republic in 1955, the philosopher Bertrand Russell commented that the ""investigation made it undeniable that he has committed mistakes, one of them from a security point of view rather grave. But there was no evidence of disloyalty or of anything that could be considered treasonable... The scientists were caught in a tragic dilemma.""
In 1963, the US government presented him with the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation, but it wasn't until 2022, 55 years after his death, that the US government overturned its 1954 decision to strip his clearance, and affirmed Oppenheimer's loyalty.
Throughout the last decades of Oppenheimer's life, he maintained parallel expressions of pride at the technical achievement of the bomb and guilt at its effects. A note of resignation also entered his commentary, with him saying more than once that the bomb had simply been inevitable. He spent the last 20 years of his life as director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, working alongside Einstein and other physicists.

As at Los Alamos, he made a point of promoting interdisciplinary work and emphasised in his speeches the belief that science needed the humanities in order to better understand its own implications, write Bird and Sherwin. To this end, he recruited a raft of non-scientists including classicists, poets, and psychologists.
He later came to consider atomic energy as a problem that outstripped the intellectual tools of its time, as, in President Truman's words, ""a new force too revolutionary to consider in the framework of old ideas"". In a speech made in 1965, later published in the 1984 collection Uncommon Sense, he said ""I have heard from some of the great men of our time that when they found something startling, they knew it was good, because they were afraid"". When talking about moments of unsettling scientific discovery, he was fond of quoting the poet John Donne: ""Tis all in pieces, all coherence gone.""

John Keats, another poet Oppenheimer enjoyed, coined the phrase ""negative capability"" to describe a common quality in the people he admired: ""that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason."" It seems as though it was something of this that the philosopher Russell was getting at when he wrote of Oppenheimer's ""inability to see things simply, an inability which is not surprising in one possessed of a complex and delicate mental apparatus."" In describing Oppenheimer's contradictions, his mutability, his continual running between poetry and science, his habit of defying simple description, perhaps we are identifying the very qualities that made him capable of pursuing the creation of the bomb.

Even in the midst of this great and terrible pursuit, Oppenheimer kept alive the ""tear stained countenance"" he had foretold in his 20s. The name of the ""Trinity"" test is thought to have come from the John Donne poem Batter my heart, three-person'd God: ""That I may rise and stand, o'erthrow me, and bend/Your force to break, blow, burn, and make me new."" Jean Tatlock, who had introduced him to Donne, and with whom he is thought by some to have remained in love, had committed suicide the year before the test. The bomb project was marked everywhere by Oppenheimer's imagination, and by his sense of romance and tragedy. Perhaps it was overweening ambition that General Groves identified when he interviewed Oppenheimer for the job at Project Y, or perhaps it was his ability to adopt, for the time required, the idea of overweening ambition. As much as it was the result of research, the bomb was the product of Oppenheimer's ability and willingness to imagine himself as the kind of a person that could make it happen.
A chain smoker since adolescence, Oppenheimer suffered bouts of tuberculosis during his life. He died of throat cancer in 1967, at the age of 62. Two years before his death, in a rare moment of simplicity, he drew a distinction that marked out the practice of science from that of poetry. Unlike poetry, he said, ""science is the business of learning not to make the same mistake again"".

NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Oppenheimer Asset Management on Tuesday projected the S&P 500 would rise above its record high by year end, the latest Wall Street firm to grow more bullish on the outlook for stocks following the market's rally this year.
Oppenheimer lifted its year-end price target for the S&P 500 to 4,900 from the 4,400 projection it set in December, Chief Investment Strategist John Stoltzfus said in a note. The new target represents a roughly 7% increase from Monday's closing price for the benchmark index, which has gained 19% this year.
The S&P 500 record closing high is 4,796.56, reached on Jan. 3, 2022, while the index's intraday record is 4,818.62, which it hit on Jan. 4, 2022.
Stoltzfus said his new target stemmed from expectations that U.S. inflation will continue to trend lower, the Federal Reserve's rate-hiking cycle appears closer to ending, and ""capitulation"" by stock market bears ""suggests that money held on the sidelines may flow into stocks in the months ahead.""
""Our appraisal of the market landscape ... suggests that opportunity outweighs risk as current monetary policy generates a transition from a 'free money' environment to an environment with a traditional cost of borrowing,"" Stoltzfus said in the note.
Oppenheimer's more bullish view comes after Citigroup (C.N) recently boosted its S&P 500 price target by 15%, saying the more upbeat view reflected increased probability of an economic soft landing.
Morgan Stanley (MS.N) strategist Michael Wilson late last month acknowledged that ""our more bearish views on the broader US equity market have been wrong this year,"" although the firm's base-case June 2024 price target of 4,200 is about 8.5% below current S&P 500 levels.

,Oppenheimer Offers Us a Fresh Warning of AI’s Danger,The U.S. ignored Oppenheimer’s warnings about nuclear weapons and rushed to build and deploy a dangerous technology. We must not make the same mistake with AI,"American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (far left) points to a picture of the atomic bomb explosion over Nagasaki, Japan, as scientist Henry D. Smyth (second from left), Major General Kenneth D. Nichols (second from right) and scientist Glenn Seaborg (far right) look on in the 1940s.
The U.S. ignored Oppenheimer’s warnings about nuclear weapons and rushed to build and deploy a dangerous technology. We must not make the same mistake with AI
Eighty-one years ago, President Franklin D. Roosevelt tasked the young physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer with setting up a secret laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M. Along with his colleagues, Oppenheimer was tasked with developing the world’s first nuclear weapons under the code name the Manhattan Project. Less than three years later, they succeeded. In 1945 the U.S. dropped these weapons on the residents of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing hundreds of thousands of people.
Oppenheimer became known as “the father of the atomic bomb.” Despite his misplaced satisfaction with his wartime service and technological achievement, he also became vocal about the need to contain this dangerous technology.
But the U.S. didn’t heed his warnings, and geopolitical fear instead won the day. The nation raced to deploy ever more powerful nuclear systems with scant recognition of the immense and disproportionate harm these weapons would cause. Officials also ignored Oppenheimer’s calls for greater international collaboration to regulate nuclear technology.
Oppenheimer’s example holds lessons for us today, too. We must not make the same mistake with artificial intelligence as we made with nuclear weapons.
We are still in the early stages of a promised artificial intelligence revolution. Tech companies are racing to build and deploy AI-powered large language models, such as ChatGPT. Regulators need to keep up.
Though AI promises immense benefits, it has already exposed its potential for harm and abuse. Earlier this year the U.S. surgeon general released a report on the youth mental health crisis. It found that one in three teenage girls considered suicide in 2021. The data are unequivocal: big tech is a big part of the problem. AI will only amplify that manipulation and exploitation. The performance of AI rests on exploitative labor practices, both domestically and internationally. And massive, opaque AI models that are fed problematic data often exacerbate existing biases in society—affecting everything from criminal sentencing and policing to health care, lending, housing and hiring. In addition, the environmental impacts of running such energy-hungry AI models stress already fragile ecosystems reeling from the impacts of climate change.
AI also promises to make potentially perilous technology more accessible to rogue actors. Last year researchers asked a generative AI model to design new chemical weapons. It designed 40,000 potential weapons in six hours. An earlier version of ChatGPT generated bomb-making instructions. And a class exercise at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology recently demonstrated how AI can help create synthetic pathogens, which could potentially ignite the next pandemic. By spreading access to such dangerous information, AI threatens to become the computerized equivalent of an assault weapon or a high-capacity magazine: a vehicle for one rogue person to unleash devastating harm at a magnitude never seen before.
Yet companies and private actors are not the only ones racing to deploy untested AI. We should also be wary of governments pushing to militarize AI. We already have a nuclear launch system precariously perched on mutually assured destruction that gives world leaders just a few minutes to decide whether to launch nuclear weapons in the case of a perceived incoming attack. AI-powered automation of nuclear launch systems could soon remove the practice of having a “human in the loop”—a necessary safeguard to ensure faulty computerized intelligence doesn’t lead to nuclear war, which has come close to happening multiple times already. A military automation race, designed to give decision-makers greater ability to respond in an increasingly complex world, could lead to conflicts spiraling out of control. If countries rush to adopt militarized AI technology, we will all lose.
As in the 1940s, there is a critical window to shape the development of this emerging and potentially dangerous technology. Oppenheimer recognized that the U.S. should work with even its deepest antagonists to internationally control the dangerous side of nuclear technology—while still pursuing its peaceful uses. Castigating the man and the idea, the U.S. instead kicked off a vast cold war arms race by developing hydrogen bombs, along with related costly and occasionally bizarre delivery systems and atmospheric testing. The resultant nuclear-industrial complex disproportionately harmed the most vulnerable. Uranium mining and atmospheric testing caused cancer among groups that included residents of New Mexico, Marshallese communities and members of the Navajo Nation. The wasteful spending, opportunity cost and impact on marginalized communities were incalculable—to say nothing of the numerous close calls and the proliferation of nuclear weapons that ensued. Today we need both international cooperation and domestic regulation to ensure that AI develops safely.
Congress must act now to regulate tech companies to ensure that they prioritize the collective public interest. Congress should start by passing my Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, my Algorithmic Justice and Online Transparency Act and my bill prohibiting the launch of nuclear weapons by AI. But that’s just the beginning. Guided by the White House’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, Congress needs to pass broad regulations to stop this reckless race to build and deploy unsafe artificial intelligence. Decisions about how and where to use AI cannot be left to tech companies alone. They must be made by centering on the communities most vulnerable to exploitation and harm from AI. And we must be open to working with allies and adversaries alike to avoid both military and civilian abuses of AI.
At the start of the nuclear age, rather than heed Oppenheimer’s warning on the dangers of an arms race, the U.S. fired the starting gun. Eight decades later, we have a moral responsibility and a clear interest in not repeating that mistake.

2023-08-07 20:48:39+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’ Extends Imax 70mm Run Due to Popular Demand (EXCLUSIVE),"""Oppenheimer"" has extended its 70mm run at Imax theaters nationwide through the end of August due to popular demand.","Due to popular demand, “Oppenheimer” has extended its 70mm run at Imax theaters nationwide through the end of August.
The previous end date, which was already an extension of the film’s original run in Imax 70mm format, was Aug. 17. Tickets for Christopher Nolan’s atomic bomb drama are already on sale through Aug. 31 at some Imax theaters, as exhibitors will make them available on a rolling basis.
Nolan, a longtime vocal champion of the premium format, touted Imax 70mm as the “best possible experience” to see “Oppenheimer” because “the sharpness and the clarity and the depth of the image is unparalleled.” Only 19 theaters in the U.S. (and 30 worldwide) have the capability to play films in Imax 70mm, including the AMC Universal CityWalk in Los Angeles and the AMC Lincoln Square in New York — making those screens some of the hottest tickets in town.
“It actually looks better in film,” Imax CEO Richard Gelfond tells Variety. “It’s not just about nostalgia. It’s a better experience.”
A lot of work goes into the 70mm experience, he adds. It takes three days to make an Imax film print, and each one is crafted directly from Nolan’s film negative. In the case of “Oppenheimer,” which clocks in at three hours, physical reels are 11 miles long and weigh 600 pounds.
The process is “time consuming and expensive,” Gelfond admits. But ultimately, it’s “worth it.”
Already, the historical biopic starring Cillian Murphy as the “father of the atomic bomb” J. Robert Oppenheimer, has raked in over $550 million at the global box office, a triumphant feat for an R-rated drama that runs over three hours long. Imax has accounted for a remarkable $114.2 million (22%) of the film’s worldwide total.
“Oppenheimer” will control the Imax footprint until Denzel Washington’s “The Equalizer 3” takes its spot on Sept. 1. Later in the year, Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune Part II,” also filmed with Imax cameras, is getting an exclusive Imax run starting on Nov. 3.
Still, executives at Imax are confident this summer won’t be the last of “Oppenheimer” in Nolan’s preferred format.
“Imax 70mm film lasts, on average, 10 times longer than regular 70mm or 35mm film. Those prints are assets that we’ll be using for the next 20 years,” says Mark Jafar, global head of corporate communications for Imax. “Places like BFI [in London] or Lincoln Square will do Nolan retrospectives or bring back ‘Oppenheimer’ given how popular it is. We’ll be showing it in this format for years to come.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItaW1heC03MG1tLWV4dGVuZGVkLXRpY2tldHMtMTIzNTY4OTg5OS_SAVlodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9uZXdzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWltYXgtNzBtbS1leHRlbmRlZC10aWNrZXRzLTEyMzU2ODk4OTkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-16 22:29:27+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’s Cillian Murphy On Why He Likes To See Christopher Nolan Films Without Him In Them & Why He Adores ‘Interstellar’,Cillian Murphy is talking about his favorite Christopher Nolan film without him and why he likes watching films by the 'Oppenheimer' director where he's not in them.,"Oppenheimer marked the sixth time Cillian Murphy starred in a film directed by Christopher Nolan following The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception and Dunkirk.
Out of the 13 films Nolan has directed, Murphy has been in close to half of them and there’s one particular title that the Irish actor would’ve liked to be a part of.
“I adore Interstellar just because I find it so emotional,” Murphy told The Independent in an interview before the SAG-AFTRA strike. “I remember seeing it in the cinema when I had little kids. It just had a big impact on me. It broke my heart.”
Murphy also noted that he enjoys watching Nolan’s work, particularly when he is not part of the ensemble cast.
“I love watching his films when I’m not in them because you don’t have to freak out about the size of your ears, or whatever,” he added.
Interstellar is a 2014 science fiction film, directed, co-written and produced by Nolan. The film starred Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn and Michael Caine about a group of astronauts who space travel in search of a new home for humankind.
Murphy also explained what other Nolan film he would pair alongside Oppenheimer for a double bill saying, “You could go Interstellar, which is very… explores similar scientific, physic themes. Or you could watch Dunkirk, which is also set in World War II. Dunkirk is shorter, so that might be a good match ‘cause it’s like an hour-and-a-half, and then you can go into [Oppenheimer].”
Murphy has been getting a lot of praise for his portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the “father of the atomic bomb.” His co-star Robert Downey Jr. said he had “never witness a greater sacrifice by a lead actor” in his career.
“He knew it was going to be a behemoth ask when Chris called him. But I think he also had the humility that is required to survive playing a role like this,” Downey Jr. told People in July. “We’d be like, ‘Hey, we got a three-day weekend. Maybe we’ll go antiquing in Santa Fe. What are you going to do?’ ‘Oh, I have to learn 30,000 words of Dutch. Have a nice time.’ But that’s the nature of the ask.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tZmlsbXMtYWRvcmVzLWludGVyc3RlbGxhci0xMjM1NTIxMDQ5L9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tZmlsbXMtYWRvcmVzLWludGVyc3RlbGxhci0xMjM1NTIxMDQ5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,‘Barbie’ arrives in Japan without ‘Oppenheimer’ after social media stumble,"“Barbie” arrived divorced from its trendy “Barbenheimer” partner, a phenomenon in July in the United States but a cultural faux pas in Japan.","J. Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, N.M., in a 1944 photograph. (National Archives and Records Administration)
TOKYO – When “Barbie,” the live-action movie about a plastic doll, opened Friday in Japan, it did so without “Oppenheimer,” the rival film with which it shared a bill in the United States.
“Oppenheimer,” a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, has no opening date in Japan, thus far, and Universal Studios has said nothing about the film coming to the only country targeted in anger with atomic weapons.
“Barbie” arrived divorced from its trendy “Barbenheimer” partner, a phenomenon in July in the United States but a cultural faux pas in Japan.
Film distributors will consider whether the movie will turn a profit before deciding to show it in Japan, said Kazuhiro Maeshima, a professor of global studies at Sophia University in Tokyo by phone Thursday. Later openings in Japan for U.S. films are not unusual, he said.
“They may decide that it’s better not to show it in Japan because of this reaction” to the “Barbenheimer” controversy, Maeshima said.
The two films were married on social media in a lighthearted, social-media meme called “Barbenheimer” that encouraged U.S. moviegoers to see the contrasting films in one day. Both movies opened July 21 in the U.S.
‘Summer to remember’
“Oppenheimer” is based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led the U.S. project during World War II that was first to develop an atomic weapon.
An Internet meme in late July that grafted images of its star, Cillian Murphy, with one of Margot Robbie, star of “Barbie,” unleashed outrage in Japan for its apparent insensitivity.
Warner Bros.’ official “Barbie” account on X, formerly known as Twitter, re-tweeted a fan-art poster showing Murphy’s Oppenheimer carrying Robbie as Barbie superimposed over a mushroom cloud.
“It’s going to be a summer to remember,” declared the tweet, since deleted.
Warner Bros. Japan was among the first to react.
“We consider it extremely regrettable that the official account of the American headquarters for the movie ‘Barbie’ reacted to the social media postings of ‘Barbenheimer’ fans,” Warner Bros. Japan tweeted on the “Barbie” Japan account.
“We take this situation very seriously. We are asking the U.S. headquarters to take appropriate action,” the tweet read. “We apologize to those who were offended by this series of inconsiderate reactions.”
The Warner Bros. Film Group the next day offered “a sincere apology” for “its recent insensitive social media engagement.”
Sachiko Ishikawa, a YouTuber from Tokyo who tries to demystify Japan by talking about its misconceptions, addressed the “Barbenheimer” flap in a video, “#Barbenheimer in Japan?!,” posted Wednesday.
“It’s not that the memes weren’t a problem, but what made it all snowball was the response,” Ishikawa told Stars and Stripes by phone Thursday. “The memes would’ve happened regardless, but the backlash was caused by the ‘Barbie’ official X reply.”

Ishikawa said she found the Japanese attitude toward “Oppenheimer” interesting. The comments on her video focus less on the meme controversy and more on the history of the atomic bomb.
People in Japan associate the atomic bomb and the mushroom cloud with an estimated 110,000 who died immediately and thousands more who suffered from the bombings, Maeshima said. Living survivors tell their stories to subsequent generations, so the atomic bombings are a reality for them, he said.
The Japanese are reminded of the bombings every August with the anniversaries of the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
By contrast, in the U.S., the bombings are generally considered a good thing that quickly ended the war, and victims’ stories are reported less frequently, Maeshima said.
Even if the movie reaches Japanese theaters, it may fall flat following the “Barbenheimer” incident, he said.
“It depends on whether one can imagine the tragic situation the bombings have brought on people when thinking about the mushroom cloud,” he said.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmlwZXMuY29tL3RoZWF0ZXJzL2FzaWFfcGFjaWZpYy8yMDIzLTA4LTEwL2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1tb3ZpZXMtamFwYW4tYmFyYmVuaGVpbWVyLTExMDA5OTY3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,'Oppenheimer': Emily Blunt got 'withering' looks from Christopher Nolan for wearing Uggs,"Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are ""vacation buddies and neighbors."" Now, they co-star in Christopher Nolan's ""nightmarish"" nukes movie ""Oppenheimer.""","NEW YORK – Like most savvy actors, Matt Damon always picks up the phone for Christopher Nolan.
The A-lister, who previously appeared in Nolan’s 2014 film “Interstellar,” was planning to take a break from acting when the Oscar-nominated director called about “Oppenheimer” (in theaters Friday), his chilling new historical drama.
“I had told my wife I was taking time off,” says Damon, speaking to USA TODAY in a joint interview with co-star Emily Blunt before the Screen Actors Guild strike. “This was something we literally negotiated, but the one caveat was ‘if Chris Nolan calls.’ He was my get-back-to-work card, and then he actually called, which was a wonderful surprise.”
'Oppenheimer':Christopher Nolan made his new movie because he thought he'd die in a nuclear Armageddon
Matt Damon brings levity to the 'wildly unpopular' Leslie Groves
In the white-knuckle epic, Damon plays gruff U.S. Army officer Leslie Groves, who calls on physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to oversee the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II. Groves was “wildly unpopular” with the scientists, Damon says, and frequently butted heads with Oppenheimer. But there was still “mutual respect” between the two men.
“They’re complete polar opposites,” says Damon, sitting at a hotel in New York's Tribeca neighborhood. “The military is obsessed with secrecy, and the scientists are trying to get to the root of the problem, which they do by sharing. Groves constantly felt like a kindergarten teacher chasing these guys around. So Chris found some comedy there, which is good for a movie about something so serious.”
“Maybe that’s why he cast you,” Blunt suggests. “Everyone loves you and you have a natural warmth. If you cast someone unlikable playing someone unlikable, it would’ve been (alienating).”
Emily Blunt's Kitty Oppenheimer is 'volatile' yet fiercely loyal
Blunt portrays Kitty, Oppenheimer’s caustic, alcoholic wife. When Oppenheimer is probed by government officials about possible Communist ties, she demands that he stop feeling sorry for himself. She’s similarly unsympathetic about the death of his former lover.
“Kitty didn’t do small talk. She only did big talk,” Blunt says. “There’s a lot about her that wouldn’t necessarily be ‘likable,’ but I don’t think she cared. She was such a force of personality.” Toward the end of the film, “she’s become so volatile and unpredictable – the drinking is out of control. But he says to his defense (team), ‘Kitty and I have walked through fire together, and I believe in her.’ She’ll fight for him when he won’t fight for himself.”
The movie's Trinity test scene was 'beautiful' yet 'nightmarish' to behold
One of the movie’s most thrilling sequences is the Trinity test, when the first nuclear weapon was detonated in the New Mexico desert in 1945. The bomb’s mushroom cloud and blinding light were recreated using practical effects.
“Because the explosion is real, it’s as beautiful as it is nightmarish,” Blunt says. “Because you know it’s not (computer-generated), you can’t dissociate from it.”
“You can’t take your eyes off it, but it’s the most terrible thing you’ve ever seen,” Damon adds. Witnessing it on the set, “it was a big boom. Everybody had their earplugs in.”
'Barbenheimer':How a movie meme inspired the 'crazy, weird' double feature
Emily Blunt recalls her 'Devil Wears Prada' moment with director Christopher Nolan
“Oppenheimer” is the second film Blunt, 40, and Damon, 52, have made together, including the 2011 sci-fi thriller “The Adjustment Bureau.” Blunt says they would “hang out constantly” while shooting the latter, going on double dates with her husband, John Krasinski, and Damon’s wife, Luciana Barroso.
“Now we’re vacation buddies and neighbors,” says Blunt, who lives in the same Brooklyn apartment building as Damon. “I know, it’s ridiculous. This is strange not to see Matt in his sweats and slippers.”
“The only time I wear shoes is when we do interviews together,” Damon quips. “I’ve got a great pair of house slippers, and I’m going to put them right on when I get home. I did accidentally wear my Ugg slippers on a school run once.”
“Do you know who hates Uggs more than anyone?” Blunt asks. “Christopher Nolan. I’ve never known anyone to detest a pair of Uggs more than Chris Nolan. It’s a testament to how he wants everything on set to look as it would (in the period). If there’s a plastic bottle in the shot, he’s like, ‘Ugh!’ He hates to even look at it. I would sometimes put on some Uggs and I’d just get this withering look down to my feet – it was like being in ‘The Devil Wears Prada’ again. Just the look down to the shoes. And I'd go, 'I know, I know. But I'm just sitting on an apple box in the background today!' ""
As a joke, Blunt gave Nolan a pair of Uggs at the end of the shoot. His wife, Emma Thomas, “wrote to me and was like, ‘Brilliant wrap gift. He’s wearing them now,’ "" Blunt recalls with a laugh. “I was so pleased!”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L21vdmllcy8yMDIzLzA3LzE5L29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWVtaWx5LWJsdW50LW1hdHQtZGFtb24taW50ZXJ2aWV3LzcwNDI0MjcxMDA3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"Review: She’s “Barbie,” he’s just “Oppenheimer”","After participating in a fever dream of head-to-toe pink outfits and a frenzy of film bros, I can confidently say seeing these films back to back is a mistake.","More than 200,000 people sat for nearly five hours with nothing but the artificial light of the screen casting shadows over their awed faces this past weekend as the cultural phenomenon “Barbenheimer” swept the nation.
Part of what drove the “Barbenheimer” double-feature craze is the hyper feminine-masculine dichotomy between the films, as “Barbie” was advertised as a feminist paradise while viewers assumed “Oppenheimer,” a biopic about the man who led the creation of the atomic bomb, would tackle war and corruption. Ahead of the films’ opening, online consensus favored watching “Oppenheimer” first then ending the day with “Barbie” under the assumption that the former would be incredibly depressing and audiences would need an uplifting only the latter could provide. But in true GW fashion, this Barbie decided to be a devil’s advocate and watched director Greta Gerwig’s masterpiece first.
In “Barbie,” viewers are quickly introduced to Margot Robbie’s Stereotypical Barbie as she makes the rounds in Barbieland, a matriarchal utopia, from an all-Barbie Supreme Court and a Pink House for the president, while the Kens … are sort of in charge of the beach. After a long day of observing physicist Barbie win a Nobel Prize (score one for the Barbies over J. Robert Oppenheimer) and moderating a fight between Ryan Gosling’s needy Stereotypical Ken and Simu Liu’s Lifeguard Ken, she brings a choreographed, blowout dance party to a halt, asking: “Do you guys ever think about dying?”
The literal record-scratch moment sparks the plot of the film as the next day Barbie’s fantasy world crumbles, sending her to seek sage advice from Kate McKinnon’s Weird Barbie. She discovers the girl playing with her in the Real World is negatively influencing her life and journeys to heal her human counterpart.
In a desperate attempt for her affection, Gosling’s Ken tags along for the ride. Barbie and Ken get separated through their misadventures, giving Ken the opportunity to discover patriarchy and import it back to Barbieland, creating a host of problems that the Barbies must solve. Along the way, Barbie teams up with mother-daughter pair Gloria and Sasha, the humans responsible for her existential crisis.
After initially hearing about this film, many people wrote it off as fluff to promote Mattel’s brand. Instead, “Barbie” unexpectedly goes where many blockbusters before it haven’t, by catering to a predominantly female audience through its satirizing of the patriarchy and gender dynamics. From the hard cut showing an ad for Depression Barbie, a doll that wears sweatpants all day and rewatches the BBC’s “Pride and Prejudice” show until she passes out, to the Barbies experiencing the canon event of pretending to enjoy a man playing guitar, the comedy was meant for the girls.
The peppy acting of the ensemble cast, featuring stars from Issa Rae to Michael Cera, is true to the dolls they portray. Yet Robbie still delivers a heartfelt performance alongside her creator, Ruth Handler, in which Barbie unpacks an identity crisis while Ruth, played by Rhea Perlman, praises her for evolving. The film resolves with an ending that is beyond “Kenough” but you’ll have to see for yourself.
Christopher Nolan’s adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” chronicles the father of the atomic bomb’s conflicted morals and personal woes as he worked on the Manhattan Project, and pinpoints his career’s downfall through two government hearings. An early scene in which Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy, attempts to poison his teacher, goes through a crisis of conscience, and then thwarts the professor from dying foreshadows a shocking amount of the film.
Politics and quantum physics go hand in hand as Oppenheimer initially struggles to get security clearance due to his ties to members of the Communist Party. Few actors encapsulate pain and regret like Murphy as he stares off into space during a Red Scare-sparked hearing into his communist associations, which unfortunately eats up valuable time in the film as the hearings are endless.
The race to build the weapon of mass destruction leads Oppenheimer to assemble a team of renowned scientists and convene them for three years in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Though I failed my AP Physics exam, I found the scenes in which Oppenheimer debates with his fellow scientists how to construct the bomb to be among the most engaging in the movie — in part because of the bizarre ensemble of actors Nolan assembled. During the infamous Trinity test, none other than Josh Peck — yes, a man who once ran over Oprah in a Nickelodeon show — turns the key that unleashes a bomb.
But Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, who were limited in screen time likely because of the unnecessarily extensive time Nolan devoted to the hearings, still shined. Pugh in the role of Jean Tatlock, Oppenheimer’s ex-flame, captures an intense torturedness in her vulnerable interactions with him, especially when he reveals to her his engagement. Blunt, who plays Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty, expertly shifts from quiet despair after being made aware of his affair to firecracker as she defends him during a security hearing.
All of that said, no movie should be three hours long. In an effort to stay true to history, Nolan drilled too deep into the legal and national security implications of Oppenheimer’s loss of clearance, misplacing the actual plot: Oppenheimer’s late-arriving conscience and subsequent moral crisis. In an effort to build tension, the complex governmental hearings just dragged on as Nolan brought back too many acquaintances and enemies of Oppenheimer to make their cases.
After participating in this fever dream of head-to-toe pink outfits and a frenzy of film bros, I can confidently say seeing these films back to back is a mistake. Some might argue that I just watched them in the wrong order but “Barbie” genuinely was not all party, more a meditation on girl and womanhood, and in truth, no movie or TV show can overpower “Oppenheimer.” Believe me, I tried watching “Glee” afterward.
These films each deserve a full day and a clear mind to be appreciated, from the fantastic floor-to-ceiling plastic sets of “Barbie” to the multi-layered, fraught emotions of “Oppenheimer.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZ3doYXRjaGV0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3LzI4L3Jldmlldy1zaGVzLWJhcmJpZS1oZXMtanVzdC1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"UNCSA Filmmaking alumni and staff take center stage as ""Oppenheimer"" 70mm projectionists",,"UNCSA Filmmaking alumni and staff take center stage as ""Oppenheimer"" 70mm projectionists
“Oppenheimer” is one of the biggest films of the summer for many reasons, including its star-studded cast and the popularity of the director, Christopher Nolan. But “Oppenheimer” has cinephiles excited for another reason: it is a rare opportunity to view a film projected in 70mm.
Though the format is widely considered the best way to view a film, Nolan is one of only a few directors that films using this iconic filming method. Since it has become an increasingly uncommon way to film, projectionists are also extremely hard to find today…unless you look in the right place. The School of Filmmaking Moving Image Archives (also known as the Film Archives) is one such place – not only is it one of the top ten largest film archives in the world, but it also serves as one of the few places in the country where people can learn the art of film projection and preservation.
Thanks to their experience working with the Film Archives, two staff members and eight alumni are serving as 70 mm projectionists for “Oppenheimer.” Alumni Jesse Price, Adam Witmer, Jonathan Foster, Christopher Schneider, Lucas Taylor, Noelle Aleman, Scott DuVall and Jason Garnett were all trained by the staff at the Film Archives during their time as students. Additionally, staff members Matt Jones and Eric Self are practicing what they teach by serving as projectionists.
'Destroyer of Worlds'
Based on the true story of theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, “Oppenheimer” focuses on the titular character's experience during World War II. During that time, Oppenheimer served as the director of the Manhattan Project’s Los Alamos Laboratory, where the first nuclear weapons were developed.
Starring many well-known actors, including Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr. and Matt Damon, “Oppenheimer” has already earned over $400 million globally. In addition to the lead cast members, three School of Drama alumni can be seen in the film in notable roles; Dylan Arnold (B.F.A. ‘16) plays Frank Oppenheimer, younger brother of J. Robert Oppenheimer, Steve Coulter (B.F.A. '81) plays American chemist James Conant, and Dane DeHaan (B.F.A. ‘07) plays Kenneth Nichols, a civil engineer in the Army who worked on the Manhattan Project.

Arnold spoke with the Hollywood Reporter about his experience on set and watching the crew work together. ""It was a pretty amazing experience to watch [Director of Photography] Hoyte van Hoytema hoist that massive 80-pound camera on his shoulder with ease and then reload that giant IMAX mag,” explains Arnold. “It’s also little moments like that where you just look around and think, 'Everyone is so on it. Everyone just knows so much. Top to bottom, this is an extraordinary experience.'""
Signature filmmaking style
Director Christopher Nolan is known for his complex storytelling and is largely considered one of the best filmmakers of the 21st century. While this can be partially attributed to his unique cinematic style that explores themes around reality, another part is because Nolan prefers shooting in 65mm film, also known as premium large format film stock. The film is then projected in IMAX 70mm film and the extra 5mm is used for sound.
Nolan explains that he was very intentional with the decision to film “Oppenheimer” in premium large format. “We put a lot of effort into shooting the film in a way that we can get it out on these large format screens,” he told the Associated Press. “It really is just a great way of giving people an experience that they can’t possibly get in the home.”
Many of Nolan’s award-winning films, including “Inception,” “Interstellar,” “Tenet” and “Dunkirk,” were either partially or fully filmed on 65mm film. It is a format he started using during “The Dark Knight” and has now become one of his signatures. “The sharpness and the clarity and the depth of the image is unparalleled,” Nolan tells AP. “You’re getting a feeling of 3D without the glasses. You’ve got a huge screen and you’re filling the peripheral vision of the audience. You’re immersing them in the world of the film.”
The 70mm difference
Historically, a majority of films were filmed on 35mm, and 70mm was reserved for blockbusters like “Oklahoma!,” “Ben-Hur,” “My Fair Lady” and “2001: A Space Odyssey.” However, with the rise of digital filming methods, both physical film formats have dwindled over the past 15 years.
Alumnus Adam Witmer (B.F.A. ‘16) elaborates on why 70mm projection is still very relevant and important in filmmaking. “70mm is still the best image quality you can see on the screen,” he says. Though several factors make this so, he summarizes that the most important reasons are “resolution, brightness and color.”
“As opposed to digital methods, film’s image isn’t made up of pixels so you can zoom in and still have a very sharp image,” explains Witmer. “Additionally, when watching a digital projector, whenever you have a screen that’s dark, there will still be a slight glow because the projector is sending light. Due to the way 70mm or 35mm film blocks light during dark scenes, it’s actually black so that the theater will be completely dark.” He adds that the inverse is also true, “true white is clearer and brighter on film because the lamps tend to be brighter than most digital projectors.”
70mm is still the best image quality you can see on the screen. Adam Witmer, Film Alumnus
Matt Jones, who currently serves as the associate curator of the Film Archives, adds that when comparing digital projection and 70mm projection side-by-side, “it's not even close.”
“When you watch film, you spend half of your time in the dark as the shutter opens and closes 24 times per second. It's an active process for the brain as it tries to make sense of what it's seeing. It's why you often rub your eyes from the strain as you leave a film show,” explains Jones. “Digital content, on the other hand, uses scan lines to replace a previous image with a new one and never goes dark. It has a numbing effect on the brain, which is why you're more likely to zone out and fall asleep when watching TV on your couch.” Jones believes that by returning film to theatres, “audiences can again enjoy the active process it used to be – nowadays there's very few opportunities for the general public to do that.”
So, if it is superior to other filming methods, why isn’t 65mm standard? Mostly it comes down to cost, availability of equipment and ease of transportation. It is very expensive to shoot. Since nearly all theaters only project digitally, distributing a film and finding projectionists to run it is a huge ordeal. Additionally, the film is challenging to transport – just one copy of 70mm film for “Oppenheimer” weighs 600 pounds.
Despite these obstacles, Dean of Filmmaking Deborah LaVine believes the format isn’t likely to disappear. “Filmmakers the caliber of Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan have long been demanding higher standards in the projection of contemporary and historical films. Scorsese explains that the audience ‘misses the narrative. You’re missing the performance’ when watching subpar projection.” Thankfully, there are schools like UNCSA that are still teaching the necessary skills these imaginative filmmakers need.
A hidden gem
Tucked into the School of Filmmaking campus lives the Film Archives building, the fifth largest non-commercial archive in the country. The extensive holding includes a collection of 16,500 original feature film prints on 70mm, 35mm and 16mm; 240 live-action and animated short films, documentaries and newsreels on 35mm and 16mm; 4,600 previews of coming attractions on 35mm; and over 20,000 videocassette, laserdisc and DVD titles.
At the Film Archives, students can either volunteer or do work-study as they start at the bottom and work their way up, learning about all aspects of caring for and handling the various pieces of media housed there. Witmer was a work-study student in the Archives for all four years he was at UNCSA and says that he and any other student trained by the staff had to first prove they could be trusted before they were taught to become a projectionist. “My first year was hauling inventory around, second year I was taught to inspect the films, and by the third year Matt felt I was ready to learn how to become a projectionist,” explains Witmer.
A look inside the School of Filmmaking Moving Image Archives (also known as the Film Archives).
LaVine emphasizes how crucial it is for a projectionist to be highly skilled. “The art of film projection is very demanding and requires great skills, not the least of which are receiving and checking film reels, loading the films onto the projector in the right order, making sure the film runs smoothly through the projector, checking that sound is operating properly, joining ('splicing') lengths of film together if they break. A projectionist must have a terrific sense of color, hearing and timing.”
The archives are run by Matt Jones and Eric Self, who are dedicated to maintaining the inventory, training students and managing the free films that are screened every weekend at the ACE Theater.
Jones explains his philosophy for approaching his job at the Moving Image Archives. “When I started at UNCSA over 20 years ago, I decided that I wanted to show as many people as possible as many different kinds of film as possible because there's secrets to life in art if you look at it the right way.”
He adds that seeing countless students graduate and move on to their careers in the film industry, Jones still finds joy in the mentorship aspect of his job. “These jobs are hard, very hard, and I can't say how proud I am to watch our students step up to the plate over and over.”
Now, from St. Louis to Los Angeles, our alumni and staff are currently utilizing skills learned at UNCSA to project “Oppenheimer” for movie lovers nationwide. Though there are only 30 theaters that are currently screening in 70mm, people are traveling long distances to experience the film the way the filmmaker intended.

He was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary, and had a thick accent, which presented Safdie with one of his biggest acting challenges.
“The accent was something I was so nervous about,” Safdie recently told Vulture. “I remember Chris asking me, ‘How’s the accent coming?’ And I’m just like, ‘Oh my God, how am I going to accomplish this?’ I didn’t know if he was going to want me to do it. But he sent me all of these interviews and we talked about how Teller speaks and who he is. It was a long process of working together to really nail it down.”
“I remember finally I was like, ‘You know what? I could sound crazy, but I don’t care. This is what Teller sounds like and I’m just going to do it,'” Safdie added. “I sent a voice-memo where I just narrated what my breakfast was and how Teller really liked pineapple.”
Because “Oppenheimer” spans several years, Safdie also had to find a way to change his accent as Teller grew older. Screaming ended up being a solution.
“Before each take, I said, ‘Okay, I’m going to yell. I’m going to really break up my vocal cords,'” Safdie told Vulture. “It makes such a big difference. We also came up with this weird laugh-snort that Teller has when Kenneth Branagh is talking and we realize the Germans are behind and we’re ahead of them. Snorting and hitting the leg. We spent so long on that! Just that little snort. You’re not afraid to look stupid in a lot of ways, because when you’re free like that, it’s a fun place to be.”
Another signature part of bringing Teller to life was his eyebrows. Safdie sports some pretty thick brows in the film, which he said Christopher Nolan was adamant about.
“I am proud to say that it’s all my eyebrows,” Safdie said. “Teller had the best eyebrows. Every once in a while I have a straggler that I’ll just pluck out, cause it looks a little too crazy. But Chris said, ‘Don’t do that. Let’s just let it go crazy.’ I had the most insane eyebrows for months and months, and you just had to brush them out and then they shined in all their glory.”

2023-08-03 12:02:10.343000+00:00,Oppenheimer Fans Spot Disturbing Detail That Hints at a Horrifying Conspiracy,Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer features a horrifying detail that hints towards a decades-old conspiracy.,"Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer.
A disturbing detail in Oppenheimer seems to hint at a larger conspiracy... and it sees director Christopher Nolan in true ""horror mode.""
During a harrowing sequence of quick shots, the death of Jean Tatlock is shown as she seemingly drowns herself in the bath. However, a pair of black-gloved hands hints that all is not as it seems.
“One thing in Oppenheimer I haven't been able to get out of my head is that brief insert of black gloves in that one flashback with Florence Pugh,” said film fan Josh Lewis on Twitter. “Nolan was really in his horror mode.”
One thing in Oppenheimer I haven't been able to get out of my head is that brief insert of black gloves in that one flashback with Florence Pugh. Nolan was really in his horror mode. — Josh Lewis (@thejoshl) July 23, 2023
He’s not the first to notice the gloved hands, and the scene seems to suggest that Tatlock’s death wasn’t suicide at all. Tatlock is played by Florence Pugh and features throughout the movie as Oppenheimer’s lover who continued to have a relationship with the scientist while he was married to his wife, Kitty (played by Emily Blunt).
Not only frowned upon due to the illicit nature of their relationship, Tatlock was also a keen member of the Communist party and was seen by many to be a security risk. Tatlock’s fate is teased throughout the film, with a flashback eventually revealing she supposedly drowned herself in the bathtub.
Of course, the gloved hands suggest otherwise, and fans have since been debating its meaning. Some believe the scene is a manifestation of Oppenheimer’s guilt and the gloved hands are meant to represent Oppenheimer blaming himself for her death.
The horrifying blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment is the closest Nolan comes to horror in Oppenheimer. However, it also teases a decades-old conspiracy. Following her death, an autopsy determined her cause of death as death by drowning, however, a “faint trace” of chloral hydrate was found in her system, a substance capable of sedating a person.
According to the book American Prometheus, on which Oppenheimer is based, at least one physician had doubts about her cause of death, speculating she may have been drugged and forcibly drowned. “If you were clever and wanted to kill someone, this is the way to do it,” said one doctor.
This subsequently led to speculation by historians, as well as Tatlock’s own brother, that she may have been killed by U.S. Government officials due to her affiliation to the Communist party, coupled with her closeness to one of the Manhattan Project’s key players.
“I do not believe that her interests were really political,” Oppenheimer told The United States Atomic Energy Commission in 1954. “She was a person of deep religious feeling. She loved this country, its people, and its life.”
Nevertheless, it looks as though Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan may have been convinced enough to tease that her death wasn’t a suicide at all.
IGN’s Oppenheimer review gave it 10/10 and said: “A biopic in constant free fall, Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s most abstract yet most exacting work, with themes of guilt writ large through apocalyptic IMAX nightmares that grow both more enormous and more intimate as time ticks on. A disturbing, mesmerizing vision of what humanity is capable of bringing upon itself, both through its innovation, and through its capacity to justify any atrocity.”

The report came as federal officials hosted a forum Thursday in Los Alamos to talk about cleaning up contaminated soil and groundwater and handling hazardous waste generated by decades of research that started with development of the atomic bomb during the 1940s.
Ike White, who heads DOE’s Office of Environmental Management, said the release this week of the “Oppenheimer” film makes it a good time to talk about the legacy that came from the dawning of the atomic age. Part of the environmental cleanup mission requires an examination of history, White told those gathered at the historic Fuller Lodge in the heart of Los Alamos.
He characterized the nation’s multibillion-dollar cleanup program as the third largest liability on the books for the federal government — behind only Social Security and Medicaid.
“It is a large, it is a complicated, it a technologically challenging program,” White said. “It is extremely important to a lot of people who live across the country from coast to coast, and all of us who are part of that program feel an extraordinary responsibility to make that program successful.”

Still, the GAO pointed to weaknesses in oversight by the Office of Environmental Management at Los Alamos. They said failure to finalize a performance baseline for the cleanup contractor prevented the office from tracking ongoing costs, the scope of work and progress.
New Mexico environmental regulators said the report validates their longstanding concerns — that cleanup is mired in unnecessary delays that threaten public health and the environment. New Mexico Environment Department spokesman Matthew Maez pointed specifically to the federal government’s responsibility to protect drinking water.
“The frequent delays and lack of transparency in cleanup must be remedied,” he said. “We hope this report galvanizes DOE-EM to enact change in Los Alamos.”
Environmental management officials at Los Alamos said they expect to complete remaining cleanup activities at the lab by 2043 at an estimated cost of about $7 billion.
Michael Mikolanis, who heads DOE’s environmental management office at Los Alamos, said Thursday that his team is developing a long-term strategic vision for the remaining cleanup that will be based on priorities identified through numerous meetings with state regulators, the leaders of neighboring Native American communities and others.
While White agrees with the GAO that prioritizing the scope of work is important, he said optimum efficiency is not always the most important factor.
“One of the things that we’ve arranged with our strategic vision effort and our stakeholder engagement is to try to make sure we’re doing that prioritization of the work in a way that is transparent to the community and that doesn’t just reflect a sort of bureaucratic set of values,” he said.
Don Hancock with the Albuquerque-based nuclear watchdog group Southwest Research and Information Center said the DOE in 2010 had issued a roadmap that included a goal of disposing of most of the transuranic waste — that which contains manmade elements heavier than uranium — by the end of 2015.
He asked the DOE officials at the forum about the timeline and how much waste remained.
Mikolanis said his office plans to unveil an interactive map this fall that will include estimates of the waste at Los Alamos that is stored above ground and that which has yet to be unearthed.
White said estimates for the cleanup project nationwide are hard to calculate because the ultimate volume of waste can change depending on the scope of a project.
The GAO report includes several recommendations for the DOE that include implementing a plan to account for cost and schedule increases, building trust with state regulators and including consideration of potential risks when making decisions.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZlZGVyYWx0aW1lcy5jb20vZmVkZXJhbC1vdmVyc2lnaHQvMjAyMy8wNy8yMS9pbi1ub2QtdG8tb3BwZW5oZWltZXItdXMtdm93cy10by1wcmlvcml0aXplLWNsZWFudXAtYXQtbnVjbGVhci1sYWIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

""It Feels Very Intimate"": Cillian Murphy on Working with Christopher Nolan and His Prep for Oppenheimer
Pattinson is one of the hottest actors in Hollywood right now.
Last month, Christopher Nolan revealed that he was inspired to make Oppenheimer (opening in theaters everywhere July 21) as his next movie after Robert Pattinson gifted him a book of speeches by J. Robert Oppenheimer when Tenet wrapped production.
You'd think Nolan would return the favor by offering Pattinson a prominent role in the atomic bomb thriller, but the actor is nowhere to be seen throughout the blockbuster's massive ensemble, which includes everyone from Cillian Murphy to Robert Downey Jr.
RELATED: Oppenheimer Stars Explain Why Working with Christopher Nolan Is an ""Instant Yes""
""He was busy,"" the filmmaker explained during an interview with entertainment journalist Tara Hitchcock, alluding to Pattinson's commitments to other projects like Mickey 17 and The Batman - Part II. ""He's very much in-demand these days.""
Nevertheless, the book of Oppenheimer's speeches fortified the director's interest in the Manhattan Project, which Tenet directly references in a conversation between The Protagonist (John David Washington) and arms dealer Dimple Kapadia (Priya Singh).
""You're reading these great intellects trying to deal with the massive consequences of the way in which they've changed life forever for all of us,"" Nolan continued. ""And I really got hooked on the story.""

While penning the screenplay for the 3-hour historical epic, Nolan drew on American Prometheus (the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography about the life and career of J. Robert Oppenheimer written by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin). His notorious commitment to realism was taken to a new level here with the insistence that the Trinity test be recreated without the use of CGI imagery.
""Doing real-world effects and having us out in the desert with the actors, waiting for this incredible moment, it gave us some small feeling of what it must have been like to be there for the original detonation,"" Nolan said. ""It was thrilling and terrifying and beautiful and dangerous — all in equal measure.""

In addition to writing and directing, he also produced the feature alongside Emma Thomas (Nolan's wife and co-founder of their Syncopy production banner) and Charles Roven. J. David Wargo, James Woods, and Thomas Hayslip are executive producers.

,Oppenheimer Almost Discovered Black Holes Before He Became ‘Destroyer of Worlds’,"Before leading the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer co-authored a paper explaining that the most massive stars must eventually become what we would now call a black hole","J. Robert Oppenheimer (right) applied the principles of general relativity developed by Albert Einstein (left) to determine that what we now know as a black hole can form under certain circumstances.
Before leading the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer co-authored a paper explaining that the most massive stars must eventually become what we would now call a black hole
J. Robert Oppenheimer, now the protagonist of a much-anticipated film hitting theaters on July 21, is today most known for his scientific leadership of the U.S. Manhattan Project, the World War II–era crash program to build the first-ever atomic bombs. But just a few years earlier, Oppenheimer had found himself pondering very different “weapons” of mass destruction: black holes—although it would be decades before that name arose.
“It was influential; it was visionary,” says Feryal Özel, an astrophysicist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, of Oppenheimer’s work on black holes and neutron stars, the superdense corpses of expired massive stars. “He has a lasting impact.” Özel is a founding member of the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration, which released the first-ever image of a black hole in 2019—80 years after Oppenheimer co-authored a paper theorizing that such objects could exist.
Özel isn’t the only leading modern physicist to admire Oppenheimer’s work on black holes. “It stands up completely; there are no flaws,” says Kip Thorne, an emeritus professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology. Thorne won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017 for his work with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), which in 2015 detected gravitational waves from two colliding black holes. “It went so far beyond anything that anybody else had ever done,” Thorne says of Oppenheimer’s “tour de force” paper exploring black holes, which runs only five pages long. “It is amazing what is contained there.”
Oppenheimer’s brief foray into astrophysics began with a 1938 paper about neutron stars, which continued in a 1939 installment that further incorporated the principles of Einstein’s general theory of relativity. He then published a third paper on black holes on September 1, 1939—but at the time, it was scarcely noticed because this was the very day Germany invaded Poland, launching World War II. Oppenheimer never wrote on the topic again.
Even if it hadn’t been overshadowed by war, Oppenheimer’s work on neutron stars and black holes “was not understood to be terribly significant at the time,” says Cathryn Carson, a historian of science at the University of California, Berkeley.
Each paper was written with a different member of the swarm of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars that Oppenheimer carefully cultivated. These protégés facilitated his ability to jump between research topics—and ultimately, according to Thorne and others, represent one of his most important contributions to physics.
Oppenheimer’s climactic third paper, written with his student Hartland Snyder, explores the implications of general relativity on the universe’s most massive stars. Although the physicists needed to include some assumptions to simplify the question, they determined that a large enough star would gravitationally collapse indefinitely—and within a finite amount of time, meaning that the objects we now know as black holes could exist.
“Eventually there should emerge what we would now call a singularity at the origin, a point of infinite density where, in some sense, spacetime itself rips, and there should become what we would now call an event horizon,” says David Kaiser, a physicist and historian of science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “This is all in that paper—not in the modern vocabulary, but the mathematics is absolutely recognizable to us today.”
In the decades since Oppenheimer and Snyder’s black hole bombshell, scientists have confirmed that the same principles hold even without the simplifying assumptions initially put in place. Thorne says that the paper is particularly staggering, given contemporary work from an even more famous physicist—the one who developed general relativity in the first place.
“[Albert] Einstein published almost simultaneously a paper in which he argued that you cannot have a star or any object shrink to the size of what we now call the gravitational radius or the size of a black hole,” Thorne says. “Einstein was completely wrong.”
But despite the merit of Oppenheimer and Snyder’s work on black holes, the topic simmered on physicists’ back burner for decades—and today is perhaps best known as a sobering example of how brilliant ideas can be overlooked, says Manuel Ortega-Rodríguez, a theoretical physicist at the University of Costa Rica.
“It struck me as really, really interesting and fascinating and scary that such an idea was there for like 25 years, and nobody paid attention,” he says. “That means that today we could have an equally revolutionary idea right now that the community is ignoring.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVudGlmaWNhbWVyaWNhbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1hbG1vc3QtZGlzY292ZXJlZC1ibGFjay1ob2xlcy1iZWZvcmUtaGUtYmVjYW1lLWRlc3Ryb3llci1vZi13b3JsZHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 08:35:09.427000+00:00,Remember ‘Manhattan’: The TV Show That Told the ‘Oppenheimer’ Story First,“Manhattan” told the story of the atomic bomb back when “Mad Men” and “The Americans” were the coolest shows on TV. The only problem was that no one watched it.,"Going as far back as last summer when the first ominous countdown clock teaser debuted, every single time I see footage of Oppenheimer, it has made me want to rewatch the overlooked two-season historical drama Manhattan. And what better way to prepare for Christopher Nolan’s highly anticipated summer blockbuster than with a canceled-too-soon TV series packed with actors who have since become recognizable favorites?
Sam Shaw’s Manhattan debuted in 2014 on WGN America, when the quintessential antihero who was a complex period character was the hottest trend in TV. It didn’t matter if they were based on real people or entirely fictitious, as long as they were complicated. Think “I can fix him,” before that phrase entered the popular lexicon.
Mad Men was heading toward its conclusion, and every network was looking for the next Don Draper. In 2013, The Americans hid a marriage story inside a spy narrative, utilizing the last decade of the Cold War as a backdrop for different interpretations of loyalty and patriotism. Halt and Catch Fire premiered the month before Manhattan, adding to this trend with its exploration of the rise of computers in the 1980s and the prickly geniuses who were making waves.
The TV landscape has fundamentally changed in the nine years since that summer. Anyone would be hard-pressed to remember what other original dramas aired on the now-defunct WGN network (Underground, Salem, and Outsiders). In fact, I misremembered that Manhattan had aired on AMC, thanks to it fitting the brand and because it can now be found on AMC+ (along with Hoopla, Tubi, and Freevee). That’s not to mention that WGN America is a name I haven’t heard in years.
Even in 2014, Kevin Fallon wrote in his glowing Manhattan review for The Daily Beast that “most TV consumers have no idea what the hell WGN America is.” This was spot-on, considering it was canceled after its second season. (Nine years later, another prophecy from Fallon in the same review has come to pass: “It raises the question of whether there really just may be too much television these days.”)
In 2021, casting news announcing that Cillian Murphy would switch his Peaky Blinders newsboy cap for a J. Robert Oppenheimer’s porkpie hat in Nolan’s latest project was the catalyst that led to me finally catching up with the hidden gem. That same October, I binged both seasons (totaling 23 episodes) in under a week, something I recently repeated in lieu of going outside over the holiday weekend. It had completely slipped my mind that the Manhattan pilot opens on July 2, 1943, and includes an Independence Day celebration at the top-secret location in the middle of the New Mexico desert. Insert the ‘Leo pointing’ meme here to reflect my lack of chill when I saw the date and realized the coincidence.
So what is Manhattan, and why should you check it out?
Spoiler alert: light spoilers for Manhattan and some historical spoilers for Oppenheimer follow.
A radio report playing over the opening scene paints a bleak picture of the casualty list “on the eve of another Independence Day,” an onscreen graphic states that 61 countries are at war, there are more than 40 million casualties, and it is 766 days before Hiroshima. A yet unnamed figure plays golf using his car's headlamps as his only light source in the dusty, dark setting before having a eureka moment. Soon, we learn that WWI veteran Dr. Frank Winter (John Benjamin Hickey) is a brilliant physicist who doesn’t play by the rules and ruffles all the wrong feathers within this government facility. While this archetype is overplayed, Frank’s journey takes unexpected deviations in exploring the ethics of a weapon with the power to vaporize cities—and Hickey delivers a deeply nuanced performance.
Frank leads one team of scientists within the top-secret Manhattan Project, tasked with developing an atomic bomb. Los Alamos, New Mexico, was originally home to a ranch school and was subsequently acquired by the military. A town was erected in its place to accommodate these experts, their families, and the men in uniform sent to keep a watchful eye over proceedings—and to ensure no secrets ended up in the hands of Nazis or the Soviets. In 1943, Los Alamos opened its doors to what was originally meant to be a small community, but two years later, its population hit 4,000 civilians and 2,000 servicemen.
It doesn’t take a scientific genius to realize that an isolated town focused on the war effort with an average age of 25 years old (as per American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, which is the inspiration for Nolan’s movie) is the ideal backdrop for a big-budget movie or a TV show. Manhattan’s heady mix of politically charged storylines, subterfuge, and relationships crumbling under the stress of this isolated environment makes it a community worth exploring.
“This is not going to be a Great Men of History piece,” creator Shaw said at the Manhattan TCA panel in 2014. Whereas Nolan’s forthcoming movie places the father of the atomic bomb front and center, Robert Oppenheimer (Daniel London) only appears in a third of the episodes and is rarely at the heart of the events. Instead, the majority of the characters are fictitious, allowing Shaw greater scope for dialing up the drama while also exploring the scientific methodology and ethical debates that go hand-in-hand with research that can destroy the world. (Figures who worked on the project and even tried to oppose it do provide inspiration for the likes of Frank.)
Two bombs were designed in New Mexico, and Shaw’s series pits the two teams against each other in the race to make a successful weapon. Maverick Frank heads the rag-tag “implosion” team, relegated to a rustic hut, whereas hotshot young scientist Charlie Isaacs (Ashley Zukerman) immediately gains entry to the main building. Charlie has been selected as an integral part of the “Thin Man” group and is working on a gun model mechanism. Don’t worry; you don’t need a degree in quantum physics to understand the series, although it also doesn’t overly dumb down the science—much like how shows like ER use medical jargon while still effectively conveying what is unfolding.
Frank is unimpressed by Charlie’s genius, and this bristling dynamic is an ongoing push-and-pull threading through the two seasons. Zuckerman is most recognizable as Succession’s Nate, and here he gets to play the shades of gray of a man tasked with creating a weapon of mass destruction.
While Los Alamos did have similar amenities as a typical town in the 1940s and encouraged social activities, workers were forbidden from discussing the details of their “day at the office” with their spouses. Therefore, without small talk about work as an option, sex became an easy way to bridge the lack of communication. What followed was the need for a robust maternity ward as the number of babies born at this location was 80 in the first year alone and 10 per month after that—any person born here has PO Box 1663 as their birthplace. Manhattan acknowledges this trend and the horniness of its scientists and wives. Wandering eyes are also part of this environment, with Charlie and his wife, Abby (Rachel Brosnahan), straying when other conversation fails.
The message here is that scientists fuck, which Nolan’s movie also endorses (The Guardian first reported that the film includes “prolonged nudity”).
Oppenheimer’s messy romantic entanglements have been teased as part of the press tour (though Murphy mentioned a NDA prohibiting the cast from detailing overall specifics of the film, and honestly, I’m all for the surprise). In Manhattan, Robert’s relationship with former fiancée Jean Tatlock propels Brosnahan’s nosy switchboard operator’s story forward in the second season. It also speaks to a wider conspiracy theory that has never been resolved—which I won’t get into here because of spoilers, but feel free to look it up. Suffice it to say Manhattan leans into the most sensationalist take on this story.
From the trailer, Oppenheimer appears to have a “getting the gang together” tone, whereas the TV series throws us into the story after Los Alamos has been constructed. Aside from the obvious similarities when using the same historical event, these two titles boast a cast of actors you instantly recognize from a slew of other projects. Manhattan is a character actor paradise, boasting the aforementioned Hickey, Zukerman, and Brosnahan, as well as other TV faves like Olivia Williams, David Harbour, Harry Lloyd (aka Tom Hiddleston’s clone), a pre-Evil Katja Herbers, the always delightful Michael Chernus, The West Wing’s Richard Schiff and William Petersen.
This list barely scratches the surface, and you should be on the lookout for guest stars Griffin Dunne, Mamie Gummer, Justin Kirk, Jason Ralph (Brosnahan’s now-husband), and the never-misses Bill Camp. Christopher Denham has the honor of playing a series regular in Manhattan and a role in Oppenheimer, and there is a thematic thread between both characters.
“We never saw this show as Law and Order: Atomic Bomb—like it was going to be ripped from the headlines of history,” Shaw told Vox after the Season 2 finale. Sadly, that episode would become the series finale as WGN America didn’t renew Manhattan. Coming to shows late makes it harder to get annoyed about a canceled-too-soon title (“It’s me, hi, I’m the problem, it’s me”). While Shaw’s story was exploring the past, it was caught between the critically acclaimed period darlings like Mad Men and The Americans.
Manhattan’s success was no doubt impacted by debuting on a platform that no one had heard of, when curious eyes had already turned to Netflix. In this case, it is not too late, as there is time to add Manhattan to your summer viewing lineup, whether you watch it before or after Nolan’s epic—or with Barbie thrown in the explosive mix. (We understand if Barbie is your first priority this weekend.)

This July has been more tense than usual, as our community waited for the release of “Oppenheimer” — and some recognition of what we have endured over the last 78 years. When I watched the film at a packed screening in Santa Fe, I saw that wasn’t to be. The three-hour movie tells only part of the story of the Manhattan Project, which developed the bomb, and conducted the test code-named Trinity that day in July.

2023-08-04 09:00:00-04:00,How Have Nuclear Weapons Evolved Since Oppenheimer and the Trinity Test?,"Despite the danger posed by nuclear weapons, the US continues programs to build new ones.","It took the Manhattan project three years to develop a nuclear bomb: and only weeks between the first nuclear test explosion and the use of a nuclear weapon in war. Almost 80 years later – how have nuclear weapons evolved?
A brief history of nuclear testing
In 1945, the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan. The first bomb, codenamed “Little Boy” was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945.Three days later, the US dropped the second bomb, “Fat Man,” on Nagasaki. The two bombs, each with an estimated yield of around 15 and 21 kilotons (15,000 and 21,000 tons of TNT equivalent), respectively, caused widespread destruction, resulting in the loss of more than 100,000 lives.
After the war, the US conducted atmospheric nuclear tests in the Pacific Proving Grounds in the Marshall Islands and in Nevada and many more underground. The Soviet Union, Great Britain, France, China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea tested nuclear weapons of their own. Since the first development of nuclear weapons, the total number of nuclear tests exceeds 2,000, with 528 tests conducted above ground. These above ground tests had a destructive force of more than 400,000 kilotons TNT. The tests provided the information to increase the sophistication of nuclear weapons designs. But the nuclear tests, and particularly the atmospheric tests, were enormously destructive to the land and communities that were exposed to their explosive power and radiation.
Timeline of nuclear weapons tests
The largest bomb ever made
Today’s modern nuclear warheads have undergone significant advancements in terms of design, technology, and destructive power. Notably, modern warheads are almost exclusively thermonuclear bombs, or hydrogen (H) bombs, which use both fusion and fission reactions to generate higher release of energy – tens of kilotons to several megatons TNT equivalent, or tens of times more powerful than the early atomic bombs. These bombs essentially use an atomic bomb as a trigger for the powerful fusion explosion.
The largest nuclear weapon to ever been tested, Tsar Bomba, had an estimated yield of 50 megatons (although it had a capacity double that) – an explosive yield greater than that of the Little Boy by a factor of 3,500. Literally translated as “King of bombs,” this monster atomic bomb, designed by the Soviet Union, generated a fireball that reached a diameter of 4 km (2.5 miles), and a mushroom cloud that rose over 60 km (40 miles) into the atmosphere. The blast wave was felt over 1,000 km away (over 620 miles), and its shockwave was detected 4,000 km away from its source, or nearly 2,500 miles away. To illustrate the increased scale of destructive power, if the same bomb dropped on Hiroshima was detonated in a major US city like New York City, 264,000 lives will be lost, along with 512,000 injuries. Tsar Bomba, on the same city, would kill more than 7.6 million people while injuring additional 4.2 million (Figure 2).

Notably, however, such weapons are too large to be considered ‘operational’. Tsar Bomba, for example, weighed 27 tons with a size of 8 meters length and 2 meters diameter – making it impractical to be deployed in a ballistic missile.
Smaller, lighter, faster
Nuclear states have not just pursued larger and more powerful weapons. They have pushed to make weapons that are lighter and more compact, so that they can be carried in multiples, and lower yield, so that they can plausibly be used on a battlefield.
60 years after the biggest nuclear test, nuclear weapons have become smaller and more compact – a process of miniaturization that allows integration into various delivery systems. Some modern weapons are also designed with multiple warheads, with enhanced precision for guidance and targeting systems, allowing a single delivery vehicle to carry multiple independent nuclear payloads.
Alongside high-yield strategic nuclear weapons, there has been significant development of non-strategic, or tactical nuclear weapons designed for limited use scenarios. These weapons are generally of lower yield and intended for use on the battlefield i.e., strikes against relatively close and specific targets that minimize collateral damage affecting the civilian population. But despite sometimes being referred to as “small nukes”, these weapons still cause devastating destruction. The explosive yield of tactical nuclear weapons today ranges from anywhere below one kt to above 100 kt: the high-end surpasses the yield of Little Boy and Fat Man by up to five times. Despite the lower yield and smaller size, the use of tactical nuclear weapons carries a high risk of escalation from potential misinterpretation, miscalculation, or an unintended response from adversaries, all of which can lead to a full-scale nuclear war. The availability of weapons, especially at low yields designed to facilitate battlefield use, increases the probability of their use in a conflict scenario.
In addition to the nuclear weapons themselves, the nuclear weapons state and non-weapons state have invested heavily in many delivery systems – strategic missile and conventional missile capabilities, as well as in missile defense systems. Nuclear strategists and scientists have long argued that the development and deployment of missile defense systems are ineffective against determined adversaries, but the US budget requested for $10.9 billion to strengthen and expand the deployment of missile defenses in 2023. Such development of missile defense systems has potential for encouraging an arms race dynamic and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty’s role in trying to arrest that dynamic.
Almost 80 years after the first nuclear weapon was dropped on Japan, there hasn’t been any use of nuclear weapons on another country. But since then, nuclear states accumulated as many as 60,000 weapons in total at one time, and currently the nine states possessing nuclear weapons have approximately 13,000 nuclear weapons, with US and Russia accounting for almost 90% of the inventory These modern nuclear warheads are significantly more lethal compared to the atomic bombs used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The radius of devastation and the resulting blast effects, such as firestorms, radioactive fallout, and thermal radiation, would be significantly larger, amplifying the casualties and long-term environmental and health consequences. Despite the danger posed by nuclear weapons, the US continues programs to build new nuclear weapons, including a nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles (SLCM-N).
Arms control and nuclear warheads over time for the US and Russia/USSR.
The use of nuclear weapons would have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and geopolitical consequences. As we continue to invest and enhance nuclear weapons technologically, the global community continues to grapple with the challenges and risks associated with their existence. The pursuit of disarmament, nonproliferation, arms control, and diplomatic dialogues remains more crucial today than ever in promoting peace and global security.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYmxvZy51Y3N1c2Eub3JnL3N1bGdpeWUtcGFyay9ob3ctaGF2ZS1udWNsZWFyLXdlYXBvbnMtZXZvbHZlZC1zaW5jZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1hbmQtdGhlLXRyaW5pdHktdGVzdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The story has deep connections to Chicago — specifically the University of Chicago — and the Manhattan Project that led to the development of the first atomic bomb.

Below is a Q&A with John Mark Hansen, professor of political science at the University of Chicago who has done extensive research on the birth of the nuclear age in Hyde Park’s “atomic village.”
(The interview has been edited for length and clarity.)
WTTW News: How did Chicago come to be the epicenter of research to make a self-sustaining nuclear reaction — the first step toward making an atomic bomb?
John Mark Hansen: Well, it was largely happenstance. The happenstance was that when the authorities in Washington who had been working on the development of nuclear power after the creation of the Manhattan Project in 1939, they decided that they would designate the first stage in the project to be under the direction of Arthur Compton, who was a professor of physics here at the University of Chicago and Nobel laureate, the chair of the physics department and the dean of the physical sciences division. And it was Compton then who within a month or so made the decision to gather all of the people he needed for that first stage of the project in Chicago. And so he was the one who asked Fermi and his group to come to Chicago.
Tell me a little bit about why Compton, because obviously, there are so many names that we are familiar with. We’re familiar with Oppenheimer. Obviously, we’re familiar with the Fermi. I don’t think as many people would know Compton. Why was Compton the man designated to get this project off the ground?
Hansen: Well, Compton was part of a group of physicists who were involved in an earlier project called the Uranium Project. He was asked by the government authorities in 1941 to produce a report about the feasibility of creating an atomic weapon and what the timetable would look like. So he was the chair of that committee, and I think it was kind of a natural extension then to ask him to be the one to lead it.
You’ve written about Hyde Park’s “atomic village.” Did the scientists talk about it in those terms at the time or is that something applied in retrospect? Is that how they thought of themselves?
Hansen: No, not really. That’s a name that I have given it in retrospect. You know, there were atomic villages that were built at Oak Ridge in Tennessee, at Hanford, in Washington and at Los Alamos in New Mexico. What I thought interesting about the group of scientists assembled here was that they weren’t segregated off from the rest of society the way they were at the other three sites. They lived out in the community and they did their work on a college campus not in a specially designed laboratory.
I can understand why they isolated the folks at Los Alamos and the other places you mentioned for security reasons. So why didn’t they do that in terms of the folks who were working in Chicago? It just seems like it would be a huge security risk.
Hansen: Well, part of it was just that they needed to get this going fast and they didn’t have anything built yet. So that’s one answer. Another answer is that they had originally, or Compton himself had originally wanted, to build the nuclear reactor that achieved the first sustainable chain reaction in 1942 — he had originally wanted to put that out at in part of the Argonne Woods Forest Preserve out in Palos Park. But the contractor didn’t get it done on time. And so it ended up being done under the West Grandstand of Stagg Field here on the campus just because they didn’t want to further delay the project.
Did all of the scientists who were working on the project have a clear notion that the end goal was to create a weapon?
Hansen: Every scientist who had a significant responsibility knew that that was the end point.
So after the first chain reaction had been achieved in Chicago, did many of the folks who were working in Chicago, were they transferred to Los Alamos?
Hansen: Yes. So a significant number were and there was a group that went to Oak Ridge, there was a group that went to Hanford and there was a group that went to Los Alamos. Oftentimes, on the way to Los Alamos, having been either at Oak Ridge or at Hanford in between.
It seems a very short period of development to go from that first chain reaction to within, I think it was 2.5 years, the Trinity test. How was that possible? Was it the fact that the government was just throwing so much in terms of personnel and money at this project?
Hansen: Well, a big part of it was that there was no expense that was spared in developing the bomb. But I would also say that Compton in his report about the timetable to the development of the bomb pretty much called it exactly right. He said that the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction could probably be achieved by early 1943 and the first battlefield weapons by sometime in 1945. So, it was anticipated even years in advance that that would be about the amount of time that would be required.
Obviously Oppenheimer himself was famously conflicted about this power he had helped to develop. Was that shared by many of his colleagues? I assume there was a range of opinions — they had achieved this incredible objective and created a weapon that ultimately did end the war. How did they feel about it?
Hansen: Well, as one might imagine, I think that there were differences in the degree to which the scientists who were involved in it felt conflicted. There were many scientists who were involved in the project who wish that we’d gotten there earlier so that the bomb might have played a role in ending the war in Europe sooner. A large number of the scientists in fact emigrated from Europe, many of them Germans who had been forced out of Germany by the Nazi regime. Many of them were Jewish and had relatives who perished and certainly friends who perished in the Holocaust. You know, on the other side, there were many scientists who were concerned not so much about having participated in the development of the bomb but not having any control over how that knowledge and how that science would be used.
So here at the Metallurgical Lab at the University of Chicago, starting in 1944, there was a major effort by the scientists to begin to sound alarms and to convince the government to begin to think about how to put in place controls over the development and use of nuclear energy. There was a lot of concern even in 1944 about the prospect of an arms race once it became known that there was such a thing as an atomic bomb. And that led in 1945 and into 1946 into a sustained effort on the part of the atomic scientists led by the people here at the Met lab to create a governance structure for nuclear energy development that would be accountable to democratically elected public officials and be accountable to the public.
In terms of the film, I don’t know whether you’ve had a chance to see it yet, but do you think the interest it has generated in the story of Oppenheimer and the development of the atomic bomb — is it a good thing that people are relearning this history?
Hansen: I think so. It certainly is going to raise awareness of the continuing issues of nuclear proliferation and of the prospects of nuclear confrontations — probably not in the places that we once thought about, but rather in places like South Asia or in East Asia. So that’s one thing I. I think the other thing it really puts on the agenda is the questions about the dangers in the development of technology and how one contains those dangers. And those are still with us. You know there are lots of technologies out there that could have far-reaching social effects and sort of bringing back to the public’s attention the way in which nuclear scientists really wrestled with the dictates of their conscience at the same time that they were developing these technologies I think that has many lessons for us as well.
The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and other organizations are hosting a special showing of “Oppenheimer” at the Music Box Theatre on July 29, followed by a post-movie panel conversation.

2023-06-29 18:19:02+00:00,Will Christoper Nolan’s ‘Oppenheimer’ Get a Theatrical Release in Japan?,"Christopher Nolan's historical epic ""Oppenheimer"" hasn't finalized release plans in Japan.","Christopher Nolan‘s historical epic “Oppenheimer,” about the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II, is preparing for a massive global debut next month. As of now, though, the film’s distributor Universal has yet to announce when — or if — it will premiere in Japan.
A spokesperson for the studio says “plans have not been finalized in all markets.” Universal is releasing the $100 million-budgeted “Oppenheimer” in the U.S. and much of the rest of the world on July 21.
The situation in Japan is complicated given the film’s subject matter and the devastation the bombs wrought on the country. “Oppenheimer” centers on American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), who led the efforts to build the weapons of mass destruction that ended the war. Approximately 200,000 Japanese civilians died after two atomic bombs were dropped in 1945 over the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Though the movie’s focus may not be enough to prevent the country from playing “Oppenheimer” in its theaters, if it does secure a release date, it’s not clear that Japanese moviegoers will be interested in seeing a film about the topic.
Other American-backed movies set in the Pacific theater of World War II have played in Japanese cinemas — though to mixed results. Hugh Jackman’s 2013 “X-Men” movie “The Wolverine,” which had a sequence involving the bombing of Nagasaki, generated a muted $7.9 million. Meanwhile, the Japanese-language “Letters From Iwo Jima” ($42.9 million), the second of Clint Eastwood’s 2006 companion pieces, earned far more than “Flags of Our Fathers” ($13.1 million), which recounted the same battle from the American perspective. “Oppenheimer,” sources say, differs from those films in that it is a talky R-rated drama that is largely set in laboratories and the halls of American government, not the battlefield.
Whether “Oppenheimer” will play in Japan comes down to Toho-Towa, the country’s biggest distributor of Hollywood films. The company has yet to screen the movie but is expected to do so soon.
There are other factors that make Japan a unique moviegoing market. Unlike most territories, Hollywood studios have influence but not the final say in when its movies will open in Japan. It’s also often the last country to release Hollywood films, in part because marketing efforts are highly structured. It’s not unusual for American-made movies to debut in Japan months later than they do in North America. And those plans are usually late to come together.
That said, two other major tentpoles that are premiering domestically in July have already been given release dates in Japan. Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” is set for Aug. 11 and Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” lands on July 21.
Nolan’s films, including “The Dark Knight” trilogy, as well as “Inception,” “Interstellar,” “Dunkirk” and “Tenet,” tend to make a huge portion of their money at the international box office. That may not be the case with a firmly American story like “Oppenheimer,” which studio sources believe will be more popular with U.S. moviegoers than foreign crowds. Japan, one of the top moviegoing markets, has been a modest territory for Nolan’s prior efforts. His two most recent releases, “Tenet” and “Dunkirk,” grossed $25 million and $14.8 million respectively in the country’s cinemas.
Nolan, who shot the movie in 70mm with Imax cameras, has stressed the importance of “Oppenheimer,” arguing that the aftershocks of the technology reverberates to this day.
“Like it or not, J. Robert Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived,” Nolan said at CinemaCon, the annual convention for movie theater owners. “He made the world that we live in for better or for worse. His story has to be seen to be believed.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2Uvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tdGhlYXRyaWNhbC1yZWxlYXNlLWphcGFuLTEyMzU2NDU3NTIv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vYm94LW9mZmljZS9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi10aGVhdHJpY2FsLXJlbGVhc2UtamFwYW4tMTIzNTY0NTc1Mi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 16:29:57+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’ sparks nuclear debate. Will Congress join in?,A few are skipping all the Oppenheimer vs. Barbie memes and trying to seize the moment to promote their legislation.,"As a wave of “Oppenheimer” vs. “Barbie” memes washed over the internet this week, members of Congress tried to ride it, joining in the fun. But a few struck a more serious tone. With nuclear policy back in popular conversation for the first time in years, lawmakers with a long-standing interest in the topic wondered how to seize the moment.
Sen. Edward J. Markey saw an opportunity to promote his proposal to ban AI from launching nuclear weapons, touting a meeting with one of the creative forces behind “Oppenheimer.”
The Massachusetts Democrat met with Kai Bird, whose Pulitzer Prize-winning book helped inspire Christopher Nolan to make his moody summer opus.
“I’m honored that Kai Bird has endorsed my legislation to ensure the robots never have their finger on the nuclear trigger,” Markey said in a statement, adding that he hopes senators will take it seriously as they work to finish their version of the annual defense policy bill.
Nolan’s movie offers a three-hour tour of the ethical and political history of America’s nuclear weapons program, following the tortured journey of J. Robert Oppenheimer, often called the father of the atomic bomb. It is based on the 2005 biography that Bird co-wrote with Martin J. Sherwin, “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.”
Markey said he sees an AI arms race beginning that recalls the nuclear arms race of the last century, and he wants public officials to remember that Oppenheimer “created a monster he ultimately could not contain.”
The summer movie release, which sparked a frenzy on Friday as it competed with the equally anticipated “Barbie” from director Greta Gerwig, was met with disappointment from advocates who had hoped it would acknowledge the lingering effects of the Manhattan Project and its testing program for people in New Mexico.
Sen. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., echoed those concerns, pointing to the “Downwinders and post-71 uranium mine workers” in his home state whose stories didn’t make it into Nolan’s biopic.
“With so much interest in Oppenheimer and the Trinity Test, this is an opportunity to educate millions of Americans that nearly eight decades later, New Mexicans are still dealing with the impacts of radiation exposure,” Luján said in an emailed statement.
The Democrat reupped calls to expand the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, the 1990 law that compensates some people who contracted cancer after nuclear contact. But he suggested the hoopla surrounding the movie hadn’t done much to advance the cause.
“It’s the sad truth that too many have died from the radioactive fallout from these decades-old tests. And I’ll be very candid, I’m worried folks aren’t really focused on the negative consequences of the Oppenheimer nuclear tests,” he tweeted.
Meanwhile, other lawmakers were jumping on the meme bandwagon on social media, playing along as people tried to guess who would see “Oppenheimer” and who would see “Barbie.”
“To everyone assuming I’m going to Oppenheimer, I say: why not both?” tweeted Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
Oppenheimer led the Los Alamos Laboratory during the Manhattan Project in the 1940s, as scientists developed the nuclear weapons that the United States would use to end World War II and change the course of human history.
Reigniting public debate was part of Nolan’s goal, the director has said, and he has tried to position the movie somewhere between a typical Hollywood blockbuster and a high-minded work of art.
At a panel this month marking the anniversary of the Trinity test, NBC News host Chuck Todd invited Nolan to imagine screening the movie for members of Congress and asked him what he would want them to learn.
“Our relationship with the fear of nuclear weapons ebbs and flows with the geopolitical situation, and it shouldn’t, because the threat is constant,” Nolan replied. “When you look back at history, some of the closest moments to nuclear disaster have actually been in times of relative calm geopolitically. So even though the situation in Ukraine kind of puts it more in the forefront of people’s minds, the truth is, nuclear weapons are an extraordinarily dangerous thing to have lying around the house.”
Nolan warned against forgetting the weapons exist or taking them lightly.
“One of the things that frightens me the most … [is] when I hear in the media reasonable people talking about ‘tactical nuclear weapons,’ as if this distinction can be made … [with] politicians and media sort of warming us up to the idea that perhaps there’s a certain size of nuclear weapon that would be acceptable as opposed to large ones,” he said.
Oppenheimer himself was eager to remind people that nuclear weapons didn’t happen by accident and that developing technology is a matter of policy, not destiny.
“We have greatly developed and greatly increased our atomic activities. This growth, though natural technically, is not inevitable,” he wrote in 1953. “If the Congress had appropriated no money, it would not have occurred.”

The BAFTA-winning series aired on the BBC more than 40 years ago and is available from today as a boxset on the VoD player.
Sam Waterston was the Cillian Murphy of the series, starring as the titular scientist as he led the weapons laboratory of the Manhattan Project, all the while under constant surveillance by the FBI because of his left wing politics and association with communists. As with Nolan’s movie, the show followed his role in developing the world’s first nuclear weapons and his rivalry with Edward Teller, through to being stripped of his security clearance by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in the 1950s. David Suchet, Kate Harper, John Carson, Christopher Munke and Jana Shelden also starred.
The show catapulted Waterston to fame, as he went on to land roles in Law and Order, The Newsroom, and Grace & Frankie. It aired in the U.S. on PBS’ American Playhouse and won three BAFTAs including Best Drama Series, while being nominated for seven.
The BBC’s move comes as Oppenheimer tears up the global box office alongside Barbie. Deadline’s latest box office report had Universal‘s opus at $405.6M global and more is expected this weekend during the second ‘Barbenheimer’ holdover.

,The Conversation: The Bhagavad Gita was special for Oppenheimer − but not in the way Christopher Nolan’s film depicts it,<p>An expert in Hindu religion explains the controversy over the use of the Gita in,"Oppenheimer often used Sanskrit verses, and the Bhagavad Gita was special for him − but not in the way Christopher Nolan’s film depicts it
A scene in the film “Oppenheimer,” in which the physicist is quoting a Bhagavad Gita verse while making love, has upset some Hindus. The information commissioner of the Indian government, Uday Mahurkar, said in an open letter the scene was a “direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus” and alleged that it amounted to “waging a war on the Hindu community.” He also said that it almost appeared to be “part of a larger conspiracy by anti-Hindu forces.”
It is hard to say how many Hindus were offended by the Gita quote in a sexually charged scene, but there were those who disagreed with the views expressed in the tweet. Pavan K. Varma, a former diplomat, wrote that the controversy was a “misplaced outrage.”
Some others were not offended, just disappointed that the context of the lines quoted from the Bhagavad Gita was not brought out well. I should also add that Hindu texts composed over 1,000 years, starting around the sixth century B.C.E., have Sanskrit mantras for every occasion, including reciting some ritually before having sex. But they are context-specific, and certainly the Bhagavad Gita would not be used.
Overall, the controversy brought attention to the words quoted by J. Robert Oppenheimer while looking at the erupting fireball from the atomic bomb explosion in Los Alamos, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945: “Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” These words are a a paraphrase of Bhagavad Gita 11:32 where Krishna, an avatar of Vishnu – whom many Hindus think of as the supreme being – says that he is kala, or time.
Kala also means “death.” Oppenheimer’s teacher, Arthur Ryder, a professor of Sanskrit at the University of California, Berkeley, had translated the verse as “Death am I, and my present task Destruction.”
Beyond the sex squabble, the biopic can be a good starting point to understand how Oppenheimer’s deep knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita and other Sanskrit texts helped him with his assignment in New Mexico. It can also be a catalyst for the public to have some hard conversations about weapons of mass destruction.
Wisdom of the Gita and the Panchatantra
As an undergraduate at Harvard University, Oppenheimer read Hindu texts in translation, but at Berkeley, he learned Sanskrit from Ryder, meeting in his teacher’s home on long winter evenings. On Oct. 7, 1933, he wrote to his brother Frank that he had been reading the Gita with two other Sanskritists.
This text was special to Oppenheimer, more than other books. He called it “the most beautiful philosophical song existing in any known tongue,” and he gave copies to friends. When talking at a memorial service for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, he quoted his own translation of Bhagavad Gita 17:3, “Man is a creature whose substance is faith. What his faith is, he is.”
Oppenheimer’s reaction, when he looked at the mighty explosion, seems to be close to what the German theologian Rudolf Otto called “numinous” – a combination of awe and fascination at this majesty. His reaction was to think of the Bhagavad Gita’s verse 11:12: “If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one.”
Oppenheimer also read many other Sanskrit texts, including the fifth-century Sanskrit poet Kalidasa’s “Cloud Messenger,” or “Meghaduta,” and his letters show familiarity with “The Three Hundred Poems of Moral Values,” or the “Satakatrayam,” a work from the sixth century C.E. From his quoting the text in many contexts, he seems to have been fond of the Panchatantra,“ a text of animal fables with pragmatic morals. Ryder, Oppenheimer’s Sanskrit mentor, had also translated this book of charming stories with sometimes cynical messages.
Oppenheimer’s familiarity with the Panchatantra is also evident in the naming of his new car Garuda, after the eagle-vehicle of Lord Vishnu. He explained the name to his brother, not with the bird’s well-known connection with Vishnu, but by alluding to a lesser-known story from the Panchatantra, in which a carpenter makes a wooden flying vehicle shaped like the mythical Garuda for his friend.
Oppenheimer loved a Sanskrit epigram from the Panchatantra: ""Scholarship is less than sense, therefore seek intelligence.” The line is a rueful reflection at the end of a story in which four men go to seek their fortune.
Three of them were learned scholars who held the fourth in low esteem. On their path, they came across some bones. On seeing those, the first, believing the bones to be of a lion, said that he could put the skeleton together. The second said he would the graft skin and flesh on it, and the third said he would make it come to life. The fourth – believed to be the less learned person – warned them against it. However, when they insisted on going ahead, he asked them to wait until he could climb a tree for safety. The lion came to life and devoured the three scholars.
Oppenheimer used the Sanskrit verse that followed this story often. From the Gita, he learned and rationalized that it was his duty to build the bomb, and it was the leaders’ duty to use it wisely. In other words, Oppenheimer went along with government decisions not because they were government decisions but because he thought political decision-making was the duty of government leaders, not scientists.
A missing discussion
It is hard to know director Christopher Nolan’s motivation for juxtaposing the Gita verse with an intimate scene – it could be creative license or simply Orientalism, or the West’s stereotypical description of the East. Given Oppenheimer’s deep love for the Bhagavad Gita, he would not have, I believe, quoted the text with disrespect.
As for the Hindus who are offended, there could be multiple reasons: It could be the centuries of a colonial gaze that was fascinated with and horrified by the erotic in Indian spirituality.
For example, the 10th-century temples of Khajuraho – where only about 10% of the sculptures are erotic – and texts like the Kamasutra informed early missionary views on Hinduism. It could also be that some Hindus valorize the spirit of renunciation and the ascetic impulse of some Hindu texts.
But beyond this controversy, this film offers an opportunity to reflect on more profound issues. The detonation of atomic bombs led to the death of possibly 200,000 people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and horrific effects on survivors. Kai Bird, coauthor of the book on which the biopic Oppenheimer is based, said that he hopes the film “will initiate a national conversation not only about our existential relationship to weapons of mass destruction but also the need in our society for scientists as public intellectuals.”
While that would be valuable, an important discussion, left out from the narrative, is about the ethics of American leaders who knowingly caused harm at the time. The atomic test explosion led to devastating health consequences for about 13,000 New Mexicans who lived within a 50-mile radius and were not warned beforehand or afterward. This exposure to radioactive material took a toll over several generations.
In the end, the lesson is that the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita have to be balanced with the pragmatic lessons of the Panchatantra. Despite Oppenheimer’s quoting the Panchatantra about common sense being more important than intellectual scholarship, his own interpretation of duty gave undue credit and power to political leaders.
With the atomic explosion in New Mexico, the lion from the Panchatantra story that Oppenheimer cautioned about did come to life, and some may say it lives in a straw cage.

2023-07-07 18:35:31.044000+00:00,"Oppenheimer, Nullified and Vindicated","Kai Bird, a biographer of J. Robert Oppenheimer, writes about his efforts to rectify a McCarthyist smear on the reputation of the inventor of the atomic bomb.","“Architect of Atomic Bomb Cleared of ‘Black Mark.’ ” That was the headline last December 18th, when the Times ran a long story on page 16 reporting that Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm had “nullified a 1954 decision to revoke the security clearance of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a top government scientist who led the making of the atomic bomb in World War II but fell under suspicion of being a Soviet spy at the height of the McCarthy era.” Granholm had issued a press release explaining that her department had been “entrusted with the responsibility to correct the historical record and honor Dr. Oppenheimer’s ‘profound contributions to our national defense and scientific enterprise at large.’ ” She said that she was pleased to announce the nullification.
The Times’ veteran reporter on things nuclear, William J. Broad, went on to summarize Oppenheimer’s life story and his downfall at the height of the Cold War: “Until then a hero of American science, he lived out his life a broken man and died in 1967 at the age of 62.” But, even in 1954, it was clear to most readers of the trial transcripts, leaked to the Times that spring, that the security hearing was a kangaroo court and that Oppenheimer had been publicly humiliated for political reasons. The “father of the atomic bomb” had to be silenced because he was opposing the development of the hydrogen “super” bomb. Ever since, historians have regarded him as the chief celebrity victim of the national trauma known as McCarthyism.
So why now, sixty-eight years after the infamous security hearing, and fifty-five years after Oppenheimer’s death, did the Biden Administration find the courage to do the right thing? Governments rarely apologize for their errors. How did this decision happen? True, the director Christopher Nolan has a major motion picture coming out this summer called “Oppenheimer.” But, contrary to popular myth, Hollywood’s influence in Washington is limited, particularly when it comes to the nuclear-security establishment.
Here is the wholly improbable story.
In 2005, Martin J. Sherwin and I published “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.” Marty had worked on the biography for twenty-five years. I was brought aboard the project only in 2000. In 2006, the book won the Pulitzer Prize, and Marty was inspired by the notion that perhaps we could sue the government to revoke the 1954 decision. We wrote a four-thousand-word memo delineating how the Atomic Energy Commission, or A.E.C., had violated its own regulations governing security reviews. Among a long list of transgressions, they had illegally wiretapped Oppenheimer’s home and the office of his lawyer during the course of the security trial. Nothing incriminating was discovered. They allowed the three-member security panel access to Oppenheimer’s F.B.I. files, which ran to several thousand pages—but denied his own lawyer a security clearance, so he was not allowed to read the material being used selectively against his client. They blackmailed otherwise friendly witnesses to turn against Oppenheimer.
Armed with this catalogue of abuses, we approached a senior partner at WilmerHale, an influential Washington law firm, and persuaded him to take on the case pro bono. A young associate was assigned to research whether there was any legal recourse in the courts. Three months later, we got a phone call from the firm, explaining that it had to drop the matter due to personal objections from one of its partners, the late C. Boyden Gray, who had formerly served as White House counsel during the Presidency of George H. W. Bush. Washington is still a small town, and, as it happens, Gray’s father was Gordon Gray, the man who had chaired the three-member security-hearing panel that ruled against Oppenheimer.
Some months later, Marty Sherwin and I were at a crowded book party in Georgetown, at the home of William Nitze, a son of the late career politician Paul Nitze. Across the room, I pointed out to Marty, stood Boyden Gray. Marty marched up to Gray, introduced himself as Oppenheimer’s biographer, and proceeded to explain why what Gray’s father had done in 1954 was a travesty. Boyden Gray took offense, and they argued vehemently for a few minutes. No blows were landed, but Marty walked away pleased that he had spoken truth to power.
By this time, we had been advised by other lawyers that, separate from Boyden Gray’s objections, they had come to the conclusion that the courts could not be used to reverse the 1954 decision. The lawyers advised that such a reversal could only be achieved by executive order, probably by the President himself. (WilmerHale did not respond to requests for comment.)
Early in 2010, we therefore approached the Obama White House. Fortuitously, the newly appointed White House counsel was Robert Bauer, who happened to be one of my high-school friends from Cairo, Egypt, where both of our fathers were stationed as Foreign Service officers in the nineteen-sixties. Marty and I drafted yet another memo making the argument for nullification and sent it to Bauer—and he was sympathetic. Bauer encouraged us to get a few senators or historians to sign a letter urging nullification.
Without further prompting, we soon learned that Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, had sent a twenty-page memo on June 14, 2011, to Obama’s Secretary of Energy Steven Chu. Bingaman’s letter, which paralleled many of our own arguments, was drafted by a member of his staff, Sam Fowler, and marshalled a powerful legal case. But Secretary Chu declined to act. Bingaman retired from the Senate, in early 2013, and was replaced by Senator Martin Heinrich.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtlci5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9jdWx0dXJlLWRlc2svb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbnVsbGlmaWVkLWFuZC12aW5kaWNhdGVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Robert Oppenheimer’s story offers particularly salient lessons for health care leaders, entrepreneurs, and policymakers.","All great stories have complicated endings. But that doesn’t mean they can’t offer simple and instructive lessons. Christopher Nolan’s magnum opus, “Oppenheimer,” highlights the tragic story about the “father of the atomic bomb.” But it’s also a story about how the United States missed an opportunity to be a global leader in the development of an innovation that would define the 20th century. This century will be defined by transformational technologies — especially artificial intelligence — and J. Robert Oppenheimer’s story offers particularly salient lessons for health care leaders, entrepreneurs, and policymakers.
Oppenheimer’s era was defined by the nuclear power race, while ours is being defined by the competition in artificial intelligence technology. Both technologies are powerful tools that will change the trajectory of humanity. In another disconcerting similarity with Oppenheimer’s era, political actors who frame national policies around innovation seem disengaged with or are politicizing the nuances of science. This politicking has made it increasingly difficult to have constructive conversations about the future of health care innovation. We already see this happening with the misinformation around mRNA technology and the ongoing harassment of scientists.

Meanwhile, more than a dozen health care companies are already using ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot developed by OpenAI, for a variety of functions. But we do not fully understand the consequences of integrating these large language models into health functions. Surprisingly, many of the ongoing conversations on AI policymaking and regulation have focused on technology industry leaders, and have not fully utilized the expertise of leaders from the health care industry, who have unique insights on the application of AI on health and medicine. This reminded me of a powerful scene in the movie “Oppenheimer” in which the titular scientist tries to persuade President Truman about the dangers of the nuclear power, only to have his concerns dismissed.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4LzAyL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWFydGlmaWNpYWwtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLWFpLWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-20 12:49:10.114000+00:00,Here’s why the best IMAX movies still need a Palm Pilot to work,"In IMAX theaters around the world, Oppenheimer will play in its full 70mm glory. In the projection booth, a Palm m130 will help make it happen.","The Palm Pilot surely wasn’t the point of the TikTok, but it seemed to be the only thing anybody noticed. Ahead of the release of Oppenheimer, the official IMAX TikTok account posted a video showing the mind-bending size of the 70mm film print and the orange extensions IMAX had to build just to hold the platter in place. To give you some context: Oppenheimer’s film reportedly weighs 600 pounds, and the reel is an outrageous 11 miles long. Director Christopher Nolan told Collider that he thinks he might have hit the “outer limit” for how big a film reel can be.
But anyway, back to the Palm Pilot. Right there, in the foreground of the TikTok video, is a small blue and silver Palm device. (It’s technically not called a Palm Pilot — PalmPilot was the name of the company and devices long before the m130 came out — but everybody calls this class of devices Palm Pilots. So we will, too.) More specifically: a picture of a Palm Pilot, on a tablet, mounted to a white column next to the machine holding the reels. It’s not just a Palm Pilot; it’s a Palm Pilot emulator, running on another device because that’s apparently how important this thing is to getting Oppenheimer on a screen near you.
The emulated device in question is a Palm m130, a device released in 2002. It had a two-inch 160 x 160 display, was powered by Motorola’s 33MHz DragonBall VZ processor, and ran on Palm OS 4.1. Palm said the battery would last a week between charges, and you could even add Bluetooth via a card slot. People liked it, it got good reviews. You probably haven’t thought about it in damn near two decades.
In an IMAX theater, the m130’s job is to control the quick turn reel unit, or QTRU for short. (For many years, it appears, a non-emulated m130 sat holstered in most theaters.) The QTRU’s job is to control the platters, which are those large horizontal shelves where all of a film’s many reels are stitched together, stored, and then quickly spun out to and from the projector. The IMAX 1570 projector moves film at a little under six feet per second, so it’s all happening really fast.
The m130 is apparently crucial to keeping the thing humming — “PALM PILOT MUST BE ON ALL THE TIME,” reads a notice above an image of a different m130 that has since been passed around the internet — but doesn’t often need to be used. “I’ve never had to interact with the Palm Pilot,” says one person familiar with the technology. “It’s really just a status screen.” Its job is to keep the QTRU moving at a consistent speed and to help keep the film’s video in sync with its audio.
A (non-emulated) shot of the m130’s QTRU status menu. Image: Tom Barber
If you zoom in on the image, as of course the entire internet did, there are four things it displays. Our knowledgeable source explained each one:
ProjL and ProjR: Refers to the sides of a 3D projector, L and R meaning left and right. “This is from the days of the 45-minute 3D documentaries, where there was a right eye print and a left eye print which both ran through the projector at the same time.”
Takeup: Defines which platter is ready to receive the film after it goes through the projector.
Feed: Defines which platter is feeding film into the projector.
Locked: “If this is highlighted, this means that the platters are ready to run.”
The Palm-powered QTRU system is actually a relatively high-tech part of an otherwise extremely manual process. Yves Leibowitz, a longtime projectionist, has made a number of popular YouTube videos documenting the process of loading a film, which requires setting up the enormous reels in exactly the right place, manually threading film through a number of rollers and platters, and constantly checking and rechecking to make sure everything’s lined up and ready to go.
In most of his videos, you actually get a brief glimpse of a Palm device set up next to the QTRU, but Leibowitz never seems to need to touch it. In every case we’ve seen, though, it’s an actual physical device. The emulator appears to be a new phenomenon, and in fact, IMAX told Vice it was created specifically for Oppenheimer. “IMAX Engineering designed and manufactured an emulator that mimics the look and feel of a PalmPilot to keep it simple and familiar for IMAX film projectionists,” the company said. The emulator, if you’re curious, appears to be running on a Winmate W10IB3S-PCH2AC-POE Panel PC, a 10.1-inch Windows tablet that appears to have been designed to live outside of conference rooms and help people control schedules and video conferencing.
The obvious question here is, why in the world would IMAX still run its systems on a 21-year-old device? And why, when faced with the need to update it, would it choose to simply emulate said 21-year-old device on a crappy Windows tablet? Other QTRU systems have a controller built into the machine itself, which seems better in every imaginable way.
For IMAX, like so many other companies that rely on generations-old technology, the answer is simple: it works. And it’s not like it’s a booming industry in need of reinvention. There are only 30 theaters worldwide that can even show a full 70mm print like Oppenheimer, 19 of them in the US. Most IMAX experiences are digital now, like most moviegoing experiences in general.
Nolan is actually one of the few filmmakers left making 70mm IMAX movies at all, and if he’s hit the limit of the technology, even he might not do it much longer. “If 70mm IMAX had a resurgence then I’d expect that they’d update the QTRU controllers,” our source says. “Until then it’s best to ride it until the wheels fall off.” Palm OS is simple and stable and easily emulated (heck, you can run it in your browser right now) and still does this particular job just fine.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMzgwMTExOC9pbWF4LW1vdmllLXBhbG0tcGlsb3Qtb3BwZW5oZWltZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

On July 21, Oppenheimer, a new major motion picture chronicling the life and legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, will open in theaters across the country. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, director of Dunkirk, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy, the film was inspired by the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. (In a run-up to the film, NBC News produced a documentary on Oppenheimer that aired on July 9 on MSNBC and is now streaming on Peacock.)
“What I wanted to do was take the audience into the mind and the experience of a person who sat at the absolute center of the largest shift in history,” Nolan said in a Universal Pictures press release. “Like it or not, J. Robert Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived.”
I can’t say that Oppenheimer—or anyone else for that matter—could be considered the most important person who ever lived, but there is no doubt that he, as well as the hundreds of other Manhattan Project scientists at Los Alamos he led, changed the world irrevocably. Ever since they detonated the first nuclear device on July 16, 1945, all of humanity, as President Kennedy pointed out in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly 16 years later, has been living “under a nuclear sword of Damocles, hanging by the slenderest of threads, capable of being cut at any moment by accident or miscalculation or by madness.”
Some Manhattan Project scientists tried to stop President Truman from dropping the atomic bomb on Japan in the first place. Afterward, many of them—including Oppenheimer—wrestled with civilian and military officials to try to restrain an arms race they predicted would happen. They campaigned against proliferation, for stricter arms control, and even for eventual disarmament. Sometimes they were successful in setting—or at least influencing—the political agenda. More often, they were not.
Bird, whose book was first published in 2005, would like the film to jumpstart a public discussion about the issues Oppenheimer grappled with, issues that are still very much with us today.
“I have hopes it will actually stimulate a national, even global conversation about the issues that Oppenheimer was desperate to speak out about,” Bird said during a mid-May seminar at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study, where Oppenheimer served as director from 1947 to 1966. “About how to live in the atomic age, how to live with the bomb and about McCarthyism. What it means to be a patriot, and what is the role for a scientist in a society drenched with technology and science to speak out about public issues.”
The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) has been deeply engaged in the same issues ever since its founding in the spring of 1969. The fledgling organization’s very first reports were on ballistic missile defense and multiple warhead missiles, and over the last 54 years, UCS scientists have been in the thick of the national debate over nuclear weapons and arms control.
Given the upcoming debut of Oppenheimer, I wanted to explore the role that physicists and other scientists have played since World War II in shaping national—and international—nuclear policy with Dylan Spaulding, a senior scientist in the UCS Global Security Program. Spaulding has an undergraduate degree in physics from Brown University and a doctorate degree in Earth and Planetary Sciences from the University of California, Berkeley, where Oppenheimer taught from 1929 to 1943. Among other positions before joining the UCS staff last year, he was a stockpile stewardship graduate fellow at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and spent time at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories, where he gained familiarity with the US nuclear weapons complex and the science of weapons development.
EN: By May 1945, it was a foregone conclusion that the United States would drop the atomic bomb on Japan. But at least one Manhattan Project scientist—Leo Szilard—tried unsuccessfully to convince President Truman to abandon plans to use the weapon, and he and a number of his colleagues warned policymakers that using the bomb would trigger an arms race with the Soviet Union. They recommended that the United States demonstrate what they called the “gadget” before United Nations representatives at an uninhabited site. Where was Oppenheimer on this issue?
DS: As Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin point out in American Prometheus, J. Robert Oppenheimer’s position was complicated. Most of the scientists at Los Alamos had been working fervently to stop Nazi Germany, which they feared would develop an atomic bomb first, but the war in Europe ended just before the US bomb was ready. Many key Manhattan Project scientists, including Oppenheimer, were Jewish, and—unlike Oppenheimer, who was born in the United States—many were refugees from Europe. After Germany unconditionally surrendered in May 1945, some of the scientists began to question the value of continuing, possibly because their sense of urgency had ebbed. That wasn’t as true for Oppenheimer, who apparently was caught between his deep devotion to the science, his personal convictions, and his role as project leader. At the time, he was reluctant to acknowledge that scientists have a unique responsibility when it comes to arms control, although he recognized that the weapon they had designed would fundamentally change the nature of war. In fact, he thought it could put an end to all war.
At the same time, he was wary of the debate among his Los Alamos colleagues about the implications of their work. He insisted that scientists were no more qualified than anyone else to determine the use of atomic power and that politics was not their first responsibility. Ultimately, he signed off on a report by an advisory committee to Secretary of War Henry Stimson that concluded that it could “propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war” in Japan and saw “no acceptable alternative to direct military use.”
By contrast, Leo Szilard was alarmed when the Truman administration’s intentions for using the weapon became clearer. Along with James Franck, Glenn Seaborg and other Manhattan Project scientists, he issued what became known as the Franck Report, an especially prescient document that recommended demonstrating the bomb before international observers in an unpopulated area. The report warned that using the bomb without a prior international agreement on controlling atomic energy would spark a runaway arms race and that dropping it unannounced on a civilian population would sacrifice any possibility of the United States being able to provide moral leadership on nuclear issues. Szilard followed the report with a petition to Truman signed by more than 70 Manhattan Project scientists calling for restraint and granting the Japanese the opportunity to surrender first. Oppenheimer did not take Szilard’s efforts kindly and did not circulate the petition at Los Alamos. It never got to Truman.
It is clear that Oppenheimer was deeply transformed after the war, particularly when his Manhattan Project protégé, Robert Serber, returned to Los Alamos after participating in the first US delegation to Hiroshima with a first-hand account of the horrific atrocities on the ground. Oppenheimer, who had previously been appalled that there were no protests over the US firebombing of Tokyo, now found himself identified in the daily news as the architect of an even more massive barbarity.
After the war, Oppenheimer did help shape some of the first US arms control proposals. In 1946, for example, he coauthored the Acheson-Lilienthal report, one of the first attempts to design a system of international control over atomic energy. After the Truman administration established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which placed atomic energy under civilian supervision, Oppenheimer became chair of the AEC’s General Advisory Committee (GAC), which kept him in the middle of the political and ethical debates over nuclear weapons in the post-war years.
EN: When the Soviet Union exploded its first atomic bomb in August 1949, it prompted the Truman administration to dramatically increase the number of nuclear weapons in the US stockpile from around 50 to some 300 by June 1950. It also ignited a crash program to develop the “Super,” a thermonuclear hydrogen bomb, 1,000 times more lethal than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. How did Oppenheimer and other Manhattan Project scientists react to that?
DS: It wasn’t a surprise for most of the Manhattan Project scientists that the Soviets were able to develop their own bomb. Spies at Los Alamos had provided the Soviet Union background on the project well before the United States dropped the bombs on Japan. In fact, when Truman told Soviet leader Joseph Stalin at the Potsdam conference in late July 1945 that the United States had a “new weapon of unusual destructive force,” Stalin may have known more about it than Truman! Detonating the bomb demonstrated the science. Afterward, it was merely an engineering problem for other countries to replicate.
The idea of a “super” bomb had been actively promoted by another physicist at Los Alamos, Edward Teller, much to Oppenheimer’s dismay. He saw it as unnecessarily complicated and possibly unfeasible, but Teller essentially refused to work on anything else. When the idea resurfaced in 1949, Teller jumped at the chance to recruit scientists back to Los Alamos to work on it.
Oppenheimer, who then chaired the GAC, opposed building this even more lethal and indiscriminate weapon. He felt that such a large bomb served no military purpose, was morally repugnant, and instead recommended that the United States develop smaller, “tactical” nuclear weapons that could be used on the battlefield.
Oppenheimer’s vehement opposition to the hydrogen bomb was a major factor leading to his prosecution in early 1950s during Sen. Joseph McCarthy’s Red Scare campaign and ultimately the revocation of his security clearance. Teller was a key witness against him in government hearings.
Oppenheimer and his allies obviously lost the debate over the hydrogen bomb. Today, most of the US nuclear arsenal is made up of thermonuclear weapons that have yields ranging from 10 to 80 times larger than the Hiroshima bomb.
EN: Regardless, physicists have played a pivotal role in arms control since then. A notable example happened in the 1980s, when US and Soviet scientists worked together to show that a nuclear test ban treaty could be verified. What can you tell us about that extraordinary effort?
DS: Between 1945 and 1992, the United States and Russia collectively conducted 1,745 tests in the atmosphere and underground. The seven other confirmed nuclear states conducted 311 tests until 1998, with North Korea being the only state that has tested since then. Because tests were critical for nuclear weapons development throughout the Cold War, antinuclear advocates saw some form of nuclear test ban as the best way to stop the arms race and limit proliferation. Progress came in fits and starts, but it was ultimately thanks to the scientists who demonstrated the technical means to verify a test ban treaty that the political stalemate could be overcome.
The earliest attempts to limit testing began in the late 1950s, resulting in a temporary moratorium and then a partial test ban in 1963 during the Kennedy administration that ended testing in the atmosphere, oceans, and space. The partial test ban treaty was largely due to growing public awareness of the threat posed by radioactive fallout as well as the sobering experience of the Cuban Missile Crisis, when the United States and the Soviet Union narrowly averted a nuclear exchange. But it also was at least partly due to efforts by US chemist Linus Pauling, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1962 for raising awareness of the dangers of atmospheric testing as well as organizing a petition calling for an end to testing signed by more than 11,000 scientists around the world.
The very real concern that nations could secretly continue to conduct underground tests would prove to be an obstacle to further progress until the 1980s, when Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev’s policy of glasnost, or openness, allowed US and Soviet scientists to talk directly with each other. Princeton physicist Frank von Hippel and Jeremy Stone, president of the Federation of American Scientists, organized arms control workshops and joint studies with Soviet physicists, including Roald Sagdeev, Evgeny Velikhov and others associated with the Soviet Academy of Sciences. At one such meeting in Moscow in 1986, Thomas Cochran, a physicist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, proposed that US and Soviet scientists work together to seismically monitor US and Soviet test sites. Velikhov and his team accepted Cochran’s proposal, and the resulting project showed that advanced seismometers could detect even small tests and distinguish them from large chemical explosions and natural seismic activity. Their demonstration provided a viable way to verify an underground test ban and countered government claims that such a treaty could not be enforced.
That joint US-Soviet project remains a prime example of what can be accomplished by multilateral scientific collaboration. It took another decade, but in September 1996, the United Nations adopted the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). All five official nuclear weapons states—China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States—as well as 66 other nations signed the treaty that day. (While abiding by the treaty, neither China nor the United States have officially ratified it.) Today, the CTBT Organization maintains an impressive array of seismic stations, infrasound atmospheric sensors, submarine hydroacoustic sensors and radionuclide monitors spanning the globe to detect nuclear tests anywhere they might occur.
EN: In 1983, President Reagan gave his famous “Star Wars” speech calling for scientists to develop a “space shield” that would render “nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete.” The US scientific community, including physicists at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), warned that the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) to put an anti-ballistic-missile-defense system in space would not work. Tell us about the role scientists have played over the last four decades to try to kill what has amounted to a zombie program that won’t die.
DS: The idea of an impenetrable shield against nuclear weapons, whether space-based or ground-based anti-ballistic missiles, is innately attractive, and would be preferable to basing national security on the concept of mutually assured destruction. In reality, however, a viable anti-ballistic missile defense system would likely spur an adversary to build more offensive missiles and, in any case, missile defense has proven to be ineffective, expensive, and technically vulnerable.
Ronald Reagan’s original notion of a space-based system was enthusiastically championed by some scientists, particularly Edward Teller, but UCS and other scientific organizations have demonstrated how impractical and dangerous these proposals are.
A year after Reagan proposed the SDI system, UCS founders Kurt Gottfried and Henry Kendall—along with Manhattan Project physicist Hans Bethe and physicist Richard Garwin, a longtime UCS board member—coauthored The Fallacy of Star Wars, a book that showed that the system was based on a nonexistent technology and would require considerably more satellites than its proponents suggested. Potentially costing billions of dollars apiece, the satellites would be much more vulnerable than the missiles they were supposed to defeat. Their assessment was seconded a few years later by scientists at the American Physical Society, who published a similarly scathing appraisal of SDI’s technical challenges and feasibility.
Around the same time, physicists Lisbeth Gronlund and David Wright, who later served as codirectors of the UCS Global Security Program (GSP) from 2002 to 2020, circulated a pledge signed by more than 7,000 scientists who vowed they would not accept SDI-related funding. The campaign generated headlines across the country, drawing public attention to the scientific community’s strong opposition to Reagan’s plan.
These efforts mounted technical, as well as moral, challenges to the Star Wars program and highlighted the folly behind it. They remain a shining example of how scientists can best use their expertise to debunk bad—and dangerous—government policy, showing that there is no technical solution to protect people from nuclear weapons. The real solution is political and diplomatic.
EN: The myth of a viable Star Wars program became even more problematic when the George W. Bush administration abandoned the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty with the Russians in 2002. UCS scientists were able to show that an anti-ballistic missile defense system could be easily defeated.
DS: That’s right. The idea behind limiting defensive weapons under the ABM Treaty was to support nuclear arms reductions by discouraging an offense-defense arms race. The ABM Treaty strictly limited the amount of missile defenses each party could field. Eventually the unrealistic dream of a space-based missile defense system came down to earth, and the Pentagon focused on ground-based interceptors to target nuclear-armed missiles during their long coast through space, the midcourse phase of flight.
In 2000, the last full year of the Clinton administration, UCS scientists published another study, this time in collaboration with scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and elsewhere. The study, Countermeasures, showed just how easily the proposed national missile defense system could be defeated using technologies available to any state capable of launching a nuclear-armed ballistic missile.
Nevertheless, within its first weeks in office, the George W. Bush administration signaled an interest in withdrawing from the ABM Treaty. Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the administration announced it was indeed doing so and planned to accelerate the development of a Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system against possible missile threats from Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. It was a decidedly pared down version of what Edward Teller and Ronald Reagan had envisioned, but it was equally misguided.
The Pentagon pursued the GMD system with multibillion-dollar budgets and little oversight, and repeatedly claimed the system was highly effective and would provide significant protection. UCS scientists and other experts pushed back against this fanciful narrative with analyses showing that the system is ineffective, costly, and destabilizing. For more specifics, I highly recommend checking out a 2016 report by UCS Global Security Research Director Laura Grego, which provides a good, relatively up-to-date analysis of the GMD system’s technical and administrative deficiencies.
Without a doubt, abandoning the ABM Treaty and spending billions on missile defense has undermined US security. In March 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin specifically cited the US withdrawal from the ABM Treaty as the reason why Russia is now developing new “super weapons,” including hypersonic nuclear delivery systems. China is following suit, prompting the United States to respond to this new “threat” by developing its own hypersonic weapons as well as modernizing every leg of its nuclear arsenal.
EN: In a 2020 report, UCS scientists made a convincing case for retiring US land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). A year later, they punctured the hype over hypersonic weapons. Are US policymakers paying any attention?
DS: Unfortunately, they are paying more attention to the perceived threat that I just mentioned—a new “trilateral” cold war. And, at the same time, they are ignoring the way in which US actions are driving a new arms race.
The 400 land-based ICBMs scattered across the northern Great Plains states are immobile, their positions are well-known, and their main purpose is to “absorb” a nuclear attack from Russia, acting as a giant “nuclear sponge.” As then GSP co-directors Wright and Gronlund and their coauthor William Hartung pointed out in their 2020 report, Russian missiles could reach them within a half hour, giving a president 10 minutes or less to decide whether to launch them before they are destroyed by a perceived attack. That increases the possibility of mistaken nuclear war triggered by a false attack warning, and there have been a number of close calls over the last six decades due to human and technological errors.
ICBMs are not only dangerous, they are an unnecessary relic of cold war strategy. They may have made sense 60 years ago, when they were more accurate and powerful than submarine-launched ballistic missiles and when communications links with subs were unreliable. Since then, the accuracy of sub-launched missiles has increased dramatically, and the Navy has secure submarine communication links, making the ICBMs superfluous.
If ICBMs are now passé, hypersonic weapons are now all the rage—with no scientific justification. A 2021 analysis by Wright and UCS Kendall Fellow Cameron Tracy found that hypersonic weapons fail to live up to the glowing claims made about them. Despite what their name suggests, they are not faster than conventional missiles, nor are they stealthier or harder to detect. Regardless, as I mentioned earlier, hypersonics have triggered a high-tech arms race with Russia and China because US policymakers mistakenly see them as cutting-edge technology.
In many ways, hypersonics are yet another example of illogical cold war thinking that goes like this: If our adversary has them, we have to have them too, even if we’re not quite sure why.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYmxvZy51Y3N1c2Eub3JnL2VsbGlvdHQtbmVnaW4vYXNrLWEtc2NpZW50aXN0LXNjaWVudGlzdHMtYW5kLWFybXMtY29udHJvbC1mcm9tLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXRvLXRvZGF5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Robert Oppenheimer at the project’s Los Alamos compound. Although his character is not depicted in “Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan’s sweeping biopic about the director of the Los Alamos lab, Hall’s smaller story — told in the documentary “A Compassionate Spy” — makes for a timely footnote to Nolan’s magnum opus.
As Hall has admitted, shortly before his death in 1999, he gave the Soviets critical information about the implosion technology being used for the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, information that may have helped them in the pursuit of their own nuclear weapon. The decision, he says in an old interview — footage of which, included here, contains his confession and other recollections of the past — was born out of “compassion”: Two superpowers with the same weapon of mass destruction would be less likely to use it against each other.
Suspicions about the loyalty of Oppenheimer — who like Hall and some others at Los Alamos had some sympathies toward leftist causes — figure prominently in “Oppenheimer.” But although Hall was interviewed by the FBI, he was never charged with a crime. By the time the U.S. government’s suspicions about Hall were confirmed (when a misspelled version of his name was recognized in an intercepted communication from Russia), the decision was made not to pursue espionage charges, which would have publicly revealed that the United States had broken Soviet code.
This small detail is actually the most fascinating part of “A Compassionate Spy,” but it is glossed over in the film by Steve James, director of the Oscar-nominated 1994 film “Hoop Dreams.” Instead, the film focuses mainly on an interview with Hall’s widow, Joan Hall, who adds some interesting perspective and insight into her husband’s thinking. Reenactments with actors playing the Halls (J. Michael Wright and Lucy Zukaitis) and Ted’s friend and co-conspirator Saville Sax (Nicolas Eastlund) are occasionally goofy and unnecessary. The threesome, it is suggested, formed a love triangle, so “A Compassionate Spy” is also a kind of romance.

Ted’s motivations are adequately defended, by his own words and Joan’s. But the other side of the moral coin is left largely unexplored, other than a brief clip in which we hear one of the film’s subjects opine that, if he had his druthers, Ted would have been shot as a traitor. Interludes related to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were convicted of espionage in 1951 (and executed in 1953), provide some helpful context.
“A Compassionate Spy” is less a full companion piece to “Oppenheimer” than an intriguing sidebar. When Ted Hall reminisces about how he sat alone in his room, disturbed, as his Los Alamos colleagues celebrated their team’s 1945 success, it’s hard not to remember those scenes of self-congratulation in “Oppenheimer” — but also to recall Nolan’s film as a better, bigger, bolder and more complex examination of all the nuance and contradiction associated with the dawn of the atomic age.

,Watching Movies Cillian Murphy Wears Three Vintage Hamiltons As J. Robert Oppenheimer In Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer',Radium is the least of his concerns in our watch-related movie of the week.,"A new film by Christopher Nolan is, more often than not, an event unto itself. His films always deliver for those of us who love the intersection of horology and cinema. In 2014, it was Interstellar and the Murph watch. In 2020, at the height of the pandemic, Nolan unleashed Tenet – and with it, a digital prop watch that re-imagined how time could be told. The one thing both watches have in common is that they come from the brand Hamilton – a company known for its involvement in the movie industry. The watches of Tenet and Interstellar were also conceived specifically for these Nolan films, which makes the association less of product placement and more a continuation of a certain filmmaking tradition of which Hamilton is very much a part.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvZGlua2VlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS13ZWFycy10aHJlZS12aW50YWdlLWhhbWlsdG9ucy1pbi1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbnMtb3BwZW5oZWltZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-05 19:57:04+00:00,"Who is Oppenheimer and why is Christopher Nolan, one of the biggest directors in Hollywood, making a movie about him?","Oppenheimer's life, work, and complicated legacy are dramatic enough for the big screen. But what can audiences learn from his story in 2023?","J. Robert Oppenheimer.
Even if that name doesn’t ring a bell, you almost certainly know who he is. Known as the father of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer is one of the most important figures of the 20th century––and now he’s the protagonist of one of the year’s biggest movies from Christopher Nolan, one of the biggest directors working today.
Considering Nolan’s filmography––dark superhero epics like “The Dark Knight,” cerebral, twist-filled blockbusters like “Inception”––it might seem odd that he’s tackling a film about Oppenheimer. But the life, work and legacy of the man are more than deserving of a jump to the big screen, says Gretchen Heefner, an associate professor of history at Northeastern University.
Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer is an IMAX®-shot epic thriller.
His leadership in the Manhattan Project, the top secret operation to develop the atomic bomb before the Nazis, that culminated in the creation of a world-altering weapon is notable enough. His post-World War II disgust in what he had created and fierce attempt to regulate nuclear weapons even more so. But according to Heefner, he was also just “an interesting character” who seems almost tailor-made for the movies.
“He was this really complicated, interesting figure,” Heefner says. “He flirted with communism for a while. He was known to be volatile, difficult to work with yet apparently a good manager when he was at [the Manhattan Project’s] Los Alamos [lab].”
Based on Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning biography “American Prometheus,” “Oppenheimer,” due to hit theaters on July 21, stars Cillian Murphy in the titular role and, based on trailers, appears to follow his early days, time on the Manhattan Project and the post-war period that destroyed his career.

Oppenheimer quickly acquired a reputation as a brilliant theoretical physicist who was pretty clumsy in a lab. He was also incredibly driven––sometimes to the point of obsession––and, as a result, prolific. Oppenheimer is mostly known for his contributions to theoretical astronomy, astrophysics, quantum field theory and, of course, nuclear physics
But Oppenheimer was also known as much for his personality as his publications.
Tall, lanky and constantly smoking a cigarette, Oppenheimer was in many ways a renaissance man. He could learn other languages incredibly fast and was often as knowledgeable and passionate about philosophy and art as he was physics.
He also was not afraid to show how knowledgeable he was. As a university student, he would dominate class discussions to the point that his classmates threatened to boycott their class, according to Bird and Sherwin. During his university years, Oppenheimer also struggled with depression that manifested in some violent behavior toward some of his closest friends.
Politically, Oppenheimer was a supporter of progressive causes and left-wing politics throughout his life. Although he never formally joined the Communist Party, in the 1930s he was an active supporter, financially and philosophically, of reforms and ideas that aligned with the party. During the Red Scare of the ’40s and ’50s, this would prove his undoing.
With a character like that at the center of his film, the focus of Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” is largely what has come to define the physicist’s legacy––the creation of the first atomic bomb––and his response to that legacy.

In October 1941, two months before the U.S. entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt officially signed off on the development of an atomic bomb. Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves (played by Matt Damon in the film) was eventually made director of the Manhattan Project, the name for the top secret project for developing the atomic bomb.
Groves chose Oppenheimer to lead the project’s secret weapons lab in New Mexico. Oppenheimer assembled a team of top tier physicists, some from the U.S. and others who had fled from Europe and Nazi Germany. For those involved in the project, there was a sense of urgency unlike anything else.
“They were like, ‘If Hitler gets it, it’s all over,’” Heefner says. “There was a sense of if your enemy has it, they’ll use it and then it’s over. Early on that was the preoccupation. It’s the ultimate weapon, so if you have it, you can threaten anything.”
In 1945, the hard work of countless Los Alamos Laboratory scientists culminated in the first nuclear explosion at a New Mexico site, codenamed “Trinity.” The Trinity nuclear test is one of the most important and iconic moments of the 20th century––so important that Nolan was adamant he needed to recreate the explosion practically, without computer generated imagery.
“We knew the world would not be the same,” Oppenheimer said of that moment in a 1965 televised interview.
He was right. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 helped end the war but also ushered in a nuclear arms race and Cold War.
He was capable of remorse and reflection. He understood that his actions had consequences and was working for a greater good more than ego. Gretchen Heefner, an associate professor of history at Northeastern University
In the same television interview, Oppenheimer says in the moment the Trinity test went off he was reminded of a quote from the Bhagavad Gita: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” It’s a quote that came to define his relationship with his creation for the rest of his life.
In response to the U.S. dropping its second bomb on Nagasaki, Oppenheimer hand-delivered a letter expressing his disgust to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson. For the rest of his life, the father of the atomic bomb would be one of the fiercest advocates for its regulation.
“Oppenheimer’s post-war life is that he was in part horrified by what he had done,” Heefner says. “He was still involved in the U.S. military and the Atomic Energy Commission, which was the organization set up to manage the bomb and manage nuclear materials. … But he also was an advocate for international control of atomic energy, which was not as pie in the sky as it sounds.”
Oppenheimer hoped an international arms regulation could avert what he saw as a potential arms race. He was right, in a sense. The Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb in 1949, prompting the U.S. to start developing the more powerful hydrogen bomb, or “super bomb,” against the recommendations of Oppenheimer and members of the AEC.
Against his wishes, Oppenheimer’s creation completely altered post-war life and politics. The ability for global powers to develop tools of mass destruction changed geopolitics forever and created a sense of paranoia and fear that pervaded culture for decades.
“It was clearly destabilizing in the fact that it creates a certain hierarchy of power,” Heefner says. “Who has it? Who has the umbrella that lets you stay secure? Who says, ‘We’ll share it with you?’ It created strange alliances.”
But Heefner says Oppenheimer’s post-war efforts were not totally in vain––nuclear weapons are “highly regulated”––but they did cost him almost everything.
“Oppenheimer was opposed to it, and because of that he became a political football,” Heefner says. “He also was a contentious personality, so he didn’t do any of this smoothly. He was charged with being disloyal, possibly being a communist or Soviet sympathizer, which in this time period was incredibly damaging.”
A brilliant mind on a meteoric rise, a scientific breakthrough with world-shattering implications and a fall from grace due to convictions that flew in the face of the political powers that be: Oppenheimer’s life is full of enough material for several movies. Heefner can only speculate about Nolan’s interest in this story, but she says even decades later Oppenheimer, flaws and all, is a reminder of what scientists and forward thinkers can do for––and to––the world.
“Oppenheimer was a scientist, a big thinker and deeply compassionate,” she adds. “He was capable of remorse and reflection. He understood that his actions had consequences and was working for a greater good more than ego.”

Christopher Nolan's latest cinematic spectacle, ""Oppenheimer,"" has finally made its way into theaters, three years after the British director's previous film, ""Tenet.""
The new movie is all about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the mastermind behind the atomic bomb, with Cillian Murphy playing the titular American scientist.
While most theaters around the world will be showing ""Oppenheimer"" — and ""Barbie"" — there has been some speculation about whether ""Oppenheimer"" will be shown in Japan because of its subject matter.
In August 1945, the United States used Oppenheimer's work to create a nuclear bomb to hit the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing over 200,000 people.

Will 'Oppenheimer' be in Japanese theaters?
Japan hasn't completely banned ""Oppenheimer"" from its theaters, but neither is there a release date for the movie in the country.
A Universal spokesperson told Variety in June that ""plans have not been finalized in all markets.""
This suggests that Japanese audiences won't be able to see Nolan's movie at the same time as the rest of the world, as Toho-Towa — the biggest Japanese distributor of Hollywood films — has yet to decide on its release plans, per Variety.
Thankfully, Japanese audiences will soon be able to see the other big movie of the summer, ""Barbie,"" which arrives in the country on August 11.

'Oppenheimer' is in theaters now
""Oppenheimer"" opens Friday in theaters across other countries, including the US and UK, where it will face off against ""Barbie"" at the box office.
Nolan recently confirmed that his own daughter, Flora, makes a cameo appearance as a girl whose face melts off during a dream sequence.
The director also told Insider that it was ""essential"" to film sex scenes for the first time in his career.

Example video title will go here for this video
OAK RIDGE, Tenn. — The highly anticipated film, ""Oppenheimer,"" opens on July 21 across the country.
Director Christopher Nolan tells the story of famed theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his work overseeing the Manhattan Project as director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico.
As the principal architect of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer also came to Oak Ridge. Back then, it was named ""The Secret City,"" and he had gone to oversee the work done there.
Oak Ridge historian Ray Smith shares stories of Oppenheimer's stay in the area at the ""Guest House"" at the time — the only hotel in town.
""Robert Oppenheimer was chosen by General Groves to lead the design for the atomic bomb,"" Ray said. ""He had a presence when he came into the room. He was very intelligent and didn't mind telling you if he knew more than you did.""
Not much is recorded about Oppenheimer's visits to the ""Secret City."" His brother, Frank Oppenheimer, is also a respected physicist and lived in the Oak Ridge area while working on the Calutron machines.
Mike Stallo, a history specialist with the Oak Ridge Public Library, says Robert was kept protected during his visits.
""He wasn't supposed to drive by himself, travel by air,"" Mike said. ""They were very protective of him.""
Oppenheimer's work was mainly done in Los Alamos, a place he had a personal connection to.
""When he was a young man, he became ill,"" said Ray. ""His father sent him to the area and later on, he had a ranch there. He said he loved combining his love for Los Alamos and his love of physics.""
The Christopher Nolan movie will explore his time in Los Alamos and his downfall after the war when he became an outspoken critic of the hydrogen bomb, which had the potential to be several times more deadly than the atomic bomb. In the early 1950s, during the McCarthy Era, the government revoked his security clearance effectively ending his career as a physicist.
""A lot of workers here were very supportive of him,"" Mike Stallo said. ""169 scientists signed a petition protesting his clearance being pulled. I think he wrote a letter thanking them.""
The AEC issued its decision on June 29, 1954, to revoke his security clearance. They cited ""fundamental defect of character"" and Communist associations ""far beyond the tolerable limits of prudence and self-restraint which are to be expected of one holding the high positions,"" according to the American Physical Society.
In December 2022 the Biden Administration reversed the decision to revoke Oppenheimer's security clearance, which Ray Smith said weighed heavily on him the rest of his life.
""As you see pictures of him through the years you can see the strain,"" Ray said. ""He was creating something that had never been done before. he was able to do that. He was under strain and stress when he went through the security clearance removed. I think what Oppenheimer did for the United States is admirable. The way he was mistreated is not.""
Today, Oppenheimer is remembered in Oak Ridge at the town's history center and at the Alexander Guest House, a senior living home that sits in the former hotel where the famed physicist was a guest.

2023-07-29 20:53:12+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’ and the TCU professor who helped build the bomb,"When I saw “Oppenheimer” last weekend, it reminded me of a story I had heard about a former TCU professor who had some involvement in the Manhattan Project.","When I saw “Oppenheimer” last weekend, it reminded me of a story I had heard about a former TCU professor who had some involvement in the Manhattan Project.
“Oppenheimer,” in case you haven’t seen it, tells the story of Robert Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project’s Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. He’s credited with developing the atomic bomb, and the Manhattan Project was the U.S. effort to build an atomic weapon during World War II.
The film brought in $82.5 million, behind “Barbie,” but quite an achievement for a three-hour movie about an event now nearly 80 years old.
I dashed off a quick note to TCU to see if my memory was on target and received a flood of information on Harrison Miller Moseley, former professor of physics.
It was Moseley who I recalled hearing about and who was involved in the Manhattan Project, though he didn’t speak about it until late in his life.
I spoke with Magnus Rittby, professor in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at TCU, who has been compiling a history of the physics department at the school.
Moseley (1922-2014) grew up in Fort Worth at the Masonic Home, a facility for widows and orphans, following the death of his father. He played on some of the school’s famed football teams and graduated valedictorian in 1938, earning a full ride to TCU. There he came under the tutelage of the chairman of the department, Newton Gaines, who probably deserves his own story as he recorded folk songs for Alan Lomax in the 1930s. At TCU, Moseley graduated the top of his class in 1943, then headed to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he worked with Nathan Rosen, a friend and fellow scientist with Albert Einstein.
Rosen and Einstein, together with another physicist, Boris Podolsky, in 1935 wrote one of the most famous papers in physics history, called “Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete.”
That paper’s impact continues, Rittby said.
“There was a Nobel Prize given in 2022 about some of the same issues raised in the paper, on quantum entanglement,” he said.
When Rosen was asked by Einstein to join the Manhattan Project at the Naval Research Laboratory, Rosen asked if he could bring his brightest student, Moseley. Moseley enlisted in the Navy and began working in the Naval Research Laboratory with Rosen on a process to produce the enriched uranium needed for the atomic bomb. Their process was called liquid-thermal diffusion.
“Unbelieveable: The Unmasking of Dr. Harrison Miller Moseley,” by Fort Worth author Stella Brooks. (Fort Worth Report| Bob Francis)
This approach to making enriched uranium was not originally favored, but it eventually proved to be the one that could produce the most material effectively. That is demonstrated in the film when Oppenheimer fills a fish bowl with marbles as the Manhattan Project grows its supply of enriched uranium. Without that enriched uranium, there would have been no bomb.
“He was at the very basic level of figuring out how they could get the necessary material for the first bomb. Which I think is pretty cool,” Rittby said.
While Moseley was doing serious work, he had a sense of humor, Rittby said. Rittby has some correspondence between Moseley and TCU’s then chairman, Gaines.
Moseley writes Gaines to advise him to to use a non-Navy mailing address since the guards are checking what goes in and out of the Navy Yard and that any physics writings would be suspect:
“Comic books, red apples, and second-hand submarines – these I could get away with. But should I start out with a sheet of solved problems in electricity I would no doubt be called in by Naval Intelligence for peddling A-Bomb secrets on the open market”.
While Moseley’s work on the Manhattan Project was not discussed much during his time at TCU, he did speak with Fort Worth author Stella Brooks about his life. She chronicled his life story in a book, Unbelievable: The Unmasking of Dr. Harrison Miller Moseley.
The book details Moseley’s remarkable life and offers an interesting peek behind the curtain at one of the most important scientific and technical achievements of the 20th century. All through the lens of a man who either led or was a member of the physics department at TCU for 40 years.
So if you go see “Oppenheimer,” when you see the scenes with the marbles in the fishbowl, just remember, a guy that taught at TCU for 40 years helped do that.

2023-07-21 16:14:22.801000+00:00,How Matt Damon went full Army for “Oppenheimer”,"“[It’s] that tension between the military and the science community,"" Damon said.","If Cillian Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer was the anti-hero of director Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves, portrayed by Matt Damon, is his equally controversial counterpart.
Tasked with staffing what would eventually become known as the Manhattan Project, Damon’s character is the dutiful Army servant given the dubious honor of presiding over a team of brilliant scientists who in no way conform to the military’s notions of hierarchy.
“The frustration [for] Groves — what he lived with as a military person — he suddenly finds himself in charge of a bunch of civilians who don’t really recognize the chain of command,” Damon told Military Times.
In a serious film about one of the most devastating weapons ever created, Damon manages to bring a bit of levity via the near-comical level of rigidity with which he portrays Groves.
“I would have played anything that Chris asked me to,” Damon said. “But Groves was really fun because I’d never quite had a role like that. Nobody liked him, which was really fun. And he didn’t care at all, he was just completely focused on what he was doing.”
Damon played off of Murphy’s character particularly well — creating a relationship between Groves and Oppenheimer that, despite tension, facilitates both individuals’ lofty aspirations to get ahead. Despite the arm’s length distance between the duo, the pairing ultimately results in a friendship based on mutual respect.
“They both appreciated each other — they helped each other fulfill each other’s ambitions,” Damon noted. “Each couldn’t have done it without the other. There was a lot of genuine affection there.”
Despite having vastly different backgrounds and personalities, both characters accomplish the unbelievable amid the constant push and pull between the military, which Groves represents, and the enterprising civilian so perfectly illustrated by Oppenheimer.
“[It’s] that tension between the military and the science community, just because the military is just completely obsessed with compartmentalization and secrecy,” Damon noted. “You’re talking about an existential threat to humankind, but the scientists are all about kind of keeping things open and learning from one another. They were philosophically totally opposed, and that led to this kind of natural tension between Groves and everybody else.”
Ultimately, in the film’s following of the development of the atomic bomb, Nolan, Damon noted, developed something more akin to a horror film or psychological thriller.
“I was terrified when I when I got to the last line of the script, and then seeing it in the film,” Damon said. “I’ve been kind of filled with dread.”
Artful anxiety is something that Damon attributes often to the genius of Nolan, who both wrote and directed the film.
“His movies do this really incredible thing where he’s always grappling with these big concepts, but they’re also very intimate,” Damon said. “He always wants to put interesting questions in front of his audience and let them ponder them, but at the same time, they’re not lectures or thought exercises. They’re very emotional movies and they’re very intimate and and so he’s always got these compelling characters.”
“Oppenheimer” is in theaters July 21.

,The threat is real: Our nuclear weapons are much more powerful than Oppenheimer's atomic bomb,"Nine countries now have nuclear weapons. After you see Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer,' demand our leaders work toward building a safer world.","Joan Rohlfing and James McKeon
Opinion contributors
Sure, it’s no ""Barbie,"" but Christopher Nolan’s ""Oppenheimer"" is the most highly anticipated film about nuclear weapons in decades.
With its impending release, we at the Nuclear Threat Initiative created a primer to set the scene and arm audiences with the most accurate information possible before you head to the theater to see the action yourself.
Which country has the most nuclear weapons?
""Oppenheimer"" is a historical film, but the threat posed by nuclear weapons is very real today. Nine countries now have nuclear weapons, with the United States and Russia possessing about 90% of the world’s nearly 13,000 weapons.
At the same time, China’s nuclear arsenal is rapidly increasing, potentially to 1,500 warheads by 2035 (Beijing currently has more than 400). Diplomatic relations between Washington and Moscow have plummeted. U.S.-China relations are at a historic low. Tensions between India and Pakistan – both nuclear-armed countries – and India and China continue to simmer. And North Korea’s nuclear program is advancing.
Unfortunately, public awareness of all these steadily increasing threats is very low, which is why many nuclear experts fear we could be sleepwalking into a nuclear disaster.
Today's nuclear weapons are much more powerful than Oppenheimer's nukes
J. Robert Oppenheimer played a critical role in developing the first nuclear weapons as part of the top-secret Manhattan Project. Two of those weapons were used against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, obliterating both cities and killing hundreds of thousands of people.
Who was J. Robert Oppenheimer?What to know about atomic bomb physicist's life, career, death
Oppenheimer was shaken by the destruction brought by the weapons and the potential for them to inflict even greater destruction in the future. After seeing the first-ever nuclear detonation in New Mexico on July 16, 1945, he reflected that he “knew the world would not be the same” and then recited a line from Hindu scripture: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”
A few years after the end of World War II, Oppenheimer opposed the U.S. government’s plan to develop even larger nuclear weapons called hydrogen bombs, which were created anyway. Today, these kinds of weapons still exist in modern arsenals that include nuclear weapons 80 times more powerful compared with the bomb detonated over Hiroshima, and they have more accurate and survivable delivery systems (missiles, not just bombers) that can fly faster than the speed of sound.
Russia has plans to deploy even more powerful nuclear weapons soon. Oppenheimer and his colleagues predicted that a strategy of nuclear competition would cause an arms race, and he was right.
US shouldn't send Ukraine cluster bombs:Biden is wrong to send cluster bombs to Ukraine. 50 years later, they're still killing in Laos.
No such thing as 'small scale': Nuclear war would impact the entire world
You might be tempted to think you would be safe if nuclear weapons were used halfway across the globe from your location. Sure, you would be able to avoid the immediate blast effects, but you would experience the after-effects. There is significant evidence that the entire globe could be impacted by even a small-scale nuclear war.
For example, one study assessed the global effects of a “limited” nuclear war between India and Pakistan, revealing that the fires produced in the conflict would send so much soot into the atmosphere that the sun’s rays would be diminished for years. This would result in reduced global temperatures, which in turn would cause widespread crop failures and worldwide famine, potentially affecting billions of people.
For many decades, scientists have been warning about this phenomenon, often referred to as “nuclear autumn” or “nuclear winter.”
No, Christopher Nolan did not detonate a nuclear weapon for 'Oppenheimer'
Even the best in Hollywood wouldn’t have the scientific and technical capabilities to develop, let alone detonate, a real nuclear weapon. But even if they somehow did, it would be illegal.
In 1963, President John F. Kennedy signed an agreement to ban aboveground and underwater nuclear tests as part of an effort to prevent additional countries from developing nuclear weapons. That agreement is still in effect.
The United States is also a signatory to a global test ban treaty that, once in full effect, would ban all nuclear explosions anywhere on earth.
So, no, director Nolan did not detonate a real nuclear weapon in the making of ""Oppenheimer."" He did not use computer-generated images, either. Instead, he simulated a nuclear explosion using conventional explosives.
There are many reasons to be grateful that a real nuclear weapon couldn’t be used for the film. Victims of nuclear testing in New Mexico and in native communities across the Southwest and U.S. island territories are still seeking compensation for the very real harm caused by the lasting effects of the Manhattan Project and nuclear testing.
When will Ukraine join NATO?Russian military fortifications may hold the answer.
It is possible to eliminate nuclear weapons once and for all
In a recent interview with Wired, Nolan stated that those lucky enough to preview his film have been left “devastated” and that the film is almost part of the “horror” genre.
While progress on nuclear disarmament has stalled, the world has made significant gains in reducing global stockpiles of nuclear weapons. At their peak, the United States and Russia (then the Soviet Union) had more than 60,000 nuclear weapons between them. Today, they have about 11,000.
Obviously, that’s a huge reduction. But we have a long way to go. From Oppenheimer to Barack Obama to Henry Kissinger, politicians and experts from all political persuasions have been convinced that we should fully eliminate nuclear weapons and the threat they pose to humanity.
Today, we have the capability to monitor and control nuclear weapons technologies that didn’t yet exist in Oppenheimer’s time. It’s now possible to create the international control system that Oppenheimer and others advocated for in 1945.
The first step to elimination is raising public awareness about nuclear threats. We hope that’s exactly what ""Oppenheimer"" will do, and we call on those motivated to speak out after seeing the film to demand that our leaders work toward building a safer, nuclear weapons-free world – now and for future generations.

,How Lewis Strauss Orchestrated Robert Oppenheimer’s Downfall,Amateur physicist Lewis Strauss spurred the hydrogen bomb’s development—and became Robert Oppenheimer's nemesis.,"A Wall Street financier who skipped college to sell shoes, Lewis Strauss became one of America's most important atomic-energy advisers during the Cold War. He also became known for his role in the dramatic downfall of the A-bomb's chief developer, physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer.
Strauss took an unlikely path to his perch as atomic policy czar. Born into a horse-and-buggy world in 1896, he first developed an interest in physics as a boy when he used a vibrating tuning fork to make waves in a bowl of mercury while waiting for a dentist to repair his tooth. He devoured books on radiation and wave mechanics in high school, but his dreams of studying physics in college after graduation yielded to the reality of his father’s struggling footwear business.
Instead of toting textbooks, Strauss lugged trunks of shoe samples across the Southeast as a traveling salesman until he volunteered to help with World War I relief efforts spearheaded by Herbert Hoover. “It was clear that to have a hand in feeding the hungry and clothing the naked in Belgium and northern France was to have a hand in history,” Strauss recalled. Strauss so impressed Hoover that he became the future president’s personal secretary before joining a New York investment banking firm in 1919 and eventually earning more than $1 million a year.
After both his parents died of cancer, Strauss established a fund that financed the use of radium as a treatment. That philanthropic work deepened his relationships with physicists working on discovery of nuclear fission. After working administrative jobs with the U.S. Navy during World War II, Strauss emerged at the forefront of America’s Cold War nuclear program.
History Shorts: How the Atomic Bomb Was Used in WWII
Strauss Champions U.S. Hydrogen Bomb Development
In 1946, President Harry S. Truman appointed Strauss as one of the first five commissioners of the newly established Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which assumed control of the U.S. nuclear program from the Manhattan Project, the top-secret wartime research and development team that built America’s first atomic bomb. Strauss urged the Pentagon to establish an atmospheric monitoring system, which successfully detected the Soviet Union’s own first atomic bomb test within days of its detonation in August 1949.
With the United States no longer the world’s sole nuclear superpower, Strauss vigorously supported a massive program to develop a thermonuclear “super bomb” that would be 1,000 times more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. “The time has now come for a quantum jump in our planning,” he wrote. “I am thinking of a commitment in talent and money comparable, if necessary, to that which produced the first atomic weapon. That is the way to stay ahead.”
Strauss found his support for a hydrogen bomb doggedly opposed by physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the chairman of the AEC’s general advisory committee who led the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Fearing the hydrogen bomb would only accelerate a dangerous Cold War arms race, Oppenheimer also argued for more openness about the size and capabilities of America’s nuclear arsenal, which Strauss thought would only benefit the Soviets.
Strauss successfully lobbied Truman, who publicly announced his decision to develop the hydrogen bomb on January 31, 1950. Less than three years later, the U.S. detonated the world’s first H-bomb, only to have the Soviets follow suit 10 months later.
After leaving the AEC in 1950, Strauss re-entered government when newly elected President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him as an atomic energy adviser in February 1953. Strauss, who had been a major donor to Eisenhower’s presidential campaign, wielded considerable power as all federal agencies were required to clear their atomic-related activities with him. Months later, Eisenhower asked Strauss to chair the AEC. Strauss agreed on one condition—that Oppenheimer no longer serve as a consultant to the commission.
Strauss Orchestrates Oppenheimer’s Blacklisting
After Strauss appointed Oppenheimer as director of the Institute for Advanced Study in 1947, the relationship had quickly frayed. Oppenheimer perceived Strauss as a meddler and mocked the amateur physicist’s opposition to exporting radioisotopes for medical purposes at a U.S. Senate hearing, leaving Strauss flush with rage. “There was a look of hatred there that you don’t see very often in a man’s face,” AEC chairman David Lilienthal recalled.
The thin-skinned Strauss didn’t forget slights easily. “He has more elbows than an octopus,” noted a colleague. Within days of being sworn in as AEC chairman, Strauss directed the removal of classified documents from Oppenheimer’s office, and he was determined to prove that the “father of the atomic bomb” was no longer a national hero—but a national security threat.
Amid the anti-communist hysteria of the Second Red Scare and the hearings of Senator Joseph McCarthy to expose suspected communists in the federal government, Strauss questioned Oppenheimer’s patriotism. Although he never officially joined the Communist Party, Oppenheimer had been drawn to left-wing political causes and had close friends and family who had been party members at various times. Strauss believed the physicist may have opposed the hydrogen bomb and concealed Soviet attempts to infiltrate the Manhattan Project because he was a foreign agent.
According to Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin's American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, Strauss used his media contacts to print defamatory stories about Oppenheimer. After he pressed J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to monitor the physicist, the agency tracked Oppenheimer and illegally tapped his telephone. And having gained Eisenhower’s ear, Strauss sowed doubts about whether Oppenheimer could be trusted; a letter written by one of Strauss’ close confidants made its way to the president, declaring “more probably than not J. Robert Oppenheimer is an agent of the Soviet Union.”
In December 1953, Strauss informed Oppenheimer that his security clearance had been stripped, but the physicist appealed the decision to a three-member panel that launched a month-long hearing in April 1954. After a one-sided proceeding in which Oppenheimer’s lawyers were blocked from accessing confidential material, the panel acknowledged he was a loyal citizen but voted 2 to 1 to revoke his security clearance.
The decision left Oppenheimer’s reputation in tatters. “He was a man of peace, and they destroyed him. He was a man of science, and they destroyed this man,” lamented close friend and fellow physicist Isidor Isaac Rabi.
Five years later, Strauss paid a price for Oppenheimer’s blacklisting. When Eisenhower appointed Strauss as U.S. secretary of commerce, the Senate rejected his nomination after a bitter confirmation hearing in which his treatment of Oppenheimer played a critical role. Strauss was only the eighth Cabinet nominee in U.S. history—and the only one between 1925 and 1989—who failed to win confirmation. Following the defeat, Strauss focused on philanthropic ventures until his death in 1974.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhpc3RvcnkuY29tL25ld3MvbGV3aXMtc3RyYXVzcy1udWNsZWFyLXByb2dyYW0tb3BwZW5oZWltZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-28 22:00:00+00:00,The True Story of Lewis Strauss' Rivalry With J. Robert Oppenheimer,Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' features Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss  Here's what to know about Strauss' career and feud with J. Robert Oppenheimer.,"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, the three-hour epic chronicling the invention of the nuclear bomb and its aftermath, features a virtuosic performance from Cillian Murphy and focuses largely on his titular scientist as he grapples with the ramifications of his own hubris. Supporting Murphy is an all-star cast of actors portraying real-life figures from that time period, including Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife Kitty, Florence Pugh as his lover Jean Tatlock, and Gary Oldman as U.S. President Harry Truman.
Especially pivotal to the film's third act is former MCU star Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, a member of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and an increasingly antagonistic party in the security hearings that ultimately result in Oppenheimer's clearance being revoked.
As the film tells it, Strauss is initially driven by professional jealousy and resentment towards Oppenheimer, as well as a degree of perceived humiliation: he believes Oppenheimer ""badmouthed"" him to renowned physicist Albert Einstein (Tom Conti).
And while some of the enmity between the two men may be narrativized and played for dramatic effect, the details of Strauss' vendetta against Oppenheimer are based in well-documented facts.

Who was Lewis Strauss?
As a founding member of the AEC, Strauss played an instrumental role in the development of nuclear weapons and energy in the United States during the Cold War. However, while Strauss was a supporter of research into the creation of the hydrogen bomb, which J. Robert Oppenheimer vehemently opposed due to his own guilt following the destruction at Hiroshima.
Strauss' grudge against J. Robert Oppenheimer is believed to have worsened in 1947, when the physicist was offered a job as director at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study—a position for which Strauss had momentarily been considered. He also disliked Oppenheimer on personal and political grounds: Oppenheimer was a liberal who associated with Communists and spoke seldom of his Jewish heritage, while Strauss was a Republican, sat on the American Jewish Committee, and had attempted (unsuccessfully) to influence U.S. policy to increase the number of refugees allowed into the country during the Holocaust.
These resentments culminated in Strauss arranging for Oppenheimer to be stripped of his security clearance following the 1954 hearings—just one day before they had been due to expire, seemingly confirming that his primary intention had been to humiliate and discredit Oppenheimer.
In an interview with Vulture prior to the release of Oppenheimer, Downey shared his thoughts on Strauss and offered an alternative take on the man, who is presented in stark antagonism to Murphy's Oppenheimer.
""I had a previous fair understanding of Strauss because I was fascinated with the mechanics of warfare, particularly in the Pacific theater in World War II,"" he said. ""I challenged a little bit the Mozart-Salieri of it all. I said, I’m not sure in some ways that Strauss isn’t a bit the hero here, which kind of raised an eyebrow on Chris [Nolan]. I half-jokingly challenged him on whether Admiral Strauss hadn’t done everything that any patriotic American would’ve done. And he said, Well, this will be a wonderful ongoing dialogue.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNoZWFsdGguY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYTQ0NjYxODU3L2xld2lzLXN0cmF1c3Mtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItcml2YWxyeS10cnVlLXN0b3J5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Oppenheimer viewers notice Josh Peck pulling his iconic 'Megan' face from Drake & Josh,Fans of the hit Nickelodeon sitcom noticed a very familiar expression courtesy of Josh Peck.,"Josh Peck's facial expressions in Oppenheimer has gone viral because it's reminding fans of his iconic 'Megan face' from Drake & Josh.
The former Disney star, 36, rose to fame starring in the hit teen sitcom Drake & Josh from 2004 to 2007.
One of the long-running jokes in the Nickelodeon sitcom revolved around the cheeky character named Megan (played by iCarly star Miranda Cosgrove) who was always pulling pranks on her brothers.

Josh's expression became a meme over the years and eagle-eyed cinemagoers who watched Oppenheimer at the weekend, in which Peck stars as Kenneth Bainbridge, has gone viral once again.
In one scene featured in Christopher Nolan's acclaimed new film, Peck does an expression which has reminded Nickelodeon fans of his 'Megan Face'.

2023-07-12 11:23:29.599000-04:00,Which Supporting Characters in Oppenheimer Will Die of Radiation Poisoning?,"Let’s go one by one down the 70-person cast list of Christopher Nolan’s ‘Oppenheimer,’ from Cillian Murphy through Florence Pugh’s Jean Tatlock, until we find the most likely suspects.","Boom. Photo: Universal Pictures
It is a truth universally acknowledged that, if you’re going to make a movie about nuclear physicists, one of them must eventually fall victim to a lab accident that causes them to die an excruciating death by radiation poisoning. If in the course of this accident, they heroically sacrifice themselves to save their fellow scientists, all the better.
However, standing between Christopher Nolan’s upcoming Oppenheimer and the obligatory radiation-poisoning death scene is the same historical fact that has bedeviled all other depictions of the Manhattan Project: The only two such occurrences at Los Alamos, the tragic deaths of Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin, happened after the bomb had already been dropped.
This will not do. How else can a filmmaker represent the terrible dawn of the atomic age than by showing the devastating effects of radiation on a single American scientist? (Before you say, “What about the hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians?,” sorry, that’s not allowed.)
The 1989 movie Fat Man and Little Boy got around this issue by killing off a fictional character, John Cusack’s Michael Merriman, who was loosely based on Slotin. Could Oppenheimer do the same? Let’s go down the 70-person cast list one by one, crossing off the people who canonically did not die of radiation poisoning, until we find the most likely suspects.

J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy)
We’ll start with the easy ones. Since Oppenheimer also delves into what happened to Robert Oppenheimer after the war, we know Nolan is not going to invent a fictional death for him. A lifelong smoker, the real Oppenheimer died of throat cancer in 1967 at age 62.
Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt)
After her husband’s death, Kitty started dating his old colleague Robert Serber, who’d recently lost his wife. In 1972 they bought a sailboat and set off on a trip through the Panama Canal and across the Pacific. However, they only got as far as Panama, where Kitty died of an embolism in a U.S. Army hospital.
Frank Oppenheimer (Dylan Arnold)
Robert Oppenheimer’s little brother also worked on the Manhattan Project, but as tragic as it would be for him to perish in the name of science, he lived to age 72.
Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), Roger Robb (Jason Clarke), Gordon Gray (Tony Goldwyn), Thomas Morgan (Kurt Koehler), Ward Evans (John Gowans), Lloyd Garrison (Macon Blair), Senator McGee (Harry Groener), Chairman Magnuson (Gregory Jbara), Senator Bartlett (Tim King), Senator Pastore (Tim DeKay), Senator Scott (Steven Houska), William Borden (David Dastmalchian), Joe Volpe (Michael Andrew Baker), and Kenneth Nichols (Dane DeHaan)
﻿You see Jason Clarke’s name in a cast list, you naturally assume he’s either going to get cucked, or he’s going to die. (Or sometimes both!) But these all appear to be characters from Robert Oppenheimer’s security-clearance hearings in 1954, which ipso facto means they will not die in a terrible nuclear accident ten years earlier.

Patrick Blackett (James D’Arcy), Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), Isidor Rabi (David Krumholtz), Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), Hartlan Snyder (Rory Keane), Kurt Gödel (James Urbaniak), and Leo Szilard (Máté Haumann)
All of these people are real scientists who crossed paths with Robert Oppenheimer, sometimes as mentors, sometimes as friends. They survived the war without being killed by rogue masses of plutonium.
Tom Conti as Albert Einstein. Photo: Universal Pictures
Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), Harry Truman (Gary Oldman), and Lyndon Johnson (Hap Lawrence)
Similarly, I do not think Oppenheimer is going to invent fictional deaths for these famous historical figures.
Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer)
During World War II, U.S. intelligence reportedly considered assassinating the Nobel laureate if they learned he was helping Germany produce an atomic bomb. He wasn’t, so they didn’t, and he lived until 1976.
Leslie Groves (Matt Damon)
Listen, it would be hilarious for Damon to be killed in yet another Christopher Nolan film. But Groves, the general who directed the Manhattan Project, didn’t die until 1970.

Did you think Dunkirk had a lot of young actors who were impossible to tell apart? Welcome to Oppenheimer’s squadron of nerdy young hunks, all of whom are playing real Los Alamos scientists who made it through the war.
Klaus Fuchs (Christopher Denham)
On the TV series Manhattan, Denham played a fictional scientist at Los Alamos who turned out to be spying for the Soviets. In Oppenheimer, he’s playing the real-life scientist who turned out to be spying for the Soviets. The guy knows his type. Anyway, Fuchs was caught, sent to prison, then moved to East Germany, where he died the year before the Wall fell.
Rossi Lomanitz (Josh Zuckerman)
Lomanitz was denied a spot at Los Alamos due to his membership in the Communist Party. He wound up fighting in the Pacific Theater, but survived, dying of cancer in 2002.
Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh)
Oppenheimer’s Communist ex was found dead in her apartment in 1944. Was her death a suicide, as the official story goes, or was she murdered? The authors of American Prometheus, the book Oppenheimer is based on, admit that much of the evidence is consistent with suicide, but they also quote a doctor who says, “If you were clever and wanted to kill someone, this is the way to do it.” Anyway, there’s enough drama to Jean’s story without making nuclear physics the culprit.
Jackie Oppenheimer (Emma Dumont), Mary Washburn (Sadie Stratton), Haakon Chevalier (Jefferson Hall), Barbara Chevalier (Britt Kyle), and George Eltenton (Guy Burnet)
Jackie was Frank’s wife and Robert’s sister-in-law. She and everyone else in this section were Communists who crossed paths with Oppenheimer without dying of radiation poisoning.
Richard Tolman (Tom Jenkins) and Vannevar Bush (Matthew Modine)
Science bigwigs! Much too important to be doing hands-on research with radioactive elements until the fateful moment their hand slips, just for an instant …
Ruth Tolman (Louise Lombard)
Richard Tolman’s wife, who allegedly had an affair with Oppenheimer. She died in 1957, for reasons unrelated to the development of the atom bomb.
Lili Hornig (Olivia Thirlby)
The rare woman working for the Manhattan Project. Hornig died in November 2017 at age 96, meaning she theoretically lived long enough to see Dunkirk in theaters.
Charlotte Serber (Jessica Erin Martin)
The librarian at Los Alamos; Serber died by suicide in 1967.
J. Ernest Wilkins (Ronald Auguste)
A Black nuclear physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project, though not at Los Alamos. He lived until 2011, and Oppenheimer wouldn’t dare put him in New Mexico just to kill him off.
David Hill (Rami Malek)
I gotta be honest, when I began this project, I thought Malek was going to be the one to bite it for sure. A name like “David Hill”? That sounds like a fictional character. And can’t you just see Malek’s eyes go wide (or wider) in panic when he realizes he’s doomed? But no — Hill was a real guy too, who lived to 89.

Lyall Johnson (Jack Cutmore-Scott), Boris Pash (Casey Affleck), Henry Stimson (James Remar), George C. Marshall (Will Roberts), James Byrnes (Pat Skipper), and James Conant (Steve Coulter)
U.S. government employees of varying ranks: Johnson was a lowly security officer; Marshall was secretary of state. What they all have in common is that none of them died of radiation poisoning.
With them, we’ve come to the end of all the named characters in the Oppenheimer credits, all of whose deaths are accounted for. Could it be that Oppenheimer will somehow not include the obligatory movie scene of a scientist dying in a lab accident? Perhaps! However, the movie’s credits also include a handful of characters who lack proper names. Let’s run through them quickly to see if any of them are candidates.
Senate Aide (Alden Ehrenreich), Counsel (Scott Grimes), and Congressman (Jeff Hephner)
These guys also seem like they come from the 1950s scenes. They’re safe! (Sidenote: Five years ago, Ehrenreich was the future of Star Wars. Now he’s playing an unnamed character in the framing device of a Christopher Nolan film. Time moves fast in Hollywood.)
Dutch Student (Petrie Willink)
He’s listed in the section with people Oppenheimer met as a young man traveling Europe, so I think he’s probably safe as well.
AAF Officer (Jeremy John Wells), Weatherman (Sean Avery), Army Captain (Adam Kroeger), Soldier (Drew Kenney), and AAF Officer 2 (Bryce Johnson)
Every World War II movie needs guys like this. I don’t expect any of them will have the screen time to die in a nuclear accident.
Burn Victim (Flora Nolan)
A possibility from the name alone, until you realize she’s being played by Nolan’s college-age daughter.
Laughing Woman (Kerry Westcott), Kissing Woman (Christina Hogue), Kissing Man (Clay Bunker), Weeping Man (Tyler Bearsley), and Consoling Woman (Maria Teresa Zuppetta)
I like to imagine these characters will all appear together in the summer’s weirdest sex scene.
Presidential Aide (Kate French)

Concerned Scientist (Brett Delbuono)
If Oppenheimer is going to make a supporting character die of radiation poisoning, it all comes down to this guy.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvd2hpY2gtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY2hhcmFjdGVycy1kaWUtb2YtcmFkaWF0aW9uLXBvaXNvbmluZy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,The Atomic Bomb’s First Victims Were in New Mexico,"The Manhattan Project’s Trinity test—the first atomic bomb detonation—led to infant deaths, cancer and decades of health problems.","On July 16, 1945, J. Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project scientists detonated an atomic bomb for the first time ever at the Trinity test site in New Mexico. The explosion took place more than 200 miles away from the Los Alamos Laboratory where they’d built the weapon. But the testing site, located in the Tularosa Basin, was not an isolated area. Nearly half a million people, many of them Hispanos and Native Americans, lived within a 150-mile radius of the detonation—some only 12 miles away. These people and others downwind of the blast became the first victims of nuclear fallout.
Many of them heard (and felt) the Trinity explosion around 5:30 that morning, and saw the bright blast it created in the sky. Some had direct contact with the fallout material. One witness at a summer camp in Ruidoso, New Mexico, later told Vice that she and other girls played in falling white debris like it was snow, catching it on their tongues and rubbing it on their faces. Others came into contact with the fallout through their environment as the radioactive debris infected the surrounding water, crops, livestock and land.
The U.S. government, keen on avoiding panic and maintaining the project’s high level of wartime secrecy, told Tularosa Basin residents that the blast they’d seen was simply an accidental explosion of ammunition and pyrotechnics. Officials chose not to evacuate the area, nor to warn residents of potential health effects. Yet even after the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki a few weeks later—killing an estimated 110,000 to 210,000 people and effectively ending the war—government officials still failed to inform Tularosa Basin residents about the potential effects of the blast. When asked directly about the detonation’s health risk, they denied any potential hazard.
Atomic Bomb History
US Officials Ignored Infant Deaths
One of the most immediate health impacts of the Trinity test was a spike in infant deaths. In 1947, an alarmed health care provider in Roswell named Kathryn S. Behnke wrote to Stafford Warren, who was responsible for radiation safety during the Manhattan Project, to ask him if these deaths had any connection to the Trinity test.
“As I recall, in August 1945, the month after the first bomb was tested in New Mexico, there were about 35 infant deaths here,” Behnke wrote in her letter to Warren, according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. “I understand the rate at Alamogordo, nearer the site of the test, was even higher than Roswell.”
At the time, scientists understood that exposure to nuclear radiation could lead to tumors, cancers and other negative health effects. In fact, five days after the Trinity test, Warren had told Manhattan Project leader General Leslie Groves that the nuclear fallout from the test represented “a very serious hazard” over a 2,700-square-mile area downwind of the Trinity site.
Despite Warren’s knowledge that the fallout represented a huge health risk, his assistant wrote back to Behnke that he hadn’t heard about an increase in infant mortality, but in any case “wanted to assure you that the safety and health of the people at large is not in any way endangered.”
Trinity Test Created an Ongoing Health Crisis
Over the next several decades, people who lived through the blast began to develop cancer, heart disease and other health problems. People born after the blast developed these problems, too. This occurred not only because the radioactive fallout from Trinity stuck around in the environment; other factors included local uranium mining (uranium is a key component of the A-bomb’s construction) and migrating fallout from nuclear tests in Nevada starting in the 1950s.
People who lived near Trinity and other nuclear test sites began to identify themselves as “downwinders,” and made connections between their communities’ health problems and the government’s nuclear tests. In 1990, the United States passed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act to provide money to some downwinders of the Nevada test site near Las Vegas. However, the act doesn’t provide any compensation or apology to the downwinders of the Trinity test site.
In 2005, Tina Cordova co-founded the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium to draw attention to the region’s radiation exposure and demand government action. The organization promotes amendments to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act that would include New Mexico downwinders and other people with nuclear radiation exposure.
The 1990 act “is an admission on the part of our government of the harm that they did to other downwinders,” says Cordova, who was born in Tularosa in 1959 and is a cancer survivor. “The problem is, the program doesn’t go far enough because it left out the first people ever exposed to radiation from a bomb, which are the people of New Mexico.”
In a 2010 report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that exposure rates from the Trinity test “were measured at levels 10,000 times higher than currently allowed.” The first nuclear detonation caused an ongoing health crisis for which New Mexico’s downwinders are still demanding an apology and compensation.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhpc3RvcnkuY29tL25ld3MvYXRvbWljLWJvbWItdGVzdC12aWN0aW1zLW5ldy1tZXhpY28tZG93bndpbmRlcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

This article is adapted from “Unleashing Oppenheimer: Inside Christopher Nolan’s Explosive Atomic-Age Thriller,” which will be published Oct. 10 by Insight Editions. LOS ALAMOS, N.M. — The drive to Los Alamos from the valley below feels treacherous, even now. J. Robert Oppenheimer chose this intensely remote location in northern New Mexico for the Manhattan Project, the U.S. government’s secret program to build an atomic bomb during World War II, precisely because it is situated on a maze of four mesas separated by deep canyons. It’s nearly impossible to find, and impenetrable if someone did locate it. Where better to save Western civilization than a mountainous high desert plateau, 7,200 feet above sea level, that looks like it’s straight out of a John Ford western?
Just as in 1943, the main entrance to town is a narrow highway that twists and turns atop cliffs of volcanic rock. The only difference now is that it’s paved. And it was up that “tricky road,” as he calls it, that Christopher Nolan found himself driving in June 2021, on a road trip from Los Angeles with his then-13-year-old son Magnus. By then, the director, known for critically acclaimed blockbusters such as “Inception” and “Dunkirk,” had already spent months writing the script for his own secret project on the man known as the father of the atomic bomb — an adaptation of Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, “American Prometheus” — and had hit a creative block. So, he’d decided to make a pilgrimage to the town that Oppenheimer (and the U.S. military) built.

“I was ready to look at it and sort of stand there and see what it felt like,” says Nolan. When they arrived, Nolan and son acted as a two-man location scouting crew. They first stopped at a reproduction of the Manhattan Project main gate that had once prevented unauthorized visitors from entering “the Hill,” as locals call the town. It’s now part of the Manhattan Project National Historical Park and is in nearly the same place that the original main gate once stood. As they explored the area, they also found a small museum located in Fuller Lodge, the great manor house in the center of town, the walls of which were constructed from nearly 800 gigantic ponderosa pine logs.
Oppenheimer had first seen the lodge in 1922 on his first trip to New Mexico, when his father sent him from New York to the Southwest as part of his recovery from a bout of colitis, a condition that would plague him for the rest of his life. It was home to a ranch school for boys that the Manhattan Project would commandeer decades later.
Nolan and Magnus took a tour of Bathtub Row, the series of simple houses where the top-level Manhattan Project scientists lived — another remnant of the ranch school, so named because they were the only dwellings in town with bathtubs (although they lacked kitchens at first). Most of these dwellings are off-limits to visitors because homeowners live there now, but Oppenheimer’s house was unoccupied. “I don’t know if I should say this or not, but Magnus, he did a lookout while I hopped the fence and got some pictures of Oppenheimer’s house,” the director says.
Nolan returned to Los Angeles full of inspiration and dove back into the script. But he’d also been left with a vexing problem. If he wanted to film the town as it had existed in the 1940s, completely forgoing the ubiquitous modern filmmaking tricks of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and green screen, he’d have to emulate the very project he was writing about. He’d have to go out to a remote desert somewhere and build it himself.
“For me, there’s this ‘keyman’ question that hangs over the life of Oppenheimer, which is that no one person invented the atomic bomb,” says Nolan. “He wasn’t the first to split the atom. He wasn’t the first to have a self-sustaining chain reaction. But somehow, he’s the guy who brought it all together and made it happen in the moment that it happened.”
Specifically, though, the physicist made it happen in a place that was a favorite childhood haunt of his, where he had fond memories of riding on horseback.
“Reading the book, you realize that, when they’re looking for a site [for the Manhattan Project], he just gently steers it toward where he spent the summers as a kid,” says Nolan. “As a young man, he said that if he could find a way to combine physics and New Mexico, he could achieve complete happiness. Well, he did and he was — for a time. And his personality was so influential that the leading laboratory in the world still stands in a place where he just liked to vacation.”
That one character detail was enough to help Nolan envision the world he might be able to create on-screen, as told through Oppenheimer’s eyes: one of sweeping desert vistas combined with an array of abstract special effects, again created without CGI, to illustrate an interior life of quantum physics and atoms and molecules. “That contrast is wonderfully cinematic,” says Nolan, who then set out to craft a story that he describes as part hero’s journey, part heist film and part courtroom drama, set against the imagery of a western — all presented in very Nolan-esque, nonlinear fashion.
The director knew he wanted to explore Oppenheimer’s rise to prominence — as well as his humiliating trial after the war, which resulted in the revocation of his security clearance due to his associations with communists. The part he was calling the “heist” section depicts the mad scramble for the world’s most brilliant minds to pull off the impossible project of building an atomic bomb before Adolf Hitler did.
Nolan and Emma Thomas — his producing partner on every film since 1998’s “Following” and also his wife — had started assembling their production team in September 2021. By the end of the month, production designer Ruth De Jong (Jordan Peele’s “Nope,” TV’s “Yellowstone”) was at Nolan’s house, hunkering down with the director one-on-one while he was editing the script, eventually creating a handmade foamcore diorama, or “white model,” of their 1940s Los Alamos set that was so big it could only fit in Nolan’s backyard.
Researcher Lauren Sandoval joined them, scouring the 180-page script looking for every historical discrepancy, as well as creating files to be used as casting references for 79 named characters, all but one of whom existed in real life. As prep and production ramped up, she’d find photo references of the actual bomb, or architectural plans for the steel tower at the Trinity test site near White Sands National Park in southern New Mexico where the first detonation occurred.
Meanwhile, Cillian Murphy was already preparing for the mammoth title role, his sixth collaboration with Nolan but the first in which he’d play the lead. For starters, he’d have to drop substantial weight to better approximate Oppenheimer’s almost emaciated silhouette. And he’d have to brush up on his horseback-riding skills for a scene in which Oppenheimer and his wife, Kitty (played by Emily Blunt), race horses across the desert. Blunt had just shot a TV western, “The English,” while Murphy jokes that, on his TV show “Peaky Blinders,” the horses rarely went faster than a walk. “Brilliant thing is that, in the story, Kitty was fantastic at horseback, apparently better than Robert, so it worked out,” says Murphy. “Emily was so graceful and elegant, and I was less so.”
They had just three months to get ready for a film that would shoot in just 57 days and run three hours, Nolan’s longest yet. “We’re not like other big films that prep for months and months and months,” says executive producer Thomas Hayslip. “Chris is of the mind that he and the crew need 12 weeks of prep and we’ll get it done in 12 weeks, and any more than that is just a waste of time.”

Ever since that first road trip, Nolan had been convinced that it would be impossible to shoot entirely in Los Alamos. “When I was there with Magnus, I saw how many things had changed, obviously, since the 1940s,” says Nolan. “I mean, there’s a Starbucks.”
The offending Starbucks is on what would have been Los Alamos’s main street, once a Wild West-style thoroughfare. Beyond Bathtub Row and the well-preserved Fuller Lodge, which Manhattan Project scientists used as a cafeteria, very little has been preserved from when Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves (played by Matt Damon in the film) and Oppenheimer took over the town.
After location scouting throughout the Southwest, Nolan and his crew built the town on a completely untouched section of Ghost Ranch, an educational and spiritual retreat about an hour and a half north of Santa Fe, made famous by the painter Georgia O’Keeffe. There, they found exactly what they wanted for their Los Alamos: a plateau on a ledge high above the desert with nothing else around.
“When I brought Chris there, he said, ‘This is very epic,’” De Jong recalls. “You felt like, ‘No one will find you here.’ There’s no one. The rest of the world is happening and going on, and we’re doing this thing that we think will save humanity.”
As the company began gathering in New Mexico to start filming at Ghost Ranch on Feb. 28, 2022, the paint was barely dry on the reconstructed town of Los Alamos. Construction had taken place in the dead of the high-desert winter, with the crew losing days of work because the ground was too frozen to dig into, or because snowfall had blocked the roads. Because of time constraints, the production team would have only six scheduled days at this $3 million set they’d spent three months building.
“Nobody is ever, ever, ever going to convince me that this would be better if shot on a soundstage,” says Damon. “When you have to go through the journey of getting out to the middle of nowhere in New Mexico and you don’t know what the weather’s going to be or what the wind’s going to do, that all affects the performance. The unpredictability and reality of being out there just gives you something that you can’t get in a controlled environment.”
Perhaps the most important sequence shot at Ghost Ranch was the moment in which Murphy puts on Oppenheimer’s distinctive porkpie hat for the first time, an action symbolic of the physicist truly coming into his own as the leader of this massive effort.
“He created this iconography, this version of himself,” says Murphy. “It was very self-consciously done, and the hat and the pipe were key. It was very helpful to me to know that these were decisions he’d made. I think he was vain. I think he was ambitious. He liked being talked about, and he liked being identifiable, and the hat and pipe were indicators of that.”

Cigarettes were also key to his persona. “Oppenheimer was a chain smoker,” says prop master Guillaume Delouche. “And when I say chain smoker, he smoked close to 150 cigarettes a day. When he didn’t smoke cigarettes, he would take a break by smoking his pipe.”
To help Murphy re-create the habit that eventually gave Oppenheimer fatal throat cancer, Delouche manufactured herbal cigarettes with a menthol flavor that Murphy could constantly smoke without getting sick. Delouche stamped the cigarettes with the logo of Chesterfield, the only brand Oppenheimer would smoke, and created period-specific cigarette packs for each era of the film.
Nolan believes in keeping an intense pace, so the cast and crew can keep civilized hours, get sleep and go home to their families. He also observes a strict routine, walking onto set every day and eating his breakfast — an omelet with avocado and crispy bacon — at 7 a.m.
“Chris works so fast that the only time you leave set is to go to the bathroom, and we move the toilets very close to you, so you don’t have to go too far,” says Hayslip.

For newcomers, Nolan’s rules were a shock to the system. “It was a real wake-up call for me,” says Blunt. “Chris’s sets can seem strict going into it, and then you realize it’s about placing the movie first. Every scene is so dialed in, because everyone’s been conversing with each other. No one’s been sitting in their own isolation looking at Instagram, distracting them from what they’re doing. I found it the most focused, collaborative experience of my career. I just ran to work. I loved it.”
Blunt found it hardest to adjust to Nolan’s requirement that actors come to set in costume, exactly as they’d appear on film. Carrying a coffee or wearing a personal coat, hat or boots while rehearsing was discouraged. The director’s reasoning was all about efficiency and keeping actors ready to shoot at a moment’s notice. He also wanted them to be entirely immersed in the world they were trying to re-create, without modern intrusions such as cellphones.
Blunt says she will never forget the day she showed up on set at Ghost Ranch wearing Ugg boots. “It was like a scene from ‘The Devil Wears Prada,’” says the actress, laughing. (She got her big break in that movie.) “Chris just looks down at your shoes, and it’s like Meryl Streep is looking at your horrible fashion choice. I just thought, ‘I’ll never be seen dead in Ugg boots around him again.’”
For her wrap gift to Nolan after the shoot, Blunt says she got the director “the ugliest Ugg slippers I could find.”
Filming interior scenes in the real Los Alamos began March 8, 2022. Nolan had revisited shooting in the extant historical buildings there, including Fuller Lodge and a 1940s Women’s Army Corps dormitory (which the production turned into Oppenheimer’s lecture hall), when he realized they had neither the time nor the budget to build those sets from scratch at Ghost Ranch. This meant he finally had the chance to shoot in the house on Bathtub Row where Oppenheimer and Kitty once lived. For the director, being there not only gave the scenes unique production value, but it also added something ineffable to the performances.
“It’s much better for the actors to be in the real place. It’s just informing so much of what they do,” he says. “It’s the exact opposite of doing something on a green­-screen stage, and particularly when people are tired and jaded on films from working long hours. There’s just something magic about walking into Oppenheimer’s real house.”
De Jong’s team and the set decoration department had furnished the space with authentic items, even finding wingback chairs that looked just like ones they had seen in a photo of Oppenheimer and Kitty relaxing with martinis. They also incorporated artwork and furniture that Murphy had uncovered during his research, helping the actor to “melt” into Oppenheimer’s space.
“Definitely, there’s something in the air and in the atoms of the place,” says Murphy, “and it confers a kind of responsibility on you, as a performer, and a responsibility on Chris also, as director. When you’re shooting in these real places where the people you’re portraying lived their lives, it adds a level of respect, and I think the audience subconsciously feels that.”

For Blunt, the house helped bring her closer to Kitty and gain a deeper understanding of her perspective. “They would drink a lot and barely eat and smoked like chimneys, and they had this real passion and fire for each other,” says Blunt, talking about the early days of their relationship.
But between Kitty’s indifference to motherhood and the isolation of Los Alamos, she began to lose herself to alcoholism. “The loneliness of life in Los Alamos must have just been extraordinary, and I felt so deeply for this woman who was not a nice person and really rubbed people the wrong way,” says Blunt.
In a key scene shot in the yard of the house on Bathtub Row, Kitty hangs up laundry while Oppenheimer heads down south to test the atomic bomb, his most triumphant moment. “She doesn’t get to see that,” says Blunt. “She’s busy hanging out laundry. Poor Kitty. No wonder she hit the drink.”
As an unexpected bonus of shooting in the home of the Manhattan Project, the production was able to cast real Los Alamos National Laboratory scientists as background actors.
“I was like: ‘It’s a town of 13,000 that’s known for the atomic bomb. I’m sure it’s full of people who know the history and have relatives who lived it,’” says Nolan, who asked the casting department to set up an open casting call in the town.
Olivia Thirlby, who plays scientist Lilli Hornig, says the actors quickly learned to lean on their new scientist friends. “We could ask, ‘So, what am I saying in this speech?’ And we’d get incredibly accurate and detailed descriptions — which didn’t make it any easier to understand,” she says, laughing.
The background actors were particularly important to a series of Los Alamos scenes that depicted the coming end of the war and Oppenheimer’s horrifying sense of guilt once the bombs drop on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, eventually killing or injuring more than 200,000 people. In one, a large group of scientists debate whether to go ahead with using the bomb on Japan after hearing that Germany has been defeated.
The director was amazed at how the actual scientists in the room could improvise incredibly complex geopolitical conversations based on their knowledge of the bomb.
“The actors were riffing on what the extras were giving them,” says Nolan. “It was a very unusual situation.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvMjAyMy8wNy8xOS9jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1yYWNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-23 09:50:00+00:00,Oppenheimer: Christopher Nolan’s movie has a devastating ending. Is it enough?,What the anti-nuclear movement thinks of Christopher Nolan’s movie.,"In Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) yells that the Manhattan Project is “the most important fucking thing to happen in the history of the world!” Many historical dramas feel that way about their subjects, but most don’t come right out and say it. Nolan’s movie attempts to back that sentiment up, though, by dramatizing the fears and guilt the bomb inspired in J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) in the postwar years. But does it matter that Oppenheimer felt guilty? Was Oppenheimer, as Nolan is telling the press now, hopelessly naïve? And is Oppenheimer, the movie, telling the right story about a weapon that, almost 80 years later, still stands at the ready to annihilate the world?
My friend Seth Shelden is the United Nations Liaison for the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, which has spent more than a decade developing a treaty banning nuclear weapons through international law and has now gotten nearly 100 nations to sign on. (Everyone has a friend who makes them feel like a slacker, but you get a special feeling of insignificance from a friend who had a hand in winning the Nobel Peace Prize.) After I saw Oppenheimer, Seth was the first person I wanted to talk to. We discussed what Nolan’s movie leaves out, what people forget about how many nuclear bombs have already been deployed in the world, and how ICAN plans to get the world’s great powers—including the U.S.—to agree to give up their nukes. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dan Kois: The centerpiece of the movie is the first Trinity test, which seems gigantic on an IMAX screen. How does a typical bomb in 2023 compare in strength to that test?
Seth Shelden: The average bomb in one of the U.S. arsenals, let’s say, is somewhere between five times and 30 times bigger than what was used in the Trinity test, which was the same size as the Hiroshima bomb. We have some in our arsenal that are over a megaton, so 80 times bigger than what we dropped in Hiroshima. The largest weapon that’s ever been tested, I think it’s over 3,000 Hiroshima bombs. That’s the Tsar Bomb. It shattered windows in other countries when it was tested.
Jeez.

The basic answer is that the weapons that were used in New Mexico—and in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which killed hundreds of thousands of people—look like colonial muskets by comparison to what we have now.
In the movie, Oppenheimer declares that developing these weapons will usher in “a peace mankind has never seen.” That seems, like, hopelessly naïve to me. Why did people once believe that?
You say “why did people once believe that” as if they don’t believe it anymore.

I guess some people still do. You don’t agree with the idea that nuclear weapons are an insurer of peace, as opposed to an eventual destroyer of the world.
This is a pervasive myth, one that primarily benefits the companies that build nuclear weapons. It’s the myth that military power prevents conflict. A lot of our work is to help people understand that this realpolitik that came about, that really crystallized in the post–World War II era, is incredibly dangerous, actually. The real realists recognize that by perpetuating this system of valuing nuclear weapons, we are going to ensure that they’re used. The only way to usher in “a peace mankind has never seen” is to prohibit and eliminate the weapons.

Oppenheimer seems to come to a similar conclusion in the movie, which focuses a great deal on his postwar career. It argues that he became something of an anti-nuclear agitator. How does the modern anti-nuclear movement actually view Robert Oppenheimer?
It’s true that the film depicts Oppenheimer’s later conviction that arms control and regulation is what is needed. But it’s also true that that he spends a lot of the movie talking about how the scientists don’t get a role in what the government does with it.

You pursue the science. That’s your job. And then it’s not up to you to figure out how to utilize it.
A lot of our movement’s success has been contradicting that notion. The experts are not these military strategists. The experts are the scientists who can really understand the way the weapons work. They’re the doctors who understand that there’s no adequate medical response to these weapons. They’re the climatologists who understand that in the event of a full-scale conflict between the U.S. and Russia, up to 5 billion people will die because of the crop reduction following the climate chaos that would ensue. And the experts are the victims, the affected people who can testify to what happens when these weapons are used.

So, on one hand, yes, Oppenheimer, like so many people who have worked in the military, later realized, “Oh, you know what? This was a terrible idea.” But at the same time, a lot of people in the modern anti-nuclear movement, especially those who are or speak for affected communities, are quite traumatized by the celebration of Oppenheimer as some sort of, I don’t know, honorable person who felt guilty.
Advertisement
Advertisement
When you’re talking about affected communities, you’re talking about people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki?
Not only them. You hear even very high-level people saying that nuclear weapons were only used twice. Nuclear weapons were not used twice. In fact, they’ve been used over 2,000 times, with all the tests that each of the nuclear-armed states have conducted. And each of those uses has had intergenerational impacts. And there are studies, including by the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, concluding that 2.4 million people are predicted to eventually die from cancers as a result of the tests that have been conducted so far.

These tests have been done generally in Indigenous lands, in lands of their imperial control, in lands of marginalized communities. In addition to New Mexico, the French tested in Algeria, the British and the U.S. tested in the South Pacific, Russians in Kazakhstan, Chinese in Uyghur territories. They’re not testing where their power centers are, for obvious reasons.
Nolan makes a very deliberate choice not to show the effects of the bomb at Hiroshima or Nagasaki. There are some stylized moments when Oppenheimer is visualizing bomb impacts in times of great personal crisis. And there are moments when those effects are described in audio but we don’t see them. Do you think the movie should have shown those impacts?
Advertisement
Advertisement
The most unfortunate aspect of this film, again, I think, is its erasure of those who are affected by the weapons. I don’t know that we always need to depict the hundreds of thousands of people dying on film, especially because these are incredibly painful and traumatic images for those who continue to suffer. But I do think it’s a disservice not to tell their story. As you say, everything is framed through the perspective of this tortured white scientist, struggling with this challenge of the scientific and moral challenge of the unknown.
The more time you spend valorizing the scientific achievement, the more you encourage people to view it as some kind of triumph that needs to be celebrated or recognized despite the possible problems it might cause in the future.
Advertisement
You could argue that the main premise of the film is that the true injustice that we’re analyzing is the refusal to renew Oppenheimer’s security clearance.
To punish him for his conscience.
Yeah.
You mention the specter of the 5 billion, as you say, who would die if there’s a full-scale war between the United States and Russia. That apocalyptic possibility isn’t exactly ignored in the movie. It’s certainly touched on. Do you think that Nolan takes that danger seriously enough, or could you never take that danger seriously enough?
Well, I think you can take that danger seriously enough.
By banning nuclear weapons.
Advertisement
Advertisement
Advertisement
Yeah. By working towards a real solution instead of perpetuating the notion that nuclear weapons are terrible things but we need them. Obviously, I didn’t expect the last line of the movie to be, like, “Every country should join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.” But even if you walk out of the film being like, Wow, these are incredibly destructive, there is a big risk that especially U.S. viewers will just come back to the false conclusion that the weapons, while clearly terrible, are better for us to have than not have, because they “keep us safe.”
Advertisement
I mean, the last line of the movie isn’t a full-throated declaration of loyalty to ICAN, but it is Oppenheimer basically saying, like, “I think I destroyed the world.”
Sure. You’re gambling, as a director, that the audience is going to walk away thinking about that moment and chewing on that. Some audience members will, probably, but in light of the three hours that have preceded it, I’m not sure it has the impact that Nolan might think it has simply by dint of being the last beat.
Let’s talk a little bit about solutions and what your organization does. ICAN is making a bet that you can persuade people not to use this weapon, on a country-by-country basis. What is the state of your treaty?
Advertisement
Advertisement
You say we’re making a “bet” that we can convince people not to use this weapon, but the fact is that it’s self-evident to most of the world that these weapons do not provide security and need to be eliminated. Now, in the U.S., this isn’t top-line news, in part because the U.S. has worked so hard to ignore this treaty.
Advertisement
We negotiated the treaty through 2017, which is when we won the Nobel Peace Prize. It’s the first treaty that builds a framework for the total elimination of nuclear weapons by international law. It also contains provisions to address the harms from past nuclear weapons use and testing. The treaty would enter into force once 50 countries ratified it and fully joined it. That happened in January 2021. By now 95 states in total have made some legal commitment to the treaty, so that’s close to half of the U.N. membership.
Advertisement
We had the first meeting of states parties last June in Austria, where they adopted this really powerful declaration that condemned any and all threats to use nuclear weapons, which had a demonstrable impact on the Kremlin’s threats in the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Advertisement
Advertisement
It may be impossible to answer this question, but what is the pathway to getting the U.S. to sign a treaty like this?
No, it’s not impossible. It’s sometimes difficult to understand how massive shifts happen when you’re in the middle of the problem. It took 70-plus years, but in 2021 nuclear weapons became comprehensively illegal under international law for the first time. So that was Step 1.
Advertisement
And the second step is then to build the norm, using this treaty to stigmatize and delegitimize the weapons as some great badge of power. Because in the U.S. right now, nuclear weapons are bizarrely baked into our national psyche as something we value, when in fact they’re just horrible, indiscriminate, and life-ending. A shift in public consciousness is a major part of this. But of course it can happen. You think about people who lived in the middle of a millennium of slavery, let’s say, who were just like, “Well, this is just the way the world works” and couldn’t ever see a way out of that. And now it’s not that slavery doesn’t exist anywhere, but it’s something incomprehensible to the vast majority of people, and it’s banned under customary international law.

Step 3: You build the prohibition, you build the norm, and then you negotiate how the disarmament happens.
Now, the question I think that we should be asking is not whether the U.S. will sign, but whether the U.S. will join this treaty before or after there’s a great nuclear disaster.
Was the development of the atomic bomb, as Matt Damon says, the most important fucking thing ever to happen?
Well, I can tell you that it was the most important fucking thing ever to happen for the hundreds of thousands of people it killed in the days after, and the millions of people who died of or continued to suffer from it. I mean, that’s not what Matt Damon meant, of course, but it goes back to one issue I take with how the story is told. Somehow, we—and the U.S. government was a big part of this—have imbued nuclear weapons with magical powers. And Matt Damon’s line reinforces that. But in fact, we should all push back against that. We should start by actually recognizing what they do and who’s actually affected by them, instead of celebrating these people who made them. If we do that, that’s a step toward finally eliminating nuclear weapons before they eliminate us.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy8wNy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1tb3ZpZS1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1lbmRpbmctaGlyb3NoaW1hLW5hZ2FzYWtpLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,The Real History Behind Christopher Nolan’s ‘Oppenheimer’,"The ""father of the atomic bomb"" has long been misunderstood. Will the new film finally get J. Robert Oppenheimer right?","Since the end of World War II, historians and artists alike have been fascinated by the brilliant, enigmatic J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who led the Manhattan Project laboratory that developed the atomic bomb. Beginning as early as 1946, documentaries, television miniseries, plays, books, graphic novels, feature films and even an opera have explored the scientist’s life, work and legacy. In recent years, however, much of that complexity has been reduced to a single popular image: the broken genius, haunted by his own invention, reciting a line from the Bhagavad Gita in a 1965 NBC News documentary. “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds,” Oppenheimer intones.
But Oppenheimer’s life was about far more than regret. “[He] was interesting as the father of the bomb,” says Kai Bird, co-author of the 2005 Pulitzer Prize-winning biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer. “But the real arc in the story is the tragedy.”

Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, which opens in theaters on July 21, will be the first feature-length film to tackle the scientist’s life in its entirety, and it promises to be spectacular. Starring Cillian Murphy of “Peaky Blinders” fame in the title role alongside an ensemble A-list cast, the film (which uses American Prometheus as its main source material) will reintroduce the scientist and the top-secret bomb project he helmed to a new generation of Americans. Oppenheimer provides an opportunity to revisit this charismatic, contradictory man and reconsider how previous attempts to tell his story have succeeded—and failed—at fathoming one of the 20th century’s most fascinating public figures.
Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project
Born into a secular Jewish family in New York City in 1904 and educated at Manhattan’s Ethical Culture School, Oppenheimer graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University in just three years. If Harvard was easy, growing out of his awkward adolescence was harder. He struggled with mental health issues while pursuing a graduate degree at the University of Cambridge—“I was on the point of bumping myself off,” he later recalled—and ended up on probation after lacing an apple with chemicals and leaving it on his tutor’s desk. But by the time World War II broke out in 1939, Oppenheimer had transformed himself into a respected physicist at the University of California, Berkeley. “He was sort of a caricature of the eccentric professor,” Bird says, an intellectual omnivore who read Sanskrit, loved Elizabethan poetry, rode horses and made a great martini.
He had also fallen in love with Jean Tatlock (played by Florence Pugh in Nolan’s film), a dues-paying member of the Communist Party who awakened his interest in politics. Oppenheimer was “likely sympathetic to … communist goals,” according to the nonprofit Atomic Heritage Foundation, but he never officially joined the party. (“Any attempt to label Robert Oppenheimer a party member is a futile exercise—as the FBI learned to its frustration over many years,” wrote Bird and co-author Martin J. Sherwin, who died in October 2021 at age 84, in American Prometheus.) But many of his closest friends and family were party members at one point or another: his brother, Frank Oppenheimer; his friend Haakon Chevalier; and his future wife, Kitty Oppenheimer. These associations would cast suspicion on the physicist himself later in his life.
Oppenheimer’s political leanings didn’t prevent him from being recruited, in early 1942, for a secret project authorized by President Franklin D. Roosevelt that was drawing scientists from all over the country. Three years earlier, Albert Einstein had written a letter to Roosevelt warning that breakthroughs in nuclear fission promised “extremely powerful bombs of a new type.” Now, the race was on to figure out how to build one of these bombs before Germany did.
In the summer of 1942, Oppenheimer organized a series of secret seminars at Berkeley, where the United States’ top physicists roughed out the outlines of a possible bomb. As it turned out, Oppenheimer was a natural manager. “I don’t know how he had acquired this facility for handling people,” said Edward Teller, a colleague who would later testify against him. “Those who knew him well were really surprised.”
That September, General Leslie Groves (played by Matt Damon in the new film), an Army engineer who’d previously overseen construction of the Pentagon, took over as head of what was by then called the Manhattan Project, after its inaugural offices in lower Manhattan. Groves knew construction but not physics, so the charming Berkeley physicist caught his eye. “Oppenheimer was the first scientist Groves had met on his tour who grasped that building an atomic bomb required finding practical solutions to a variety of cross-disciplinary problems,” wrote Bird and Sherwin. He wasn’t an obvious choice—“He couldn’t run a hamburger stand,” said a Berkeley colleague—but in October 1942, Groves named Oppenheimer the project’s scientific director.
The government operation brought hundreds, and eventually thousands, of scientists, civilians and Army personnel to a mesa in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Their ranks eventually included Teller, Hans Bethe, Richard Feynman, Seth Neddermeyer, Robert Serber, Kenneth Bainbridge, Enrico Fermi and many others. (Nolan’s film portrays each of these figures and, judging by the full cast list, more or less recreates the entire field of theoretical physics in the 1930s and ’40s, including Kenneth Branagh as Nobel Prize winner Niels Bohr.) The scientists reported directly to Oppenheimer, who, at 38, was learning on the job how to run a lab.
Oppenheimer’s lab was only one part of the Manhattan Project. Built on the site of a former boys’ school, Los Alamos was one of three “secret cities” seized and transformed by the U.S. government in late 1942 and early 1943. The other two—Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington—accounted for the vast majority of the manpower, expense and industrial scale of the project, which employed an estimated half a million people between 1942 and 1945. At Oak Ridge, uranium was refined at the largest factory in the world, newly built for that purpose. In Hanford, an area half the size of Rhode Island was cleared of residents, their houses bulldozed to make way for reactors to produce plutonium. “I told you it couldn’t be done without turning the whole country into a factory,” Bohr said to Teller in 1944. “You have done just that.”
At Los Alamos, Oppenheimer came into his own as a gifted leader. “[He] had a very distinctive voice that was very soft,” says Bird. “You had to listen very carefully, but he was magnetic.” That magnetism kept the lab productive even after an initial design for the bomb, known as Thin Man, had to be scrapped in July 1944. Ultimately, the scientists settled on two workable designs for a bomb, which they called Fat Man and Little Boy. At 5:29 a.m. on July 16, 1945, almost three years of work culminated in the first nuclear detonation in history. Known as the Trinity test, it lit the hills of the New Mexico desert.
Oppenheimer, already famously thin, had lost weight during the project, and during the countdown, he reportedly barely breathed. Later dramatizations had the scientist reciting the line from the Bhagavad Gita during the moment of detonation (Oppenheimer himself later claimed the line had come to him then), but he reportedly said something closer to “It worked.”
After the test, Oppenheimer was transformed by relief. “I’ll never forget the way he stepped out of the car,” fellow Manhattan Project scientist Isidor Isaac Rabi later said. “His walk was like High Noon … this kind of strut. He had done it.”
On August 6, 1945, the Enola Gay dropped Little Boy on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Three days later, Bockscar dropped Fat Man on Nagasaki. Estimates of deaths from the two bombings vary widely, from a contemporary figure of around 110,000 to a later estimate of closer to 210,000. On August 15, Emperor Hirohito announced Japan’s surrender.
The battle over the bomb
In the years immediately following the war, public opinion about the use of the atomic bomb hadn’t yet solidified. The first time Oppenheimer appeared on the big screen was in August 1946, when he starred in the 18-minute documentary “Atomic Power,” which was part of Time’s “The March of Time” series. Onscreen, Oppenheimer (one of several figures who participated in the film, including Einstein, Groves and Rabi) re-enacts waiting anxiously for the detonation at Trinity with Rabi, who gives a stilted performance as he reassures his boss, “It’s going to work all right, Robert. And I’m sure we’ll never be sorry for it.”
HISTORY OF THE ATOM BOMB, MANHATTAN PROJECT AND ATOMIC POWER (Print 2) 71674z Watch on
In fact, Oppenheimer was already sorry. In October 1945, he told President Harry S. Truman (played by Gary Oldman in Nolan’s film), “Mr. President, I feel I have blood on my hands.” The tide of public opinion was also beginning to turn. Three weeks after “Atomic Power” was released, John Hersey’s searing, book-length article “Hiroshima” appeared in the New Yorker, awakening many Americans for the first time to the horrors of the bomb.
Fearing they were losing the battle for the history books, Truman and other officials sprang into action, compelling former Secretary of War Henry Stimson to defend the use of the bomb in a Harper’s magazine article published in February 1947. The story, which reads as a simple recitation of the facts, portrays the decision to use the bomb as one made with sagacious care. It introduced the argument—repeated often since—that the bomb prevented an Allied land invasion of Japan that would have cost “over a million casualties, to American forces alone.”
“That article really set the history for most Americans for the next generation,” Bird says. “And the narrative was, ‘Oh, it was a difficult decision. It was terrible. But it was necessary, and it saved perhaps a million American lives.’”
The first major Hollywood film about the bomb, The Beginning or the End, debuted the month after Stimson’s article. Initially conceived by atomic scientists as a way to educate the public about the dangers of nuclear warfare, the movie went through script approvals and retakes ordered by Groves and Truman that turned it into a “pro-bomb celebration—dictated by the Pentagon and White House,” wrote Greg Mitchell in his 2020 book, The Beginning or the End: How Hollywood—and America—Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.
Directed by Norman Taurog, the film “is so instructive because it is the earliest, and one of the most complete, reassertions of the pro-bomb narrative just when doubts were being raised,” Mitchell tells Smithsonian magazine. “Even Truman got involved, to the extent of ordering a costly retake and getting the actor playing him fired. The studio voluntarily handed over control of the film to the Pentagon, via Groves, and the White House. Oppenheimer himself caved to pressure.”
The Beginning or the End claimed the American military dropped warning leaflets about the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and that the Enola Gay came under attack from Japanese antiaircraft missile fire on its bombing run. Like Stimson’s article, it depicted Truman carefully working through the decision to drop the bomb before arriving at a pivotal moment.
In fact, the U.S. did not drop leaflets warning of the atomic bomb specifically, though pilots may have dropped more general notices of impending attacks on Hiroshima, and the Enola Gay did not come under antiaircraft fire. Many historians disagree that there was a single moment of “decision” on Truman’s part. In an essay included in the 2020 anthology The Age of Hiroshima, Alex Wellerstein, a nuclear historian at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey, wrote that Truman “was actually quite peripheral to most of the decisions that led to the use of the weapons.” Wellerstein argued that Truman may have even mistakenly believed that Hiroshima was a military target rather than a city made up largely of civilians. As for that figure of one million projected American casualties, Bird later asked Stimson’s ghostwriter, Mac Bundy, where he got it. “He looked at me,” Bird recalls, “and he says, ‘Oh, we pulled it out of thin air.’”
Oppenheimer described the script of The Beginning or the End as “without purpose or insight.” Another physicist, Leo Szilard, put it even more bluntly: “If our sin as scientists was to make and use the atomic bomb, then our punishment was to watch The Beginning or the End.”
The Oppenheimer security hearing
Almost immediately, Oppenheimer began speaking out publicly about the dangers of atomic warfare, even as he continued to act as a nuclear weapons consultant for the U.S. government. In November 1945, he told an audience in Philadelphia that the bomb was “by all the standards of the world we grew up in … an evil thing.” He gave television interviews starkly elucidating the risk of nuclear war. In 1949, as the head of an advisory committee for the newly formed Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), he delivered a report warning against developing a hydrogen bomb—a fusion weapon more powerful than the Trinity, Hiroshima or Nagasaki bombs—that had been conceived by fellow Manhattan Project scientist Teller. “A super bomb might become a weapon of genocide,” Oppenheimer wrote. “A super bomb should never be produced.” In 1953, he gave a speech likening the nuclear-capable United States and Soviet Union to “two scorpions in a bottle, each capable of killing the other, but only at the risk of his own life.”
Oppenheimer’s outspoken warnings made him a target, and in December 1953, amid McCarthy-era paranoia about Soviet spies in the highest levels of government, AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss (played by Robert Downey Jr. in Nolan’s film), who harbored a dislike for Oppenheimer, called the scientist into his office and told him his top-secret security clearance had been revoked. Oppenheimer insisted on defending himself, leading the AEC to call what became a highly publicized security hearing to resolve the matter.
The monthlong hearing, which began on April 12, 1954, amounted to an X-ray of Oppenheimer’s adult life. Transgressions large and small were dragged into the open and held up to exacting scrutiny. Key pieces of the case against Oppenheimer included his close friendship with Chevalier, a scholar of French literature at Berkeley and a card-carrying Communist whom the physicist had once protected from incrimination, as well as Oppenheimer’s opposition to Teller’s hydrogen bomb. The usually persuasive scientist panicked under questioning by AEC lawyer Roger Robb; at one point, caught in a contradiction, Oppenheimer accounted for his defense of Chevalier by admitting bluntly, “I was an idiot.” But he also had to defend personal matters, such as his decision to spend a night with his communist ex-fiancée, Tatlock, in the summer of 1943, while he was working at Los Alamos, six months before she died by suicide in 1944. Why did he have to see her? The committee asked. “Because she was still in love with me,” Oppenheimer responded.
On May 27, the board overseeing the hearings voted 2 to 1 not to reinstate Oppenheimer’s security clearance. “I personally think that our failure to clear Dr. Oppenheimer will be a black mark on the escutcheon of our country,” wrote lone dissenter Ward V. Evans. Either way, Oppenheimer’s relationship with the U.S. government was now officially over. He returned to Princeton, New Jersey, where he’d been the director of the Institute for Advanced Study since 1947. The hearings “destroyed him,” Rabi later said. Another friend, diplomat George Kennan, remembered trying to comfort Oppenheimer by telling him he’d surely be welcome abroad. “His answer, given to me with tears in his eyes: ‘Damn it, I happen to love this country.’”
Oppenheimer tried to minimize the importance of the hearings. “I think of this as a major accident, much like a train wreck or the collapse of a building,” he told a reporter. “It has no relation or connection to my life. I just happened to be there.” As much as he might have wished that to be true, Oppenheimer’s downfall during the hearings came to define him in the public eye. In 1964, the German playwright Heinar Kipphardt drew directly on the published transcripts of the security hearings for his In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Discussing the play with the Washington Post, perhaps still trying to prevent his downfall from defining him, Oppenheimer said, “The whole damn thing was a farce, and these people are trying to make a tragedy out of it.”
In an attempt at public rehabilitation, President Lyndon B. Johnson presented Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award, the AEC’s highest honor, in 1963. Nonetheless, the physicist never fully recovered from the blow to his reputation. He lived out the rest of his days in Princeton, where he kept his job at the Institute for Advanced Study until 1966, and died of cancer there in February 1967. As the New York Times wrote in his obituary, “This bafflingly complex man nonetheless never fully succeeded in dispelling doubts about his conduct.”
Oppenheimer’s security clearance remained revoked until December 2022, when the Department of Energy vacated the commission’s 1954 decision. “Oppenheimer occupies a central role in our history for leading the nation’s atomic efforts during World War II and planting the seeds for the Department of Energy’s national laboratories,” said Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm in a statement. “As time has passed, more evidence has come to light of the bias and unfairness of the process that Dr. Oppenheimer was subjected to, while the evidence of his loyalty and love of country [has] only been further affirmed.”
The myth of Oppenheimer
In the more than 50 years since Oppenheimer’s death, popular culture has taken varied approaches to exploring his life. The Peabody Award-winning 1981 documentary The Day After Trinity focused on his regret over his role in building the bomb. The 1980 BBC TV miniseries “Oppenheimer,” by contrast, starred a thin, quietly charismatic Sam Waterston and was more interested in the question of Oppenheimer’s communist ties and his downfall.
Later fictional depictions of Oppenheimer grew less interested in complex readings of his psychology and often flattened him into a character who sometimes bordered on the ridiculous. In 1989, director Roland Joffé made a big-budget bet on the story of the Manhattan Project in Fat Man and Little Boy. Despite an A-list cast—Paul Newman as Groves, John Cusack as a fictional Manhattan Project scientist, Laura Dern as that scientist’s girlfriend—the film flopped. The script was simplistic, the dialogue groan-inducing (“Naked. Isn’t that a beautiful word?” Dern says to Cusack when propositioning him) and veracity an afterthought. But the film suffered most from the performance of Dwight Schultz, best known to viewers from “The A-Team” and “Star Trek: The Next Generation,” as Oppenheimer. Schultz brought a blankness to his portrayal of a man who famously had charisma to spare. “Schultz is stiff and actorly,” wrote the Washington Post. “Like an irredeemably tone-deaf singer, he hits only false notes.”

In the otherwise excellent TV show “Manhattan,” which ran for two seasons in 2014 and 2015, Daniel London played Oppenheimer as an already broken man, as though the actor’s only reference for the character was the famous “I am become death” interview. His Oppenheimer was more interested in self-preservation than the success of the project, whereas the real Oppenheimer of the Los Alamos years was a nimble ball of energy, guiding the complex endeavor toward completion thanks to his keen feeling for the challenges his fellow scientists faced.
No list would be complete without one other fictional depiction of Oppenheimer: Pulitzer Prize-winning composer John Adams’ 2005 opera, Doctor Atomic. If Oppenheimer objected to Kipphardt’s play, he surely would have found Doctor Atomic’s elevation of his life into an operatic Faustian tragedy ridiculous. But the opera, which centers around the days leading up to the Trinity test and culminates in the detonation of the first atomic bomb, was rapturously received by critics and has been restaged several times since its debut. In the New York Times, science writer Dennis Overbye wrote that the opera had disabused him of his preconceptions about the bomb: “I long ago concluded that there was not much new to say about the atomic bomb. But I was wrong. As I was watching … I began to wonder if anything had yet been said that counted.”
Nolan’s Oppenheimer
Before Sherwin’s death in 2021, he and Bird read several scripts based on American Prometheus. One, Bird says, was boring. Another was just weird: “It had dream sequences, a ghost speaking Oppenheimer’s poetry. It had a scene in which [Oppenheimer] is at a cocktail party in Berkeley and imagines himself dropping a cyanide pill into Edward Teller’s drink and watching him collapse on the floor and die in agony.” Bird and Sherwin sent back a long memo detailing the script’s many historical errors.
So Bird was relieved when, in fall 2021, he became one of a handful of people outside the film’s production to read Nolan’s take on Oppenheimer. “I think it’s a fabulous script,” Bird says. Unlike other recent depictions, it covers scenes from Oppenheimer’s entire life and doesn’t shy away from the moral questions of the bomb. “Nolan covers in a very deft way the argument among the physicists over whether the bomb was necessary or not and has Oppenheimer after Hiroshima saying the bomb was used on a virtually already defeated enemy,” Bird adds. “People who know nothing about Oppenheimer will go thinking they’re going to see a movie about the father of the atomic bomb.” Instead, “they’re going to see this mysterious figure and a deeply mysterious biographical story.”
Regardless of whether subject matter experts believe there is nothing new to say, the general public’s understanding of Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project hasn’t changed significantly since Stimson’s 1947 Harper’s article. After all, most people’s sense of history doesn’t come by way of the academy or densely researched biographies. Visiting Los Alamos myself a few years ago, I asked a docent what they thought might renew public interest in the history of the Manhattan Project.
The answer? “A movie.”
“Oppenheimer himself couldn’t make up his mind how he felt about making and helping to use the bomb, right to the end of his life,” says Mitchell. Until now, “filmmakers also couldn’t seem to get a handle on his conflicting emotions and statements. In that sense, he is a valuable audience surrogate, severely divided or conflicted on these questions.”
Nolan’s film arrives at a precarious moment in which optimism about nuclear disarmament is giving way to talk of a new nuclear age. Few world leaders today have direct experience with the horrors of nuclear bombs, and some younger people are ignorant of even basic facts about World War II. But perhaps our distance from Oppenheimer’s era also presents an opportunity.
“Today, almost 80 years have passed since the end of World War II,” says Cynthia C. Kelly, president of the Atomic Heritage Foundation. Now, she adds, “the public can more openly consider different interpretations of atomic history.”
Why did it take so long for a director of Nolan’s caliber to take on Oppenheimer’s story? Perhaps it’s because we’re only now far enough away from those world-changing events to be open to seeing them—and him—with fresh eyes.
That’s no easy task. As Oppenheimer himself told an interviewer in 1948, “If you’ve lived a life that isn’t free and open with people, it’s almost impossible to unsnarl it, to unravel the ball of twine.”

Christopher Nolan says the strike is about ""jobbing actors, staff writers trying to raise a family, trying to keep food on the table""
Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan has said he ""absolutely"" will not work on another film until the Hollywood strikes are resolved.
Tens of thousands of Hollywood actors have joined writers in taking industrial action, because they want streaming giants to agree to a fairer split of profits and better working conditions.
The Screen Actors Guild also wants to protect actors from being usurped by digital replicas.
Nolan admitted he was ""very fortunate with the timing"", as his film's premieres were held just before the strike began, meaning Oppenheimer would not be affected by industry members stopping work.

When asked if he would write another film during the strike, he told BBC Culture editor Katie Razzall: ""No, absolutely. It's very important that everybody understands it is a very key moment in the relationship between working people and Hollywood.
""This is not about me, this is not about the stars of my film,"" the acclaimed director, writer and producer added.
""This is about jobbing actors, this is about staff writers on television programmes trying to raise a family, trying to keep food on the table.""

Oppenheimer stars Peaky Blinders' Cillian Murphy, who has already appeared in five Christopher Nolan films
As more production companies use streaming platforms - like Netflix and Amazon Prime - for their shows, it has changed how actors and writers get paid.
Previously every time an episode was re-run on a TV network, it would tend to involve payment, allowing those who worked on projects to get by in between jobs.
The director said the companies involved had not yet ""accommodated how they're going to in this new world of streaming, and a world where they're not licensing their products out to other broadcasters - they're keeping them for themselves"".
Nolan, who was Oscar-nominated five times for the films Dunkirk, Inception and Memento, added: ""They have not yet offered to pay appropriately to the unions' working members, and it's very important that they do so.
""I think you'd never want a strike, you never want industrial action.
""But there are times where it's necessary. This is one of those times.""
Speaking ahead of the London premiere, where several of Oppenheimer's stars left the red carpet early to strike, he explained: ""It's very important to bear in mind that there are people who have been out of work for months now, as part of the writers strike, and with the actors potentially joining - a lot of people are going to suffer.""
Watch: How the Hollywood strike affects you in 75 seconds
Despite the row in California, British-born Nolan has no current plans to work more in the UK, his home country, as he prefers to be ""on the real locations"" where his films are set.
""The UK has wonderful film studios,"" he explained. ""It's a great place to come to shoot a film if you're going to be on sound stages.""
Oppenheimer tells the story of J Robert Oppenheimer, the enigmatic Manhattan Project scientist, who had a leading role in developing the atomic bomb that made him a ""destroyer of worlds"".
He ""gave us the power to destroy ourselves and that had never happened before"", Nolan said.
Commissioned by the US Government during World War II, and believing themselves in a nuclear race with the Nazis over who would create the bomb first, in 1945 scientists in Los Alamos, New Mexico detonated a test bomb, codenamed Trinity.

Trinity was the codename of the world's first nuclear weapon, which was successfully detonated in the New Mexico desert in 1945, as part of the Manhatten Project
""There's a possibility that when you push that button, you might destroy the entire world,"" Nolan told the BBC.
""And yet they went ahead and they pushed it. How could you make that decision? How could you take that on yourself?""

Another existential threat to civilization is AI, which is also part of the Hollywood strike and makes the Oppenheimer movie more timely.
""One of the interesting things about putting this film out is it's coming at a time when there are a lot of new technologies that people start to worry about the unintended consequences,"" he said.
""When you talk to leaders in the field of AI, as I do from time to time, they see this moment right now as their Oppenheimer moment. They're looking to his story to say, 'what are our responsibilities? How can we deal with the potential unintended consequences?' Sadly, for them, there are no easy answers.""
Nolan is one of a rare number of Hollywood directors. His films - Interstellar, the Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception amongst them - are both blockbusters and arthouse fare; critically acclaimed and, Tenet aside, which was released during the pandemic, box office successes.
""I make the films that I really want to go to the cinema and sit down with my popcorn and watch"" he says. ""I started making films when I was a kid. I made Super 8 films from when I was seven or eight years old and I've never stopped"".

Christopher Nolan on the set of Oppenheimer, was hailed as 'a genius' by Cillian Murphy
He's a champion of the big screen who, famously, left Warner Bros for rival Universal to make Oppenheimer.
Nolan's known for wanting his films to feel authentic rather than computer-generated.
There was even a rumour doing the rounds on the internet that he had set off a real atomic bomb in New Mexico for Oppenheimer.
""We recreated the circumstances of it,"" he said, ""obviously not using an atomic weapon. What we're trying to portray is this moment of absolute beauty and absolute terror.
""This is the moment that really changed the world.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LWFydHMtNjYxOTE3MDXSAThodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3MvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1hcnRzLTY2MTkxNzA1LmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Speaking to an audience from onstage at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London Thursday, Nolan said, ""We have to acknowledge, you've seen them here earlier on the red carpet. Unfortunately, they're off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by SAG.""
""Joining one of my guilds, the Writer's Guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of their union, and we support them,"" the director added, as seen in video shared by Deadline.
Soon after, leadership for SAG-AFTRA (aka the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) announced that the union would go on strike Friday, with union president Fran Drescher and national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland writing in a memo that members were ordered “to cease rendering all services and performing all work covered by the TV/Theatrical Contracts” once the strike began.
Ahead of Nolan's comments, Blunt, 40, told Deadline she hopes ""everyone makes a fair deal and we're here to just celebrate this movie.""
But she was prepared for what ended up being the case, adding, ""If they call [a strike], we’ll be leaving together as a cast in unity with everyone. … We're gonna have to. We're gonna have to. So we'll see what happens. But right now, it’s the joy to be together.""

Damon, 52, told the same outlet that despite some of the difficulties a strike would pose professionally, including for his newly launched independent studio with longtime friend Ben Affleck, a fair deal was the priority.
""It's brutal for our sister unions,"" he added. ""And it's gonna be tough for 160,000 actors. Nobody wants a work stoppage.""
""But if our leadership is saying that the deal isn’t fair, then we gotta hold strong until we get a deal that’s fair for working actors,"" Damon said. ""It’s the difference between having healthcare and not for a lot of actors, and we gotta do what’s right by them.""
""I stand by my colleagues — that's all I can say to you, really,"" Murphy, 47, told Irish outlet RTÉ.

2023-07-13 18:47:47+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’ Cast Leaves London Premiere Before Screening As SAG-AFTRA’s Official Strike Call Looms,"Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan told the crowd at the film's London premiere that the cast of his film had left and are ""off to write their picket signs""","Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan told the crowd at the film’s London premiere Thursday that the cast of his film had left and are “off to write their picket signs” as SAG-AFTRA prepares to go on strike.
“I have to to acknowledge the work of our incredible cast, led by Cillian Murphy,” Nolan said from the stage. “The list is enormous — Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek and so many more. … You’ve seen them here earlier on the red carpet. Unfortunately, they are off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by SAG, joining one of my guilds, the Writers Guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of their union.”
Watch the video below of Nolan’s comments, which he gave at both London screening venues today that showed the film simultaneously.
The Oppenheimer actors came into the Odeon Luxe theater and filed into a reception. One by one they came through the lobby. Deadline saw Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt leave before Nolan came onstage. All of the cast members Deadline spoke with declared their support for the strike action.
Deadline understands the cast members who exited went out for dinner in the West End. Later, Nolan and his creative team left for dinner with some Universal executives; some of the cast ate separately due to SAG-AFTRA regulations about accepting studio hospitality while on strike.
Speaking to Deadline on the red carpet earlier, Emily Blunt said that she and the other cast members would leave the event if the guild’s leadership officially approved a walkout. “I think right now we are just sort of — I hope everyone makes a fair deal and we are here to celebrate this movie. And if they call [a strike], we’ll be leaving together as cast in unity with everyone. … We are gonna have to. We are gonna have to. We will see what happens. Right now it’s the joy to be together.”

2023-07-24 02:07:18+00:00,Christopher Nolan Forgot To Credit Over 80% Of VFX Crew On ‘Oppenheimer’,VFX workers get screwed by Hollywood yet again.,"During the publicity junket for Oppenheimer, director Christopher Nolan repeatedly pointed out how his latest film doesn’t contain any cgi shots, leading many to believe that there were no digital vfx in the film. That interpretation of his statement is inaccurate.
While Oppenheimer may not contain cgi – or computer-generated imagery that is rendered in the computer – it absolutely does contain digital vfx. A lot of it may be ‘invisible vfx,’ a style of vfx often used in period films and adult dramas where the goal is to enhance the authenticity of the setting but not call attention to the fx work as superhero and action films tend to do. With invisible vfx, if the crew does their job well, then audiences won’t even realize that vfx are being used.
We don’t know how Nolan employed digital vfx on Oppenheimer, and won’t know until (and if) the effects breakdowns are released, but we do know for a fact that vfx were used on the film. We also know that the vfx studio on the film was DNEG, marking the eighth time they’ve collaborated on a film with Nolan.
UPDATE: DNEG has provided further information to Cartoon Brew to explain how compositing was the primary use of vfx in the film:
[Production vfx supervisor] Andrew Jackson spent several months of the project in Scott Fisher’s workshop, working with him and his SFX crew to develop the various simulations and effects. The process involved shooting an extensive library of elements. They shot these explosions at high speed, slowed them down then brought layers of footage together in post-production. The final shots ranged from using the raw elements as shot, through to complex composites of multiple filmed elements. Almost all the VFX shots in the movie were recreated using only real elements combined together. Chris Nolan was determined to keep the VFX grounded in reality and maintain the raw feeling of the actual footage.
Additionally, we now know that Nolan and Universal decided to not credit the majority of the film’s vfx crew. The film credits list 26 vfx crew, in addition to vfx supervisor Andrew Jackson. Ten of these roles are supervisors while fifteen are workers and support roles. This is a particularly high ratio of supervisors to workers, and it doesn’t make sense unless those in the management roles were overseeing a larger group of artists.
And there you have it, Oppenheimer has a VFX crew of 27 people from @dneg (including the overall VFX Sup). It looks like it’s only compositing and no CG. Congratulations to the team. The film looks amazing. Won’t spoil or review it now. I will wait a bit longer to do that. pic.twitter.com/FSsE8MCbvJ — Hugo Guerra (@HugoCGuerra) July 21, 2023
Indeed, it has now been revealed that a much larger group of people worked on the film than were actually credited. DNEG’s own website has a scrolling list of vfx crew who worked on Oppenheimer and it totals over 160 people. Meanwhile, people online have even created a spreadsheet to try and properly identify the roles of all the film’s vfx workers.

Thus, Universal and Christopher Nolan excluded over 80% of the film’s vfx crew from the credits. Why? Who knows. It certainly wasn’t a running time issue. At three hours in length, an additional 10 seconds of credits wouldn’t have made a bit of difference to the audience. But it would have meant the world to the workers who could have had a screen credit on a blockbuster film. (It’s telling that many of the workers who were left out of the credits worked at one of DNEG’s facilities in India.)
Not crediting the vfx crew is actually fairly common practice in Hollywood, and because vfx artists aren’t unionized, there is no recourse for the worker and no penalty for the studio when credits are omitted or misrepresented.
In a day and age when literally everyone connected to a film production gets a credit, from craft services to on-set teachers of child actors to random “production babies” who didn’t even work on a film, it is utterly incomprehensible that vfx artists, whose work makes possible the final images that appear onscreen, are routinely omitted from screen credits.
Oppenheimer is yet another example of how live-action filmmakers like Nolan denigrate and misrepresent the work of vfx workers to the media, and then add insult to injury by not even acknowledging them in the credits. The fact that over 125 people who contributed to Oppenheimer’s success aren’t listed in the credits is a reminder of how the vfx industry is a corrupt and broken enterprise that undermines and disrespects its workers at every juncture.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXJ0b29uYnJldy5jb20vaWRlYXMtY29tbWVudGFyeS9jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1mb3Jnb3QtdG8tY3JlZGl0LW1vcmUtdGhhbi04MC1vZi12ZngtYXJ0aXN0cy1vbi1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci0yMzA3NzUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-01 00:46:10+00:00,How Accurate is Christopher Nolan’s ‘Oppenheimer’?,A nuclear engineer reviews the blockbuster film.,"The critics rave—and I don’t disagree—that the box-office blockbuster Oppenheimer is the greatest film, or at least biopic, since Lawrence of Arabia. The cinematography is grand, the acting is fine, the pace is excellent, and the story has real importance. If, considered as a meal, most movies today are a bag of skittles, Oppenheimer is a thick juicy corn-fed Iowa steak. So, if all you need to know from a film’s review is whether you should go see it, the answer, in Oppenheimer’s case, is unquestionably yes.
But is Oppenheimer accurate?

,"An extended interview with Christopher Nolan, director of Oppenheimer","The director of the film ""Oppenheimer"" tells of how he came to choose the ""father of the atomic bomb"" as the subject of a movie, and describes how he went about translating the physicist’s sprawling life—as laid out in the 700-plus-page, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, ""American Prometheus""—into a single film.","In the middle of May, I drove to Universal Studios Hollywood and proceeded, per instruction, to Jurassic Parking (yes, that really is the name of the parking garage). I then walked down the Citywalk “street” to the Universal Cinema AMC theaters, where I watched a five-minute montage edited from the soon-to-debut Christopher Nolan film Oppenheimer.
The film clip was brisk and intriguing but not particularly revealing as to plot, so you don’t have to worry about reading further into this piece; I have no spoilers to offer (though I can say Matt Damon plays a mean Gen. Leslie Groves). After the screening, I drove to a leafy and placid part of Hollywood and what appeared to be a converted residence that serves as a cutting studio, where I spoke with Nolan about how he came to choose J. Robert Oppenheimer, the enigmatic director of the Los Alamos laboratory that birthed the atomic bomb, as the subject of a mass-market film.
For those not up on their recent Hollywood history, Nolan has directed a series of major films over the last several decades—among them Tenet, Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception and three Batman-related films known as The Dark Knight trilogy—that have featured complex narrative approaches and achieved remarkable success, commercial and critical. (Nolan’s films are said to have earned more than $5 billion in the global box office and won 11 Oscars, among 36 total Academy Awards nominations).[1]
Even taking the wide range of his previous work and predilection for innovative storytelling into account, Oppenheimer seems an ambitious choice of subject. The story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called father of the atomic bomb, certainly doesn’t lack for historical sweep. Oppenheimer was a key figure in the revolution in physics that started in December 1938, when physicists Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch [2] found that something previously thought impossible was actually happening: a uranium nucleus had split in two. Subsequent theorizing and experimentation led scientists to confirm that a chain reaction of such atomic “fissions” was possible. And that such a chain reaction could lead to a massive release in energy, dwarfing what conventional explosives produce.
The race to build an American atomic bomb before Nazi Germany could acquire one is, in its own right, a complicated and existential drama of the highest order. Many of the top physicists at Los Alamos had earlier fled the Third Reich; they knew Werner Heisenberg and other scientists in the emerging field of quantum mechanics had stayed in Germany and worked on a Nazi bomb (though how faithfully later came into question). Beyond the gargantuan task of building a secret laboratory in an isolated part of New Mexico, attracting top scientists to it, and managing their quirky and sometimes conflicting personalities, the Oppenheimer saga includes a variety of complex personal, psychological, and political strands. A polymath seemingly as interested in psychotherapy, poetry, Eastern religion, the arts, and horseback rides across the New Mexican outback as in physics, Oppenheimer was both a commanding figure—a hero of sorts to many at Los Alamos—and a sensitive, ambiguous soul of some fragility.[3]
After education at Harvard, Cambridge, and the University of Göttingen in Germany during the 1920s, Oppenheimer grew to become a major figure in US and world science as he built a physics program at the University of California, Berkeley, along with a joint appointment at the prestigious California Institute of Technology, or Caltech. His contributions to theoretical physics were important across several of its subfields, from quantum field theory to the phenomena that came to be called black holes. In California in the 1930s, Oppenheimer also developed an interest in left political causes. His membership in progressive circles that contained members of US communist and socialist groups was not particularly unusual in the context of a great depression then ravaging the US working class and the rise of fascism in Europe. Many American intellectuals on the political left felt some connection with the Soviet Union, especially as regards its support of the Republican government in the Spanish Civil War, against the fascist Nationalists of Gen. Francisco Franco.
Oppenheimer always maintained that he had never belonged to the Communist Party or taken direction from it, and the public record contains little documentary evidence to the contrary. Still, because of his interactions with a variety of people who were members of the party and allied groups, Oppenheimer became a focus of FBI surveillance and wiretapping well before he was appointed director of the Los Alamos lab.
After the war, Oppenheimer and other scientists involved in creating the first atomic bombs feared that political leaders did not fully appreciate the danger they posed. In hopes of avoiding a global nuclear arms race, some of those scientists, including Oppenheimer,[4] advocated placing nuclear technology under international control (an effort that failed, at least in the short term). A group of Manhattan Project scientists and engineers also focused on wider public education on nuclear weapons and energy (and science generally) through the creation of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists; Oppenheimer served as the first chair of the magazine’s Board of Sponsors.[5]
As the atomic bomb’s so-called father, the porkpie-hatted, cigarette-smoking Oppenheimer became a scientific celebrity in the post-World War II years, serving as director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and appearing on the covers and in the pages of major magazines. But in 1953, a former congressional aide alleged to the FBI that Oppenheimer was a Soviet spy, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered that a “blank wall be placed between Dr. Oppenheimer and secret data.”[6] Oppenheimer challenged the suspension of his security clearance, but after 19 days of highly publicized hearings, a panel of the Atomic Energy Commission’s Personnel Security Board ultimately refused to reinstate the clearance, effectively ending Oppenheimer’s government service.[7]
It was a decision that haunted Oppenheimer until his death in 1967, and one that was not rescinded until December 2022, when Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm vacated the order that stripped Oppenheimer of his security clearance “through a flawed process that violated the Commission’s own regulations. As time has passed, more evidence has come to light of the bias and unfairness of the process that Dr. Oppenheimer was subjected to while the evidence of his loyalty and love of country have only been further affirmed.”[8] Decades after the fact, records of the Oppenheimer security hearing made it clear that, rather than any disloyalty to the nation, it was his principled opposition to development of the hydrogen bomb—a nuclear fusion-based weapon of immensely greater power than the fission weapons used to decimate Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945—that was key to the decision to essentially bar him from government service.
So the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer is rich, nuanced, dramatic, politically fraught, existentially important, morally challenging—and therefore a narrative that stands out against the general run of animated superhero sequels and other Hollywood franchise fare as starkly (to my way of thinking) as Raymond Chandler’s tarantula on an angel food cake. In the following interview, I asked Nolan how he came to choose Oppenheimer as the subject of a movie and how he went about boiling down the physicist’s sprawling life—as laid out in Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s 700-plus-page, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, American Prometheus—into a manageable film script.[9] His answers constitute a cinematic origin story of sorts, and one that seemed, to me, both important and interesting during the interview and, on subsequent review, even more worthy of thoughtful attention, as Russia’s sporadic threats of nuclear weapons use in Ukraine continue.
John Mecklin: I work in a field where the material is naturally off-putting; nuclear weapons are not something that people want to talk about. So, the first thing I am interested in is: How did you come to choose Oppenheimer as a movie? It’s not Batman or something.
Christopher Nolan: No, it’s something that’s been on my radar for a number of years. I was a teenager in the ‘80s, the early ‘80s in England. It was the peak of CND, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the Greenham Common [protest]; the threat of nuclear war was when I was 12, 13, 14—it was the biggest fear we all had. I think I first encountered Oppenheimer in that relation; I think he was referred to in Sting’s song about the Russians that came out then and talks about Oppenheimer’s “deadly toys.” He was part of the pop culture then, without us knowing a lot about him.
And at some point, in the intervening decades, I got ahold of the information, the fact that the scientists at Los Alamos at a point had determined there was a small statistical possibility that the Trinity test would ignite the atmosphere and destroy all life on Earth. They couldn’t mathematically, theoretically, completely eliminate that possibility; they went ahead anyway. And that struck me as the most dramatic situation in the history of the world, with any sort of possibility being an end to life on Earth. That’s a responsibility that nobody else in the history of the world had ever faced.
I put a reference to that in my last film, Tenet; there’s dialogue, a reference to that exact situation by Oppenheimer. That film deals with a science-fiction extrapolation of that notion: Can you put the toothpaste back in the tube? The danger of knowledge, once knowledge is unveiled—once it’s known, once it’s fact—you can’t wind the clock back and put that away.
So having dealt with that, in a science-fiction sense, at the end of that film, I was sort of left with that as a hanging question. And actually, Robert Pattinson, who’s in Tenet, as a wrap gift, he gave me a book of Oppenheimer speeches, post-World War II speeches. And reading those and reading about the great minds of that time, in the early ‘50s, trying to wrestle with and create some kind of intellectual framework by which to understand and deal with a new existential threat, the first ever truly existential threat to life on Earth—it’s a frightening time to read about, when it’s so new. Then over the decades, we’ve managed to dress it up in all kinds of policy statements, philosophical discussions, you know, all the rest. So, we’ve got generations of people giving intellectual context to the idea of Armageddon, which disguises it and makes it all feel a bit more acceptable as part of the life that we’ve grown up with under the shadow of the bomb. And other than the Bulletin and the Doomsday Clock, [that’s all we have] to remind people of the terrible situation we’re in.
My goal when making the film—I don’t make films to send a message, I made it because it’s a fascinating story. But part of that storytelling is getting back to basics about the bomb, stripping away policy statements, philosophy, the geopolitical situation and just looking at raw power that’s about to be unleashed and what that means for the people involved and means for all of us.
Mecklin: So that was obviously a long runway, a long period of interest. When you sit down to write your screenplay, as I understand, basically based on the American Prometheus book—I mean, that book is 700 pages, and it covers a lot of ground. Just talk a little bit about what the process of getting to a movie is.
Nolan: The process was an interesting one because of everything that makes American Prometheus firstly such a brilliant record of Oppenheimer’s life and interpretation of Oppenheimer’s life. But everything that makes it seem daunting as adaptation is what I found wonderful to adapt, because dealing with real life, with history, and in trying to then make an entertainment from it, an expressive dramatic piece—your biggest hindrance as a screenwriter is authority, is knowledge. I’m not a scientist; I have no way to become a scientist in the period of time it would take me to write the script. You look to experts and expert knowledge.
So, in the past, I’ve collaborated with [Caltech physicist and Nobel laureate] Kip Thorne, for example, on Interstellar and on Tenet. With American Prometheus, Kai Bird and Marty Sherwin (and Marty Sherwin in particular spent 25 years researching the book)—there is an enormous amount of authoritative information, every rock’s been lifted, no stone left unturned. And so, you’re then dealing with an enormous amount of knowledge that, thankfully, has an index at the back. So, once you’ve read it, you can say, “Hang on, what was that bit about [Edward] Teller?” [and] you can look at all the references. And so it was this incredible wealth of knowledge to be able to then start writing a much more subjective script from. I took the view of wanting to tell the story from Oppenheimer’s point of view. That’s what I got from Kai and Martin’s book; I got a feeling of what it is to be this guy, what’s going on in his head. And I felt like that’s the movie.
Mecklin: He’s a tough someone to pin down. I mean, he is ambiguous, shifting, whatever. Did you find that fun to try to put into a movie, or…
Nolan: Yeah, if you look at the films that I’ve made, I’ve always been drawn to ambiguous storytellers, possibly unreliable narrators, people who have interesting layers—those are the characters, right? You know, back to Bruce Wayne, Batman, all the rest, I was interested in characters who in some sense are imprisoned by paradox, who are at the mercy of paradox. And so, for me, it was a very natural fit. And the fact that his story is real, verifiable documentary record, history, really frees you up to just take the audience on the journey. But [for] my interpretation—and ultimately Cillian Murphy’s interpretation of what’s going on in his head, his interior state, which we’re trying to represent—we’ve got a lot of information about where he went, how he got there, what he did.
I’ve always actually favored the medieval, Middle English approach to characterization to the more modern, psychological, novelistic approach to characterization in film, because in film, character defined through action has always been the strongest, because it’s visual, and it’s narrative-based; it’s for me the strongest, most interesting form of building character and characterization. And so, in approaching Oppenheimer, my feeling was by researching, looking at what he said and what he did—where they’re the same, where they’re different—you start to get a sense of the contradictory impulses, and how he dealt with these impossible situations that he was put into.
Mecklin: It’s certainly an open field. In the book, everybody has a slightly different view of who Oppenheimer is. Was he a communist, wasn’t he, all of that. So, I’ll be fascinated to see how he’s handled.
Nolan: He is the ultimate Rorschach test. I believe you see in the Oppenheimer story all that is great and all that is terrible about America’s uniquely modern power in the world. It’s a very, very American story. And there are no simple answers to the questions that it raises, and anyone claiming simple answers to Oppenheimer’s story, let alone to the film itself, is definitely ignoring certain aspects.
Mecklin: These are subjects that deal with physics; physicists are notably persnickety about facts and details. Did you have science advisors along the way, looking at what you’ve done or at the script?
Nolan: I did. We had a very helpful chap from UCLA, David Saltzberg, who was helping us with certain scientific aspects on set. We also brought Kip Thorne into the fold because we’d worked with Kip on a couple of movies. Kip attended Princeton, among other institutions, and while at Princeton went to seminars at the [Institute for Advanced Studies] under Oppenheimer and actually met him; he actually watched him teach. And so I was able to put Kip on the phone with Cillian—and then he visited the set—to talk about what it was like to watch Oppenheimer manage a group of minds in a seminar, how he would organize a debate, how he would apparently listen to all these different points of view and summarize them very, very efficiently and eloquently, and move the dialogue forward.
Kip was also able to answer some of my questions about, for example, there’s a moment where [physicist and subsequently Nobel laureate] Luis Alvarez, [physicist and Nobel laureate] Ernest Lawrence, and Oppenheimer, reading about the splitting of the atom in Germany, apparently then immediately went off and proved on the board that it couldn’t be done. So, of course, we then have to portray it as, “Okay, what does he write on the board?” So, Kip was able to go into it and say, “Okay, this is what we think he may have written. And this is what’s wrong with it; this is where the mistake is, if you like.”
Mecklin: Wow, that’s fascinating. You would think, trying to introduce a general audience to fission, fusion, quantum mechanics, trying to get that into a movie narrative—it must have been some trick.
Nolan: Well, luckily, I’ve had a bit of practice, because my last couple of films have gone in pretty hard on some of the aspects of the science, of the physics, where they create dramatic opportunity. And the thing about fission and fusion, the thing about the revolutionary nature of quantum physics in the 1920s, that’s very dramatic, when you’re dealing with a person’s life. You’re dealing with people who were engaged in a revolutionary reappraisal of the laws of the universe, just as Picasso and other artists were engaged in a revolutionary reappraisal of aesthetic art, of visual representation, just as Stravinsky, you know, was there writing all his music, and indeed, Marx, the communists—that is to say, moving on from Marx, the communist 1920s, the Russian Revolution. I mean, you’re literally rewriting all aspects of the rules whereby we live, physics being the most radical of any of those. So the difference between classical physics and quantum physics is extraordinarily dramatic, even if you can’t understand it.
I can’t explain to the audience—I could barely understand myself—what those differences really constitute, where Einstein’s theory of relativity really takes us. But everybody knows who Einstein is, everybody knows the theory of relativity as a thing that happened, that changed the world. And it lets me position Oppenheimer at the most exciting time in physics, when, literally, the laws of the universe are reappraised and looked at in a completely different way. It’s a paradigm shift that’s, I think, really very unprecedented.
It’s kind of an amazing time. And then, of course, as you start to research and look at the drama of his story and where it then went, where this revolutionary fervor actually wound up—that’s when so many revolutions wound up in a pretty awful place. So trying to give the audience the terms and the grounding, just enough to know that yes, we can’t explain to the audience how quantum physics is different, just that it is radically different.
The difference between fission and fusion becomes very important in terms of the atom bomb versus the hydrogen bomb, how that plays into the politics, the situation where Oppenheimer is, where Teller is. That’s a very relatable human dynamic between the guys interested in fission and the guys interested in fusion and the conflict between them. So I was able, in the screenplay and then the finished film, to build on the sort of pop culture understanding of some of these concepts, because people know the A-bomb, and they know the H-bomb. Do they know the difference between them? No, not really, but that we can explain in the film. So there are lots of ways in which we’re able to dramatize the scientific concepts.
But there are a lot of ways in which—this is what my brother and I found working with Kip on Interstellar—a lot of ways in which the science itself is so dramatic, the theory itself is what’s presenting the possibility of the end of the world, the possibility of enormous destruction, really fearful destruction. These are the most dramatic stakes imaginable. So following the science leads you to some very, very extreme dramatic situations. And as a filmmaker, that’s really what you’re after.
Mecklin: It’s a real departure from the day-to-day ignoring of the ultimate meaning of nuclear weapons. They really could end the Earth, and most people don’t really have a concept of nuclear weapons, or the difference in their sizes. How important was it to you in portraying the Trinity test, or whatever nuclear explosions are going to be portrayed in your movie, and how did you come to the decision about “We’re going to do it [the Trinity test] this way.”
Nolan: The first person we showed the script to after Emma Thomas [my producing partner] was Andrew Jackson, who has been my visual effects supervisor in the last couple movies. Because what I wanted to say to him right out of the gate was, “In this film, we’re going to try and portray the inner state of the character, we’re going to try and show atomic activity, we’re trying to show the quantum world to a degree, which is something that’s unshowable and might obviously lend itself to fancy computer graphics. I don’t want to use any computer graphics for that. We’ve got to show the Trinity test, we’ve got to show the destruction of that; I don’t want to use any computer graphics for that.”
In one of my previous films we portrayed an atomic explosion using CG, and whilst I thought the team did a very good job, and technically the result was good, it confirms to me something that I’ve always felt about computer graphics, which is they tend to feel inherently, in the subconscious of the audience, that they’re animations; they’re not something that’s been photographed in the real world. And so there isn’t really a feeling of danger. And in The Dark Knight Rises, where we have the nuclear explosion, it’s not meant to feel particularly dangerous at the time, because the danger is past, it’s happening out to sea, it’s far enough away.
The point of the Trinity test being there for that birth of atomic weaponry, you want to be terrified. You want it to be beautiful but also frightening, and things that are photographed for real, they’re going to inherently have more weight to them, they’re going to have that threat. Computer graphics tends to feel a bit safer. It’s one thing if the whole film was fanciful. But if the whole film was grounded and real and recognizable as the world we live in, you want this most important event of the film to be equally valid, to have the weight of reality to it. So Andrew thought long and hard about ways in which to photograph real things, both microscopic and macroscopic; he collaborated with our special effects coordinator. Visual effects are the things you do in post-production: optical effects, computer graphics, all those kinds of things that you do after the fact. And special effects are what you do on the floor with the actors, in the moment. Scott Fisher does our special effects, has done for years. He worked very closely with Andrew on some small-scale things to photograph that could be proxies for bigger events and could use the scale of things but also some massive explosions on set that the actors were tied in with; they were there. By using different frame rates and forced perspectives and different combinations of chemicals—magnesium flares in combination with black powder explosions and petrol—to create a variety of explosive effects that could stand in for the Trinity test. Rather than detonating a real atomic bomb, which would be a little extreme (laughs).
Mecklin: Extremely extreme. But it sounds like fun.
Nolan: It was a lot of fun. And they took a very long time to do it. But where their methods became very interesting to me was in the attempts to visualize the quantum world. Because what we were looking for, and what I think we managed to achieve, was a combination of shooting very large things and shooting very tiny things. There is a confusion of scale in the imagery. Are we looking at distant stars and planets or are we looking at atoms and molecules? You don’t quite know; the scales are confused. And to me, one of the most fascinating things about quantum mechanics and everything that’s come from it is this shift between the absolute tiniest things that we know of and the largest that we know of, and both being clearly defined by, determined by, the same set of rules. It’s what’s in the middle that gets a bit complicated, and the interactions between quantum physics and that world in the middle that we all live in, the human-scale world, are some of the most destructive things imaginable. The micro and the macro, the sort of two ends of the scale, I think, are really fascinating.
Mecklin: Do you have any thoughts or expectations about what the response to your movie might be? I know that everybody wants it to be a great success, and you think it’s obviously good. But it really is a touchy subject. Right?
Nolan: I have shown the film to a lot of people by this point; it is a Rorschach test that prompts a variety of responses. There are people who come out of the film literally speechless. They can’t talk; they’re upset in some way. They’ve enjoyed the film, but they don’t understand why they’ve enjoyed it. It’s a very conflicted set of feelings that the film gives you. And that was the goal, that peculiar mixture of emotions, and from the responses so far, we seem to have achieved that. How that fits into the culture, I have no real way of knowing until after it happens. We give it to the audience, and it becomes theirs. What I do know is that, in the history of movies, there are many times in which a complicated emotional response or subject matter can be very powerful for people, can be very entertaining.
Entertaining is a sort of reductive word, we tend to think of that as happy, funny things, whatever, but it’s not. It’s about engagement. It’s about: Does the film resonate with people, do they think about it afterward, do they tell other people to go see it, and that kind of thing? And movies embrace all sorts of different types of engagement. So yes, this is a complicated form of engagement that we’re after. And we’re looking for an extremity of response, an emotional response that’s not necessarily clear-cut. But the film does seem to resonate with people. It does seem to mean something to people. And I think, as a filmmaker, that’s all you can hope for. What that translates to in the culture, we’ll see.
Mecklin: The other current-day question I have is: Obviously, you started this movie well before the invasion of Ukraine. But that invasion has happened since then, and Vladimir Putin and various people in his government have threatened to use nuclear weapons. I’d just like to hear you talk about what you think about your movie being birthed into that current reality.
Nolan: Well, you don’t have any way of knowing the circumstances of the world in which your film will be released, because you started years before. And when I first started writing Oppenheimer, I remember clearly a conversation I had with one of my teenage sons where I told him what I was working on. And he literally said to me, “Well, nobody really worries about nuclear weapons anymore. Are people going to be interested in that?” And, of course, my response to that at the time was, “We should be, and maybe the film would help with that.” But, of course, what then in awful, actual fact has happened is the world has once again been reminded of the threat. Which is, you know, it’s a terrible circumstance. It’s a terrible circumstance. But certainly, our intention with the film—whatever world it was coming out into—absolutely part of the intention of the film is to reiterate the unique and extraordinary danger of nuclear weapons. That’s something we should all be thinking about all the time and care about very, very deeply. But obviously, it’s extraordinarily troubling that the geopolitical situation would have deteriorated once again to the extent that it’s being talked about in the news.
Mecklin: Well, I appreciate you taking all this time to talk to me. So, I think I will turn to a final question: Did anything about making the movie change your mind, change how you think about nuclear weapons? Did it make you more, or less, or the same concerned about this world situation?
Nolan: It’s a hard question to answer. I think the honest answer is that, the deeper into the research I got, and the more that we all talked and thought about it, there’s a phase in which the more you know about nuclear weapons, you start to see them as more ordinary armaments. Because you’re comparing, for example, atomic munitions with hydrogen weapons, so you’re starting to engage in the slippery slope of looking at the scale of things, and how many people were killed by this particular device, you’re starting to get used to the analysis of these things.
Mecklin: You’re normalizing the killing of tens of thousands of people.
Nolan: You’re normalizing killing tens of thousands of people. You’re creating moral equivalences, false equivalences with other types of conflict, et cetera, et cetera. So, you’re going down a lot of different roads toward a more accepting, normalizing of the danger. But then that ultimately leads you around to: That’s the real danger. And that’s when, you know, even Oppenheimer himself, when you start talking to the Army about let’s bring battle back to the battlefield and start talking about tactical nukes—that’s the conversation that I now am most afraid of, because I hear that from both sides of the political spectrum, not just from Putin. I feel we’re in a world now where people are starting to once again talk about those things as some kind of acceptable possibility for our world. And, of course, if we want to think about how nuclear Armageddon ultimately is probably going to happen, is it going to be some Dr. Strangelove-type scenario with bombers getting the wrong signal? I think it’s far more likely to be the normalizing of atomic weapons at the beginning, the use of tactical nukes leading to larger- and larger-scale conflict that will ultimately destroy the planet. So yeah, I came away with a different understanding, a different set of fears that ultimately are founded on the same ultimate fear, which is that the world is going to be destroyed by these things.

On the surface, the release of ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Barbie"" on the same weekend seems to be because of an overcrowded summer movie season, resulting in a playful box-office battle that the internet has dubbed ""Barbenheimer.""
The reality, though, is a little more complicated and may have something to do with the recent skirmish between the ""Oppenheimer"" director, Christopher Nolan, and Warner Bros., the studio releasing ""Barbie.""
For most of his career, Nolan released his movies through Warner Bros. Starting with 2002's ""Insomnia,"" the studio released some of his most beloved titles like ""Inception,"" ""Dunkirk,"" and his ""Dark Knight"" trilogy.
But that changed soon after the studio released his 2020 film, ""Tenet,"" exclusively in theaters during the height of the pandemic. When the studio's parent company, WarnerMedia, made the shocking decision in late 2020 to release its 2021 slate exclusively on its streaming service, HBO Max, Nolan lambasted the move.

""Some of our industry's biggest filmmakers and most important movie stars went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the worst streaming service,"" Nolan said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter in December 2020.
Then, in September 2021, Deadline reported that Nolan would be making his next movie about the atomic-bomb creator, J. Robert Oppenheimer, at Universal.
As theatrical-release dates began to fill the 2023 calendar, ""Oppenheimer"" was scheduled for July 21 — not a surprise, given that mid-July has been Nolan's preferred-release week for his films since 2008's ""The Dark Knight (save for ""Interstellar,"" which opened in November; ""Tenet"" would have also opened in mid-July if it weren't for the pandemic).
But a new title also showed up on that date: the ""Barbie"" movie Warner Bros has been developing for years.

Was this a coincidence, or was this Warner Bros. enacting some form of payback on Nolan? Would Warner Bros. be so petty that it would purposely attempt to undercut the auteur that used to be a star in its stable?
I had to ask Nolan himself.

Sources said Nolan was upset that ""Barbie"" was scheduled for release on the same weekend as ""Oppenheimer""
""Have you seen 'Barbie' yet?"" I asked Nolan at a press event for ""Oppenheimer.""
""No,"" he said. It was a curt response with a hint of disinterest.

I told him my theory that ""Barbenheimer"" was born through his complex history with Warner Bros.
""Now, you must know I'm not going to answer that question,"" he said with a chuckle, ""only to say those who care about the theatrical experience, we've been longing for a crowded marketplace with a lot of different movies. That's what theaters have now, and those of us who care about movies are thrilled about that.""
Margot Robbie in ""Barbie."" Warner Bros. Pictures
Four sources familiar with the matter said Nolan wasn't nearly as diplomatic in his stance behind the scenes. The sources — who didn't authorize Insider to use their names as they didn't have the authority to speak on the matter publicly — told Insider that Nolan was upset that Warner Bros. scheduled ""Barbie"" for release on the same weekend as ""Oppenheimer,"" especially since mid-July has been known in the movie business as ""Nolan's weekend"" for years.
There was even an attempt by the movie-theater community, in which Nolan is beloved, to convince Warner Bros. to move the release date of ""Barbie."" But two of the sources said the studio wouldn't budge. Insider contacted Warner Bros. for comment on this story but did not receive a response.

The showdown between ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Barbie"" is rare because studios typically want to keep their big releases away from other major titles because opening on the same weekend can result in fewer box-office dollars for both.
But clearly, Warner Bros. feels ""Barbie"" is up for the challenge. The studio has blitzed the public with promotion for months: First came the on-set shots of Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken dressed in matching roller-blading outfits. Then came the instantly memed character posters, stories about ""pink days"" on set, and news of the film contributing to an international shortage of pink paint.
Meanwhile, Universal has stayed surprisingly quiet about ""Oppenheimer."" Outside of revealing a countdown clock and ominous trailers featuring the film's star, Cillian Murphy, there hasn't been much information about the movie — and most people are shocked when I tell them Florence Pugh is in it.
Awareness is set to increase soon — Universal held a press junket for ""Oppenheimer"" in New York City this past weekend — but is it too late? Early box-office forecasts said that ""Barbie"" would earn about $80 million in its first three days and that ""Oppenheimer"" would take in only $40 million.

Now here's the crazy part: Warner Bros. wants Nolan back!
Despite all this, don't be surprised if Nolan returns to Warner Bros.
""Oppenheimer."" Universal
In June, Variety reported that the new heads of Warner Bros., Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy, want Nolan to return. The magazine reported that they sent the director a seven-figure royalty check for ""Tenet"" in an attempt to extend an olive branch.
On top of all that, I've been told by a source that Nolan and Emma Thomas, his wife who is also his producing partner, still have an office on the studio lot.
After all this, could Nolan really go back to Warner Bros.? Some sources tell me a decision to return would be less about ""Barbenheimer"" and more about the respect Nolan and Thomas have for De Luca and Abdy.

But the Universal head Donna Langley isn't going to give up Nolan without a fight, either. Insider contacted Universal for comment on this story but did not receive a response.
As many moviegoers happily plan a ""Barbenheimer"" double feature (I suggest seeing the intense, three-hour ""Oppenheimer"" first, and then finishing with the fun ""Barbie""), Nolan will have to begin soul-searching to decide his best path forward.
And if recent history has taught us anything, we shouldn't be shocked by decisions made in Hollywood. If Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel can work together again, don't be surprised if Nolan and Warner Bros. patch things up, too.

2023-07-22 14:32:02+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Barbie’ Breaks Ground With Biggest Opening Day of 2023, ‘Oppenheimer’ Dolling Up to $77 Million Debut","Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" and Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" are both impressing in their box office openings.","Greta Gerwig’s hot pink fantasia “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s intricately bleak historical drama “Oppenheimer” are both putting up box office openings to remember. In a summer movie season that has largely failed to keep spirits up, two bona fide blockbusters are showing that everyone can be a winner.
But the more winning winner between the two — the number one movie in North America — is Warner Bros. Discovery’s “Barbie.” After scoring $22.2 million on Thursday, the highest preview ticket sales of the year, the big screen bonanza about Mattel’s marquee doll kept the superlatives going on Friday, adding another $48.2 million from 4,243 theaters. That’s a $70.5 million total — the biggest opening day of the year, blasting past the $51.8 million earned by “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” in June.
The pink wave may not stop there, as “Barbie” now looks to score the biggest three-day debut of 2023. In the crosshairs is another branding flex — “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” which landed $146.3 million in three days in April (as a caveat, the film opened with Tuesday previews and also played through the Easter holiday, drawing $224 million through that stretch). That animated feature currently stands as the highest-grossing release of the year, with $573 million domestically and $1.34 billion worldwide.
Gerwig’s “Barbie” also has a shot at scoring the biggest opening weekend ever for a feature with a female director. “Captain Marvel,” co-helmed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, earned $153 million in its 2019 opening. The record for a feature solely directed by a woman is currently held by Patty Jenkins’ “Wonder Woman” at $103 million, which “Barbie” will easily surpass.
All of this is to say, “Barbie” has gone boom. The film was a gambit by Mattel to enter the filmmaking space, costing $145 million to produce, not to mention more spending for a ubiquitous marketing campaign that went down to bus stop benches being painted pink and a Dreamhouse in Malibu. Reviews are glowing with a 90% approval rating from top critics on aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes and audiences are also ecstatic, as indicated by the enthusiastic “A” Cinema Score grade determined by surveying the first round of moviegoers. This weekend is proving to be an eruption, but the summer is far from over for “Barbie.”
Starring Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, the comedy follows the iconic doll as she travels from the fantastical Barbieland to the real world — which has some problems! The deep bench of ensemble talent includes Issa Rae, America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, Simu Liu, Helen Mirren, Will Ferrell and many more.
The penultimate weekend of July had become Christopher Nolan territory over the past few years, as the renowned filmmaker opened two of his last four features (“The Dark Knight Rises,” “Dunkirk”) in that slot. (“Tenet” was also originally slated for it, but faced release delays due to the COVID pandemic.) Months after Nolan exited Warner Bros. and voiced blistering frustrations about the then-current leadership’s lack of commitment to exclusive theatrical releases, Warner Bros. followed up — arguably retaliated — by dating “Barbie” for the same weekend as Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” which the director had brought to Universal.
What once seemed like a contentious collision course now seems to have proven nothing but fruitful. “Barbie” may be winning the weekend, but “Oppenheimer” is still impressing. Playing in 3,610 locations, the sweeping biopic earned $33 million on its opening day, which includes $10.5 million in Thursday previews.
“Oppenheimer” is now looking to rank among the biggest opening weekends ever for an R-rated release. At the top of that list are a swath of franchise films, like “Deadpool” and its sequel, “It” and its sequel, plus the “Batman” spinoff “Joker” (which has already shot its own sequel). The film is currently projecting $77 million through Sunday, which would put it behind only “The Passion of the Christ” ($83 million) among the highest openings ever for a non-IP R-rated film — and the titular role of “Passion” has a bit more of a built-in fanbase than J. Robert Oppenheimer, to say the least.
The Nolan feature is also strongly benefitting from its showtimes in Imax auditoriums and other premium formats, which come with increased ticket prices. The filmmaker has a longstanding relationship with Imax, shooting large fractions of his features with the company’s heavy-duty cameras. (Also of note, the performance of “Barbie” is all the more impressive because it isn’t playing Imax auditoriums.) “Oppenheimer” is shaping up to be the third-biggest opening of Nolan’s career, behind “The Dark Knight” and “The Dark Knight Rises.”
On top of that, Nolan features tend to stick around in theaters. “Interstellar” and “Dunkirk” nearly quadrupled their opening weekend numbers in their final domestic earnings. Even “Tenet” legged out to $58.5 million after its wide release debut of $9 million — in a time before a widely distributed COVID vaccine no less. “Oppenheimer” has drawn some of the strongest reviews of Nolan’s career (a 96% approval rating from top critics on Rotten Tomatoes), but — even more encouraging — audiences seem to have truly taken to the despairing three-hour epic, as inferred by the sterling “A” grade through Cinema Score. With strong buzz and already some good fortunes for awards season, “Oppenheimer” has the right stuff to keep drawing audiences in.
The film follows the life of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy, who was tapped by the U.S. military to spearhead the construction of the first atomic bomb. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Casey Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Benny Safdie, Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek and many others also star.
Paramount’s “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” had Imax screens snagged away by “Oppenheimer” after only eight and a half days of showtimes. Without premium ticket prices in play, the Tom Cruise sequel is facing a sizable tumble of about 62% in its second weekend, projecting a $21 million haul. That’d be much steeper than the 54% drop that “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” took in its sophomore outing.
That isn’t exactly what Paramount wants to see for a “Mission: Impossible” entry, which typically show formidable endurance at the box office. The previous two installments, “Fallout” and “Rogue Nation,” fell only 42% and 48% in their sophomore outings, respectively. Even as “Dead Reckoning” continues the critical hot streak for the series, that buzz isn’t translating to a very strong hold. Adding to the pain, this was by far the most expensive franchise entry yet, ballooning to a $300 million production price tag due to costly COVID-related delays and safety measures.
Domestic total should reach $120 million by Sunday, but “Mission: Impossible” has always been a stronger performer overseas. The series often finds more than two-thirds of its total gross in international markets. “Dead Reckoning” looks to maintain that pattern to keep afloat in the coming weeks.
“Mission: Impossible” might lose third place to Angel Studios’ “Sound of Freedom,” which continues to impress in its third weekend of release. Rivals are estimating a $20.1 million haul for the human-trafficking thriller, which would mark a slim 26% tumble — this after sales actually went up a staggering 38% last weekend. The film has proven controversial — Rolling Stone deemed “Sound of Freedom” a “QAnon-tinged thriller” that targets “the conscience of a conspiracy-addled boomer” — but it has certainly proven to have a target audience. Total domestic gross stands at $124 million, with no real signs of slowing down.
Religious and conservative media groups have rallied behind “Sound of Freedom.” Angel Studios has also instituted an unconventional “Pay It Forward” system, allowing people to donate money to the distribution banner so that the studio can purchase tickets for its own movie and distribute them for free. The company touts the initiative as a tool to raise awareness of its subject matter.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” looks to take fifth place, adding $1.9 million on Friday. The Harrison Ford finale didn’t exactly light up the box office since its disappointing debut in June, but it hasn’t fallen like a stone since then. In its fourth weekend of release, the adventure film will push close to a $160 million domestic gross through Sunday.
Lionsgate is also opening its horror film “Cobweb” in 310 theaters this weekend. Rivals are projecting a $450,000 weekend gross for the genre spin.
Additionally, Searchlight Pictures is expanding “Theater Camp” into 51 locations after debuting in six New York and Los Angeles venues last weekend. The ensemble comedy added $113,000 on Friday, up only 2% from its more limited opening.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItb3BlbmluZy1kYXktcHJvamVjdGlvbnMtMTIzNTY3NjY4MS_SAW5odHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL2JveC1vZmZpY2UtYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLW9wZW5pbmctZGF5LXByb2plY3Rpb25zLTEyMzU2NzY2ODEvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The script behind Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer” has jumped to the top of bestseller lists on Amazon following the film’s smashing blockbuster release last month.
Oppenheimer $17.95 $16.16 Buy Now On Amazon
The film, based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book “American Prometheus,” tells the definitive story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the father of the atomic bomb. The film, starring Cillian Murphy as the eponymous scientist, pulls straight from the 700-page biography, which traces Oppenheimer’s life starting with his time at Cambridge, where he earned a reputation as an intellectual prodigy. As a physicist, Oppenheimer made significant contributions to quantum mechanics and theoretical physics, earning him great respect among his peers.
The narrative takes a dramatic turn with the onset of World War II, when Oppenheimer was appointed as the scientific director of the Manhattan Project, a top-secret government initiative aimed at developing the first atomic bomb. His leadership and organizational skills were instrumental to the project, which culminated with the devastating nuclear weapons dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing over 200,000 Japanese people.
In his introduction to the screenplay, Bird praises Nolan’s skill in extremely complex life story and miraculously turning it into “visual art that is faithful both to the history and the man.”
When Bird read Nolan’s screenplay, he was “struck by how faithful it was to the book, capturing what was always most important to Sherwin: the paradoxes at the heart of Oppenheimer’s character and the intimate details that dovetailed with enormous plate shifts of world history.”

2023-07-18 20:00:56+00:00,Why 'Oppenheimer' director Christopher Nolan doesn't use a smartphone,"Nolan revealed that his ""kids would probably say I'm a complete Luddite"" because of how tech-averse he is in his working life.","Director Christopher Nolan is well known for avoiding computer generated effects in his films when possible, preferring instead to capture all the action in-camera. But Nolan's penchant for doing things the old-fashioned way goes beyond what moviegoers see on screen.
In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter this week, Nolan revealed that his ""kids would probably say I'm a complete Luddite"" because of how tech-averse he is in his working life.
The ""Tenet"" director, who in 2020 told People that he uses a flip phone over a smartphone, said that he chooses to not get too ""involved"" with technology so as to maintain focus.
""It's about the level of distraction,"" Nolan said. ""If I'm generating my material and writing my own scripts, being on a smartphone all day wouldn't be very useful for me.""
Back in 2020, he described himself as ""easily distractible.""
""I don't really want to have access to the internet every time when I'm bored,"" he said at the time. ""I do a lot of my best thinking in those kind of in-between moments that people now fill with online activity, so it benefits me.""
But his old-school ways don't stop there. The computer that the 52-year-old writes his scripts on isn't connected to the internet, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
Nolan also prefers to hand deliver his scripts to actors rather than sending them digitally. While he said this has given him a reputation for working ""in secrecy,"" Nolan said the truth is anything but.
""It's not secrecy, it's privacy,"" he said. ""It's being able to try things, to make mistakes, to be as adventurous as possible. And to be able to sit with somebody who's just read what you've written and get their take on it, see how they connect with it in a very human, face-to-face way.""
Dating back to his 2000 breakout hit ""Memento,"" Nolan has written every one of his films save for 2002's ""Insomnia."" His latest movie, the hotly anticipated ""Oppenheimer,"" will hit theaters on July 21.

2023-07-27 08:29:48.826000+00:00,Christopher Nolan Has Earned Filmgoers’ Trust Like No Other Director,"Ever since the runaway success of “The Dark Knight,” the director has proven to audiences that there’s fun to be had in watching something cerebral—especially on a big scale.","Over the next few weeks, we’re going to hear a lot about what “Barbenheimer” really means for the film industry. One movie massively exceeding expectations is, these days, a major event. But two over a single weekend? Barbie and Oppenheimer—the yin-and-yang hits of this summer movie season, radically different spectacles united through the unexpected good luck of concurrent release—will surely inspire a lot of reactive thinking on the part of studios hoping to replicate the phenomenon of their joint success. If Hollywood learns any lessons from Barbenheimer, however, it’ll probably be the wrong ones.
One of the simplest takeaways of this past weekend is more of a forceful reminder of something that should be conventional wisdom, even gospel for executives by now: Christopher Nolan, the writer, director, producer, and reigning blockbuster visionary of our age, can turn just about anything into a hit. Oppenheimer, much more so than Barbie, is the traditional definition of a tough sell. It’s a three-hour drama about quantum physics and McCarthyism, a summer movie set in laboratories and courtrooms; it’s a true gabfest blown up to IMAX proportions. Movies like this don’t make big money, especially not in 2023. Except, apparently, when they have Nolan’s name on them.
Oppenheimer, which opened to a staggering $80 million domestically last weekend, doesn’t simply count as another smash in a career full of them. It also feels like a culmination of Nolan’s whole deal: his heartening, unfashionable tendency to respect the intelligence of his audience. Cinephiles may debate how truly ""deep"" his blockbusters are, but there’s no denying that almost all of them are conceptually audacious, applying complicated structural gimmicks to their narratives and traipsing into matters of theoretical science. Nolan trusts viewers to keep up with the pretzel logic of his movies. Remarkably, those viewers have rewarded his trust over and over again, by coming out in droves to each new picture, undeterred—maybe even exhilarated—by the very real possibility that it will require some intellectual labor.
Tracing the arc of Nolan’s career backwards, Memento-style, takes you to the origins of his reputation for crafting uncommonly brainy blockbusters: 2008’s The Dark Knight, still the biggest hit he’s ever helmed. The success of that magisterial superhero movie, the middle chapter of his seminal Batman trilogy, wrote a blank check that he’s been cashing ever since. The movie was such a sensation—not just a record-breaking box-office juggernaut, but one of those rare films that seems to dominate the entire pop-cultural attention span for months on end—that it all but guaranteed its maker some runway, the ability to chase his muse out of the franchise trenches.
More than simply buying him that leeway, The Dark Knight also made Nolan one of the few Hollywood filmmakers that can be called a household name. He used the plum gig to assert his interests and personality—to tell the world, through the big stage of a big event picture, that this is what you could expect from a Christopher Nolan movie. His later films would push further into his particular obsessions, but the funneling of big ideas through IMAX-scaled entertainment begins with The Dark Knight. It’s a comic-book movie about chaos and order, cause and effect, and whether ends justify means—a Batman movie that sells the vision of its filmmaker as much as it sells Batman.
Arriving between this historic success and the less rapturously received closing chapter of the Dark Knight saga, Inception was the true test of Nolan’s stature—and the movie that solidified his standing as a reliable purveyor of big-idea blockbusters, the thinking man’s Hollywood hitmaker. ""From the writer-director of The Dark Knight"" may have put asses in seats, but his follow-up’s runaway popularity dispelled any concerns that Nolan was a flash in the pan, that his powers might weaken beyond Gotham City limits. Without the safety net of beloved intellectual property, the director thrust audiences into a heist movie of M.C. Escher complexity: a brain-bending sci-fi action picture that layered its dream reality like nesting dolls, daring audiences to keep track of multiple planes of dilemma unfolding at different speeds.
The convoluted nature of Inception’s plotting would inspire lots of jokes at its expense (Dan Harmon had a field day), but it wouldn’t hurt the movie. Quite to the contrary, that byzantine structure made it a must-see in summer 2010, amassing fans with each sold-out screening. What became clear quickly was that viewers weren’t putting up with the bewildering-but-plainly thought-out zig zag of Nolan’s storytelling as a tradeoff for the more conventional pleasures, the zero-gravity fights and city-folding special-effects shots. They were actually feeding on the brain candy Nolan provided, getting hooked on the way he sent their minds racing to keep up with the implications of the premise.
Inception, with its twisty temporal mechanics and teasingly ambiguous ending, made Nolan into his own brand, nearly as bankable as that of the masked superhero he sent into action once more afterwards. His name became a promise of a certain kind of rare theatrical experience: a big-budget contraption that would buzz the brain as surely as it quickened the pulse. In the years after, Nolan would continue to issue comprehension challenges to his audiences, and those audiences would continue to rise to them every time. He didn’t need a blank check anymore; each new hit paid for the next one.
2014’s Interstellar is a gushy, all-the-feels space odyssey built on a foundation of hard science fiction. The film tells a tender father-daughter story through the lens of time’s cruel relativity and with a lot of dense jargon. Dunkirk, released in 2017, is a war film of rare immediacy, reducing WWII to a series of ticking-clock, life-and-death scenarios by air, land, and sea. It also happens to take the Matryoshka games of Inception even further, crosscutting the timeline into three distinct stories—one set over roughly a week, another set over a day, and the last set over a single hour, all converging at the exact same point in time and space. And 2020’s Tenet might be the most proudly, stubbornly confounding exercise in espionage action ever inflicted upon moviegoers: The film’s Rubik’s Cube inscrutability begins with its very conceit—the inversion of cause and effect on which the increasingly befuddling time-travel hijinks all rest.
Again, whether Nolan’s movies are as smart as his biggest fans insist they are is a matter of opinion, and irrelevant besides. They are undeniably cerebral in basic shape, especially for movies of their budget. More importantly, they don’t hold the viewer’s hand or over-explain themselves; they count on us to work out their loopy structural games, and to keep pace with the way they fold into themselves. That just about all of them have been big hits—Tenet, the exception, has the excuse of opening in the throes of the pandemic, an unwise decision for multiple reasons—is proof that Nolan has turned the promise of a mental workout into a selling point. At this point, people go to his films with the expectation, maybe even the hope, that they’ll have to work out what they’re seeing. His movies make you feel smart for keeping up.
Oppenheimer might be the ultimate consummation of that special relationship between director and fanbase. It’s a new benchmark in Nolan’s ongoing project to treat the multiplex masses like adults, intellectually capable and curious. Beyond its inherently heady subject matter, Oppenheimer is another structural wonder, applying a sophisticated nonlinear framework to historical events. This time, Nolan takes his cues from actual scientific theory, coding the separate timelines in color and black-and-white, but also with the words “fission” and “fusion”—a choice with all kinds of fascinating interpretative potential. Oppenheimer wants us to grasp the race for the atomic bomb in scientific, historical, political, and moral terms all at once. That big opening weekend suggests that plenty are at least game to try and follow his train of thought.
And that’s worth celebrating in an era when the American box office is mostly dominated by movies that treat all audiences like children. Pick a year, any year in recent memory, and its biggest hits will almost invariably be aimed at all ages; our theaters are now the almost-exclusive dominion of superheroes, cartoon mascots, and other figures of juvenilia. In fact, for all the money they’ve made so far, Barbie and Oppenheimer have a long road ahead of them if they hope to surpass the year’s true box-office winner, The Super Mario Bros. Movie—the epitome of how the studios have child-proofed their dream factory.
Love or hate his movies, Nolan is an anomaly in the field, a thinker who looks out into the dark of the proverbial auditorium and sees a mirror of his own intellectual hunger. For all the grimness of the future Oppenheimer finds in the aftermath of its subject’s achievement, it counts as a hopeful vision in another respect. Once more, Nolan has shown that he believes in a market for grownup entertainment. And once more, the American moviegoing public has justified that faith.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL29ic2Vzc2VkL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLWhhcy1lYXJuZWQtZmlsbWdvZXJzLXRvdGFsLXRydXN00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-21 14:20:53+00:00,Christopher Nolan Says Some ‘Oppenheimer’ Viewers Walk Out ‘Devastated’ and ‘They Can’t Speak’: ‘It’s Kind of a Horror Movie’,"Christopher Nolan says some viewers are not able to speak after watching ""Oppenheimer.""","Christopher Nolan has a warning for anyone purchasing “Oppenheimer” tickets: The film might emotionally destroy you. Speaking to Wired magazine in a new interview, Nolan said that some early “Oppenheimer” viewers have had a visceral reaction to the film, which follows theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) as he creates the atomic bomb to end World War II.
“Some people leave the movie absolutely devastated,” Nolan said about early screenings. “They can’t speak. I mean, there’s an element of fear that’s there in the history and there in the underpinnings. But the love of the characters, the love of the relationships, is as strong as I’ve ever done.”
Nolan later added, “It is an intense experience, because it’s an intense story. I showed it to a filmmaker recently who said it’s kind of a horror movie. I don’t disagree.”
“Oppenheimer’s story is all impossible questions,” Nolan added. “Impossible ethical dilemmas, paradox. There are no easy answers in his story. There are just difficult questions, and that’s what makes the story so compelling. I think we were able to find a lot of things to be optimistic about in the film, genuinely, but there’s this sort of overriding bigger question that hangs over it. It felt essential that there be questions at the end that you leave rattling in people’s brains, and prompting discussion.”
One outspoken fan of “Oppenheimer” ahead of the film’s July theatrical release is historian Kai Bird, who co-wrote the 2005 biography “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” with Martin J. Sherwin. Nolan adapted the book into “Oppenheimer.”
“I am, at the moment, stunned and emotionally recovering from having seen it,” Bird said during a recent conversation. “I think it is going to be a stunning artistic achievement, and I have hopes it will actually stimulate a national, even global conversation about the issues that Oppenheimer was desperate to speak out about — about how to live in the atomic age, how to live with the bomb and about McCarthyism — what it means to be a patriot, and what is the role for a scientist in a society drenched with technology and science, to speak out about public issues.”
Starring opposite Murphy in the drama are Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh and more. The film is Nolan’s first R-rated release since 2002’s “Insomnia.”

2023-07-30 13:00:00+00:00,Those Controversial Oppenheimer Sex Scenes Are a Departure for Christopher Nolan,Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh's prolonged sex scene in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is one of the film's most memorable moments. Here's what to know.,"Spoilers follow.
Christopher Nolan's historical biopic Oppenheimer has finally been released, prompting all kinds of conversations about humanity's capacity for destruction. But viewers are also keenly discussing the film's sex scenes—the first that Nolan has ever included in one of his movies.
Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh, who play J. Robert Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, appear in three nude scenes together throughout the movie. In the first, the pair have sex after flirting at a party. During this encounter, Tatlock pauses the intercourse to browse Oppenheimer's bookshelf, remark on how many languages he speaks, and pull down a copy of the Hindu holy text the Bhagavad-Gita. The scene culminates in Oppenheimer reciting the famous line ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"" while having sex with Tatlock, a moment which has been deemed offensive by some Hindu viewers.
The second nude scene is stark by comparison; the two characters sit naked as Oppenheimer breaks off his affair with Tatlock, who later dies by suicide.
However, Pugh's character makes a surreal reappearance towards the end of the film, in a sequence where Oppenheimer and his wife Katherine (Emily Blunt) are being questioned by senators in a security hearing, and his private life is splayed out—quite literally—for all to see, with the film showing Oppenheimer and Tatlock having sex in the room.
Universal
""One of the things that was so striking about the real-life situation in which Oppenheimer found himself in these security hearings is they were conducted in a very shabby small space with a very peculiar intimacy,"" explained director Christopher Nolan. ""He was being interrogated about the most intimate details about his entire life and the witnesses who would testify, he was sitting three feet behind them the entire time... His wife was sitting right behind him as these most intimate details of his life were being unfolded and he was being split open for all to see.""
""I really wanted to push as hard in the direction of showing how uncomfortable that must have been and how strange that must have been for everyone involved,"" he continued. |""The dialogue in that moment is from the transcripts. I didn't write it. It really is what was said there. It's a really shocking piece of history and I wanted to really bring that to life for people.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNoZWFsdGguY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYTQ0NjE4OTYzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWNpbGxpYW4tbXVycGh5LWZsb3JlbmNlLXB1Z2gtc2V4LXNjZW5lLWV4cGxhaW5lZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

You likely know J. Robert Oppenheimer best as the father of the atomic bomb.
After seeing ""Oppenheimer,"" you will also know him as a ladies' man.
Christopher Nolan's latest movie recounts Oppenheimer's work in the Manhattan Project, but it also reveals that the renowned physicist had several affairs while he was married, including one with a Communist, which got him into hot water.
Because of this side of Oppenheimer's life, Nolan featured something he's never done before in his filmography: sex scenes.

""When you look at Oppenheimer's life and you look at his story, that aspect of his life, the aspect of his sexuality, his way with women, the charm that he exuded, it's an essential part of his story,"" Nolan told Insider about the choice of including sex scenes.
One woman in particular holds an important part in the ""Oppenheimer"" story.
Jean Tatlock, played by Florence Pugh, is someone Oppenheimer is completely infatuated with leading up to the Manhattan Project.
Their steamy love affair continues after Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy, marries Kitty, played by Emily Blunt.

But Tatlock is also a Communist. Due to her political affiliations, Nolan said his affair with her ""had enormous ramifications for his later life and his ultimate fate.""
Essentially, a decade after Oppenheimer successfully tested the atomic bomb, his security clearance was revoked following a 1954 security hearing in which he was accused of having Communist ties.
Nolan said he wanted the sex scenes between Oppenheimer and Tatlock to show why the relationship transcended politics.
""It felt very important to understand their relationship and to really see inside it and understand what made it tick without being coy or allusive about it, but to try to be intimate, to try and be in there with him and fully understand the relationship that was so important to him,"" he said.

Nolan also answered whether he's nervous about how audiences will react to seeing sex scenes in one of his movies.
""Any time you're challenging yourself to work in areas you haven't worked in before, you should be appropriately nervous and appropriately careful and planned and prepared,"" he said.

Nolan gave all the praise to his actors: Murphy, who he has worked with on several movies, and Pugh, who he's wanted to work with.
""I met with her and immediately felt a creative connection,"" he said of the acclaimed ""Little Women"" actor. ""I felt this is somebody who could bring Jean Tatlock to life and have the audience understand the significance of this figure in Oppenheimer's life.""

""Oppenheimer"" opens in theaters on Friday.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXIuY29tL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLXNleC1zY2VuZXMtZXhwbGFuYXRpb24tZXNzZW50aWFsLTIwMjMtN9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXIuY29tL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLXNleC1zY2VuZXMtZXhwbGFuYXRpb24tZXNzZW50aWFsLTIwMjMtNz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Only 19 US theaters have IMAX 70mm screens to show 'Oppenheimer' as Christopher Nolan intended,"While 'Oppenheimer' has been digitized to work for all screens, director Christopher Nolan said it is best viewed in specific IMAX theaters.","While more than 20,000 people have already bought tickets for Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer,"" only 19 theaters in the U.S. have the capacity to show the movie as the director intended.
In an interview with The Associated Press, Nolan explained that the ""best possible experience"" of the movie is in IMAX 70mm theaters, as both the aspect ratio and the sound will be ideal.
So what difference does the size of the screen make for the viewing experience? Here's what to know about the IMAX 70mm experience.
More:Christopher Nolan made 'Oppenheimer' because he thought he'd die in a nuclear Armageddon
What's the importance of 70mm screens?
""Oppenheimer"" was shot using some of the highest-resolution film cameras that exist. The film was shot entirely on large format film stock, meaning a combination of IMAX 65mm and Panavision 65mm
""The sharpness and the clarity and the depth of the image is unparalleled,"" Nolan said in an interview with the AP. ""The headline, for me, is by shooting on IMAX 70mm film, you’re really letting the screen disappear. You're getting a feeling of 3D without the glasses. You’ve got a huge screen and you’re filling the peripheral vision of the audience. You're immersing them in the world of the film.""
While it's impossible to shoot all of the movie in IMAX (as the cameras are too loud for scenes with dialogue), sequences that used the IMAX cameras will expand to fill the entire screen in 70mm theaters.
How else can you watch 'Oppenheimer'?
If you aren't near one of the few theaters with IMAX 70mm screens, you'll still be able to enjoy the film, Nolan said.
In any IMAX theater, including IMAX digital, the sequences shot with IMAX cameras will still expand to fill the entire screen, allowing viewers to experience the full effects.
Viewing on other ""premium large format"" (or PLF) screens 70mm, 35mm and Dolby Cinema will be impressive for audiences.
Nolan said his team has worked for six months to digitize the original film for other formats to ensure the best experience on every screen.
Where are the best seats in movie theaters?
While seats are a personal preference, Nolan said he likes to sit in different places for different kinds of screens.
""When I'm in a theater that’s Cinemascope ratio, I like to be right near the front, middle of the third row,"" he said. ""When I’m in a stadium, IMAX 1.43:1, then I actually like to be a little behind the center line right up at the middle. So, a little further back.""
What is IMAX?
IMAX by definition refers to the firm that manufactures high-resolution lenses, film codecs, projectors, and movie theater equipment.
However, the term is often used to describe the movie format and the viewing experience specific to IMAX cameras and theaters, according to the Nashville Film Institute.
IMAX theaters have a screen the entire width of the movie theater and loudspeakers behind the screen. IMAX cameras produce high-quality images, using 70mm film.
Additionally, IMAX theaters have a large circular dome and a flat screen, giving viewers a more life-like experience and the same view of the screen from any seat.
IMAX film resolution is almost 10 times more than a 35mm projector and each frame has some 18,000 pixels of resolution versus a home HD screen that has 1,920 pixels.

2023-07-08 06:00:07+00:00,"Cillian Murphy on Oppenheimer, sex scenes and self-doubt: ‘I’m stubborn and lacking in confidence – a terrible combination’","If Peaky Blinders made the Irish actor a household name, will Christopher Nolan’s nuclear blockbuster send him into the stratosphere? He talks about extreme weight loss, hating school and why his next character won’t be a smoker","Cillian Murphy is struggling with what he can and can’t say about his title role in Oppenheimer, the latest Christopher Nolan epic, such is the secrecy surrounding this film. Murphy is under “strict instructions” not to talk about the content. Which is awkward when you’ve flown to his home in Ireland to interview him specifically about playing the physicist who oversaw the creation of the atomic bomb, later detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It’s not clear who issued these instructions. Nolan? The studio? The US government? All I know is that as well as Murphy being gagged by hefty NDAs, I am not allowed to see it (“bit unfortunate”, he concedes).
So, yes, here we sit in an empty upstairs room of a restaurant near his house in Monkstown, Dublin, working out how to do this. The room is dark, the sun shining through a solitary Velux lighting his features like a Géricault. The only background noise is the low hum of a wine refrigerator. Murphy loathes interviews, looks visibly tortured at points. But he relaxes when I ask if he’s pleased with Oppenheimer. “I am, yeah,” he says. “I don’t like watching myself – it’s like, ‘Oh, fucking hell’ – but it’s an extraordinary piece of work. Very provocative and powerful. It feels sometimes like a biopic, sometimes like a thriller, sometimes like a horror. It’s going to knock people out,” he adds. “What [Nolan] does with film, it fucks you up a little bit.”
Nolan wouldn’t disagree. The director recently told Wired magazine that some of those who’d seen it were left “absolutely devastated … they can’t speak”. Which sounds like a bad thing, but is related perhaps to the thought of the 214,000 Japanese people, overwhelmingly civilians, who lost their lives when the bombs were dropped. Kai Bird, the historian who co-authored American Prometheus, the 2008 biography of J Robert Oppenheimer upon which the film is based, said he was still “emotionally recovering” from seeing the film, clarifying that it was “a stunning artistic achievement”.

Murphy’s portrayal is said to be astonishing (“Oscar-worthy” is the buzz). This is not unbelievable. While Hollywood might not know him as a leading man, this quietly intense actor has long been celebrated in the UK and Ireland, most notably for his nine-year stint as Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders. When he first appeared on our screens, looking like a renaissance painting of Saint Sebastian – chiselled head contrasting with translucent blue eyes – it was impossible not to be distracted. He appeared first on stage in Enda Walsh’s Disco Pigs, then the screen adaptation. Then 28 Days Later; Intermission; Ken Loach’s The Wind That Shakes the Barley. Previous collaborations with Nolan include the Dark Knight trilogy, Inception and Dunkirk, “significant milestones in my career,” he says, adding that Nolan “might be the perfect director”.
It was Nolan’s wife, the producer Emma Thomas, who called Murphy one afternoon at the home he shares with his wife, artist Yvonne McGuinness, and two teenage sons. Nolan doesn’t actually have a telephone, or an email, or computer for that matter: “He’s the most analogue individual you could possibly encounter.” So, Emma said Chris would like a word and passed the receiver, then the director came on the line. “Cillian, I’d love you to play the lead in this new thing,” he said. Murphy tries to recreate his response to this news. “I was lost for words. But thrilled. Like beyond thrilled.” It is characteristic of Murphy that the modulation of his voice barely changes as he expresses this. He was so stunned, he had to sit down. “Your mind explodes.”
In the absence of the three-hour feature, I scrutinise Oppenheimer’s three-minute trailer. It’s a rush of snapshots against the crackling of a Geiger counter. There’s Murphy, short back and sides, lifting 1940s eye goggles; blue and red atoms coming at him fast; orange light; white light; blackout; silence. Massive explosion against the backdrop of space. Overlaid is Murphy’s narration, “We’re in a race against the Nazis / and I know what it means / if the Nazis have a bomb.” There’s Matt Damon looking porky as army general Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project: “They have a 12-month head start.” Murphy, pointing with cigarette: “18.”
He has put back on some of the weight he lost for the part, I’m relieved to see; his skin isn’t quite so taut over his skull and there are freckles over those eagle-wing cheekbones. He was determined to nail the scientist’s silhouette “with the porkpie hat and the pipe”, testing himself to see how little he could eat. “You become competitive with yourself a little bit which is not healthy. I don’t advise it.” He won’t say how many kilograms he lost, or what food the nutritionist told him to cut out. NDA? “Ach, no. I don’t want it to be, ‘Cillian lost x weight for the part’.”

Then again, the hurtling speed at which Nolan worked, crisscrossing the US, made it easy to skip meals. Murphy began to forget about food in the same way he began to forget about sleep. “It’s like you’re on this fucking train that’s just bombing. It’s bang, bang, bang, bang. You sleep for a few hours, get up, bang it again. I was running on crazy energy; I went over a threshold to where I was not worrying about food or anything. I was so in it, a state of hyper …” he gropes for the word, “hyper something. But it was good because the character was like that. He never ate.” Oppenheimer subsisted on little more than Chesterfield cigarettes and double-strength martinis, rims dipped in lime. “Cigarettes and pipes. He would alternate between the two. That’s what did for him in the end,” Murphy adds, a nod to the scientist’s death from cancer in 1967. “I’ve smoked so many fake cigarettes for Peaky and this. My next character will not be a smoker. They can’t be good for you. Even herbal cigarettes have health warnings now.”
I raise method acting and Murphy tilts his head and frowns. “Method acting is a sort of … No,” he says, firm but with a half smile. Oppenheimer had many defining characteristics, not least walking on the balls of his feet and a vocal tic that sounded like nim-nim-nim, but Murphy didn’t want to do an impression. Nolan was obsessed with the Brillo-texture hair, so they spent “a long time working on hair”. And the voice. The real question for Murphy was what combination – ambition, madness, delusion, deep hatred of the Nazi regime? – allowed this theoretical physicist to agree to an experiment he knew could obliterate humankind. “He was dancing between the raindrops morally. He was complex, contradictory, polymathic; incredibly attractive intellectually and charismatic, but,” he decides, “ultimately unknowable.

“Listen, it’s not like a spoiler,” he says, checking himself before he leans in, “but there are incidents in his early life that were quite worrying; very erratic.” They are in the film and the book, he steers. I suspect he is referring to Oppenheimer’s postgrad at Cambridge in 1926, when he placed a poisoned apple on the desk of a tutor towards whom he harboured complicated feelings of inadequacy and jealousy. Arguably, this was attempted murder. But Oppenheimer’s rich New York parents rushed in to bundle him into psychoanalysis. He was diagnosed with “dementia praecox”, a term describing symptoms associated with schizophrenia.
Murphy likes these complex characters; they’re his meat. People that don’t necessarily follow the – yawn – traditional transformative arc of storytelling. Not villains, exactly (although he’s played a few, including Scarecrow in Dark Knight and Jackson Rippner in Red Eye): “Villains are good if they’re well written, but if it’s one note or a trope, then they are dull.” He likes a script to stretch leisurely into all corners of the human condition, “all the shades”. At the same time, you have to understand his exceptional ability to portray interiority, physically manifesting intense human emotion without a word, radiating fierce, consuming energy. Which he does today, actually, when I stray off track.
Although Nolan is usually, shall we say, antiseptic in his approach to romance, Oppenheimer represents a significant shift. He told Wired the love story aspect “is as strong as I’ve ever done”. It features prolonged nudity for Murphy and Florence Pugh, who plays Oppenheimer’s ex-fiancee, as well as sex, and there are complicated scenes with Emily Blunt, who plays his wife, “that were pretty heavy”. Murphy turns coy: “I’m under strict instructions not to give away anything.”

He asks if I’ve heard of chemistry tests. “They put two actors in a room to see if there’s any spark, and have all the producers and director at a table watching. I don’t know what metric they use, and it seems so outrageously silly, but sometimes you get a chemistry and nobody knows why.” This is a roundabout way of saying his scenes with Blunt and Pugh conjure this magic. His established bond with Blunt (they co-starred in A Quiet Place II) meant “the audience gets something for free”, he says. “You can be immediately vulnerable and open, and try stuff. There were moments where I remember saying, ‘I couldn’t have done that if it wasn’t with you.’”
Murphy, 47, grew up the eldest of four in Cork. His father was a civil servant, his mother a French teacher. They were a middle-class family, musical; his father “can pick up any instrument”, his brother played piano, and they regularly got stuck into “traditional Irish sessions”. Bookshelves were stuffed with literature, the radio often on, the “shitty” TV set not so much. Home life was busy but his parents taught him French and Irish, and sent him to an all-boys academic, rugby-playing private school. “I got all the education” he says, drily.
The story of how much he disliked the Presentation Brothers College, the hard-drinking masculine emphasis, how he found solace playing guitar in a band, is much rehearsed and he says today he doesn’t want “to slag the school off. I hear it’s great now.” Something about this experience seems nonetheless unsettling. He had one friend, who is still his best friend, “so I wasn’t, like, an outcast”. He played rugby for the first couple of years, but abandoned it “because everyone was all of a sudden towering over me.” Was it an unhappy time? He shifts. “It was OK. I was a bit of a messer, like I’d get in trouble and say nothing. It wasn’t the ideal school for me.”
I don’t enjoy the personality side of being an actor. I don’t understand why it’s expected I’ll be scintillating on a talkshow
He enrolled in and dropped out of a law degree at University College Cork, which created some friction with his parents (when I ask if his own sons will go to university in Dublin, he says, “Whatever they want”). He continued with the band, his first creative love but the one that got away. When they were offered a contract with Acid Jazz records, he turned it down for a number of reasons, he says, crucially that he didn’t feel good enough. He still writes and plays at home but, no, you won’t be hearing any of his recordings, ever, he says.
It’s a funny thing talking to Murphy. He’s at once garrulous (on the craft, or literature, or ideas) and reticent (pretty much anything else). I sense in previous interviews that he skates over issues close to his heart – such as the expression of emotion in Ireland and the need to teach empathy in schools. But when I try to drill in to these topics, get to the root, he clams shut, emitting energy like a nuclear reactor.

Later, in a different context, he will tell me a truth: “I’m stubborn and lacking in confidence, which is a terrible combination. I don’t want to put anything out that I don’t think is excellent.” But he clearly hates the pantomime of publicity, asking why I am returning to certain topics and repeating lines I’ve read elsewhere. I can almost see him at home with its views towards the Irish Sea, complaining to his wife as they tuck into supper: “Another one, asking the same fucking questions.”
If he could get out of going to Cannes, of standing on red carpets, dressed as is his habit for a funeral, hair shellacked, hands in pockets; if he could turn his back on the coloured-foam mics thrust in his face, he would. He really would. No, it dawns on him now, there’s something even worse than the red carpet; there’s the talkshow rounds. The very word “talkshow” comes out of him like a pain from his ribcage, as if the parcelling out of amuse-bouche anecdotes, offering them up to the forced laughter of that false god of show business, the studio audience, is in itself the most cheapening experience known to mankind.
“I do them because you’re contractually obliged to. I just endure them. I’ve always found it difficult. I’ve said this so many, many times.” Then there’s the double wince of realising that, yes, he’s done it again. He’s laid into the industry that feeds him. His hands raise slowly in surrender. “I want to just caveat this by saying, I’m so privileged. I’m so happy to be doing what I love. I’m really lucky. But I don’t enjoy the personality side of being an actor. I don’t understand why I should be entertaining and scintillating on a talkshow. I don’t know why all of a sudden that’s expected of me. Why?”
There’s an awkward silence. I say that he reminds me of Naomi Osaka, the tennis player who refused to talk to journalists after the French Open in 2021. He says he feels “100%” sympathy with her, “because why should she have to perform?” Then he relents. “But I get it. I get it’s a kind of ecosystem where the film feeds the publicity which feeds the talkshows which goes back and feeds the film, so, like, that’s how it works. I suppose I’m just not good at it. At interviews, at this stuff,” he gestures at me. He says after he leaves me today he’ll be going down the stairs thinking of all the things he’s said and worrying it’s come across all wrong. “Do you know what Sam Beckett said? ‘I have no views to inter.’ I love that. That should be the interview.”

We return to his art, the tension falls away and he’s back to his charming self, charged air evaporating. Since Oppenheimer, he’s also wrapped Small Things Like These, an adaptation of Claire Keegan’s brilliant novella set in 1985 in a small Irish town on the edge of which is a convent and “laundry”. Murphy is a huge fan of Keegan. He remembers reading her 2010 novel Foster on a train and having to pull his hoodie over his face because he was crying so hard. Anyway, he’d wanted to work with the Peaky Blinders director Tim Mielants and they were throwing ideas around in his sitting room when Murphy’s wife suggested Small Things. “No, there’s no way,” Murphy said. “That’s going to be gone already.” But when he called the agent, he found it was available. “I went, ‘No, you’ve got to be fucking kidding.’” Murphy pitched the idea to Matt Damon, who has set up a studio with Ben Affleck. “From there it all just happened really quickly.”
I’m always trying to cut lines in scenes. I like films that pose the big questions, then leave it to the audience
Murphy plays Bill Furlong who, funnily enough, is a man of few words. Keegan’s light-touch writing is everything he loves in art – the sense that you are not being bashed over the head by an idea. That’s how he tries to act, he adds. “I’m always trying to cut lines in scenes, because I feel like you can transmit it. Like when you see a person on a train thinking, or driving a car, and you are purely observing someone and feeling the energy that is vibrating from them. That’s the sort of acting I love. In a lot of film and television, they want to cut those bits to go to the action. I like films that pose the big questions and then leave it to the audience.” Perhaps this is at the heart of his reticence in interviews? That he doesn’t feel the need to explain.
He still finds it “nuts” that the last of the Magdalene laundries closed in 1996, that it was illegal to buy condoms in Ireland until 1985, that divorce was made legal only in 1996. He remembers vividly thousands of people still going to see moving statues in Cork when he was growing up. “Crazy. But, like, how far the country has come since then, we’re so socially advanced now compared with where we were. But you must look back. And art is a better way of doing that than reading all these reports [into the laundries].” (Afterwards, he emails me: “The nation is actually dealing with an unresolved collective trauma. Who knows how long this will take to heal, but I feel strongly that art, film and literature can help with that process. It’s a kinder and gentler sort of therapy. I hope that our movie can help with that in its own little way.”)
Because he’s a nice man, because he doesn’t want me to feel bad about our encounter, and because he’s generous and hospitable, Murphy finishes by telling me some of the best places to visit in Ireland. He and his family are staying here for the summer. They’ve had it with air travel and his home town of Cork is only a couple of hours away. He supplies me with other recommendations: a great book he’s just read, Brian, by Jeremy Cooper, oh, and there’s the Francis Bacon studio exhibition I should catch on my way out.
But before I go, what has he learned from playing Oppenheimer? Foremost, he says, that scientists think differently. He knew this already from playing physicist Robert Capa in Danny Boyle’s Sunshine (2007) and hanging out in Cern, home of the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, for research. “I had dinner with all these geniuses. I’ll never understand quantum mechanics, but I was interested in what science does to their perspective.” He sought their opinions on subjects that matter – love, politics, our place in the universe, “infinity, or whatever the fuck. Because they have a completely different way of taking in information than we do. I remember one scientist saying, ‘I don’t believe in love. It’s a biological phenomenon, the exchange of hormones between the female and the male. That’s all. Love is a nonsense.’” Murphy taps the table with his hand. “I couldn’t go along with that, obviously.”

,"Yes, Christopher Nolan really prints his scripts on red paper — just ask Robert Downey Jr.",Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt recall meeting with Christopher Nolan for 'Oppenheimer' — and reading the script printed on red paper.,"Oppenheimer stars Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy know the routine with director Christopher Nolan, having worked with him on previous movies: Nolan makes a call, they meet, the actor reads the script while Nolan waits nearby.
What Robert Downey Jr. didn't know is that those scripts are presented in a low-tech manner, which ended up being the Iron Man actor's one complaint about working with the filmmaker.

""I went over to his house. I read it,"" explains Downey in EW's Around the Table with Nolan and the cast. ""I don't want to complain, but it's on red paper printed in black, which is kind of difficult at best.""
""And a bit unnerving as well,"" interjects Emily Blunt, who plays Oppenheimer's wife Kitty in the film.
""I guess there's something about it that makes it that you forget it as soon as you read it,"" jokes Downey, who portrays Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss in Oppenheimer. ""I don't know what those colors are. Anyway, it's a thing. You read the script, it's written in the first person, you're transported, and it's a journey to read it, and then at the end of that, the guy who wrote the script you just read is asking you if you want to do it. It's kind of like being hypnotized.""

As it turns out, the red paper doesn't have any hypnotic powers at all — the color just makes it difficult to photocopy the pages.
Blunt, who is also a Nolan-movie first-timer, admits that she didn't realize she was actually being offered a role when she first met with the director.
""I went and met Chris in L.A., and I didn't know the process — I didn't know if you were meeting countless other people,"" she says. ""So we talked for an hour or so, and then he's just very casual, and he goes, 'So it's the part of his wife and I'd love you to take a look at it.' And you're like, is this an offer? [Laughs] So I went into the living room and read the script and it was just so heart-racing. It was so awesome.""

Blunt reveals that she called Murphy, who has appeared in a slew of Nolan-directed movies, to ask what she could expect from the experience of working with the filmmaker.
""I knew Cillian from A Quiet Place II, so, of course, I called him and I said, 'What's it like? Come on, tell me,"" recalls the actress. ""And he just said, 'You're going to just love it. You're going to love it. It's so focused, there's no chaos, it's very giving, it's collaborative,' and [he said] how amazing he was with actors. I think that is the great beauty of Chris. There are directors who are led by the visuals, or there are directors who are pretty good with actors, but you never find where someone is as mirroredly brilliant at both. So I was excited about the focus of it, I was excited about the screws getting tightened on everybody, and what that atmosphere will feel like on a film set.""

2023-08-15 12:02:37+00:00,“Oppenheimer” Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema on Making History With Christopher Nolan,"Cinematographer collaborator Hoyte van Hoytema, Christopher Nolan's longtime collaborator, on how they recreated the Trinity Test and more.","“Oppenheimer” Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema on Making History With Christopher Nolan
Oppenheimer marks the fourth collaboration between director Christopher Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema. And like their past efforts, the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the theoretical physicist who spearheaded the effort to create the atomic bomb and then came under attack when he warned the world of its dangers, is anything but routine. It’s a three-hour epic that has mesmerized audiences around the globe, a masterclass in storytelling, and a visual feast that manages to blow your mind without deploying a single visual effect. In short, Oppenheimer is a masterpiece.
In a conversation with The Credits, Nolan’s longtime collaborator discusses the surprising things about working with the director, bespoke lenses, and recreating the Trinity Test by eschewing spectacle for something more intimate and far more harrowing.
In what ways does Oppenheimer differ from your past collaborations?
Obviously, every film is different with Chris. He is definitely challenging himself. He doesn’t want the next film to be similar to the previous one. How did this film differ? This was a biopic. He’s never done anything like that before. Also, this was one of the first films where he wanted to turn inward. This is essentially a film about faces and thoughts. There was a different way of thinking about that.
Oppenheimer features vivid scenes of color and segments in black and white. Can you talk about creating those various looks?
Well, I’m a little allergic to the word. “Looks” hints at a surface patina. Film, for me, is a visceral medium. I’m more concerned about organic flow. I love the idea that you can take it in and have an emotional reaction to it. I never build an entity with looks. I always hope that it becomes an organic soup that somehow makes sense.
How do you achieve this organic soup?
We wanted to create a feeling of living in Oppenheimer’s head…to touch on the way he changed traditional physics into the new abstract world of quantum physics. It’s a time in which people started thinking conceptually differently about music, the arts. And also physics — that the fabric of our world is not built from molecules, but waves and their energies. That was our color world.
(Lewis) Strauss (the government official, played by Robert Downey Jr., who instigated a campaign to discredit Oppenheimer in the 1950s), on the other hand, is Oppenheimer’s nemesis. And in order to distinguish between those two storylines, the choice was made to go black and white so we could maneuver within those two worlds.
And then you ask why black and white? It was something Chris and I grew up watching. Chris shot his first film in black and white. I went to a Polish film school and saw films that I adored in black and white. We had an intuitive connection to that medium. Above that, we love to do things in-camera. We love to work on real negatives with as little digital interference as possible. For us, it was an obvious method.
You mentioned Oppenheimer’s close-ups. What were the challenges of creating such personal images for large-scale viewing?
I think the fact that the scope has to be about big subjects is a misconception. I had to learn that myself. Can you find the scope in the face of a person? I posed that question early on and started working with that concept. I firmly believe that if you make a good close-up and people look into the eyes of the players and feel the peripheral vision, you see a wide, expansive world through that face. Faces become your landscape. You have to be able to look into Oppenheimer’s world through his eyes.
What do you remember most about recreating the atomic blast?
I remember reading this segment in the script and thinking, “Okay, let’s not read this thoroughly yet because how are we ever gonna do this?” Chris is extremely pragmatic, and his guidance is always important. He has already envisioned a lot of the storytelling obstacles in his head. He’s a master of the timeline and how consecutive images can paint one image. So when you’re thinking about the Trinity test, you don’t think about one single image; you think about the collection of images that tell that story. And you start to dissect. You break it down into smaller pieces. Some of those pieces bring the size and the scope. And along the way, you find ways to communicate that feeling of seeing it for the first time.
What images did you decide on to help re-create what that experience must have been like?
We read a lot of witness accounts of the scientists that were there. They’re very emotional. Everything else was physics, but they were overwhelmed the moment they saw that thing. They had a poetic way of describing what they were seeing — the colors, the brightness of light, for instance. That’s something I can translate into photography. I wanted to avoid trying to photograph this big thing that would blow everybody away. We wanted to stay close to the way people experienced it. Strangely enough, it is about restraint. Let go of the Hollywood inside you. Just be truthful to the experience. Trust that that experience is actually something that people haven’t seen in a film and deserve to witness.
A little of “less is more”?
“Less is more” is something that always sings in my head. I think that a lot of my best choices come from restraint. Film is a collection of thousands of “less is more” choices. You’re always struggling between what your Hollywood devil on your shoulder tells you to do and what purity on the other shoulder tells you. On one hand, it’s what you think the audience wants to see. On the other, it’s trying to distill things, be simpler and more truthful. I think that people recognize honesty.
Can you give us a peek into your toolbox?
We always use custom lenses. They’re not off-the-shelf. For this one, we wanted to be part of the game, the epicenter where stuff was happening. We didn’t want to peek from the outside. And in order to feel that proximity, we needed to tweak the lenses to focus closer on the faces.
We shot a lot of close-ups on slightly wider lenses than we usually do. Our IMAX workhorse lens is a 40-millimeter. Traditionally, we would never shoot close-ups on that. When you get close to an actor, you have to reduce the distortion on the face. So we needed to rebuild that lens to get closer while reducing the distortion. There was a balancing act, but we were fanatic about creating a language in which we feel we were participating and not just observing.
For the technical stuff — the atoms colliding with each other, the stars, the black hole — we built a super macro lens that didn’t exist before. It enabled us to actually put a wide lens in between two small entities and gaze through it as if it was a landscape. [He holds up a lens with the wording “HVH IMAX Oppenheimer Probe Prototype 2022.”] We were building and engineering those kinds of things all the time. But this lens became pivotal to a lot of that microworld.
Is there anything you’d like to say about Oppenheimer that no one has asked you yet?
You wouldn’t believe how much I’ve been talking about this film. I just returned from Holland, where I talked on live television for literally three hours straight. What I always love to say is something people don’t realize about working with Chris. People think that he’s all about precision and planning…being extremely meticulous. And in many ways, he is. But what I think people sometimes forget is how intuitive he is. He understands his audience on a visceral level. And that’s what I love about working with Chris. He’s a technical master but also allows himself to step away from that and feel. I can’t say that enough. It’s not only technical perfection; he infuses heart into it.
Oppenheimer is in theaters now.

2023-07-18 08:31:20-04:00,"Christopher Nolan, Warner Bros., and the Struggle for the Soul of Movies",The upcoming face-off between ‘Oppenheimer’ and ‘Barbie’ points to a conflict between two radically opposed visions of movies. On the one side: Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav. On the other: Christopher Nolan.,"From the moment Warner Bros. announced Barbie would arrive in theaters on July 21, 2023, the same day previously announced as Oppenheimer’s release date, the two films have been pitted against one another. But the face-off is ultimately a distraction from larger issues within the film industry, even if it involves some of the same players. In the battle between Barbie and Oppenheimer, the only rational response is to hope for both films to be (a) good and (b) successful. Both are, from all appearances, ambitious and unusual projects from major directors. (Greta Gerwig’s Barbie is rooted in IP but can’t be easily mistaken for the fashion-doll equivalent of The Super Mario Bros. Movie or a Transformers sequel.) Both, in other words, are the sorts of films treated as must-sees by those who consider themselves more than casual moviegoers, as suggested by AMC’s report that it’s already sold 20,000 tickets to those planning to take them in as a double feature and by the appearance of “Barbenheimer” T-shirts. For those who care about movies, the only real choice this coming weekend is “all of the above”; it doesn’t matter which ends up winning the weekend box office.
The matchup does point to another underlying conflict, however, between two radically opposed visions of movies, their place in culture, and their future at large. On one side: Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav. On the other: Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan, who, with each new revelation made about the man now in charge of Warner Bros., is starting to look like the anti-Zaslav. And though there’s ultimately a clear hero and obvious villain, the situation they’re both involved in isn’t a simple one.
Like a lot of the predicaments that the world now finds itself in, it features the COVID-19 pandemic in a major supporting role. On December 3, 2020, Warner Bros. announced that its 2021 films—all 17 of them, including Dune and the third Matrix sequel—would premiere simultaneously in theaters and on the service then known as HBO Max. It was an unexpected development, to say the least. Theatrical exhibition had been devastated by the pandemic, and the FDA would not authorize the first coronavirus vaccines for another week. But this was a major studio putting its bets on streaming rather than theaters for (at least) the next year, a move most speculated had as much to do with HBO Max’s flagging subscription numbers as a concern for public health and safety.
Four days after the announcement, Nolan weighed in, telling The Hollywood Reporter, “Some of our industry’s biggest filmmakers and most important movie stars went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the worst streaming service.” By Nolan’s logic, this wasn’t just about art, but about business. “Their decision makes no economic sense,” he added, “and even the most casual Wall Street investor can see the difference between disruption and dysfunction.” It was an issue disturbing enough for Nolan to end his relationship with Warner Bros., a collaboration that dated back to his 2002 remake of Insomnia, his first film for a major studio. In September 2021, news broke that Nolan’s next film, a biopic of atomic scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer, would be for Universal.
In some respects, Nolan was then an imperfect messenger for the primacy of the theatrical experience. In the year leading up to Warner Bros.’ decision, the release of Nolan’s 2020 film, Tenet, became a kind of beacon of hope, signaling the moment when movie theaters would resume business as usual. Its U.S. release date kept shifting, moving from July 17 to July 31 before finally opening in some cities on September 3. For many, it seemed too soon (and restrictions prevented the film from opening in New York and elsewhere). Warner Bros.—presumably with Nolan’s approval, if not at his insistence—refused to make the film available digitally for critics, requiring them to attend screenings. Some simply balked. It seemed like an instance in which Nolan favored theatrical evangelism at the expense of public safety.
Still, the merger of Warner Bros. and Discovery in April 2022 into the Brundlefly-like Warner Bros. Discovery seemed to confirm the wisdom of Nolan’s decision to bolt. With that merger came Zaslav’s ascent to CEO of the new company, a role he’d previously played at Discovery.
A catalog of Zaslav’s greatest hits since taking control of Warner Bros. Discovery would be an article unto itself. In fact, GQ had a pretty good article written by Jason Bailey earlier this month that detailed just that—you might have heard about it because the piece was edited to soften its criticisms at the request of a Zaslav spokesman, and then the story was pulled entirely when Bailey asked for his byline to be removed. (The original still exists in archived form.) Some highlights include the shelving of a nearly completed Batgirl movie, which allowed the studio to use it as a tax write-off; the removal of original series made for HBO and other networks, including the once-mighty Westworld, also seemingly for tax purposes; and the sell-off of over half of Warner Bros.’ film and TV music assets.
Nothing is as concerning, or as revealing of Zaslav’s vision of the movies, however, as the gutting of Turner Classic Movies, the beloved cable destination for classic film. Thoughtfully programmed to provide context for our cinematic past, TCM has been essential to cinephiles since 1994—increasingly so since the shuttering of video stores and other channels’ retreats from airing classic films. (It’s now a distant memory that AMC used to be TCM’s rival.) It was, from all evidence, a gutting performed less out of necessity than out of an attempt to save money, any money, no matter what was lost in the process. TCM was, by all reports, a profitable operation, if not one destined to pad out the coffers of Warner Bros. Discovery to Uncle Scrooge–like dimensions. An intervention by Steven Spielberg, Paul Thomas Anderson, and Martin Scorsese led Zaslav to restate his commitment to TCM and his love of classic film—which he also expressed via an unconvincing and glib Maureen Dowd column—but TCM remains a decimated operation with an unsure future in the climate Zaslav has created.
Here’s a thought exercise: Would Zaslav’s Warner Bros. Discovery have indulged Nolan’s pet project of a few years back: releasing an “unrestored” version of 2001: A Space Odyssey, created by using original negatives owned by Warner Bros.? The release earned a lot of cinephile attention, and viewers who turned out for its art-house run in 2018—the same year the Discovery-owned TLC debuted the first episode of Dr. Pimple Popper—saw a gorgeous version of one of the greatest movies ever made. But so what? Why indulge in that sort of small-potatoes exercise?
Another project is even more telling of how Nolan’s vision contrasts with Zaslav’s. In 2015, Nolan released the short documentary Quay and oversaw the release of The Quay Brothers in 35mm, projects dedicated to the work of stop-motion animators Stephen and Timothy Quay. The Quays’ work, largely unknown outside of cinephile circles, is exacting, laborious, and deeply rooted in the old ways of making movies. It makes perfect sense as a Nolan inspiration.
In some ways, it’s not fair to compare a CEO—who, by definition, has to be in charge of a sprawling operation—to a single filmmaker. But it’s possible that because of his dedication to the past, Nolan is better equipped for the future. Since the disastrous report in April 2022 that Netflix had lost 200,000 subscribers, sending its stock plummeting by more than 35 percent, there’s been a nagging sense that something isn’t right with the streaming model—that the vision of theatrical releases as advertisements for film’s real home on competing streaming services may be misplaced, and that at some point, the bill would come due on the spending sprees used to set up streaming services for future profits. It makes sense that so many issues involved in the simultaneous WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes can be explained by a combination of greed and fear.
Nolan’s approach, by contrast, puts the emphasis on theatrical exhibition and on movies made to be seen by crowds on the biggest possible screens. Most films aren’t released in eight different formats or accompanied by format viewing guides. Movies are an event, in other words. Home viewing is essentially the film’s afterlife. It’s, in many respects, the way things used to be and nothing like the world preferred by Zaslav and others in the streaming business.
That might be why the Barbie (a Warner Bros. film) vs. Oppenheimer showdown feels a little personal. In many cities, their press screenings have been, at least initially, scheduled on the same night, forcing critics to cover one or the other. At the same time, Warner Bros. has been vocal about wanting to coax Nolan back to the studio, where he’d fit right into a professed plan to emphasize theatrical screenings and risky projects, as expressed by Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy, co-CEOs of the division now known as Warner Bros. Film Group. And there’s no reason to think that De Luca and Abdy aren’t serious. They’re real film people with track records to prove it, including a recent stint together at MGM that included auteur projects like Paul Thomas Anderson’s Licorice Pizza and Ridley Scott’s House of Gucci.
But they also work for David Zaslav, whose record has so far been defined by the trading of artistic achievement and lasting prestige for immediate profits. De Luca and Abdy’s definition of success might not be the same as their boss’s, and it’s hard to imagine that Nolan wouldn’t be wary about a return to the fold no matter what promises are made. Whatever the case, the film industry status quo that Zaslav has come to symbolize seems unsustainable—and, with the ongoing strikes, it’s not being sustained at all—and Nolan’s adherence to tradition suggests movies can still be made, distributed, and watched the way they were before the disruptions of the last decade. Whether he’ll be a model for others to follow or one of the last of his kind remains the great, unanswered question.

2023-07-26 19:32:14+00:00,Oppenheimer: Is Christopher Nolan’s movie worth the trouble to see in 70 mm IMAX?,Here’s what you’re missing if you don’t see the movie in Christopher Nolan’s favorite format.,"If you want to see Oppenheimer the way Christopher Nolan wanted it to be seen, here’s what you need to do. First, live near one of the 30 theaters in the entire world where it’s being projected on 70 mm IMAX film, a format whose almost hyperreal resolution leads Nolan to call it “3D without the glasses.” Then, buy a ticket. Whoops, tonight’s sold out. Tomorrow? Sold out too. How’s Aug. 10 for you?
You get the point. Because of the delicate nature of the IMAX prints, which weigh 600 pounds and are 11 miles long—so long that the platters that feed the film into the projector had to be fitted with custom 3D-printed extensions—most theaters have guaranteed the movie only for a three-week run. And because of the sheer size of the image, which often opens up from a thin rectangle to fill the IMAX screen’s entire floor-to-ceiling height, you can rule out the first few rows in many theaters, which offer a distorted and decidedly nonoptimal experience. (One Twitter user posted a since-deleted video shot from a front-row seat in which Cillian Murphy’s face appeared swollen like a deformed balloon.) At the theater nearest me, there are still a few good seats left on the last day of the run—as long as you’re willing to start a three-hour movie at 11 on a weeknight. If you live in Manhattan, well, you’d better hope someone who’s already got tickets has a death in the family, and even then, they might charge you upwards of $100 apiece.
Haunting your local theater’s ticket app might turn up a cancellation—that was how I managed, scoring a fourth-row seat for a Saturday morning screening a mere five days in advance—but at this point, you’re getting the idea that seeing Oppenheimer in 70 mm IMAX is more like snagging Taylor Swift tickets than striding up to the counter and saying, “One, please.” And that leads us to a vital question, given the amount of effort you’re likely to be putting in at this moment: Is it worth it?

I’ve seen Oppenheimer twice, in digital and 70 mm IMAX—both times, as it turns out, in the exact same auditorium. So while I can’t speak to the full range of formats in which the movie is being exhibited—standard and 4K projection, laser and xenon IMAX, not to mention 35 mm and non-IMAX 70 mm film—I can say precisely how much of a difference seeing it in this most rarefied of formats brings to the process, and how much is just hype.

Setting aside the scattershot nature of contemporary multiplex projection—really the primary consideration here, but one that’s beyond the scope of this inquiry—Oppenheimer is going to look spectacular in any of them. Nolan and his cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema are famously meticulous, optimizing for various formats all the way down the line to Blu-ray and DVD (although with streaming, they kind of throw up their hands). But IMAX, and here I mean any kind and not just film, adds a layer of meaning that enhances the film, if not necessarily transforms it. Nolan divides the movie into two sections, labeled “Fission” and “Fusion,” the former shot in color and following the point of view of Cillian Murphy’s Robert Oppenheimer, the latter shot in black and white and dominated by Robert Downey Jr.’s Lewis Strauss, the ambitious and vindictive government official who arranged to have Oppenheimer persecuted during the McCarthy era for his left-wing associations.

In both the Fission and Fusion sections, the movie switches between widescreen and full-frame images, a long, thin rectangle and something closer to a square—a technique he has been using since 2008’s The Dark Knight. But where most IMAX movies are solely interested in exploiting its capacity for spectacle—making the big things bigger and the loud things louder—Oppenheimer is up to something different. While the Trinity test does fill the theater floor to ceiling with a cloud of nuclear fire, the movie is largely driven by conversations. (It’s the first Nolan movie in years where you can actually hear all the dialogue.) But by blowing those conversations up so much larger than life, to the point where Cillian Murphy’s eyes are not just the color but the size of swimming pools, Nolan underlines how seemingly mundane or undramatic events, the kind movies often don’t even bother with, can have absolutely massive consequences. When the time comes to pick which Japanese city will be the target of the deadliest weapon the world has ever known, Truman’s secretary of war starts by crossing Kyoto off the list, because he and his wife enjoyed their visit there on their honeymoon.

Because IMAX cameras are cumbersome and noisy, some of the decisions about which scenes are shot in which format seem to driven by technical concerns. If a scene involves two people in a room, it’s more likely to be shot in widescreen than full-frame IMAX. But in general, Nolan uses the larger frame when Oppenheimer’s world is expanding, and the more narrowly bounded widescreen when it’s contracting. When Oppenheimer meets with Albert Einstein by a pond in Princeton, it’s shot in black-and-white IMAX (a format that didn’t even exist until Nolan and Hoytema had Kodak manufacture a new kind of film stock). But when Strauss arrives and curtails their chat, black bars appear at the top and bottom of the screen, as if a sense of unlimited potential has suddenly been constrained by a huffy bureaucrat. In Dunkirk, I found this sort of back-and-forth distracting, and after seeing it in three different formats, I wound up preferring the fixed aspect ratio of traditional 70 mm. But because Oppenheimer isn’t an action movie, the effect is more impressionistic, something you feel more than you see.

The showstopper, so to speak, is the Trinity explosion itself, but the movie is dotted with arresting images all along, some of which remain abstract or ambiguous until the closing moments: the ripples of raindrops in a pond evolve into the blast radii of nuclear detonations covering the globe; an ethereal vision of clouds that we later realize are the ghostly trails of missile launches. And that’s where the added power of the 70 mm IMAX format, which offers more than four times the resolution of the best commercial digital projection, really comes in. Oppenheimer is most effective when the audience is as seduced and haunted by these images as its protagonist is. When a young Oppenheimer starts to really grasp the nature of theoretical physics, the movie shows us visions of atoms spinning in the air around his head, as if he’s peering directly into the fabric of the universe, and at the Trinity test, all the assembled scientists stare in awe, transfixed by the awesome beauty and terrible potential of what they’ve just unleashed. (One even rips off his safety goggles and runs outside in the seconds before the blast, as if possessed by the need to experience the totality of its power.) The movie never shows us the results of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki—Oppenheimer didn’t even know that the bomb had been dropped until he heard Truman announce it on the radio the following day—but we feel them anyway, as the martial pounding of feet on gym risers during a victory rally in a basketball gym morphs briefly but unmistakably into the piercing shrieks of the dead. For the movie to work best, that moment has to have an impact as profound as the blast itself.

I wouldn’t go so far as to say that if you haven’t seen Oppenheimer in 70 mm IMAX, you haven’t seen it at all, or even that it’s worth waiting to see it until you can watch it that way. (And miss out on all the Barbenheimer discourse? Perish the thought.) As stunning as a perfectly projected film print can be, I’ve seen reports of botched screenings from all over the country, whether because of poorly maintained equipment or untrained projectionists or any number of factors. One reason for the limited runs is that film prints wear over time, and a format this detailed shows the flaws more than most—a single hair over the lens is enough to mar the image. But with enough effort and a little bit of luck, you’ll be rewarded with one of the most visually stunning experiences you’ve ever had in a movie theater, and one there’s no guarantee you’ll ever be able to see again.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy8wNy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1tb3ZpZS1pbWF4LXNob3d0aW1lcy03MC1tbS10aGVhdGVycy1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"Christopher Nolan on J. Robert Oppenheimer, ""the most important person who ever lived""","In his latest film, the director examines the efforts of the physicist and his race to build the atomic bomb that ended World War II. What happened after the war proved to be an entirely different power struggle, as Oppenheimer was accused of being a Russian agent.","The world's first atomic explosion was conducted on July 16, 1945, during the final weeks of World War II, in the high desert of New Mexico.
At Ground Zero, the sand melted in the fireball, and rained back down to the ground, where it re-solidified in the form of a mineral – what we now call trinitite, after the name of the site: Trinity.

Recalling the moment 20 years later, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man history calls ""the father of the atomic bomb,"" said it brought to mind a line of Hindu scripture: ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.""
Christopher Nolan, the director behind such films as ""Dunkirk,"" ""Inception,"" ""Interstellar,"" and the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy, has spent the last three years living in Oppenheimer's world, writing and directing the movie ""Oppenheimer"" (opening this week). ""I view Oppenheimer as the most important person who ever lived,"" he told Martin. ""Oppenheimer's story is one of the biggest stories imaginable.""

""By unleashing atomic power, he gave us the power to destroy ourselves that we never had before, and that changes the human equation,"" said Nolan.
To watch a trailer for ""Oppenheimer"" click on the video player below:
Kai Bird is co-author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Oppenheimer, ""American Prometheus,"" on which the film is based. ""It's complicated to take on a historic icon like Robert Oppenheimer and deal with the history faithfully and yet turn it into a cinematic experience,"" said Bird.
Martin asked, ""Did you have qualms about what Hollywood would do to all your research?""
""Of course I did, yes!"" Bird laughed.
Martin said to Nolan, ""For high stakes human drama, it's hard to improve on the historical facts.""
Nolan replied, ""I know of no other story as dramatic as Oppenheimer and his involvement in the Manhattan Project"" – the code name for the race to build the bomb.
Nolan filmed ""Oppenheimer"" using an Imax camera. ""Only Imax film would really be worthy of the Trinity project,"" he said. A 70mm Imax print of ""Oppenheimer,"" which runs three hours, is 11 miles long; on its platter it weighs 600 pounds. CBS News
Oppenheimer (played in the film by Cillian Murphy) was teaching graduate physics when he was recruited by a gruff Army general, Leslie Groves (played by Matt Damon). Bird said, ""Oppie was then, you know, 38 years old, never managed anything more than his graduate students, and yet Groves selected him.""
""What did other people think of Groves' choice?"" Martin asked.
""They thought it was outlandish.""

Besides his lack of experience, Oppenheimer had communist connections. ""It took him a long time to get a security clearance,"" said Bird. ""His own wife, Kitty, had been a member of the party for a long time.""
And what did Groves think of that? ""He thought Oppie was the one to lead this project, and it was a brilliant choice,"" said Bird. ""He could see in Oppie the smarts and the charisma to bring all these scientists together in this secret city and make it happen.""
At Los Alamos, New Mexico, where the bomb was designed and built, it was initially believed that it would only take about 130 people to get the job done. ""That number grew to 1,700,"" said Alan Carr, the historian at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
Thrown together in what was then the nowhereville of Los Alamos, the average age of the scientists was 29.
Martin asked, ""Boys and girls together – were there romances?""
""There were,"" Carr replied, ""and that became somewhat of a security problem here, because before the project essentially no one was born in this area. All of a sudden, you've got 8, 10, 12 children being born every month. How do you hide that?""
After shooting scenes in Oppenheimer's New Mexico home, Nolan donated the furnishings he had brought in to the Los Alamos Historical Society, but without the bugs placed by security officers suspicious of Oppenheimer's politics, who had him under surveillance, even in his own house.
""He was being watched for much of his employment in different ways,"" said Carr. ""For instance, his phone was tapped at various times. And when he would talk to Kitty, they would occasionally make reference to the fact that they were probably being listened in on.""
By the time Oppenheimer was ready to test what he called ""the gadget,"" Germany had already surrendered, but Japan fought on. Carr said, ""This was literally life-and-death because of every day that was going on in the war, thousands and thousands of more people were being killed.""
The ""gadget"" was hoisted to the top of a 100-foot tower, and the countdown began.
Oppenheimer was in a bunker 10,000 yards from Ground Zero where, before the test, he supposedly said, ""Lord, these affairs are difficult on the heart.""
""There is a tremendous burst of light,"" said Carr. ""He would have been watching it unfold in silence for dozens and dozens of seconds before the shock wave arrived. Imagine someone firing a pistol very close to you and somebody putting a leaf blower on high right in your face.""
Three weeks after the test, an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Then, a second one on Nagasaki.
The war was over, and Oppenheimer was the most famous scientist in the world.
But that is only half the story
Bird said, ""He shortly afterwards plunged into a deep depression, I think having read some of the news accounts of what had happened actually on the ground at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.""
Oppenheimer had built the weapon that won the war, but he also had created a monster, which he warned would one day cause the world to curse the names Los Alamos and Hiroshima. In 1947 he said, ""If there is another world war, this civilization may go under.""
""The national security establishment is appalled that the father of the atomic bomb is coming out in public giving speeches against these weapons,"" said Bird.
Lewis Strauss, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (played in the film by Robert Downey Jr.), was bent on building more and bigger bombs than the Russians – and Oppenheimer was in his way. ""Strauss managed to draw up an indictment that made it appear that Oppie's advice was politically motivated, that maybe he was a subversive, that maybe he was a secret communist, that maybe he was a spy,"" said Bird.

Meeting behind closed doors, an Atomic Energy Commission security panel heard evidence – some of it gathered from illegal wiretaps – of Oppenheimer's communist connections. The judges voted against him. Bird said, ""It's a terrible tragedy, because here's America's foremost scientist, a great public intellectual, put on trial and stripped of his security clearance and then humiliated.""
He retreated into academic exile at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, home of Albert Einstein, who had tried to talk Oppenheimer out of fighting a battle he couldn't win. Bird recalled: ""Oppenheimer walks away from Einstein, and Albert Einstein turns to his secretary and says, 'There goes a nar,' the Yiddish for 'fool.'""
It would take decades for the humiliation to be rectified. In December 2022, the Department of Energy formally vacated the entire clearance hearing. ""The message there is that this shouldn't have happened,"" said Carr.
By then, Oppenheimer had long since passed away. So he remains, as the title of his biography says, the American Prometheus who stole fire from the gods and was tortured ever after.
But it's not a myth.
Nolan said, ""Oppenheimer was at the center of a set of events that changed the world forever. Like it or not, we still live in his world, and we always will.""

NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - Acclaimed film director Christopher Nolan turns his attention to J. Robert Oppenheimer for his new blockbuster movie, taking audiences back to when the American theoretical physicist oversaw the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II.
Based on the 2005 biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, Nolan's biological thriller ""Oppenheimer"" features a stellar cast including Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt and Cillian Murphy in the titular role, portraying the man known as ""the father of the atomic bomb"".
""Oppenheimer's story is one of the most dramatic that I know of and there are many, many aspects to what makes it so compelling,"" Nolan told Reuters in a joint interview with Murphy.
""I just thought to take the audience there, to be there in that room with these people as they had to make these horrifying decisions that have defined the world we now live in... what a remarkable dramatic event to bring the audience to.”
Oppenheimer headed the secret Los Alamos Laboratory, established under President Franklin D. Roosevelt as part of the Manhattan Project to build the first atomic bomb.
He oversaw the first atomic bomb detonation in the New Mexico desert, code-named ""Trinity"", before the weapons were used in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
""There is so much information (about Oppenheimer)... My job as an actor is really to go after the humanity and the emotion, and the complexity and the morality of the character,"" Murphy, who has worked with Nolan previously, said.
""So I didn't really waste too much time on the physics, I did a little bit... but it was the man I was after.""
Nolan is known for conceptual narratives and visual style in films like ""Inception"" ""Tenet"" and an instalment of the Batman film franchise.
'Oppenheimer' is kind of the amalgam of every Chris Nolan movie ever, all of which have been leading to a statement as kind of profound as this but it's still edge of your seat entertainment,"" Downey Jr. said.
""It was crazy to be part of shooting it and even crazier to watch it.”

2023-07-23 18:08:57+00:00,Robert Downey Jr. Praises Cillian Murphy for His Role in ‘Oppenheimer’: “I Have Never Witnessed a Greater Sacrifice”,'Oppenheimer' stars Robert Downey Jr.,"Robert Downey Jr. sang Cillian Murphy’s praises for his take on J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, in Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer.
In a conversation with People magazine, the Iron Man actor, who plays former Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss in the film, explained he was impressed with Murphy’s “commitment” to the role.
“I have never witnessed a greater sacrifice by a lead actor in my career,” Downey told the publication. “He knew it was going to be a behemoth ask when Chris called him. But I think he also had the humility that is required to survive playing a role like this.”
The Sherlock Holmes star shared that the cast would go and do things together when they had a break in production, but Murphy often passed on joining so he could keep working.
“We’d be like, ‘Hey, we got a three-day weekend. Maybe we’ll go antiquing in Santa Fe. What are you going to do?’ ‘Oh, I have to learn 30,000 words of Dutch. Have a nice time,'” Downey recalled. “But that’s the nature of the ask.”
Florence Pugh, who plays one of Oppenheimer’s great loves, psychologist Jean Tatlock, also reflected on her time starring opposite the Peaky Blinders actor in the film.

“Chris had one of the most incredible leads in Cillian,” she told People. “He is an actor that I have been watching for quite some time and have been desperate to work with for ages. You’d have to be mad to say no. It was truly one of the best experiences that I’ve had.”
The Don’t Worry Darling actress shared that working with Murphy was “hugely impressive.”
“Every single day he shows up knowing every single possible way, intonation, inflection of how to bring this character to life,” she continued. “There’s a reason why he is one of the greats.”
In a previous conversation with The Hollywood Reporter, Nolan revealed he knew almost immediately that he wanted Murphy to portray the physicist in Oppenheimer, which is based on biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.
“I’ve been staring at the cover of the book American Prometheus for so many months, and there’s this photograph, black and white, a light blue-eyed stare, very intense, of this guy,” Nolan told THR. “And I thought, ‘Well, I know who could do that.'”
The Oscar-winning director called the actor while he was at home in Ireland and offered him the role of a lifetime.
“He’s just so understated and matter-of-fact and British,” Murphy said of Nolan. “It was like, ‘Cillian, look, I have a script, it’s Oppenheimer and I’d like you to play Oppenheimer.’ That was it.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItcm9iZXJ0LWRvd25leS1qci1mbG9yZW5jZS1wdWdoLXByYWlzZS1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi0xMjM1NTQyMDEwL9IBlgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItcm9iZXJ0LWRvd25leS1qci1mbG9yZW5jZS1wdWdoLXByYWlzZS1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi0xMjM1NTQyMDEwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-16 18:36:15+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’ Korea Debut Delivers Christopher Nolan’s Biggest Opening Day Ever In Market,"‘Oppenheimer’ debuted Tuesday in Korea with $4.3M, the best opening day ever for a Christopher Nolan pic in the market and biggest Hollywood bow of 2023 there.","Universal and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer debuted in more than 500 locations in Korea on Tuesday, capitalizing on the Liberation Day national holiday. The epic bowed to $4.3M, capturing 44% market share for the day in a highly competitive environment.
That marks the best Nolan opening day in the market, biggest Hollywood opening of the year there (No. 2 launch of 2023 for all titles), the No. 5 debut day of the pandemic and the No. 4 Universal opening day ever. Presales were outstanding, beating all previous Nolan movies.
Across 1,600 screens, this is the second-widest release for a Nolan title in Korea, only behind Tenet, which came out during the pandemic when there was no other competition.
On 20 Imax screens, Oppenheimer generated 9.4% of the total box office for the day. The CVG Egg score currently stands at a strong 92%. The Korea cume is $5.5M through today (not included in the totals above), dominating with a 42% market share on Wednesday.

In total on Tuesday, the Cillian Murphy-led historical drama added $9.6M in 80 markets. The international box office through Tuesday is $398.3M and $668M globally.
The offshore cume to date is above Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises and more than double Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception and Tenet at the same point of release.
This is now Nolan’s biggest film of all time in 50 markets including Germany, Brazil, the Netherlands, India and Poland. It’s his top non-superhero movie in 62 markets.
Over the weekend, the drama overtook Star Wars: The Last Jedi in the UK to become the third-biggest Imax release of all time. The overall cume there through Wednesday is $59.7M, which is in line with The Dark Knight Rises (-3%) and Dunkirk (+1%).
In Brazil, Oppenheimer topped the lifetime take of The Dark Knight Rises.
Other standouts include Germany at $36.4M, for the biggest Nolan movie ever in the market; France, with a running total of $29.4M through Tuesday, 23% above The Dark Knight Rises at the same point in release; and Australia, with $21.4M to date, 30% above Inception at the same point.

2023-07-24 18:41:56+00:00,"Every Christopher Nolan Movie Ranked From Worst to Best, Including ‘Oppenheimer’","All 12 Christopher Nolan movies ranked, including 'The Dark Knight,' 'The Prestige,' 'Tenet' and 'Inception.'","With the release of Oppenheimer, it’s time to rank all of director Christopher Nolan‘s movies from worst to best (BWAAAAAHM!). This wasn’t an easy task. Unlike ranking five Indiana Jones movies or seven Mission: Impossible films, Nolan offers 12 films that range from historical dramas (Dunkirk, Oppenheimer), to sci-fi thrillers (Interstellar, Tenet) to mysteries (The Prestige, Memento) to his Batman trilogy. Through it all, Nolan has risen to become one of the world’s finest filmmakers, one of the few who can dependably fill theater seats on an opening weekend, and is considered the last respite for grown-up cinema fans. Here are all of Nolan’s films, from the weakest to the strongest.
12. Insomnia (2002)
It says a lot about Nolan that the “worst” film he directed is still rather good and worth watching. Insomnia is a remake of the Norwegian title and is perhaps notable that it’s the only movie Nolan directed that he didn’t also write or co-write. Here, a veteran Los Angeles detective (Al Pacino) teams with a small-town investigator (Hilary Swank) to solve a murder in remote Alaska. It’s a nice, moody detective drama, but it lacks Nolan’s usual ambitious scope.
11. Following (1998)
Nolan’s debut feature, made for a reported $6,000, showed all the promise for the then-20-something director. Shot in black-and-white, it features some themes Nolan would continue to explore for decades to come. Its protagonist is a single-minded obsessive alienated from society who follows a code (sound familiar?), and it has a twisty third act and smart expositional dialogue that rings Nolan. The feature centers on a man who follows strangers around London and becomes embroiled in more than he expected after breaking his rule never to follow the same person twice. At just 70 minutes, some might argue it’s not a feature-length movie, but Nolan — who put three years of his life into scraping it together — has said it’s just as valid as anything he’s done.
10. Tenet (2020)
John David Washington is compelling as a secret agent trying to prevent World War III — a war between the present and future. Tenet feels like a collection of Nolan’s most frustrating habits — from an oppressive soundscape that eclipses dialogue, to stylish yet flat characters, to a narrative that’s twisty to the point of sometimes losing the audience. Still, Tenet earns some admittedly shallow points for looking cool and sounding cool and trying gamely to do something original with time travel. (THR’s review.)
9. The Dark Knight Rises (2012)
Tom Hardy is marvelous as the menacing terrorist Bane and there are some strong sequences in the climax to Nolan’s Batman trilogy (such as the plane hijacking opener, and Bruce’s trial in The Pit). Also, the film deserves credit for thinking big — criminals entirely taking over Gotham City is a storyline that really goes for it (so long as you don’t think too much about the believability of a police force being conveniently trapped in a sewer for months). (THR’s review.)
8. Memento (2000)
The one that got everybody’s attention: Nolan’s sophomore effort (co-written with his brother Jonathan) is a twisty noir thriller starring Guy Pearce as a man unable to make new memories trying to solve his wife’s murder. It’s a compelling puzzle that showed a filmmaker who can blend an accessible genre movie with a challenging narrative and pull it off, all leading to an ending that’s, well, unforgettable.
7. Dunkirk (2017)
Dunkirk is masterfully well made from its very first shot, which smash cuts into falling leaflets on a street amid a ticking clock as British World War II soldiers attempt to flee the Germans as they invade France. Nolan’s skill in staging action is on display in one gripping sequence after another. Yet several of the heroes feel unknowable and interchangeable, which keeps the audience at an emotional distance even as Nolan employs every sweeping cinematic technique to pull us close. (THR’s review.)
6. Interstellar (2014)
Nolan is often accused of being a cold filmmaker — and can be. But there’s nothing aloof about Matthew McConaughey’s powerful performance as an astronaut who leaves behind his daughter in a quest to save humanity by finding a new world to replace a dying Earth. While the story has some plot holes (OK, a lot), the resulting combination of 2001: A Space Odyssey-inspired cinematic wonder and its emotional heft make this one of Nolan’s most popular films (and currently his most successful non-superhero title at the box office). (THR’s review.)
5. Inception (2010)
From here on, Nolan is hitting home runs. Inception has Nolan putting together so many of his signature talents into one original blockbuster as it follows Leonardo DiCaprio as a man who implants false memories for his corporate clients. It’s visually spectacular, exceedingly clever and has the filmmaker’s coolest ending shot. While Hans Zimmer’s score became a meme for that iconic bwaaaahm, it’s also one of the composer’s greatest efforts (see “Time”). (THR’s review.)
4. Batman Begins (2005)
The first hour of Batman Begins is a fantastic launch to not only a grown-up Dark Knight trilogy but also a re-imagining of what superhero movies can be, if they’re treated like larger-than-life crime dramas with practical effects instead of quip-filled, save-the-world, CGI-fueled dramedies. Christian Bale quickly proved he’s a fine successor to the cowl and there’s never been a better Alfred than Michael Caine, even though the film’s final act staggers a bit.
3. The Prestige (2006)
The Prestige is a marvelous mystery based on Christopher Priest’s novel about dueling turn-of-the-century obsessive magicians with terrific performances by a dogmatic Bale, a searing Hugh Jackman (“You don’t know?!“), and an all-too-wise Caine. The Nolan brothers’ script uses voiceover and narrative in such a confident and propulsive way, and there’s an ending twist you’ll never see coming.
2. Oppenheimer (2023)
Oppenheimer is too long, overly chatty and its final act goes from fate-of-the-world stakes to men sitting around tables arguing over a security clearance (imagine if Batman defeated the Scarecrow in Batman Begins and then spent another 40 minutes discussing how to best fix Gotham City’s damaged monorail system). And yet, Nolan uses every well-honed instrument in his toolbox to create a dramatic masterpiece that has something that his other, more pulpy films largely lack: modern-day, real-world importance. In the film, based on the biography American Prometheus, Nolan successfully tells the story of a major historical figure, champions science and movingly reminds the world of the dangers of weapons of mass destruction. The score by Ludwig Göransson might be the best yet for a Nolan film. And Nolan’s hellish post-Trinity test pep rally scene is perhaps the most cleverly directed and emotionally powerful sequence of his career. (THR’s review and cover story.)
1. The Dark Knight (2008)
Because you’re never going to watch Oppenheimer as many times as you’ve probably already watched The Dark Knight — as the clown says, it’s “just too much fun.” It’s still the best superhero movie ever made, with Heath Ledger delivering a legendary (and posthumous Oscar-winning) performance as the Joker that looms over every frame, despite only appearing in 33 minutes of the 152-minute film. The script (by the Nolan brothers, along with David S. Goyer) is fantastic, with so many iconic lines (“You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain” … “It’s all part of the plan…”). Every supporting cast member pops, Zimmer’s score is ominously tense, and the action sequences are grounded and effective. So many of Nolan’s movies have lengthy run times, but this is one you don’t want to end. (THR’s review.)

However, shortly before the film began, director Christopher revealed the cast had left the premiere early in solitary with the writer's strike in the US. Hollywood's writers have been striking for months outside the studios of streaming services such as Netflix and Disney over working conditions and pay.
Oppenheimer hits theatres on 21 July, the same day as the iconic Barbie movie.

,Doomsday Scenario: In Post-Production On Oppenheimer With Christopher Nolan,Empire meets Nolan in LA to talk about going nuclear.,"With apocalyptic atomic-bomb thriller Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan brings one of his enduring obsession to the screen. We meet the director in LA to talk about going nuclear.
Read an extract of our exclusive Oppenheimer feature from our July 2023 issue below, or see the full piece here.
We see the lower fifth of Christopher Nolan. The shoes. A bit of trouser. A small section of Christopher Nolan on the move, glimpsed through the bottom of a windowed wall, the rest blocked out by frosted glass, obscuring him until he’s ready.
He stops to talk to someone, but even then, despite hearing his voice, we can’t make out the words. So here we sit, waiting for him in a small conference room, seeing and hearing bits of him, unable to piece it all together. It’s enigmatic. It’s cryptic. It’s — dare we say — cinematic. And very Christopher Nolan. He just can’t help himself.
Yes, for a man who likes his films to pose questions rather than provide answers, who constructs them like puzzles, this all makes sense. It’s early May in the Los Angeles post-production facility where his films are taken to the finish line. In rooms and offices there is evidence of an impressive career — framed newspaper cuttings about The Prestige, various awards, an Inception poster, a Batpod maquette, framed cells from the Dark Night trilogy, and film cans containing reels from his latest opus, Oppenheimer, a bit of which he’s just played for Empire in a screening room so loud it felt like an earthquake. As it should — this is a film about the man responsible for the development of the atomic bomb. The footage is, we tell Nolan as he finally appears, unnerving. “I think ‘unnerving’ is definitely a good word to describe it!” he laughs.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtcGlyZW9ubGluZS5jb20vbW92aWVzL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2Rvb21zZGF5LXNjZW5hcmlvLWluLXBvc3QtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1vbi1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci13aXRoLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-24 12:07:15+05:30,"How Cillian Murphy became Robert Oppenheimer in 6 months for Christopher Nolan: Strict diet, read the Gita, ate only almonds","When the interviewer mentioned that they wanted to give Cillian Murphy a sandwich throughout Oppenheimer because he looked 'sickly', the actor laughed and said, 'I would have taken it.'","Actor Cillian Murphy felt the fizz on the sets of Oppenheimer, thanks to its talented cast and filmmaker Christopher Nolan at the helm of it. In the filmmaker’s latest historical drama, Murphy stars as theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, regarded as the father of the atom bomb.
In a video shared by the Twitter handle of Rotten Tomatoes, Murphy detailed how he got into the headspace of Oppenheimer, a complicated, divisive figure in the US. The actor said his approach is to do as much research as possible and there was a lot on Oppenheimer to dig into. He earlier said that he read the Bhagavad Gita, from which Oppenheimer quoted after the Trinty test, “I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”.
“There’s so much archival footage out there, which you can access. Obviously, I’ve read the book but for me the most important resource was the script. That’s what I really worked on. I had six months from when Chris called me unexpectedly to when we started shooting.”

The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J Sherwin. Oppenheimer, led by Cillian Murphy, is powered by a strong supporting cast which includes Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Florence Pugh.
Murphy said, despite all the reading and research, once on sets, it all becomes about the “moment”. On Oppenheimer, Murphy said the energy of the actors was “electric”, which could be felt.
“I think when you get on the floor with actors like these guys and Chris, you kind of just put that aside and it all becomes about the moment and the truth and the emotions between the actors and everyday it was a gift. I can’t give you one specific point, but there were many scenes in the film, like with Robert, Emily and Matt that were just electric. You could feel it fizzing at that point of time. It isn’t intellectual, it is instinctual and emotional,” he added.

When the interviewer mentioned that Murphy had lost so much weight for the role that he looked “sickly” in the film and they wanted to give him a sandwich throughout the movie, the actor laughed and said, “I would have taken it.”
Blunt said in New Mexico, the team would eat quesadillas, but Murphy would be in his room, eating almonds. Damon said the actor “declined” every dinner invitation for the entire filming duration. “We invited him every night, he never came once,” Damon added.

,Emily Blunt gave Christopher Nolan Uggs as an Oppenheimer wrap gift,Christopher Nolan revealed that Emily Blunt gave him a pair of Uggs as an 'Oppenheimer' wrap gift after he criticized her for wearing them on set.,"Emily Blunt has successfully converted Christopher Nolan to the dark side of footwear.
The director revealed this week that, after mercilessly criticizing Blunt for sporting Ugg boots on the set of his new drama Oppenheimer instead of her period-appropriate heels, he now gets their appeal.
""She gave me a pair of Uggs boots — Ugg slippers, actually — as a wrap gift,"" Nolan said on Friday's episode of The View. ""For people who have been on a set, people know how it works — we're there, losing the light, 'Okay, we need the actors to come in,' and sometimes they'll come straight from wardrobe, but they'll have these big coats on top and they'll be wearing these big Ugg boots, because the shoes of the character are uncomfortable. You know, 1940s shoes.""
Nolan explained that seeing Blunt show up wearing her Uggs ""used to drive me crazy"" during shooting. ""I'd immediately say to her, 'Can you please just get rid of the boots, put the shoes on, and get ready to go?'"" he recalled, before joking, ""And she got so sick of me saying that time after time, she thought I should join the cult of Ugg boots.""
These days, Nolan added, he considers the boots to be ""pretty comfortable.""

Blunt previously shared her side of the story in a recent USA Today interview, jokingly declaring that Nolan ""hates Uggs more than anyone"" else in the entire world.
""I've never known anyone to detest a pair of Uggs more than Chris Nolan,"" she said, calling it a ""testament"" to the director's intense desire for verisimilitude while filming. ""I would sometimes put on some Uggs and I'd just get this withering look down to my feet – it was like being in The Devil Wears Prada again. Just the look down to the shoes. And I'd go, 'I know, I know. But I'm just sitting on an apple box in the background today!'""
Naturally, Blunt had to send a pair his way. Afterward, she explained, she received a note from Nolan's wife, Emma Thomas, who wrote her to say, ""Brilliant wrap gift. He's wearing them now.""
""I was so pleased!"" Blunt recalled.
Oppenheimer also stars Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr. Based on the true story of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Murphy), the scientist who led the effort to create an atomic bomb during World War II, the movie is playing in theaters now.

,'The danger never goes away': Christopher Nolan didn't intend for Oppenheimer movie to be so timely,"Known as the father of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer changed the course of history. Now, director Christopher Nolan takes his story to the screen - but does the three-hour epic pull it off? Critics think so.","The world's first nuclear explosion happened on 16 July 1945, when a plutonium implosion device was tested in New Mexico.
Now a new film about the so-called father of the atomic bomb, J Robert Oppenheimer, looks at how he came to create a weapon that would change the world and how it changed him.

Decades since its invention, as Russia's war rages in Ukraine, the weapon's threat to the world is back in people's minds.
Director Christopher Nolan, who also wrote the movie, basing it on the Pulitzer Prize winning book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin, told Sky News he never meant for his film to be so timely.
""I had a conversation with one of my teenage sons about what I was working on and he literally said to me - 'Does anybody really worry about nuclear weapons anymore? Is that really a thing in the world?'
""To which I said, 'Well, maybe that's a reason for making the film but beyond that, it's just a very, very dramatic story about how our world changed forever'.

""Two years later, he's not asking that question anymore and neither is anybody else for all the worst possible reasons, and that's symptomatic of our relationship with the threat of nuclear weapons and nuclear holocaust - it ebbs and flows with geopolitical shifts in a way that it shouldn't - I mean, the danger never goes away.""
To inhabit the role of Oppenheimer, Peaky Blinders star Cillian Murphy lost weight and perfected a new accent and also had to learn about quantum physics and grapple with Oppenheimer's morality.
""Actors love getting jobs and then they're dying to finish them, that seems to be the way,"" Murphy told Sky News.

""So, yeah, it was time for a holiday after that for sure, if you do anything for like 17, 18 hours a day and you're in that and you're on set all the time, naturally there will be a cost and then you feel at the end there's all this displaced energy and you're not quite sure what to do with it, and you start moving furniture around.""
Nolan interjects: ""And have a sandwich"".
For the director, known for movies including Intersteller, Inception and Dunkirk - and who has a reputation for shunning digital effects and greenscreen - it wasn't recreating a nuclear explosion that posed a challenge.
Instead, he says he found the casting process daunting.

""The ensemble - with Cillian at the heart of it as Oppenheimer - but then his interactions with this entire team of people coming together to pull off this, you know, impossible feat, that was a challenge for me.
""Doing these group discussions, these arguments, these interpersonal relationships and all of that, all of which came into such a kind of hothouse atmosphere with the Manhattan Project and everything they had to do in the years that they were there.
""That was something I'd never really taken on before.""

The extremely positive early reviews for Oppenheimer suggest Nolan rose to that challenge.
But now, with promotion for the film interrupted by the US actor's strike, it remains to be seen whether audiences will have the appetite for a three-hour epic about the creation of the atomic bomb - the end of the world perhaps too close for comfort to be considered entertainment.

2023-07-29 09:00:00+00:00,Christopher Nolan Movies Ranked from Worst to Best (Including Oppenheimer),"From Memento to Oppenheimer, and all the Dark Knights in between, we rank the works of one of modern cinema’s loudest voices, Christopher Nolan.","Released when Nolan was only 28, the movie is in many ways an experiment in themes and ideas that would color the rest of the writer-director’s filmography. Like most of Nolan’s early output, it’s a neo-noir picture about the self-destructive obsession of a flawed protagonist, who in this case cannot help but pursue his desire to follow strangers home. In a narrative unspooled via nonlinear storytelling, and shot on black-and-white 16mm film stock, we are invited to likewise follow a nameless and unemployed young man (Jeremy Theobald) as he walks behind strangers for fun. The lad’s vaguely Hitchcockian voyeurism becomes his undoing, though, after he is spotted spying on the criminal underworld. Viewed today, it’s not entirely polished, and the narrative strands more knot and jumble than weave and coalesce. Still, the compelling hook of Nolan’s penchant for unconventional structure and unreliable narrators was already in place.
11. Tenet (2020)
Contentiously released during the fall of 2020 at Nolan’s insistence, Tenet positioned itself as a savior of movie houses during the pandemic. This was, in retrospect, a tall order for what is Nolan’s most ambitious action movie, as well as his most remote and exasperatingly opaque. Reappraisals have already begun, with some arguing Tenet was the director attempting to see how far he could lead audiences down the path of esoteric “vibes”—there is the famous line “don’t try to understand it, feel it”—but we’d contend Tenet remains a bridge too far.
With the conventions of modern action cinema intentionally sketched at their thinnest and most utilitarian (John David Washington’s character is simply called “The Protagonist”), Tenet nonetheless presents a dizzyingly complex world and challenging sci-fi idea in which the entropy of objects and even people can be inverted—allowing most things to travel backward in time. Yet the execution is so needlessly obtuse, and the sound design intentionally confounding, that it doesn’t matter if you understand it; the main thing you’re feeling is frustration and annoyance. There are some dazzling action set pieces, and Hoyte van Hoytema’s cinematography and Ludwig Göransson’s score are sumptuous, but even after figuring out just how many Robert Pattinsons are running around at various stages of inversion, the movie remains little more than a stylish puzzle box that’s far too pleased with its configuration.
10. Insomnia (2002)
Very few directors on this side of the millennium have gotten Al Pacino to deliver a restrained and sharp performance that understands some lines can actually be underplayed to marvelous effect. Christopher Nolan is one of them thanks to his icy remake of a Norwegian film of the same name. Another excursion into neo-noir, Insomnia follows in the footsteps of many post-Se7en and Silence of the Lambs Hollywood murder procedurals, casting one movie star as the cop (Pacino) and the other as the killer (Robin Williams).
The cold-blooded cunning of Insomnia comes from the revelation that the killer is no genius, but rather a somewhat pathetic loner with a reptilian brain who, through a grim twist of luck, is able to blackmail his pursuer into becoming his accomplice. In hindsight, the film’s fascination with the duality between hero and villain was a warm-up act for The Dark Knight, but the restrained Insomnia is often more unsettling due to how calmly both actors are asked to essay their characters, with Williams making for an exceptionally soft-spoken demon, and Pacino for a compelling corrupt cop circling the drain. If the film was allowed to better breakaway from the conventions of these types of early 2000s movies, it might’ve been an actual classic instead of an absorbing, if less memorable, star vehicle from an era when studios would let stars appear in such fare.
9. Batman Begins (2005)
The placement of the Batman films on this list will undoubtedly be the most contentious thing for readers, but please understand we all think Batman Begins is a great piece of entertainment, as well as the finest superhero origin story ever produced. Told with what was at the time a shocking amount of gravitas and charm, Batman Begins recognized superhero movies as material worthy of serious cinematic consideration. Such a feat arguably had not been seen since Superman: The Movie (1978).

2023-06-29 16:19:30+00:00,"Barbenheimer: ‘Barbie’ Tracking for Beatific $70M- $80M Opening, Christopher Nolan’s ‘Oppenheimer’ Targets $40M",The two tentpoles open in North America over the July 21-23 weekend.,"In one of the most intriguing showdowns in recent times, filmmaker Greta Gerwig’s Barbie is tracking to open well ahead of Christopher Nolan‘s atomic bomb drama Oppenheimer. But the biggest winner could be theatrical if the two movies work over the long run.
The two July tentpoles — dubbed “Barbenheimer” on social media — officially came on tracking Thursday, three weeks ahead of their detonation in theaters over the July 21-23 weekend.
From Warner Bros., Barbie could open to a beatific $70 million to $80 million, if not more, according to sources who have access to tracking data (and there’s plenty of upside). Warners is being more cautious, suggesting $60 million. The movie, based on the iconic Mattel toy line of dolls, stars Margot Robbie in the titular role and Ryan Gosling as Ken.
A Barbie movie had languished in development for years before moving from Sony to Warners. But in recent weeks, the film has turned into a social media and marketing phenomenon (not to mention merchandising). And buzzy female-skewing titles can transform into box office summer bonanzas, such as Warners’ Sex and the City or Universal’s Mamma Mia! franchises. Barbie is skewing almost entirely female at this point, and particularly to females 35 and under.
Universal and Nolan’s Oppenheimer is tracking for a domestic debut in the $40 million range. For Oppenheimer — an R-rated, three-hour drama targeting adults — having legs could prove far more important than its opening weekend haul. Still, $40 million would mark one of the acclaimed filmmaker’s lowest openings. And excluding Tenet, which opened to $20 million during the heart of the pandemic, it would mark Nolan’s lowest start since The Prestige ($14.8 million) in 2006.
Nolan has come in No. 2 before; in 2014, Interstellar opened behind Disney’s Big Hero 6 with $47.5 million on its way to enjoying a long ride in theaters and grossing $701.7 million globally.
Oppenheimer stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, considered the father of the atom bomb, alongside an ensemble cast of A-listers including Emily Blunt and Matt Damon.
Paramount and Skydance open Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One on July 12 domestically, and the event pic will still be a formidable force when Oppenheimer and Barbie unfurl. (There’s even a scenario where Oppenheimer comes in third in its opening weekend behind Barbie and Mission: Impossible.)
The three tentpoles, along with this weekend’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, need to succeed if summer revenue is to make gains over 2022. On Thursday, Cruise urged his fans to support the theatrical experience by seeing Indy, Barbie and Oppenheimer (in addition to Mission, of course).",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9iYXJiaWUtYm94LW9mZmljZS10cmFja2luZy1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci0xMjM1NTI2MTcyL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9iYXJiaWUtYm94LW9mZmljZS10cmFja2luZy1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci0xMjM1NTI2MTcyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The cast of ""Oppenheimer"" has been on a seriously gushy media tour.
The movie has made more than $209 million since it came out on July 21, per Box Office Mojo. The cast members, for their part, have been on a media tour de force full of effusive praise and affection for each other.
Here's a sampling of cast members gushing about Cillian Murphy:
""I have never witnessed a greater sacrifice by a lead actor in my career,"" Robert Downey Jr. said of his costar Cillian Murphy in a People Magazine story published Sunday.

Emily Blunt, who plays the wife of Murphy's character in the movie, said she was wowed by the extreme diet Murphy underwent to resemble J. Robert Oppenheimer.
""He had such a monumental undertaking. And he could only eat, like, an almond every day. He was so emaciated,"" Blunt told Extra in an interview that aired July 7.
Blunt and Matt Damon have also talked about losing themselves in Murphy's piercing blue eyes while shooting.
""It's a real problem when you're doing scene work with Cillian,"" Damon told People Magazine in a story published Friday. ""Sometimes you find yourself just swimming in his eyes.""

""It's like that 'Ocean Eyes' song by Billie Eilish. We just hum it all day,"" Blunt said in the same interview.
Here's Murphy on Downey Jr.:
""I mean, acting with him was just extraordinary,"" Murphy told GQ magazine in a story published Monday. ""He's just electrifying, the most available, engaged, present, unpredictably brilliant actor I've ever worked with.""
Murphy on Florence Pugh:

Pugh and Murphy share a sex scene in the movie, something the film's director, Christopher Nolan, had never done before in his filmography.
""And I think when you see it, it's so fucking powerful. And they're not gratuitous. They're perfect. And Florence is just amazing,"" Murphy said of Pugh in an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, published July 19.
""She has this presence as a person and on screen that is staggering. The impact she has for the size of the role, it's quite devastating,"" Murphy said.
A-list marketing
While gushy media tours aren't new — ""A Star is Born,"" anyone? — this one stands out first because of the sheer quantity of comments and the competition it's up against.

I'm talking, of course, about the marketing behemoth that is Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie."" ""Barbie"" has been widely promoted with everything from Barbie-themed Xbox controllers to burgers numbering among the movie's many wall-to-wall marketing plays.
In fact, ""Barbie"" had a $150 million marketing budget, per Variety. That's bigger than the estimated $100 million it cost to make ""Oppenheimer.""
With competition like that, ""Oppenheimer"" needed to muster every ounce of marketing magic it had. Having the very famous and talented cast publicly declare their admiration for one another is a low-cost but effective way to promote ""Oppenheimer.""
And it looks like it's working. According to Deadline, the movie clocked the highest global day and date opening weekend ever for a biopic. ""Oppenheimer"" also bested ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" by netting the biggest opening weekend for an R-rated film in 2023, per Screen Rant.

2023-07-18 07:57:19+05:30,"Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer: A look at the scientist’s fascination with Hinduism, and why he quoted the Bhagavad Gita after the bomb was tested",Christopher Nolan's upcoming film has reawakened interest in nuclear physicist J Robert Oppenheimer's fascination with the Hindu religion.,"As fans in India excitedly wait for the release of Christopher Nolan‘s new film, Oppenheimer, many have revisited the famed nuclear physicist’s iconic reference to the Bhagavad Gita. J Robert Oppenheimer has often quoted from the sacred text, making the words synonymous with his achievements.
Oppenheimer’s research resulted in the creation of the first nuclear bombs. He immediately understood the gravity of what he had helped create, and has often said that the first words that ran through his mind after the bomb was successfully tested in the New Mexico desert in 1945 were from the Gita: “If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the Mighty One… I am become death, the shatterer of worlds.”
According to Time Magazine, Oppenheimer read the Gita for his ‘personal delight’ in the evenings, and sometimes to entertain friends. A copy of the sacred text, bound in pink and held together by scotch tape, was placed in his Princeton study. He took lessons in Sanskrit, his eighth language, from Professor Arthur W Ryder at Berkeley, and was particularly fond of the couplet, “Scholarship is less than sense, therefore seek intelligence.” According to his colleague, the Nobel Prize winner Isidor Rabi, Oppenheimer was ‘overeducated’ in fields that ‘lie outside the scientific tradition’, such as his interest in the Hindu religion. Rabi said, “He saw physics clearly, looking toward what had already been done, but at the border he tended to feel there was much more of the mysterious and novel than there actually was… [he turned] away from the hard, crude methods of theoretical physics into a mystical realm of broad intuition.”

A Time Magazine report published in 1948 recounted his story, and quoted Brigadier General Thomas F Farrell as describing Oppenheimer’s demeanour on the fateful day. “He grew tenser as the last seconds ticked off. He scarcely breathed. He held on to a post to steady himself . . . When the announcer shouted ‘Now!’ and there came this tremendous burst of light, followed … by the deep-growling roar of the explosion, his face relaxed into an expression of tremendous relief.”
Years later, he would still be impacted by the ethical complexities of creating a bomb capable of such destruction. Deployment of two atom bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki effectively brought World War 2 to an end. But the destruction caused by something that he had helped create confirmed Oppenheimer’s fears. He told fellow physicists, according to the obituary that the New York Times published on his death in 1967, that the bomb “dramatised so mercilessly the inhumanity and evil of modern war.” He added, “In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no overstatements can quite extinguish,” he went on, “the physicists have known sin; and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.”
In a news interview following the bombings on Japan, Oppenheimer once again recalled the emotions that were felt in the control room on the day of the test. “We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, ‘Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.’ I suppose we all thought that one way or another.”
He made an effort to regulate atomic energy by heading the Atomic Energy Commission’s General Advisory Committee of top nuclear scientists. He also served on the atomic committee of the Research and Development Board to advise the military.

The 1945 test will be featured prominently in the film Oppenheimer, as the trailers have shown. One of the most haunting images of the trailer shows Oppenheimer’s face lit up by the light of the explosion. The film will be released in theatres across the world on July 21, and advance booking for it began three weeks prior to release date. Although recent reports suggest that advance bookings were temporarily halted because the film received an A certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification. Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J Sherwin, Oppenheimer stars Cillian Murphy in the lead role, alongside Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Florence Pugh and others.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9ob2xseXdvb2QvY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tb3BwZW5oZWltZXItaGluZHVpc20tc2Fuc2tyaXQtYmhhZ2F2YWQtZ2l0YS04ODMzMDIxL9IBhQFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9ob2xseXdvb2QvY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tb3BwZW5oZWltZXItaGluZHVpc20tc2Fuc2tyaXQtYmhhZ2F2YWQtZ2l0YS04ODMzMDIxL2xpdGUv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

(Also read: Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer sells 90000 tickets for opening day, Barbie advance booking stands at 16000 in India) Cillian Murphy as scientist J Robert Oppenheimer in Christopher Nolan's upcoming film Oppenheimer.
About Oppenheimer
Oppenheimer is based on Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin's biography American Prometheus, based on the life of American theoretical physicist known as the ‘father of the atomic bomb.’ It stars Cillian Murphy in the titular role and the ensemble cast includes Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon and Florence Pugh.
Opening day box office prediction
As per a report by 123Telugu.com, Oppenheimer is set for a box office collection in the range of ₹10-15 crore on the day of its release in India. Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One had collected around ₹12.50 crore on its opening day in India, so it will be interesting to see whether Oppenheimer can outdo that.
The early sales of Oppenheimer began a week ago in India as the film's advance booking started 10 days ago. It received a tremendous response within the first very few hours. As per the figures posted by a film trade analyst, the film has already amassed 90,000 tickets across all three multiple chains - PVR, INOX and Cinepolis - for the opening day itself. These include IMAX screens as well.
Christopher Nolan on Oppenheimer
Christopher Nolan recently opened up on making Oppenheimer. “I just thought to take the audience there, to be there in that room with these people as they had to make these horrifying decisions that have defined the world we now live in... what a remarkable dramatic event to bring the audience to,” Nolan told Reuters.
On the other hand, Barbie, which has also commenced its advance booking, has shown a good start and has sold around 16,000 tickets across the three multiple chains for the opening day.
About Barbie

“Oppenheimer” is Nolan’s first feature at Universal and a company-wide priority. A Comcast NBCUniversal Symphony title, the company leveraged the unequalled breadth of its portfolio in support of the film. The movie’s historical foundation made for a perfect partnership with NBC’s world class news division.
On July 15, Universal and Syncopy commemorated the anniversary of The Trinity Test with a screening in New York featuring a post-event conversation with filmmaker Christopher Nolan and some of the greatest scientific minds of our time including Dr. Thom Mason, Director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, world-renowned theoretical physicist Dr. Carlo Rovelli, the event's honorary chairmen: Nobel Prize winning theoretical physicist Dr. Kip Thorne, who served as a consultant on the film, and Pulitzer Prize winner Kai Bird, co-author of the book “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” the basis for Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” screenplay. Chuck Todd, the Emmy-winning host of NBC's “Meet the Press,” moderated the conversation which also aired on NBC.
On MSNBC, “Morning Joe” co-host Joe Scarborough sat down for an exclusive interview with “Oppenheimer” writer/director Christopher Nolan and stars Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr. to discuss the making of the film, which Scarborough described as “breathtaking” and “unlike anything I've ever seen.” The cast opened up about bringing their complex characters to life, shooting on location, the magic of big screen, and more.

2023-07-21 15:11:28+05:30,Has Japan banned the release of Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer? Here's the truth,"Speculation has arisen over a potential ban on Christopher Nolan's film ""Oppenheimer"" in Japan due to sensitivities surrounding nuclear warfare | Hollywood","As the highly anticipated release of Christopher Nolan's epic film, ""Oppenheimer,"" draws near, speculations have emerged about a potential ban on the movie in Japan. ""Oppenheimer"" delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist behind the creation of the first nuclear bomb during the Manhattan Project. This image released by Universal Pictures shows Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock, left, and Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer in a scene from ""Oppenheimer."" (AP)
The use of nuclear weaponry in the Pacific War resulted in devastating consequences for Japan, with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki causing the loss of approximately 200,000 lives, mostly civilians. However, recent reports debunk the ban rumors, indicating that the film's release plans are still in progress for various markets, including Japan.
Japanese Cinema's Savvy Approach
While ""Oppenheimer"" gears up for its global release, the Japanese market is known for its prudent approach to blockbuster films. Hollywood releases often arrive later in Japan than in other countries, giving the industry a chance to gauge the movie's performance and popularity worldwide before determining its local release strategy. If ""Oppenheimer"" proves successful elsewhere, Japan may opt for a widespread launch; otherwise, a limited release could be considered.
Unfounded Sensitivities
Speculation arose that ""Oppenheimer"" might be too sensitive for Japanese audiences due to the tragic events of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, a glance through Japan's cinematic history reveals a liberal approach to artistic expression. The industry has embraced various genres and styles, including horror, samurai, and high-school themed dramas. Moreover, since the 1950s, film censorship in Japan has largely focused on explicit imagery rather than political or militaristic issues.
A Gripping Tale Leaving Audiences Devastated
As the film premiered in several locations, viewers have been deeply moved by the intense story it portrays. Some even described it as akin to a horror movie. Kai Bird, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and co-author of the book that inspired the film, expressed being stunned and emotionally affected by “Oppenheimer.”
Christopher Nolan himself proclaimed J. Robert Oppenheimer as one of the most significant figures in history, shaping the world we live in today, both for better and worse.
Awaiting ""Oppenheimer's"" Unveiling in Japan
The delays are not uncommon, and the industry's pragmatic approach could lead to a decision based on the film's global success. Despite the historical sensitivities surrounding nuclear warfare, Japan's cinematic landscape has shown resilience and artistic freedom over the years, making it a compelling territory for ""Oppenheimer"" to explore.

Is Oppenheimer in Japan is same as Barbie in Vietnam?
Coincidentally, another film, Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie,"" has faced its own challenges in Vietnam, where it was banned over a scene depicting the contentious ""nine-dash line,"" representing China's territorial claims in the South China Sea. In response, Warner Bros clarified that the scene was intended to be a child-like crayon drawing within the context of “Barbie's make-believe journey from Barbie Land.”

2023-07-24 21:00:08+00:00,Will ‘Oppenheimer’ be the ticket to Christopher Nolan’s elusive first Oscar?,"The filmmaker has been nominated five times over the last 22 years, but he has yet to win.","It’s been more than two decades since filmmaker Christopher Nolan‘s first Oscar nomination, but he’s still waiting for his first victory. Will “Oppenheimer” be the film that finally nabs him the gold?
The first of Nolan’s five career nominations to date came 22 years ago. It was Best Original Screenplay for his and Jonathan Nolan‘s tricky, innovative script for “Memento,” a 2001 thriller about a man with short-term memory loss that was told in reverse order. That indie film led to bigger projects, including the “Batman” trilogy that marked his breakthrough in blockbuster filmmaking. The second of those, “The Dark Knight” (2008), was touted for potential Oscars and indeed received eight of them, but Nolan himself was snubbed entirely: no Best Picture, no Best Director, and no Best Adapted Screenplay.
He got his elusive first Best Picture nom for the sci-fi epic “Inception” (2010), for which he was also nominated for writing. But again, no Best Director bid. That would wait a few more years, finally coming for his 2017 war film “Dunkirk”; Nolan received Picture and Director bids for that one. Which brings us to “Oppenheimer.” On paper it’s Oscars catnip: a biopic (check) about an important historical figure (check) set during World War II (check) and featuring a highly pedigreed cast and crew (check). But will that translate to actual awards?
As of this writing the film ranks second in our odds for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, all of which would go to Nolan as producer, director, and writer of the film. If the odds hold true and he receives those nominations, it would be his first time contending in all three fields at the same time. Unfortunately for Nolan, though, for the moment he’s stuck behind Martin Scorsese‘s “Killers of the Flower Moon” in all three categories. “Flower Moon” has already screened at the Cannes Film Festival to rapturous reviews, so it might be tough for “Oppenheimer” to catch. But the story of Oscars is never fully written as early as July, so Nolan’s overdue narrative may yet boost him towards the winner’s circle.

2023-07-27 18:21:40+00:00,Matthew Modine On Working With Christopher Nolan: “He’s Like An Orchestra Conductor”,"Movie interview, Matthew Modine: The actor talks about filming Oppenheimer, Stranger Things, and his recent documentary on the atomic tests.","This interview was conducted before the current SAG-AFTRA strike. It has been edited for length and clarity.
Although Matthew Modine has been making his way through the Hollywood ranks since the early ‘80s, the actor has found himself in a new position of prominence thanks to Stranger Things. Since portraying the complicated and devious Dr. Brenner in the first season of the Netflix series in 2016, Modine has become even more of a household name. The role earned him a SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series and his character’s return last year made waves amongst fans. But Modine has a lot more on his plate. Recently he’s produced and filmed several movies, narrated a documentary (Accidental Truth, about UFOs), and performed onstage in London’s West End. He’s also part of the star-studded cast of Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s new blockbuster about the origin of the atomic bomb.
In Oppenheimer, Modine plays Vannevar Bush, a real-life historical figure who headed the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development during World War II. Bush was involved in many of the discussions about the atomic bomb, including which Japanese cities to target. Modine describes filming the scenes where some guys decide the fate of the world as almost absurd.
“The idea that there was this small group of men sitting in a room, old white men, who arbitrarily make a decision in that moment of going from one bomb to two bombs is incredible,” the actor tells Observer. “That a decision as powerful and as dangerous and as deadly as that could be made in a room—it’s beyond my comprehension and my belief that that’s how decisions are made. But it’s historically correct of what would happen in that room.”
Oppenheimer, which marks Modine’s second collaboration with Nolan, is one of two projects Modine is involved with which reflect on humanity’s obsession with nuclear weapons. His recent documentary Downwind, which Modine executive produced, examines the real-world impact of the nuclear tests in America. The actor made both films in between shooting the upcoming thriller Retribution with Liam Neeson and true life drama Hard Miles, as well as writing and directing a short film, I Am What You Imagine, which will premiere in film festivals this fall.
Here Modine speaks to Observer about making Oppenheimer, why humanity is in dire straits, and how Stranger Things has changed Hollywood.
What drew you to this project?
Film, for good and bad, is a powerful tool of influence. You can make films that glorify combat and war and make it romantic—what I call war pornography. Or you can make a film like All Quiet on the Western Front that shows you how ugly and horrible it is. That there’s nothing that’s sexy or romantic about it. It’s an ugly, horrible solution to people who hold different views. So with Oppenheimer I said yes right away. There’s a scene where [Vannevar] Bush is speaking during Oppenheimer’s trial and he says he’s expressed an opinion that was unpopular and that if we’re going to destroy people’s lives because they express an opinion that is unpopular, then you should start with me because I’ve expressed an unpopular opinion.
In the time we’re living in, especially with social media and the way that people are so quickly crucified for expressing an opinion that somebody might find contrary, that doesn’t bode well or speak well of humanity and civilization. We have to be able to discuss our differences and, more importantly, to hold a different opinion. That’s how we evolve. We’re living in a really, really volatile time with these really, really powerful weapons of war.
The massive cast was probably also a draw.
Just to get a sense of Christopher Nolan, when I asked him about participating, he said, “We’re casting a bunch of unknowns. The only person that you know is Cillian [Murphy], who’s playing Oppenheimer.” I knew Cillian and hadn’t worked with him, but we were in the same movie, The Dark Knight Rises. He’s a wonderful actor. And then you get closer to going to work and all of the unknowns are people that you’ve known or worked with or people you admire, from Kenneth Branagh to Robert Downey Jr. to Matt Damon. I mean, it was ridiculous. But that’s a testament to Emma [Thomas], Christopher’s wife, and Christopher. They’re such lovely people. They’re so kind and smart and obviously great filmmakers that these are folks people want to work with.
So were you cast because you had worked with Christopher previously?
I hope so! He’s like an orchestra conductor. Christopher is always on the set, he’s always standing beside the camera. He’s there in the scene with you when you’re doing it. What generally happens today is the director’s in another room watching on a television monitor, but because he’s in the room you can feel his encouragement. The same way that a conductor stands in front of an orchestra and raises his hand and opens his palm and says, “A little bit softer, a little bit louder.” Christopher conducts when on his set and it’s something that I really appreciate.
And as a cellist or a violin player or percussionist, it’s your responsibility to learn the song. You have to learn the role and show with all of your knowledge of how to play that piece because you’re part of a big orchestra. It’s not Christopher Nolan’s responsibility or job to teach you to do your part. That’s why he hires you. It’s why those actors come to work because they do all of their homework and their research. They show up and Christopher conducts them.
How long ago did you shoot Oppenheimer?
I’m very bad with dates. I saw a five-year calendar on someone’s wall once and it was just a bunch of boxes. And in the boxes, he had ticked off what he was going to do in six months time and a year and two years and three years. What was astonishing to me was how few boxes five years represented. What it looked like. From that point, I took my watch off and I tossed the calendar and I said, “I just don’t want to measure my life by a calendar or clock.” But I want to say it was about a year ago—it was pretty fast.
In general, why does it feel important for you to be part of the conversation about nuclear weapons?
Nuclear bombs and nuclear energy are a temporary solution to a permanent problem. As long as human beings use violence and war to solve our problems we are the stupidest primate. There are eight billion people on the planet consuming the Earth’s resources at an unsustainable pace. We are about to experience the largest migration of climate refugees in the history of the planet. I picked up a book in England, which I encourage you to read, called The Long View. The problem with the world is the political systems and the economic systems are all designed for the short view. To address the environmental problems that we have, it demands a long view. You can’t look at it in four year cycles, you can’t look at it in quarterly cycles. It demands that we look at the systems where the tree that you and I plant today, we will never enjoy the shade of that tree. You plant that tree for your grandchildren. And that’s what’s missing from the human race today is that ability to see the long view.
The film Downwind, which is also about nuclear bombs, reflects on that. I grew up in Utah. My family—my father, my uncle and my grandfather and my grandmother—they all lived out in the desert in a place called China Ranch in Death Valley. They all died with cancer. They were all downwind of the almost one thousand bombs that were tested in the Nevada desert. They were downwind of the radiation that was falling depending on which way the wind was blowing. I was watching the news once and I saw my brother Maury being arrested and he said what I consider one of most significant things about atomic bomb testing: We know they work, so why did we have to test almost one thousand bombs on American soil?
Did you film Retribution before or after Oppenheimer?
Right before. Liam Neeson and I have been friends for almost three decades and we’ve always wanted to work together. There’s been some plays that we were going to try to do on Broadway.
The director of Retribution, Nimród [Antal], was directing two episodes of Stranger Things. One day, he said, “Come on, they’re ready for us on the set. So we’re going to walk through it together.” I said, “I’ll walk with you if you give me a job in the Liam Neeson movie you’re directing.” He laughed and I laughed. About an hour later, he showed me his phone and had a text message from his producer saying, “We think it’s a great idea.”
It’s a good lesson in asking for what you want.
I would have never done it before because it sounds like such an ass-holic thing to do. That’s a word I learned from Christopher Nolan—I have to give credit where credit’s due.
How has Stranger Things impacted your career?
I think it’s changed the entire entertainment industry. When I began, one of the most famous films I was in was Full Metal Jacket, a very powerful anti-war film. If Full Metal Jacket was successful in 60 territories around the world that was an unbelievable success. Netflix is in over 190 territories around the world, bringing entertainment right into people’s homes. So the kind of success that you can experience today from a streaming service like Netflix or Hulu is something that’s never existed in the history of the entertainment industry.
Have we seen the last of Dr. Brenner?
I hope not! It has been announced now they’re doing the origin story on stage. The producer of a play that I did, To Kill a Mockingbird, in London, Sonia Friedman Productions, is doing an origin story of Stranger Things. I think the whole scenario is about the origin of Dr. Brenner and the children.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvbWF0dGhldy1tb2RpbmUtb24td29ya2luZy13aXRoLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLWhlcy1saWtlLWFuLW9yY2hlc3RyYS1jb25kdWN0b3Iv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-07-12 17:00:00+00:00,What Cameras Did Christopher Nolan Use on 'Oppenheimer'?,"When Nolan makes a movie, we sit and watch in awe.","Christopher Nolan is a name that drives us to the theaters in droves. He's a filmmaker whose point of view is unlike anyone else working today. His comprehension of scope and scale is unparalleled and when he announced he would be tackling the story of Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb, I became very excited.
So how did Nolan turn an Oppenheimer movie of this scale into reality? What cameras did he use to capture this story?
This article delves into Nolan's innovative techniques, the use of IMAX film cameras, and his collaboration with Special Effects Supervisor Scott R. Fisher and Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema.
We'll take you through everything we know about the movie and Nolan's process.
Let's get started.
Oppenheimer | Shooting For IMAX youtu.be
Nolan's Groundbreaking Approach
In Oppenheimer, Nolan has once again chosen his favored approach of practical effects over computer-generated imagery (CGI). ""I think recreating the Trinity test [the first nuclear weapon detonation, in New Mexico] without the use of computer graphics, was a huge challenge to take on,"" explains Nolan to Total Film. ""Andrew Jackson–my visual effects supervisor, I got him on board early on–was looking at how we could do a lot of the visual elements of the film practically, from representing quantum dynamics and quantum physics to the Trinity test itself, to recreating, with my team, Los Alamos up on a mesa in New Mexico in extraordinary weather, a lot of which was needed for the film, in terms of the very harsh conditions out there–there were huge practical challenges.""
For a crucial scene depicting the detonation of an atomic bomb, Nolan's team managed to recreate the effect practically, without resorting to CGI. This commitment to realism was evident in his creation of the atomic bomb detonation scene.
""I find CG rarely is able to grab you,"" Nolan revealed in an interview with Empire. ""It tends to feel safe. Even if it's impressive and beautiful, it's difficult to make you feel danger. And we were presenting the ultimate danger. We needed it to feel threatening, nasty, and frightening to the audience.""

Special Effects: A Practical Approach
The special effects team, led by Scott R. Fisher, had their work cut out for them. One of the most significant challenges was recreating the Trinity Test, the world's first-ever atomic explosion. Fisher and his team used forced perspective, an age-old Hollywood trick, to achieve this.
""We don't call them miniatures; we call them 'big-atures,'"" Fisher explained. ""We do them as big as we possibly can, but we do reduce the scale so it's manageable. It's getting it closer to the camera, and doing it as big as you can in the environment.""
The pyrotechnic aspect was a combination of gasoline and propane, with aluminum powder and magnesium added to mimic the blinding flash of a nuclear blast. The goal was to replicate the brightness, causing an intense discussion about the flash.

How Do You Shoot This Stuff?
Our very own Alyssa Miller wrote a breakdown of the cameras Nolan used for these explosive shots. Cinematographers relied on two basic types of cameras for their high-speed work.
The pin-registered cameras, which are the most common of the two, have a superior image quality but have a limiting frame rate. The 16mm Photo-Sonics Actionmaster 500 is limited to a maximum frame rate of 500 fps, while the 35mm-4ER Photo-Sonics camera is limited to a max of 360 fps.
Rumor has it that one of the cameras Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema attempted to use was a Photo-Sonics 35mm 4C high-speed rotary prism camera, which is capable of 2,500 frames per second. If a shot requires a faster camera, then creatives must rely on a rotary prism camera. The Photo-Sonics 16mm E10 is one such camera that can capture up to 10,000 fps while still using film, making it a great solution for slowing down motion to a near standstill.
Unfortunately, the camera is unable to capture great footage at such a high rate for a feature film. Instead, sources tell NFS that the cameras used on Oppenheimer maxed out at 150 fps. The pyro work on the film was done at a substantial scale due to the limits of in-camera magic. There was some post-manipulation of some shots, but there seem to hardly be VFX effects done to emphasize the greatness and magnitude of the explosion. Then again, this could be another situation like the VFX shots in Top Gun: Maverick.

Harnessing the Power of IMAX
Oppenheimer is filmed in a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film photography including, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX black and white analogue photography. This decision was rooted in Nolan's love for the format. He believes that IMAX offers a level of immersion unmatched by other formats. This choice posed its unique challenges, given the bulkiness and heaviness of the IMAX MSM 9802 camera.
Still, these hurdles did not deter Hoyte Van Hoytema, the film's cinematographer, who was determined to use the IMAX cameras in all modes, even carrying them on his shoulders. He aimed to transform the IMAX from a format known for grand vistas to a more intimate medium, capturing the complex landscape of human faces.
Shooting faces with IMAX cameras presented a unique challenge. The large-format IMAX cameras capture a level of detail that makes it difficult to shoot faces without revealing every minor detail. However, Hoytema and Nolan were unafraid of this complication, instead using it to their advantage to capture a series of intimate, portrait-style shots.
One of the unique elements of Oppenheimer was its combination of color and black and white, an approach that required Nolan and his team to create their own 65mm black and white film. This new format was tested on a giant IMAX screen, and the results were Nolan approved.
Summing Up A Behind-The-Scenes Look at Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer
Oppenheimer is a testament to Nolan's innovative approach to filmmaking, pushing the boundaries of cinematic storytelling. With its immersive use of IMAX cameras and practical special effects, the film promises to offer audiences a unique movie-going experience.
Christopher Nolan's reputation as a visionary director continues as he pushes the boundaries of what we can expect from cinema.

We called Barbie a ""masterful exploration of feminity and the pressures of perfection,"" in our 9/10 review, and Oppenheimer we dubbed ""Christopher Nolan's most abstract yet most exacting work"" with a 10/10 score. These Barbenheimer t-shirts also seem to be doing the rounds on social media as well, if you want to look the part when attending your double feature.

Robert Oppenheimer in the film.","TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) – Ever since Christopher Nolan’s blockbuster hit “Oppenheimer” premiered in theatres, many have noticed that Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Tyler Glasnow looks eerily similar to Cillian Murphy, who plays the lead role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in the film.
After Glasnow went viral on social media for looking like Murphy’s “long-lost twin,” many wondered if Murphy even knew he had a “doppelganger” since he’s not online, let alone one who plays professional baseball.
It turns out he’s very aware.
In an interview with Josh Horowitz on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast, Murphy was asked who’s the last actor he got mistaken for. When Murphy responded, saying it doesn’t really happen to him, Horowitz brought up Tampa Bay’s Tyler Glasnow.
“Are you aware – again, I know you’re not online, this baseball player that’s been mistaken for you?” Horowitz asked.
To which Murphy surprisingly replied, “Yes, I’ve been sent that.”
“You’re the first person to say, but wasn’t that like an AI-generated image or something?” Murphy asked. “Many people have sent the [picture]. I need to turn off more notifications.”
While the Rays’ photo of Glasnow may have been a little touched up, the resemblance between the two is still uncanny.

Although there are several differences between Glasnow and Murphy, like the staggering 18-year age gap and the fact Murphy probably can’t throw a 96 mph fastball, fans can’t help but be in awe over their looks.
“You’ve got a long-lost twin,” Horowitz told Murphy.
“Yeah, well, he’s a lot better at baseball than I am,” Murphy said. When told that he’s probably “a bit better at acting” than Glasnow, Murphy joked, “Well, we’ve all got our skills.”
Horowitz shared that clip of his interview with Murphy on Twitter with the caption, “Yes, Cillian Murphy is aware of his baseball doppelgänger.”
As of right now, Glasnow has yet to publicly comment on the resemblance.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZmxhLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LW5ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc3Rhci1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1hY2tub3dsZWRnZXMtcmF5cy1waXRjaGVyLWFzLWRvcHBlbGdhbmdlci1oZXMtYS1sb3QtYmV0dGVyLWF0LWJhc2ViYWxsLXRoYW4taS1hbS_SAZ0BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2ZsYS5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1uZXdzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXN0YXItY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktYWNrbm93bGVkZ2VzLXJheXMtcGl0Y2hlci1hcy1kb3BwZWxnYW5nZXItaGVzLWEtbG90LWJldHRlci1hdC1iYXNlYmFsbC10aGFuLWktYW0vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Cineplex Inc. says it saw its highest July box office of all time as Barbie and Oppenheimer sent droves to theatres last month.
The Toronto-based cinema chain says the record month surpassed $86 million in net box office revenues.
July also delivered the company its second-highest month on record, trailing December 2015, when Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens was released.
Cineplex attributed much of the month’s lift to “Barbie,” which generated the highest July attendance at its theatres, followed by Oppenheimer and Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.
Altogether the company says 6.8 million moviegoers visited its theatres last month and Cineplex also scored its second-highest monthly premium box office revenue of all time.

No filme de Nolan, Murphy (47 anos) dá vida a Oppenheimer e Pugh (27 anos) interpreta a primeira noiva do cientista, a psiquiatra Jean Tatlock. Na entrevista ao diário inglês The Guardian na qual falou sobre suas cenas de nudez com a colega, o ator também disse que os dois passaram por um “teste de química”, tendo sua interação avaliada pelos produtores do filme.

Na entrevista ao The Guardian, Murphy disse que o aspecto romântico da história de ‘Oppenheimer’ “é um dos mais intensos"" já feitos por ele. Depois a reportagem do jornal fala em “cenas prolongadas de nudez frontal” do ator com Pugh, ""além de cenas de sexo e cenas complicadas com Emily Blunt, intérprete de sua esposa”.
Murphy classificou as cenas com Blunt como “muito pesadas”. No entanto ele disse que recebeu “instruções enfáticas para não entregar nada do filme”.

Sobre seus “testes de química” com suas colegas de elenco, o ator explicou: “Eles colocam dois atores em uma sala para ver se existe alguma química, com os produtores e o diretor em uma mesa nos assistindo. Não sei qual é a métrica deles e parece algo extremamente bobo, mas às vezes essa química acontece e ninguém consegue explicar”.

Cillian Murphy é presença constante nos filmes de Christopher Nolan. Ele foi dirigido pelo cineasta na trilogia ‘Batman - O Cavaleiro das Trevas’ e em ‘A Origem’ (2010). Já Florence Pugh tem no currículo uma indicação ao Oscar por seu trabalho no drama de época ‘Adoráveis Mulheres’ (2019). Para a Marvel ela trabalhou em ‘Viúva Negra’ (2021) e na série ‘Gavião Arqueiro’.",https://news.google.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?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,TCL Q6 Review: Best Overall,"It's bright, affordable, looks great, and is easy to mount and use. What's not to like?","A good TV should never disappoint you. Whether you’re tuning in for a big game, racing losers online, or just streaming a show in the background, the picture should be clear and the content should be easy to access.
TCL’s latest mid-tier hero to accomplish this task is the Q6 (a replacement of sorts for last year’s 5-Series). It’s a solid TV in every way that matters, right down to its new Google operating system. Casting movies, photos, and apps from your phone to your screen is easier than ever, and you’ll still find nearly the same ease of use as you used to on the older Roku models.
As always, this is one of the best TVs for most people, especially if you don’t need the faster refresh rate of higher-end models for gaming. You can even choose between two positions for the TV’s included legs, which means it can fit on older, more svelte TV stands.
Same Old TCL

Besides a new remote that pairs with the new Google operating system (this one is more pill-shaped and longer), there isn’t much that tells you you’re looking at the latest era of TCL. The TV is still about 2 inches thick and thus easy to mount, and it still has super thin bezels on each side.
The biggest change is the aforementioned legs, which are nicer in the center position, though I’d still prefer a pedestal mount or to wall mount this TV if I bought it. It can be hard to fit a soundbar between the thinner leg sections (yes, you should have a soundbar).
Setup takes no time. Just sign in with Google and download every app that you’re interested in. There isn’t much that this doesn’t have. The one app I couldn’t find that I regularly use was F1 TV, but even that has Google Chromecast integration, so I was able to stream it from my computer or phone to the TV with ease.
The built-in Chromecast functionality finally puts TCL on par with fellow mid-tier TV brand Vizio with its Smartcast interface. It can’t be overstated how nice it is to quickly pull up stuff on a phone to watch it on TV, especially if you have friends and family over. All they need to do to cast to your TV is to connect to your Wi-Fi.
The downside of the new OS is that it can be a bit sluggish. I frequently found myself waiting for it to respond between app changes, occasionally making me a little confused whether I’d actually clicked on an app or was waiting for it to load.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9yZXZpZXcvdGNsLXE2LTIwMjMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Jetzt kommt der Blockbuster auf DVD und Blu-ray: Unsere Autorin findet, der Film sei zu männerdominiert.","Oppenheimer – ein Name, um den man in den letzten Wochen digital und analog nicht herumgekommen ist. Es ist der Name des Physikers Julius Robert Oppenheimer, besonders ist es aber der Titel des neuen Films des Starregisseurs Christopher Nolan. Ein hochkarätig besetzter Blockbuster.
Im Netz, auf der Straße und natürlich in den Kinos wurde der Film beworben. Als er dann endlich am 20. Juli in die Kinos kam, spielte auch noch das Wetter mit: der Regen spülte die Massen geradewegs in die Kinosäle.
So ging auch ich mit meiner Familie an einem düsteren Sonntagnachmittag ins Thalia in Potsdam. Es war das Versprechen, meine Geschwister, die sich sonst noch in den Schulferien gelangweilt hätten, ganze drei Stunden gut unterhalten zu lassen.
Wir wurden auch nicht enttäuscht. Der Sound fegte uns geradewegs von den Sesseln und unsere Augen konnten gar nicht weit genug geöffnet sein, um all die Farb-, Bild- und eben Bombenexplosionen sehen zu können. Und um Bomben geht es in dem Film ja schließlich.

Oppenheimer als „einzigartiges Genie“
Es ist die dramatisch erzählte Geschichte, wie der Physik-Nerd Oppenheimer zu einem politischen Akteur wurde. Er wurde während des Zweiten Weltkriegs Leiter des Manhattan-Projektes vom US-amerikanischen Militär, das an der Entwicklung einer Atombombe arbeitete. 1945 explodierte schließlich die erste Atombombe als Testversuch in der Wüste New Mexicos und kurz darauf in Hiroshima und Nagasaki. Ein einschneidendes historisches Ereignis in der Menschheitsgeschichte. Seine Erfindung hat eine neue Welt ermöglicht. So der Film.
Die Realität erzählt da noch etwas anderes. Während die Figur Oppenheimer mit stilistischen und narrativen Mitteln zum einzigartigen Genie stilisiert wird, das sich mit seinem „Mind-Palast“ (bekannt aus der Serie Sherlock) Dinge vorstellen kann, die Normalsterbliche nicht mal nach Erklärung verstehen, trat der reale Oppenheimer mit seinen physikalischen Erkenntnissen nur in eine Reihe von genialen Köpfen.
Manche davon finden auch in dem Film Erwähnung, wie beispielsweise Niels Bohr und Werner Heisenberg. Ein Name fällt in dem dreistündigen Spektakel an Emotion und physikalischen Ereignissen nicht. Es ist der Name einer gewissen Lise Meitner.
Wer war Lise Meitner?
Lise Meitner TT/imago
In einem hat der Film mit seiner Erzählung recht: Frauen hatten es in den 1940er-Jahren mit starrköpfigen Männern zu tun, die sich fragten, ob Menschen des weiblichen Geschlechts überhaupt in der Lage waren, logisch zu denken (so muss General Leslie Groves im Film direkt die Kompetenz einer Frau anzweifeln, die hinter der Schreibmaschine sitzt).
Doch tut der Film Lise Meitner Unrecht an, sie nicht einmal zu erwähnen. Sie war keine Geringere, als diejenige, die die erste wissenschaftliche Erklärung des Zerfalls von Uran-Atomkernen unter Neutronenbeschuss lieferte. Zusammen mit Otto Hahn hatte sie die Atomkernspaltung entdeckt. 1939 war sie diejenige, die die Kernspaltung richtig deutete.
Ohne ihre Forschungsergebnisse wäre Oppenheimers Forschung und das Manhattan-Projekt gar nicht möglich gewesen. Heute schätzt das Deutsche Patent- und Markenamt es als eins der größten Versäumnisse, dass Meitner keinen Nobelpreis erhalten hat. Die Möglichkeit dazu hätte bestanden – ganze 48-mal, denn so oft wurde sie von Kolleg:innen nominiert.
Diese Nominierungen sind Zeugnis dafür, dass sie und ihre Arbeit sehr wohl auch schon zu ihren Lebzeiten von Fachleuten gesehen, anerkannt und geschätzt wurde. Dass sie aber nie den Preis erhielt, ist Zeugnis für die politische Gesinnung ihrer Lebzeit.
Als Frau, als Jüdin und als Pazifistin musste sie schon 1938 aus Berlin fliehen, nachdem ihr die Arbeit an der Universität verboten wurde. Doch sie blieb im engen Kontakt mit ihren Kolleg:innen und forschte im Exil weiter.
Meitner bleibt unerwähnt
Es ist als eines der größten Versäumnisse des Films einzuschätzen, Lise Meitner keine Sekunde in den 180 Minuten Wissenschaftsgeschichte zu widmen. Es stellt sich die Frage, warum sich das Produktionsteam von Christopher Nolan dafür entschieden hat. Dass sie nicht auf Lise Meitner gestoßen sind, kann nicht sein. Dagegen spricht die sonst sorgsam recherchierten und dargestellten Ereignisse der Vergangenheit von Oppenheimer.
Zudem kann man sich nicht mit Kernenergie auseinandersetzen, ohne auf ihren Namen zu stoßen. Bekommt sie vielleicht keine Figur, weil sie mutiger als Oppenheimer war? Auch sie soll 1943 für das Manhattan-Projekt eingeladen worden sein, lehnte allerdings diese Einladung ab, da die Forschung an einer Massenvernichtungswaffe ihren moralischen und ethischen Vorstellungen widersprach. Würde sie mit dieser mutigen Entscheidung vielleicht der Figur des Genies Oppenheimer schaden?
Es ist aber vielmehr anzunehmen, dass der Hauptgrund darin liegt, wie sich die Menschheit die Vergangenheit seit Jahrhunderten erzählt: Als eine Zeit, die nur von Männern geprägt wurde.
Wenn wir heute an die vergangenen Jahrhunderte denken, stellen wir uns vor, dass Frauen unterdrückt und ausgebeutet waren. Dass ihre Handlungsorte die drei „Ks“ waren – Küche, Kinder, Kirche. Frauen, die aktiv das Leben aller beeinflussten, die Dinge erschufen und erdachten, die unsere Gegenwart heute formen, erscheinen unvorstellbar.
Es hinterfragt dabei keine:r, wie es eigentlich sein kann, dass wirklich die Hälfte der Menschheit gar keinen Beitrag zu der Entwicklung von Kultur, Wissenschaft und Politik geleistet haben soll. Kann es wirklich sein, dass 50 Prozent der Gesellschaft apathisch dahinlebte? Es ist zumindest das, was die Geschichtsbücher im Unterricht bis heute erzählen.
Frauen bleiben die Partnerin oder Affäre
Es ist auch das, was Filme wie „Oppenheimer“ meinen jüngeren Geschwistern in den Sommerferien erzählen, wenn sie Frauen nur die Rolle der Partnerin, Affäre oder Sekretärin zugestehen. Natürlich waren die 1940er-Jahre für Frauen eine harte Zeit, aber Frauen waren keineswegs inaktiv.
Lise Meitner ist das beste Beispiel dafür. Sie war nicht nur in der Physik eine Vordenkerin, sondern auch in ihrer Vorstellung davon, was eine Frau kann. Sie wurde 1878 in Wien geboren, hinein in eine Zeit, in der Frauen nicht die gleichen Rechte wie Männer zugestanden wurden.
So wie sich Meitner physikalisch Dinge vorstellen konnte, wie es ihre männlichen Kollegen nicht konnten, so dachte sie sich auch über die patriarchalen Vorstellungen ihrer Zeit hinweg und wurde geradewegs die erste Frau, die sich in Deutschland habilitierte, die in unserer Stadt Berlin die erste Professorin der Physik wurde.
Es ist Frauen wie ihr zu verdanken, dass wir heute in einer Gesellschaft leben, die Frauen die gleichen Rechte wie Männer einräumt und die ein Gesetz hat, das die Bürger:innen vor Diskriminierung aufgrund ihres Geschlechts schützen soll. Den Frauen wurden diese Rechte nicht geschenkt, sondern sie haben dafür gekämpft und von diesem Kampf muss erzählt werden.
Junge Mädchen von heute müssen von den Kämpferinnen von damals erfahren, müssen davon hören und sehen, dass Frauen mit ihren Gedanken und ihren Fähigkeiten auch in der Vergangenheit die Menschheit bereichert und geprägt haben. Dass es eben nie wirklich eine „reine Männerwelt“ war.
Und gerade deswegen bräuchte es eigentlich nicht den nächsten Blockbuster über einen vermeintlichen, männlichen Helden, sondern vielmehr über eine Frau, die heldenhaft für eine bessere Welt kämpfte. Lise Meitner wäre eine solche gewesen.

2023-08-08 17:12:31.899000+00:00,"With the Sexy Passages, Ira Sachs Reminds Why He’s an Essential Indie Voice",The acclaimed writer-director went outside the U.S. to make his latest movie—the latest example of an industry veteran determined to make his art his way.,"Even as the world of American independent film has contracted and consolidated, as the marketplace’s demand for originality has declined, Ira Sachs has carried on. He has made what he calls “personal cinema,” of a very personal (and very consistent) quality, for decades now, seemingly without interruption. The journey hasn’t actually been so smooth, of course—it’s required initiative, flexibility, a certain drive. His latest film, Passages—already an arthouse success out of its opening weekend, and a critical darling—reflects that nimbleness. It showcases a filmmaker unwilling to compromise creatively, if keenly aware of the forces around him needed to make it happen.
A heated and darkly funny love triangle, the Paris-set Passages concerns what happens when Tomas (Franz Rogowski) briefly abandons his longtime partner Martin (Ben Whishaw) to pursue an affair with a woman, Agathe (Adèle Exarchopoulos). Tomas navigates this new attraction with a selfishness that plays out as simultaneously mortifying, heartbreaking, and hilarious, a tough combination sold by Rogowski’s fearless performance. It’s very much in the Sachs oeuvre too—another biting relationship study from the mind behind such indie gems as Love Is Strange and Little Men.
How does he keep doing it—both creatively and logistically? It’s no secret that films of Sachs’s scope have become more difficult to fund and get off the ground, especially one like Passages, whose central queer sex scene ostensibly offended the MPAA enough to slap it with an NC-17 rating. (Distributor Mubi chose to release the film unrated.) “I wouldn’t say I’m at the end of my American career. I am American. I’m from Memphis, Tennessee. I’m born and bred here, so I have stories to tell here,” Sachs says on this week’s Little Gold Men (listen above). “Part of what I’m doing with this film is playing and being open to the impact of, particularly, French cinema on me as an artist, and allowing myself a kind of freedom of bringing that into the film.”
But making the movie outside the U.S. does reflect certain structural industry changes that Sachs has proven crafty enough to respond to. “I think the [2008] recession changed everything in American cinema and in particular in American independent cinema,” he says. Around that time, he had an all-star cast assembled for a film to be titled The Goodbye People, including Michael Shannon, Patricia Clarkson, Kirsten Dunst, and the late Anton Yelchin. “I couldn’t raise $1 over a multiple-year period and I really was, like, ‘Oh, this is not working. Something is not working,’” Sachs says. “From then, I looked at my job differently. I realized I was going to be the instigator, and in a way, I became my own producer. I became the person who raised money, and I raised it out of that system.”
This led to one of the more noted decades for a queer filmmaker in the 2010s, beginning with the steamy relationship study Keep the Lights On. From 2013–2017, Sachs received an impressive six Independent Spirit Award nominations, including two for best feature. But even as his profile grew, he still struggled to pull financing together. “When I finished Love Is Strange, which was a success in the independent marketplace and was well reviewed, I wrote Little Men thinking, ‘Okay, I’m coming off of something,’” Sachs says. “And no one would make the film. Not one company. Again, I had to raise the money for the film independently.”
Passages is Sachs’s second consecutive movie made in Europe, following 2019’s Isabelle Huppert vehicle Frankie, which brought the director less enthusiastic reviews than usual. The movie marked his Cannes debut. “I feel like in France it was received with a lot of love,” he says. “In the US, it’s an unusual film. It’s a film out of place with the concerns of American cinema, but I’m okay with that. That seems like a good thing.” Passages, with its frank approach to sexuality and richly messy depiction of human behavior, would seem an even better fit for the Croisette than the low-key Frankie, but instead, Sachs brought it back to Sundance, the place where his 2005 breakout Forty Shades of Blue won the Grand Jury Prize and where those 2010s hits all premiered to wide acclaim. Sachs seems pleased with the decision.
“Cannes is a festival that chose this year to open with a Johnny Depp movie—we’re talking about a film festival where the people in charge have a certain politic that’s really important to them,” Sachs says. “I can’t say whether Johnny Depp should or should not make movies, but when you’re deciding what that [opening film] is, you’re deciding which films you want to promote and which conversations you want to engage in…. On the other hand, Sundance is a festival that has always privileged voices that are marginalized in other festivals—that are put into the back of other festivals. Sundance says, ‘These are actually the films that mean the most to us.’”
There’s that independent spirit, shining through again. It’s served Sachs quite well.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbml0eWZhaXIuY29tL2hvbGx5d29vZC8yMDIzLzA4L2F3YXJkcy1pbnNpZGVyLWxpdHRsZS1nb2xkLW1lbi1pcmEtc2FjaHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-07-27 13:00:00+00:00,"Franz Rogowski’s Sexy, Lonely, Beautiful Worlds","Maybe the most exciting movie star on the global stage, Rogowski finds himself looking inward with each new project. His latest film, ‘Passages,’ led to especially profound reflection.","“You and me, if we would both sit here naked, it would change the energy.” That sounds like a safe bet, but Franz Rogowski is getting to a point here. “We wouldn’t have to do anything. We’d just take off our clothes.” He smiles at my nervous laugh, then gives an eyebrow raise that keeps his interviewer on his toes. This is the way Rogowski answers a question about the experience of filming a sex scene.
“You always depend on intimacy when you create scenes for a movie—it’s more obvious when you’re naked and you’re moaning,” he says. “But it’s not just having sex, you know? Having a conversation can be very intimate—as now, in this lovely Zoom conversation.”
Speaking with Rogowski, it seems, is not unlike watching him onscreen. The 37-year-old German actor has emerged as one of the most dynamic talents of his generation through a peculiar combination of wit, sexiness, vulnerability, and transparency. That last quality is key. His characters can behave cruelly, unbearably, or with bracing kindness and empathy; either way, Rogowski offers access into their vibrant, messy interior worlds. In his portrayals, they are funny and strange and deeply sad—the kinds of people we all recognize and who too rarely fill up the movies.
The honesty catches you off guard, and with that comes a thrilling unpredictability that explains his status as the art house man of the moment. The German auteur Christian Petzold cast Rogowski in 2018’s Transit; the next year, the actor took on a small but pivotal role in Terrence Malick’s World War II drama A Hidden Life. He’s now a global star primed to soar, completing ADR in three different languages on a given movie, acting around the world, and learning new ways of working along the way. He is in production on Andrea Arnold’s new movie, Bird, as we chat, shooting in the English town of Gravesend (Rogowski calls it “Brexitland”)—near where the director grew up—and giddy at the fact that he knows nothing more about his character or storyline than what’s on the pages Arnold gives him to act out for the day.
“We are dealing with all kinds of birdy issues here,” he says of the mystery project. Is he into that bird stuff? “Yes. I think I am an owl.” Okay, how so? After a pause, Rogowski hoots a few times in response. It is weirdly charming, and definitely confounding.
The superb film Passages (in US theaters August 4), which serves as the occasion for this interview, contains Rogowski’s most explosive and delicate performance yet. Not coincidentally, his character is highly chaotic. We meet Rogowski’s Tomas as a German filmmaker living in Paris, wrapping work on his latest movie. As he transitions back to regular life, he briefly loses interest in his long-term partner, the British Martin (Ben Whishaw), and finds himself intensely attracted to a French woman, Agathe (Adèle Exarchopoulos), who worked on the project. He begins an affair, swiftly moves in with her, and then starts pining for his old life—setting a fraught and heated love triangle in motion.
“He’s a fun character,” director Ira Sachs says, before qualifying with a laugh: “I mean, he’s a bad guy.” When it came to casting, Sachs thought about Jimmy Cagney. “Orson Welles once said [Cagney] was the greatest cinema actor ever—which I think is not far from true. [He] played people whose actions seemed despicable, and yet you loved him.” That model tracks here: Rogowski’s warm expressiveness barrels through even the most selfish of acts. He plays Tomas with delirious commitment. “He’s not really capable of putting a gloss over things or making something tidy when it’s not,” Whishaw tells me. “[Franz] is very frank. He’s very direct. At least, that’s how he seems to me.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbml0eWZhaXIuY29tL2hvbGx5d29vZC8yMDIzLzA3L2ZyYW56LXJvZ293c2tpLXByb2ZpbGUtYXdhcmRzLWluc2lkZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-22 14:00:14+00:00,Oppenheimer review – Christopher Nolan’s volatile biopic is a towering achievement,"As the ‘father of the atomic bomb’, Cillian Murphy is a 20th-century Frankenstein whose catastrophic creation unravels across a tangle of timelines in Nolan’s expansive drama","It’s billed as a biopic of theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, dubbed the “father of the atomic bomb”. But “biopic” seems too small a word to contain the ambition and scope of Christopher Nolan’s formidable if occasionally unwieldy latest. Oppenheimer is a dense and intricate period piece, playing out in a tangle of timelines. It weaves together courtroom drama, romantic liaisons, laboratory epiphanies and lecture hall personality cults. But perhaps more than all of this, Oppenheimer is the ultimate monster movie. Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer is an atomic-age Frankenstein, a man captivated by the boundless possibilities of science, realising too late that his creation has a limitless capacity for destruction. Ultimately, however, the monster in this story is not Oppenheimer’s invention but the appetite for annihilation that it unleashes in mankind. It’s a realisation that plays out, inexorably, in Oppenheimer’s hollow, haunted face as the film unfolds. Murphy’s far-seeing ice-chip eyes have never been put to better use.
In fact, Murphy’s physicality as a whole is one of the most potent weapons at the film’s disposal. He seems impossibly slight, a theoretical idea of a man in contrast to the robust certainties of the military figures he works alongside (Matt Damon’s Lt Gen Leslie Groves, for example, is bullish and solid, a clenched fist looking for something to punch). In one shot we see Oppenheimer hauling an armful of books into a new classroom, and it looks as though he’s buckling under the weight of his accumulated knowledge. At other times he’s calm and glassily composed, somehow removed from jostling egos and the fusion of ideas that will take shape into the ultimate weapon.
Given Nolan’s preference for shooting on Imax 70mm film, the picture has a depth of detail you could drown in
The version of Oppenheimer that we see on screen at any given time is a marker, an indication of which timeline we are currently inhabiting. Insights into his stellar early academic career are punctuated by glimpses of a later humiliating security clearance hearing that picked over every aspect of his life; the development of the bomb – the so-called Manhattan Project – is cut together with another hearing, this time in the Senate, to establish whether Oppenheimer’s former colleague Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr, excellent) should be appointed in a federal government role. It’s a knotty mesh of a structure. Time in Oppenheimer doesn’t feel entirely linear – there are moments, in particular a pivotal encounter with Albert Einstein, that seem unmoored from the rest of the film. Nolan’s films frequently require a couple of viewings to unravel fully, and while it lacks the baffle-factor of Tenet, Oppenheimer is no exception.

There are other problems: the cursory treatment of the female characters is one. Florence Pugh, as Oppenheimer’s mistress Jean Tatlock, gets short shrift. And Emily Blunt, as J Robert’s wife Kitty Oppenheimer, spends much of the first two hours mutinously clutching a martini on the edge of the frame. She does, however, claim a couple of terrific moments later on: a skin-flaying interrogation scene; a wordless glare that conveys the full nuclear winter of her animosity towards a disloyal colleague.
But, for the most part, the film is a towering achievement. Not surprisingly, given Nolan’s preference for shooting on Imax 70mm film, the picture has a depth of detail you could drown in. There’s no shortage of scenes of furious blackboard scribbling, the accepted cinematic signifier of scientific genius. But more interesting are the abstract moments; it’s as though we are venturing into the heart of the atom itself. Equally inventive is the way the sets seem to quake at moments of tension. Oppenheimer’s world is literally rocked by the shockwaves of the reaction that has been set in motion.
Most effective, however, is the use of sound and music. Like Jonathan Glazer’s upcoming The Zone of Interest, this is a film in which the horrors of war are not shown but conveyed inescapably through what we hear. Ludwig Göransson’s score is masterful and mercurial, surely one of the finest of the year. And there’s a recurring motif in the soundscape, a crescendo of thunderously stamping feet. It’s taken from a moment of triumph and glory, the high point of Oppenheimer’s career. But it takes on a mounting sense of threat with each use, as the catastrophic potential of the physicist’s work becomes clear.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZmlsbS8yMDIzL2p1bC8yMi9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1yZXZpZXctY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tdm9sYXRpbGUtYmlvcGljLWlzLWEtdG93ZXJpbmctYWNoaWV2ZW1lbnQtY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHnSAYoBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2ZpbG0vMjAyMy9qdWwvMjIvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItcmV2aWV3LWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLXZvbGF0aWxlLWJpb3BpYy1pcy1hLXRvd2VyaW5nLWFjaGlldmVtZW50LWNpbGxpYW4tbXVycGh5?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

By Paul Glynn Entertainment reporter
Universal Pictures
Oppenheimer stars Peaky Blinders' Cillian Murphy, who has appeared in five previous Christopher Nolan films
Critics have given positive reviews to Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan's sweeping new biographical thriller about the ""father of the atomic bomb"".
The film features an all-star ensemble cast led by Cillian Murphy as the US physicist, J Robert Oppenheimer.
The Independent called the ""clever, imaginative"" film Nolan ""at his best"", while the Telegraph said actor Murphy ""dazzles as the destroyer of worlds"".
The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw deemed the movie ""flawed, but extraordinary"".
Universal Pictures
The protagonist's wife, German-US biologist Katherine 'Kitty' Oppenheimer, is played by Emily Blunt
Inspired by the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph And Tragedy Of J Robert Oppenheimer, the film tells the story of the enigmatic Manhattan Project scientist, who had a leading role in developing the atomic bomb, changing the course of World War II.
He ""gave us the power to destroy ourselves and that had never happened before"", director Nolan told BBC Culture editor Katie Razzall.
Commissioned by the US Government, who saw themselves in a nuclear race with the Nazis, in 1945 scientists in New Mexico detonated a test bomb, codenamed Trinity.
Their invention was later used, controversially, to end the war, when an atomic bomb was dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to devastating effect.
'Performance of his life'
The Telegraph's Robbie Collin awarded five stars, saying: ""Nolan's portrait of the father of the nuclear bomb is a triumph, like witnessing history itself being split open.""
""Oppenheimer is a film that works simultaneously on the most intimate and cosmic scales,"" he wrote.
""It's at once a speeding rollercoaster and a skin-tingling spiritual portrait; an often, classically-minded period piece that only Nolan could have made, and only now, after a quarter-century's run-up.""
He added: ""Playing Oppenheimer from his early 20s to late 50s, the 47-year-old Murphy gives the performance of his life, imbuing Oppenheimer's body with an enthralling nervous eroticism and his voice with a noirish musicality that reminds you of [Humphrey] Bogart.""
""A masterfully constructed character study from a great director operating on a whole new level. A film that you don't merely watch, but must reckon with.""

In a four-star review in the Guardian, Bradshaw said the film ""captures the most agonising of success stories"".
""This is the big bang, and no one could have made it bigger or more overwhelming than Nolan,"" he wrote.
""He does this without simply turning it into an action stunt - although this movie, for all its audacity and ambition, never quite solves the problem of its own obtuseness: filling the drama at such length with the torment of genius-functionary Oppenheimer at the expense of showing the Japanese experience and the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.""
He described Murphy as ""an eerily close lookalike for Oppenheimer... very good at capturing his sense of solitude and emotional imprisonment"".

Writing in the Times, critic Ed Potton, who also awarded the film four stars, hailed Murphy's performance as ""explosive in a breathtaking movie"".
The Evening Standard's Charlotte Sullivan agreed that the ""dark, immersive epic gives Cillian Murphy the role of his career"".
Speaking ahead of the film's release, the Irish star told journalists the role had taken ""a toll"" on him ""but in a brilliant way"".
""It was the biggest, most exhilarating challenge,"" he said.
Co-star Matt Damon revealed he had told his wife he would take a break from acting, unless ""Chris Nolan called"".
Nolan is best known for his Dark Knight trilogy, as well as films including Inception, Dunkirk and Tenet. He makes history with Oppenheimer - which also features Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Robert Downey Jr - as the first film with sequences shot on black and white IMAX film.

The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney called the movie a ""scorching depiction of America's ability to create and destroy its heroes.""
While the four-act structure ""asks a lot of the film's audience"", he commented ""our patience and concentration are amply rewarded"".
Handing the film four stars, the Independent's Clarisse Loughrey called Oppenheimer ""Nolan's best and most revealing work"".
""It's a profoundly unnerving story told with a traditionalist's eye towards craftsmanship and muscular, cinematic imagination.""
She praised its non-linear structure - a common feature of Nolan films - and its ""beautifully lensed"" cinematography, but added: ""It's a little too conscious of itself, and the ways cinema crafts its own reality.""

,'Oppenheimer' True Story: All About the Real Events That Inspired the Christopher Nolan Film,Christopher Nolan's 2023 film 'Oppenheimer' centers around physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and the events that led to the creation of the atomic bomb. Here's the true story of 'Oppenheimer.',"Christoper Nolan's highly anticipated behemoth film Oppenheimer has finally hit theaters. The film stars Cillian Murphy as the title character, renowned and notorious physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer.
Oppenheimer is most remembered as the “father of the atomic bomb” and was the physicist in charge of the Manhattan Project, the name given to the top-secret project that developed the weapons the United States used to devastate the Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. His path toward the creation of the bomb was etched in his childhood when Oppenheimer proved to be scientifically gifted and advanced far beyond his years.
As a reticent and thoughtful man, Oppenheimer didn’t always share his inner workings freely. He spoke out about the gravity of the atomic bomb following the two detonations, and in later years openly opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb for use against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The latter choice meant he was investigated as a Communist sympathizer, a charge Oppenheimer denied.
Oppenheimer’s path toward the atomic bomb and his subsequent feelings about its use are both riveting and devastating. Here is what to know about the real events that inspired the Christopher Nolan film Oppenheimer, including his personal life, work with the Manhattan Project and Communist investigations.
Who was J. Robert Oppenheimer?

Julius Robert Oppenheimer was brought into the Manhattan Project soon after it began in 1942. While President Roosevelt expressed some hesitation, the U.S. launched the project to explore building an atomic bomb during World War II.
As shared by the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History, Oppenheimer, already a renowned theoretical physicist at the time, served as the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory throughout the project. He was eventually nicknamed the “father of the atomic bomb” after being put in charge of both the research and design of the devastating weapon.
Oppenheimer was born on April 22, 1904, and gained a reputation for academic giftedness early in his life. By the time he was 10 years old, Oppenheimer was studying physics and chemistry. At 12 years old, the New York Mineralogical Club asked him to speak at the group’s meeting without realizing he was not yet a teen. He graduated from Harvard University at the age of 22 after finishing his degree in three years.
Oppenheimer eventually went to Europe to study at the University of Cambridge and later at the University of Göttingen's Institute for Theoretical Physics. Though a scene in Oppenheimer shows the young theoretical physicist poisoning an apple on his Cambridge professor's desk with potassium cyanide only to correct his mistake the following day, Oppenheimer's grandson Charles told TIME the incident is untrue. ""There's no record of him trying to kill somebody,"" Charles told the publication. ""That's a really serious accusation and it's historical revision. There's not a single enemy or friend of Robert Oppenheimer who heard that during his life and considered it to be true.""
Oppenheimer went on to receive a Ph.D. degree under Max Born, a physicist who helped develop the theory of quantum mechanics. He returned to the United States and began working as an advisor at the Atomic Energy Commission following World War I. He also taught at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1929 to 1943.
In October 1942, Oppenheimer was put in charge of what was then known as Project Y, a laboratory that focused on researching weapon physics. He served as director of the Los Alamos facility from 1943 to 1945 before resigning.
Did J. Robert Oppenheimer have a family?

Oppenheimer married biologist Katharine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer (née Puening) in 1940. Kitty (portrayed by Emily Blunt) had been married three times prior: She annulled her first marriage in 1933; her second husband — who was a Communist Party member — died during the Spanish Civil War; and she was married to her third husband, Richard Harrison, when she met Oppenheimer.
Kitty and Oppenheimer welcomed two children together: son Peter in 1941 and daughter Katherine ""Toni"" in 1944.
According to the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History, Kitty also worked at the Los Alamos facility for a short period of time and was well-known for the dinner parties she threw for the other wives of scientists at the facility. She was Oppenheimer’s first and most important confidant in all matters of his life. Kitty also struggled with alcoholism and depression, especially following Oppenheimer's death in 1967. She died in 1972 in Panama City, Panama, after suffering a pulmonary embolism.
Prior to meeting Kitty, Oppenheimer was involved with psychiatrist and American Communist Party member Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). The two met in 1936, though Tatlock ended their relationship in 1939. However, Oppenheimer and Tatlock rekindled their romance during his marriage to Kitty, with the physicist even visiting Tatlock in San Francisco as late as 1943. Tatlock died in January 1944.

Oppenheimer primarily worked in theoretical physics and made a number of contributions to the field. While he is known for the development of the atomic bomb, the physicist was also responsible for the development of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which is a mathematical approximation in molecular dynamics
His work is also credited with predicting later findings by other scientists, such as the neutron, meson and neutron star, in addition to a number of theoretical contributions.
What was the Manhattan Project?

In 1939, scientists around the world learned that Nazi Germany’s scientists had learned how to split a uranium atom. The process is known as nuclear fission and requires a neutron to collide with a uranium atom, which in turn releases an amount of energy that can have devastating consequences. As such, the news appropriately alarmed scientists around the world, especially if it meant the Nazis would develop their own atomic weapons.
Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), who fled Nazi Germany, and physicist Leo Slizard each took steps to speak to President Roosevelt about the gravity of the situation and to encourage Roosevelt to develop a program in the United States so that scientists could work toward developing their own project. The U.S. government launched the Manhattan Project in 1942, though Einstein was not involved in the military and scientific project. According to the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History, the project was originally headquartered in New York City, hence the name, and led by Lieutenant General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon).
From there, two secret nuclear facilities were constructed in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington, as well as a laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer was head of research. While 120,000 people worked at the Manhattan Project, only a handful knew the true goal of the work they were contributing to.
Known as the Trinity test, the first atomic bomb was tested on July 16, 1945, in the Jornada del Muerto desert — more than 200 miles south of Los Alamos. Oppenheimer chose the code name Trinity inspired by the poetry of John Donne. The results were a shock to everyone involved; homes 100 miles away could reportedly feel the explosion and a mushroom cloud ballooned about eight miles into the sky.
Following the Trinity test, Oppenheimer later recalled, ""A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent."" He also famously said that a line from the Hindu scripture Bhagavad-Gita came to mind: “Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”
What did J. Robert Oppenheimer think of the atomic bomb?

It seems as though Oppenheimer believed in his work, including the work that led up to the ultimate detonation of atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. In the 2012 book Robert Oppenheimer: A Life Inside the Center, author Jay Monk wrote that on Aug. 6, 1945, (when the first bomb was dropped), Oppenheimer and his fellow scientists seemed victorious.
As the book describes, “To ecstatic cheering, Oppenheimer told the crowd that it was too early to say what the results of the bombing had been, but that ‘the Japanese didn’t like it.’ ” Monk added Oppenheimer's only regret was that ""we hadn't developed the bomb in time to use it against the Germans.""
The second bomb devastated Nagasaki, Japan, on Aug. 9, 1945. Monk also wrote that President Truman and Oppenheimer were not involved in the decision to deploy the weapon, as a previous directive issued on July 24 of the same year had already authorized General Spaatz to drop subsequent atomic bombs “as soon as made ready by the project staff.” The following day, President Truman issued an order to stop atomic bombings.
It does not seem that Oppenheimer was proud of or happy about the deployment of the second bomb. Monk wrote that an FBI report stated the physicist was a “nervous wreck” following the events of Aug. 9, and was also described as being “reluctant to promise that much real good could come out of continuing atomic-bomb work.”
What did J. Robert Oppenheimer say after the nuclear explosions in 1945?

Oppenheimer left his post at the Los Alamos facility in November 1945. In his farewell speech, which the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History has since shared in full, Oppenheimer admitted that the initial reason the team built the bomb was that it was believed using a weapon of that nature might be the only way to win World War II. Once it became clear that the war could be won without using atomic weapons, he said, a different motivation kicked in.
As Oppenheimer put it, “Some people, I think, were motivated by curiosity, and rightly so; and some by a sense of adventure, and rightly so. Others had more political arguments and said, ‘Well, we know that atomic weapons are in principle possible, and it is not right that the threat of their unrealized possibility should hang over the world. It is right that the world should know what can be done in their field and deal with it.’ ”
Ultimately, Oppenheimer seemed resolute on a number of issues, including the fact that with the detonation of two atomic bombs, the world had to contend with a new problem. He said, “I think it is true to say that atomic weapons are a peril which affect everyone in the world, and in that sense a completely common problem, as common a problem as it was for the Allies to defeat the Nazis. I think that in order to handle this common problem there must be a complete sense of community responsibility. I do not think that one may expect that people will contribute to the solution of the problem until they are aware of their ability to take part in the solution.”
Was J. Robert Oppenheimer a Communist?

The years that followed the detonation of two atomic bombs were politically fraught in the United States. Oppenheimer was named Chairman of the General Advisory Committee for the Atomic Energy Commission, and in this capacity, argued against the development of a hydrogen bomb.
At the time, the United States was well into the Cold War with the Soviet Union, and Oppenheimer’s recommendation against creating a hydrogen bomb was seen as politically dubious. As the Institute for Advanced Study noted, the physicist was soon caught up in McCarthyism and investigated by the U.S. government.
In December 1953, then-Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (and foe of Oppenheimer) Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) informed the physicist that his security clearance had been suspended due to his alleged ties to the Communist Party and urged Oppenheimer to quit. (Oppenheimer's mistress Tatlock was a known member of the Communist Party, as well as his brother Frank Oppenheimer and sister-in-law Jackie. Oppenheimer had also been under investigation while teaching at Berkeley and during the Manhattan Project.)
Rather than step down, Oppenheimer requested a hearing into the matter, which began in April 1954 and lasted for four weeks. Several of Oppenheimer's former colleagues testified against him, including Edward Teller (Benny Safdie). Ultimately, Oppenheimer lost his security clearance and was eventually stripped of his title.
In 1962, President Kennedy asked Oppenheimer to come to the White House, where he received an apology for what happened. He received the Enrico Fermi Award for his scientific achievements one year later.
And in 2022, United States Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm nullified the AEC's decision, saying, “more evidence has come to light of the bias and unfairness of the process that Dr. Oppenheimer was subjected to while the evidence of his loyalty and love of country have only been further affirmed,"" per The New York Times.

2023-07-20 21:05:23+00:00,"Cillian Murphy Talks ‘Oppenheimer,’ Christopher Nolan & “Terrifying” Jobs – Deadline","Cillian Murphy discusses his sixth collaboration with Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer,an epic about the complicated man who led the Manhattan Project.","Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan are marking their sixth collaboration with Oppenheimer, the biographical epic about the titular complicated and brilliant physicist tasked with leading the Manhattan Project, the secret effort to create the atom bomb, and the moral and political struggles that followed. This is the first time Murphy, who plays Oppenheimer, is essaying a lead role for Nolan – “Finally!”, as he enthuses with a wink below.
The first reactions to the film have hailed it as a triumph for Nolan and Murphy; the latter having last year completed a decade-long arc as Tommy Shelby in lauded period gangster drama Peaky Blinders. In Oppenheimer, Murphy “captures all the contradictions of this brilliant, tortured, complicated man,” wrote Deadline’s Pete Hammond in his review which also called this “the most important motion picture of 2023, and maybe far beyond.”
Oppenheimer the man, as the film that’s based on American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin tells it, struggled with psychological issues in his youth and grew to become a peerless intellectual though not an entirely likeable presence – he womanized and could appear arrogant and aloof. After the war, he was a vocal opponent of nuclear armament and stripped of his security clearance during a 1954 hearing that focused on his maybe/maybe-not communist ties. The film presents the audience with philosophical quandaries aplenty. Murphy as Oppenheimer quotes the Bhagavad Gita after the Trinity test of the bomb: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”
I caught up with Murphy on two recent occasions to discuss the film, his role as the contradictory scientist and much more. The interviews, which took place before the SAG-AFTRA strike was called, have been combined, condensed and edited for clarity in the Q&A below.
Oppenheimer also features a large and starry cast that includes Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Jason Clarke, Kenneth Branagh and an unrecognizable Gary Oldman along with a host of others. Universal began overseas rollout on July 19 with North American previews beginning today.
DEADLINE: The last time you and I spoke was about a year ago when you were just a couple of weeks out of filming Oppenheimer…
CILLIAN MURPHY: (Laughs) I must have been in a heap.
DEADLINE: How long does it take to shed the figurative weight of this sort of character afterwards?
MURPHY: It’s like anything. If you do anything to a high standard and spend an awful lot of time at it, you’re working 16-, 17-, 18-hour days incredibly focused. So then when you stop, it’s very abrupt and you have an awful lot of displaced energy. It takes a while to figure that out. There is a little period where you’re neither one nor the other, you’re not a civilian, you’re still not the character, you’re floating around – but it’s not particularly dramatic it’s just trying to readjust to daily life.
DEADLINE: When Chris first talked to you about the project, did he offer any insight into what he was setting out to do? What did he say to you when he first proposed it to you?
MURPHY: In typical Chris fashion, there was no pre-amble or no sense that he might have been writing something. He just called me out of the blue and he said, in his very understated British way, that he’s making this film about Oppenheimer and he’d like me to play Oppenheimer. So that was a tremendous shock, a very pleasant one, but a shock nonetheless.
I didn’t know that much about Oppenheimer, I had kind of like Wikipedia-level knowledge about him at the time, and then Chris said it’s based off of this book.
He was in LA and I was in Dublin and it was still Covid times. I couldn’t get out of Ireland, so he came to Dublin and he gave me the script and I sat in his hotel room and read it and realized it was something special. It genuinely was one of the best screenplays I’d ever read, and it was written in the first person which is not something I’d ever experienced before, so that was terrifying.
DEADLINE: I don’t mean this in a pejorative sense, but the film was like a history lesson that only made me want to learn more. He’s not the most likeable person, but then it’s fascinating to watch the build-up and it’s like a left turn in the third act with the security hearing and the adversarial relationship with Robert Downey Jr’s character Lewis Strauss. I felt like it had echoes of a redemption story, but with so many contradictions. In terms of working on it with Chris, how important was it to shed light on, as the book is subtitled, Oppenheimer’s “triumph and tragedy”?
MURPHY: It’s interesting that you use the word redemption. The bit you mentioned, the hearing at the end, that to me feels like the most Promethean part of the movie, or the most Faustian – he made a pact and then he tried to renegotiate the pact. Did you feel it was redemptive in the end?
DEADLINE: To a degree – with regard to Strauss and with him receiving the Enrico Fermi Award that was conferred by John F Kennedy years later.
MURPHY: And also you know that the American government reinstated his security clearance, I think it was just a few months ago; it really didn’t get much headlines that story, but that was quite interesting that that happened within the year when the movie was coming out.
DEADLINE: I wonder if there’s any correlation to that…
MURPHY: Maybe they were getting ahead of it. I don’t know, but it’s good that it happened, but it was a little under the radar.
DEADLINE: Let’s talk more about the Promethean angle.
MURPHY: It’s brilliant for drama, isn’t it? Like I mentioned the Faust thing… When I was researching it and Chris and I were talking – cause he gave me the script in September of 21 and we didn’t shoot until February 22, so I had six months – it’s in the book that Oppenheimer was obsessed with this Henry James novella called Beast in the Jungle and this idea that there was something stalking him all his life and that eventually it would come after him and get him.
Maybe that’s the state of mind of all great human beings: that with all the success and fame and notoriety there will be something there that will take you down. It’s not a very good novel, it’s not one of James’ best, but it’s very interesting. All the time, Oppenheimer sensed that this was all gonna come crashing down and they were going to come for him. It’s really interesting to have that in your psychology all the while.
DEADLINE: You’ve had a long time collaboration with Chris and this is the first time that he put you in a leading role…
MURPHY: (Laughs) Finally!
DEADLINE: Are there particular challenges associated with that? Do you feel a lot of extra pressure?
MURPHY: Yeah, but I’ve always chased down roles that I feel pressure. I have no interest in doing something that is safe or easy where you can kind of cruise in. So the jobs that I love are the terrifying ones that do put you under a lot of pressure, that do give you a lot of responsibility – and this was a huge one.
I’d always secretly wanted to play a lead for Chris. I think any actor in the whole world would want to be in a Chris Nolan movie, not to mind play a lead for him, and we have such a long relationship. I mean, it’s 20 years.
It was 2003 that I first met him, so (laughs) it makes us old – it’s a long time.
He’s not the sort of person that would call me up and talk and shoot the shit. He’s just working and it just felt right this one – and maybe there was some sort of physical resemblance, I don’t know. People seem to think there was, but he just seemed to think that the time was right.
DEADLINE: Maybe this time was different because you were so deeply involved, but how do you work together?
MURPHY: My personal way of working is to do an awful lot of research and prep and then sort of abandon it when you come to actually acting in the scene with other actors because then it becomes about instinct. For me, acting is not intellectual, it’s instinctual. But it’s always really useful to have all of the research, it’s your kind of due diligence to do that.
With Chris, I think trust is the main thing. He expects excellence from everybody – from every single crew member, from every single actor – and so people know that and they come fully prepared and then in terms of the work he kind of lets you off.
He really loves actors and he lets you off to explore choices in the scene, and then maybe after a few takes he comes in and he gives these incredibly unbelievably precise and succinct and kind of laser-like notes which can completely flip your performance. But it is just about trust really. I feel very safe, you feel very cared for.
And also his sets, even though they’re huge blockbuster movies, it feels very private when you’re making them cause there’s only one camera, there’s the boom op and there’s Chris right next to the camera. There’s no video village, there’s none of that, so it does feel like this kind of laboratory that you’re making work in and you can make a fool of yourself and try something that mightn’t work. I think the reason that his films succeed on such a massive scale is that he puts performance first.
DEADLINE: I recall one of the times I visited the Peaky Blinders set and you were filming a scene which required several takes. I was standing like four feet from you between set-ups and you leaned over and whispered, “How are your donkey and sheep?” and then you went straight back into being Tommy. It was very kind of you, but I was surprised because it was so intense on set; are you able to dip in and dip out like that? Or was that just a weird day?
MURPHY: (Laughs) No, I always like to have a light atmosphere on set, you know particularly if we’re doing work where you have to go deep and into kind of darker places. I always like to have it easy because you need to feel relaxed to make great work, certainly I do.
But, you know, it affects you completely. If you do anything intensely for 17, 18 hours a day like we were working on Oppenheimer – it was an incredibly fast shoot, it was like 57 days we shot the whole thing – if you do anything that intensely for that length of time a day, it’s gonna affect you. And then also I had to get really skinny for it so I wasn’t really eating, so you get to this very sort of hysterically lucid state of mind, but it’s an amazing feeling – you feel completely immersed in it and completely focused in it.
Chris moves at a really fast pace, there’s no one standing around kind of shooting the shit or talking. When you come on the set at 7 and you wrap at whatever time, it’s constant work – there’s no waiting around cause Chris knows exactly what he wants and he moves at an incredibly fast pace so he expects everyone else to move at that pace, but you feel wonderfully exhausted at the end of it.
DEADLINE: What did the physical prep entail? Did you get hangry?
MURPHY: (Laughs) Probably, I don’t know. Like I said, I try to keep it light. It’s important to have a light atmosphere on set and to get on with people cause that’s where I think good work comes from. But, if you reduce your calorific intake after a while your body just gets used to it; you stop feeling hungry – I wouldn’t recommend it, but that’s what happens.
It’s not a big deal really, you just kind of eat less. I had a nutritionist and all that, but what was important was to get the silhouette. He had a very distinct silhouette, you know? And it was very self-conscious, self-mythologizing. So, in order for that silhouette to work, I had to be a certain physical shape, but that’s just another trick in your arsenal and a lot of it we could accentuate with costuming and the way the suits were tailored.
DEADLINE: On Peaky Blinders your mother, who’s a French teacher, helped you out with the French you needed for the final season. Here, Oppenheimer at one point surprises everyone by launching into what sounded like perfect Dutch. How did you work on that?
MURPHY: I remember saying to Chris, ‘So there’s this scene with a Dutch sequence in the script, how are we going to do that?’ And he said, ‘You mean how are you going to do that.’ And I went ‘Okay…’ I asked (DP) Hoyte van Hoytema, who’s Dutch, to record it, and he recorded it and then I slowed it down so I just learned it phonetically over three months – I can still remember it.
DEADLINE: Do you actually know what you said?
MURPHY: (Laughs) It was something about atoms… No, I do remember. I had a vague conceptual grasp on all the science of the movie, but there’s no point in wasting time on that stuff because you can’t in six months even begin to have a grasp on quantum mechanics. My job was to go after the humanity. So that stuff becomes mechanical.
It’s like writing all the equations, it becomes like hieroglyphics and there’s something very soothing about writing those equations. I was talking to Matt Damon about it as well, he did it in Good Will Hunting, and you just learn them and forget what they mean, but it’s very satisfying to write them.
DEADLINE: Talking about the humanity, what is it actors say about not having to like the character…
MURPHY: You have to have some empathy I think. What was pretty clear with Oppenheimer, there was no judgement. It was really interesting, for me one of the ways in was the intellect, and I firmly believe – a lot of his contemporaries would argue that he was the most brilliant of all of those men of that generation, those scientists — I believe it’s actually a burden not a gift to be that brilliant. So that was a way in for me, and then also it’s pretty clear that when he was a kid he struggled a lot emotionally, psychologically and you can see that in the movie, there’s a lot of that in all the texts about him.
I think he was forming himself in his 20s and 30s, self-consciously doing that. Then the relationship with Kitty (Oppenheimer’s wife played by Blunt) is very interesting. You know they say that you never really know what makes a relationship, but that relationship sustained. There was some interdependence there that was key to both of their lives, they needed each other; it was highly dysfunctional but it sustained.
DEADLINE: What do you think about the timeliness of the movie? There’s stuff in there that makes one think about climate change and then the whole warning that this will keep escalating… What parallels do you see?
MURPHY: I’m always very careful about giving messages with work because I don’t think that’s the job of the movie – the job of the movie is to ask the question not to give the answers. I think it’s clear for anyone who’s interested in geopolitics, what’s happening in the world today – the movie is scarily kind of relevant and just as we began shooting, Russia invaded Ukraine and there was all this nuclear sabre rattling which is still continuing.
But, yeah, I think it should provoke. I think it’s a very provocative film. What happened in ’45 changed history, changed the world. We’re all living in a nuclear age now. Whether you decide to think about it or not, it’s there and I think this film is very entertaining and very stimulating, but it should exercise people if they so wish to go out and read about it and to educate themselves and to actually know about that, the threat that we live under continuously.
DEADLINE: This cast is so jammed with incredible talent, can you talk about working with all these different actors?
MURPHY: It was ridiculous. Like I said, we work so fast and I was so in it and I was on every single day, just like this train that had left the station and there was no getting off and we were going at such a pace and I was so consumed by the whole thing. But you’d look at the call sheet and go ‘Oh fuck, tomorrow it’s a scene with Ken Branagh’ or ‘Tomorrow it’s a scene with Gary Oldman’ or ‘We’ve got a big huge scene with Downey’ and it was kind of every actor’s dream to be able to work… There’s no resting, you’re just pushing yourself all the time trying to match these incredible actors. What I love about Chris, I think he always casts movies immaculately.
Now on this you could say ‘Oh, there’s just a bunch of movie stars.’ But the fact is, they’re all playing people of consequence, like every single one of them is a very consequential person. So, to have a big movie star in there makes total total sense, but everybody mucked in.
On Chris’ sets there’s no individual trailers, there’s no individual make-up, everything is just very old school and it think everyone was delighted to be back, it felt like independent movie making on a huge scale.
But the day with Gary for example, that was just a gift; it was just a total gift and we tried it loads of different ways. We had a whole day to do it and obviously he knows Chris from before and I’d worked with him briefly on one of the Batman movies and I’m a huge fan, but when you get in a room with all of these big movie stars, ultimately it just comes down to people who are at work trying to do the best they can. Every single one of them was incredibly generous and focused and there for Chris. I think it also shows the amount of respect Chris has in the business, everyone wants to turn up to do the movie, whatever size the part – it was a blast.
DEADLINE: You’ve spoken a bit about Oppenheimer’s naiveté, can you elaborate on that?
MURPHY: I thought it was naive of him to think that you could create this genocidal weapon and think that it would end all wars or that governments and countries would work together to restrict nuclear armament or proliferation and I think we all see now that was incredibly naive, but that’s what makes him so fascinating – that he could be this brilliant and then feel that way about this creation. It’s just part of his personality in general – he was so complicated in his relationship with people, they were very, very tricky – he was so kind of contradictory, that’s the word that keeps coming up.
DEADLINE: The hearing scenes with Jason Clarke as the prosecutor were so intense – I’ve met Jason a number of times and like him, but I really kind of wanted to punch his character…
MURPHY: (Laughs) Well that was my favorite part of making the film cause that came right at the end and we shot that in like two or three weeks but it was very intense and we were in this tiny, tiny little room – it was not a set, it was this outrageously tiny bureaucratic shitty place somewhere in LA and you have this huge IMAX camera and all these brilliant actors and it felt a little bit to me like the old days, like making theater. There was this troupe of actors that would come in every day and we’d really just go at it. I remember those particular scenes with Jason – particularly the last sort of cross examination that he grills Oppenheimer with at the end – and Chris was just pushing us and pushing us and pushing us and that’s the stuff that I love – you know those big, meaty, meaty scenes.
DEADLINE: Emily and Matt recently mentioned that you didn’t join the cast for dinners when shooting the Los Alamos scenes. Was that an effort to just stay in the zone?
MURPHY: I’ve talked to all of those guys about this, when you get one of those huge roles of a lifetime – which this felt like it was one of those for me – you become consumed by it, it takes up all of your waking time and it’s all you think about. You’re just preparing all the time. I just didn’t really have room for it in my head, for having a crack and having fun. Yeah, I was trying to skip meals and reduce calorie intake, but it was just a decision. It’s not that I’m an unsociable person, I loved hanging out with these guys now on the tour, we’re great pals. It’s just focus – you just want to focus on the work. And sleep becomes vitally important cause you’re working every single day and you’re up before dawn, you just want to get as much sleep as possible.
DEADLINE: In the final scenes when Oppenheimer is older, did that make you wonder if that’s what you’ll look like?
MURPHY: I guess so, there’s a little preview for my wife. It’s amazing what it does to the actor because it’s like a mask and that’s what actors do, right? But when you actually put on the physical mask it’s incredible, and the work of those prosthetic artists is so detailed it’s staggering. I wouldn’t like to do a job every day which involved hours and hours in the chair – that was five or six hours for two days – but I salute their work because it’s extraordinary.
DEADLINE: The reactions have been great, and you’ve been racing about between Paris and London, what are you taking away from the response?
MURPHY: The response has been insanely good and we’re so proud of it. We were at the premiere in Paris and after the movie finished all the audience stayed there talking. It was amazing, they just stayed and were talking because it does that, it has that effect on people. That’s what I’m excited about cause it’s made for the audience and I think they really get something out of it.
My 15-year-old son saw it and I know a lot of kids want to see it which is great; I think there’s going to be a lot of discussion about this movie when the world can finally see it.
DEADLINE: You’re not super fond of promoting yourself; you don’t do that many interviews…
MURPHY: (Laughs) I’m getting better at it, Nancy, c’mon!
DEADLINE: I know, and I’m grateful that you always make time for me, but you haven’t been on this sort of tour before with you front and center. In an interview we did a little while back, you referred to yourself as a kind of ‘weirdo hermit’ so I wonder how the promotion has been for you and being out amongst so many people…
MURPHY: Here’s the thing, I like talking about work and promoting work that I’m really proud of. The distinction I make is that I’m not so comfortable being a personality or just talking about myself or being analyzed by people, that isn’t my favorite thing. But I adore talking about this film because I think it’s incredibly special and I really want to get people to go see it in the cinema cause I think they’ll have a really excellent experience.
DEADLINE: You physically live far away from the industry – what does that do for you in terms of your work and making choices?
MURPHY: We did live in London for 14 years, it was a big chunk of my life from my mid 20s to my late 30s. I really enjoyed it, it was really exciting, it’s a great city, but the move to Dublin wasn’t motivated by wanting to distance myself from the industry. I was purely motivated by wanting to come home to Ireland and raise our kids as Irish and be near our families.
I think the world we live in now, you’re proof of it as well, you can do your work remotely and the work will come to you. I don’t believe that you have to live in Los Angeles or New York or London to make good work; it means you have to travel a little more, but it hasn’t affected my work or professional life in any way. It just means that when I stop working, I’m not surrounded by it and that to me is healthy.
DEADLINE: I imagine at home people are just used to seeing you walking the dog or whatever, but when you get recognized by a fan, what do they talk about the most?
MURPHY: Oh, Peaky Blinders, inevitably. Which is great. The show is a kind of global phenomenon and we never expected it; I mean you know how it grew, you were there, you saw it. I feel really proud of it and that’s the thing about television, it’s continually growing an audience and people are rewatching it. I mean, it’s kind of staggering how popular the thing is still.
DEADLINE: What did you think about footage of you as Tommy being used in a video posted by the Ron De Santis campaign?
MURPHY: Well, Steve (Knight, Peaky Blinders creator) texted me and said, ‘We’ve got to put out a statement.’ I thought it was a very well written statement. We just don’t want to be associated with that sort of awful rhetoric.
DEADLINE: Conversely, there’s a scene in season three of Ted Lasso that uses the Peaky theme song “Red Right Hand” in what seems to be a complete hat tip to you guys.
MURPHY: That’s the weird thing, you know?, people have Peaky Blinders weddings, people have Peaky Blinders tattoos. I still haven’t figured it out – it’s still kind of bizarre to me, but it’s wonderful. It means that we did something good.
DEADLINE: Are there people you meet that make you geek out?
MURPHY: Musicians, yeah, I do, cause I’m a frustrated musician, you know, and I rarely get to meet them, but I’m still in awe of them and what they do.
DEADLINE: And you’re still never going to release any of the music you’ve done?
MURPHY: (Laughs), No, no way.
DEADLINE: What’s the status of the film you’re producing and starring in, Small Things Like These?
MURPHY: We wrapped that in March; we’re just cutting it, we’re in that post-production stage. I’m really happy with it, it was a great experience. It was kind of weirdly related to Oppenheimer because I met Matt on Oppenheimer and they were just setting up Artists Equity and I pitched him the story of the film. So that was the lovely kind of bit of serendipity on that movie. I really admire the philosophy of that company which is artists-led. I’m really proud of it, so hopefully it’ll be I guess next year at this stage.
DEADLINE: You’ve said in past you like to take maybe six months off between projects…
MURPHY: Yeah, that’s kind of ideal. I mean, I love not working, and I also feel that, you know, people talk about research, I think the best research is just being a normal human being and citizen – that’s how you learn about life. All actors are like emotional detectives, so it’s like, I just love looking at people and observing people and just being in the world and I think that’s how you properly research.
DEADLINE: I imagine you’ll work with Chris again, but now that you’ve done a lead for him, would you go back to playing ‘shivering solider’?
MURPHY: Sure, like I’ve said it from the beginning, I’ll always turn up for Chris. I’m such a fan of his movies, I was a fan of his movies before I ever met him – they’re the sort of movies that I love watching – so it’s been a privilege to get to work with him six times. I’ll turn up for anything Chris wants me to do, I’m there.
DEADLINE: You’ve told me before that it’s the writing that attracts you to a project. Oppenheimer is in part about a legacy left behind – and a devastating one at that. Do you ever think about your own legacy in terms of the choices you make?
MURPHY: I think it’s a little dangerous to start thinking about legacies. My career has always been incredibly haphazard and incredibly arbitrary, incredibly unplanned. The one constant that you mentioned is the writing. I think since I was a kid I’ve loved story, and I’m still a big reader and I love watching movies, and good stories are my kind of North Star. That’s what I follow. The budget or the medium is secondary to the story always.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktaW50ZXJ2aWV3LW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLTEyMzU0NDMyMzUv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy9jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1pbnRlcnZpZXctb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tMTIzNTQ0MzIzNS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"Who is Cillian Murphy, the magnetic star of Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer'?","Irish actor Cillian Murphy has been hiding in plain sight, having done around 50 movies and a dozen TV shows including Netflix's ""Peaky Blinders.""","Christopher Nolan’s hit film “Oppenheimer” rides on the slight but sturdy shoulders of Irish actor Cillian Murphy.
And that’s Cillian with a hard K – get to know it.
Murphy’s performance as physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led development of the atomic bomb that ended World War II, is one that may explode his fame, going from “I know I’ve seen him somewhere” status to Oscar-contending familiar face.
Not that Murphy, 47, is eager for the spotlight to grow hotter.
“Honestly, this may sound predictable, but I don’t think about that sort of stuff,” Murphy told USA TODAY in an interview before the start of the Screen Actors Guild strike. “It’s not going to do you any good. I just think about the work.”
Here’s a primer on one of this summer’s acting supernovas:
Who is Cillian Murphy?
Murphy grew up in a suburb of Cork, Ireland, and was active in plays as a teen. He first appeared on the big screen in 2001 in the film adaptation of an Irish play he starred in called “Disco Pigs.”
That was followed a year later by a haunting performance in Danny Boyle’s zombie thriller “28 Days Later.” Murphy has appeared in about 50 movies and half a dozen television shows.
In 2004, Murphy married his longtime girlfriend, Yvonne McGuinness; the couple have two teenage sons. Murphy and his family live in Dublin, deliberately far from Hollywood. He is notoriously shy of the red carpet and prefers the relative anonymity of his native Ireland.
What is Cillian Murphy’s biggest role to date?
If there’s a hint of recognition from movie and TV fans when they see Murphy’s face, that’s probably because of his star turn in the Netflix series “Peaky Blinders,” a drama based on the exploits of a British crime gang that operated after World War I. Murphy played Thomas Shelby, leader of the Birmingham flat cap brigade, in the series, which was among Netflix's most popular at the time.
Have Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan collaborated before?
Many times. In fact, Murphy has been a go-to pick for Nolan in six movies, but this latest, “Oppenheimer,” is the first time Murphy has taken the lead role.
Their collaborations include Murphy’s performance as the Scarecrow in three Batman movies, “Batman Begins” (2005), “The Dark Knight” (2008) and “The Dark Knight Rises” (2012).
In 2010, Murphy played the role of a business tycoon’s heir in “Inception,” and in 2017 he played a shell-shocked solider in the World War II historical epic “Dunkirk.”
Why did Christopher Nolan pick Cillian Murphy for the role of Oppenheimer?
Nolan says he never writes a movie script with specific actors in mind. But when he was staring at the cover of the book “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin, from which “Oppenheimer” is adapted, he knew who his leading man would be.
“I saw that photo (of Robert Oppenheimer) on the cover of the book, with that intense blue-eyed stare, and I thought, 'I know who can do this,' ” Nolan says. “I called him and said: ‘This is the one. You’ll take center stage and carry the audience with you.’ ”
Murphy at first was terrified, Nolan says. In a good way. “He was frightened to just the right degree. He knew he had to do a lot of work, and you’re looking for that in an artist. I didn’t want an imitation. I was looking for our interpretation of this man.”
What was Cillian Murphy’s reaction to seeing 'Oppenheimer' for the first time?
Murphy says he was “emotionally winded” after screening the completed three-hour film, which was shot in 70mm IMAX.
“I was knocked out really. It’s hard to take it all in,” he says. “It was a movie that I felt grabbed me by the throat and didn’t let go for three hours. I believe it’s Chris’s magnum opus.”
Will Murphy see 'Barbie,' the other part of the 'Barbenheimer' blockbuster movie weekend?
“For sure, 100%,” Murphy says. “I’m a fan of (“Barbie” director) Greta Gerwig, of (lead actress Margot) Robbie and Ryan (Gosling, who plays Ken).”
Murphy says his teenage sons “keep showing me these things on social media where people are saying they’re going to go to one movie and then straight into the other, and I think that’s just great for our industry.”

What’s next for Cillian Murphy?
Murphy has produced and acts in an upcoming movie called “Small Things Like These,” based on the award-winning historical novel by Irish writer Claire Keegan.
The movie follows a small-town Irish coal merchant, Bill Furlong (Murphy), who on a delivery to a convent discovers a haunting secret that forces him to confront his own and his town’s past.
With that wrapped up, might a relaxing break be next for the exacting actor, whose on-set intensity echoes that of British-born and Ireland-homesteading acting giant, three-time Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis?
“I’m not great at taking vacations, man,” Murphy says. “But maybe that’s why I only do a film a year. It takes too much out of me.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L21vdmllcy8yMDIzLzA3LzIxL2NpbGxpYW4tbXVycGh5LW1vdmllcy1hbmQtdHYtc2hvd3Mtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc3Rhci83MDQyNzU0NDAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Stars including Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt have walked the red carpet in London for the eagerly-awaited UK premiere of Oppenheimer.
Christopher Nolan's much-hyped movie tells the story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer, known for developing the atomic bomb.
Rami Malek, Florence Pugh and Robert Downey Jr are also among its big names.
But several stars left the premiere early, because of strike action called on Thursday evening.
Director Nolan told the audience before the screening of the film that ""unfortunately they've left to write their picket signs"".
Hollywood actors began their strike after talks between their union and major studios and streaming giants broke down. Writers in Hollywood are already taking industrial action - and a ""double strike"" such as this has not been seen since the 1960s and could bring the industry to a halt, as well as disrupting Oppenheimer's New York premiere on Monday.
Crowds gathered to watch the movie's makers and stars walk the red carpet, joined by celebrities including actor Jefferson Hall, acting husband-and-wife Josh Hartnett and Tamsin Egerton, and singer Sam Ryder.

Speaking on the red carpet, Murphy told BBC News there was a ""great atmosphere"" in London, and ""the response to the movie has been extraordinary"".
Many of the stars told the BBC they were drawn to the film because of director Nolan. ""There's a reason we all say that, it's just he's making the best movies right now,"" said Damon. ""It's a thrill to get a call from him.""
The premiere at the Odeon in Leicester Square comes ahead of the movie's release in the UK next Friday.
It comes the day after Wednesday night's premiere of Barbie, which is also out on 21 July. Because of the contrast between the two films and the same release date, many fans are planning to watch both, in what has been dubbed Barbenheimer.

2023-07-26 13:49:09+00:00,"Cillian Murphy Says Losing Batman Role Was ‘For the Best,’ Was on a List to Play Oppenheimer 9 Years Before Christopher Nolan’s Film","Cillian Murphy says losing the role of Batman to Christian Bale was ""for the best.""","Before Christian Bale landed the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne in Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight” trilogy, the filmmaker screen-tested his “Oppenheimer” star Cillian Murphy. Both men have since admitted that Murphy was never a real threat to steal the part from Bale, and Murphy told GQ Magazine UK in a recent interview that it “was for the best” that Bale won the coveted role over him anyway.
“Yes, I think it was for the best because we got Christian Bale’s performance, which is a stunning interpretation of that role,” Murphy said. “I never considered myself as the right physical specimen for Batman. To me, it was always going to be Christian Bale.”
Nolan didn’t think Murphy was right for the part either, but he still screen-tested him for Batman so that executives at Warner Bros. could see what an amazing actor he was. The director wanted Murphy to play the film’s villain, Scarecrow, but Murphy wasn’t exactly a huge movie star. The previous formula for Batman movies was that a big star played the hero’s villain, but Nolan wanted to shake things up.
“Everybody was so excited by watching [Cillian] perform that when I then said to them, ‘Okay, Christian Bale is Batman, but what about Cillian to play Scarecrow?’ There was no dissent,” Nolan recently told Entertainment Weekly. “All the previous Batman villains had been played by huge movie stars: Jack Nicholson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Carrey, that kind of thing. That was a big leap for them and it really was purely on the basis of that test. So that’s how you got to play Scarecrow.”
“Batman Begins” would be the first of six collaborations between Nolan and Murphy. He reprised Scarecrow in two more Batman movies and then had supporting roles in “Inception” and “Dunkirk” before landing his first Nolan lead role in “Oppenheimer.” It turns out Murphy was eyed to play the theoretical physicist almost a decade before Nolan’s biographical drama.
In a recent Vanity Fair story, television creator Sam Shaw looked back at the making of his WGN America series “Manhattan.” The period drama covered the same ground as Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” in telling the story of the Manhattan Project’s efforts to build the first atomic bomb in Los Alamos, N.M. The acclaimed series ran for two seasons in 2014 and 2016. Oppenheimer was a recurring character on the show played by Daniel London, but series writer Lila Byock said Murphy was on the team’s wish list.
“When we were casting Oppenheimer, we went through a whole series of different ideas,” Byock said, before adding, “A thousand percent, Cillian Murphy was on that list.”
“We wanted Oppenheimer to feel both like he possessed a certain undeniable charisma, a presence onstage, but also that he was playing a different instrument,” Shaw said. “He needed to feel alien — or other — in some ways. He stood out.”
Nearly 10 years later, Murphy is finally Oppenehimer and earning the best reviews of his career. Nolan’s film is now playing in theaters nationwide from Universal Pictures.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktbG9zdC1iYXRtYW4tcm9sZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci15ZWFycy1lYXJsaWVyLTEyMzU2ODA0Njcv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1sb3N0LWJhdG1hbi1yb2xlLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXllYXJzLWVhcmxpZXItMTIzNTY4MDQ2Ny9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-14 20:45:34+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’ First Reactions Praise Cillian Murphy’s ‘Mesmerizing’ Performance in Christopher Nolan’s ‘Spectacular’ Epic,"The first reactions to Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" are already calling Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr. Oscar nominees.","The explosive first reactions to Christopher Nolan‘s WWII epic “Oppenheimer” have lit the internet ablaze.
The film hosted its world premiere in Paris, shortly before the cast walked out of the U.K. premiere amid the SAG-AFTRA strike being announced July 14. “Oppenheimer” is set to debut in theaters July 20 and stars Cillian Murphy as the titular father of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer. Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr. are among the star-studded ensemble cast.
Writer-director Nolan used real explosions in lieu of CGI to mimic the first detonation of the atomic bomb during the Trinity Test. The entire film was shot in IMAX. “Oppenheimer” is inspired by 2005 book “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin and centers on Manhattan Project leader J. Robert Oppenheimer (Murphy) as he grapples with the moral repercussions of creating the bomb.
Murphy’s co-star Damon called his performance a “marathon” of sorts to balance the genius physicist’s academic and personal lives. And critics agree: Empire magazine editor Nick de Semlyen tweeted, “‘Oppenheimer’ is a roaring beast of a film, largely set in research labs but feeling like an odyssey into hell. Cillian Murphy is mesmerizing, and Nolan is at full power; it feels like the film itself becomes radiation-poisoned as it goes on. A bleak triumph.”
Criterion writer Christina Newland added, “Cillian Murphy is genuinely so incredible here. Just operating at such a level of fragility and haunted knowingness and arrogant bravado; a performance as complex as the subject deserves.”
New York Magazine critic Bilge Ebiri called the film “incredible” and cited its “fearsome” approach to the weighty subject matter. “A relentlessly paced, insanely detailed, intricate historical drama that builds and builds and builds until Nolan brings the hammer down in the most astonishing, shattering way,” Ebiri tweeted.
The Playlist journalist Gregory Ellwood especially cited Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr.’s respective performances, saying Downey especially gave a career-best. AP film writer Lindsey Bahr wrote that she was “lucky” to have seen “Oppenheimer” in 70mm IMAX, which was a “once in a lifetime experience.”

,Cillian Murphy admits he was a mess after watching Interstellar,"'Oppenheimer' stars Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt reveal their favorite Christopher Nolan movies.","Ask four random people to name their favorite Christopher Nolan film and you might get four different answers. Ask the four main stars of Nolan's new movie Oppenheimer (out July 21) that question and that's definitely the case, as EW discovers when Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr. share their take on his filmography (even Nolan himself offers a suggestion) during our latest Around the Table conversation.
""I love Dunkirk,"" says Blunt. ""I've seen that, like, 20 times.""
""My wife and I watched The Prestige, I think, four days in a row when it came out,"" says Damon. ""But I love Inception as well. That's kind of an impossible question. It's like saying, what's your favorite Hitchcock movie?""

""You're in all of them,"" Blunt says to Murphy, whose professional relationship with Nolan dates back to 2005's Batman Begins in which the actor played the role of Dr. Jonathan Crane.
""No, I'm not,"" the actor politely corrects. ""I remember seeing Interstellar in IMAX, on my own. I just remember coming out in a terrible state. It was so emotional.""
""Did no one else want to watch it with you?"" jokes Blunt.
""I love escaping from the house,"" says Murphy. ""My kids were little. But it's so emotional, that movie, that always gets me every time.""

""I can't answer the question but I want to make the case for Dunkirk,"" says Nolan, who cast Murphy in the film as the survivor of a U-boat attack named in the credits as ""Shivering soldier."" ""When I sent Cillian the script, he wasn't entirely enthusiastic about playing the character. You actually called me up and went like, 'Sure, I'll do it because I want to work with you, but couldn't I be a Spitfire pilot instead?' And I said 'No, I need you out on that boat.' So I convinced you, and then you're out on the boat, and you're diving in the water off the wreck, and feeling more and more miserable about it all. The character doesn't have a name, all that. But cut to a couple years later, I went to buy the box set of Peaky Blinders and on the back it said: Cillian 'Dunkirk' Murphy. I was like, job done!""
It's a good answer. But Downey has an arguably better one.
""Many people will say this is your greatest film and a culmination of aspects of every film you've ever done,"" says the actor to Nolan. ""So it's almost like Good Will Hunting: You've made this equation where you're now at the end of the chalkboard, and what the heck would you do next? But we believe in you, sir. So my favorite film of yours is whatever the heck you do after this, because you'd better come up with something amazing.""
Oppenheimer stars Murphy as theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called ""father of the atomic bomb."" Blunt plays Oppenheimer's wife Kitty; Damon portrays General Leslie Groves, the man responsible for putting Oppenheimer in charge of the Manhattan Project; and Downey is Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss.
Oppenheimer drops in theaters July 21.

2023-07-27 00:50:29+00:00,Movie review: Christopher Nolan ventures out of his element in 'Oppenheimer',"Christopher Nolan is a legendary director, with his filmography — including renowned movies such as “Inception,” “The Dark Knight” and “Interstellar” — having gained distinction because of his passion for developing visually and auditorily stunning films. The consequence of his painstaking commitment to his style is a lack of substance at times — a heavy criticism of “Tenet,” Nolan’s most recently released film prior to “Oppenheimer.” While “Oppenheimer” fits right in with his best work at times, it occasionally falls into the exact same pitfalls that hold his other movies back from being full-on masterpieces.","Christopher Nolan is a legendary director, with his filmography — including renowned movies such as “Inception,” “The Dark Knight” and “Interstellar” — having gained distinction because of his passion for developing visually and auditorily stunning films. The consequence of his painstaking commitment to his style is a lack of substance at times — a heavy criticism of “Tenet,” Nolan’s most recently released film prior to “Oppenheimer.”
While “Oppenheimer” fits right in with his best work at times, it occasionally falls into the exact same pitfalls that hold his other movies back from being full-on masterpieces.
“Oppenheimer,” starring Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, details the life of the “father of the atomic bomb” as he races to assemble a team of scientists and develop the infamous weapon before rival scientists in enemy countries. Amid this already monumental challenge, he struggles with accusations of being a communist ally and an increasingly complicated personal life.
The story can’t reasonably be criticized, as it is a cinematic retelling of Oppenheimer’s real life, but the way Nolan chooses to tell the story is somewhat questionable.
Nolan is known for directing blockbusters like superhero movies, and “Oppenheimer” can sometimes feel like a superhero origin story rather than a true biopic. Cameos and name drops of famous scientists are shot like easter eggs viewers might expect to see in a Marvel film; moreover, the dialogue features quips and one-liners that seem thoroughly out of place.
“Oppenheimer” is at its best when it focuses on Murphy’s brilliant performance and the deep dive into Oppenheimer’s psychology, more akin to the individualistic character study expected of a biopic.
An issue Nolan runs into even in his most successful movies is the repeated use of female characters’ suffering to bring emotional depth to his main characters — a martyrized manic pixie dream girl of sorts.
“Oppenheimer” is based on a true story, so Nolan didn’t write these characters from scratch, but he did purposefully select what parts of their real-life story to show. While Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) is developed well, the treatment of Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), his first love and on-and-off-again relationship, is shockingly disappointing for someone so important to Oppenheimer’s story.
She has very limited scenes — a shame in and of itself because of Pugh’s stage presence — and when she does appear, she acts more as a hardship for Oppenheimer to overcome rather than her own distinct person. Nolan neglects not only to pay much attention to Tatlock’s own accomplishments as a brilliant scientist but also her struggles with her sexuality, a defining characteristic of her own life as well as of her relationship with Oppenheimer.
In doing so, he takes a complex real-world person and makes her one-dimensional. In fact, it’s almost implied Tatlock’s struggles with mental health weren’t due to the pressure of being a non-heteronormative person in the 1940s, but rather because of her failing relationship with Oppenheimer.
While the movie is ultimately an Oppenheimer biopic and not a Jean Tatlock biopic, you’d think that a person arguably more consequential to Oppenheimer’s life than his own wife would be treated with the care she deserves, especially when failing to do so sacrifices historical accuracy.
Another common struggle of Nolan’s that is seen again in “Oppenheimer” is his approach to pacing. The movie actually moves through Oppenheimer’s life fairly quickly; however, Nolan chooses to show so much of the story that the plot still seems slow at times, especially due to the immense number of time jumps back and forth through Oppenheimer’s career.
For instance, if the ignition of the Trinity test — the first atomic bomb ever dropped and the culmination of Oppenheimer’s life’s work — was the peak of action and build-up in the movie, “Oppenheimer” might have one of the longest third acts in all of cinema.
The second half of the movie deals with a series of trials faced by Oppenheimer and adjacent scientists, soldiers and politicians. While it is extremely tense and enjoyable in a manner reminiscent of political dramas, what audiences came to see had already exploded by then, and the film’s remainder may drag for those less interested in the politics of it all.
Nolan urged the film community to see “Oppenheimer” in specific formats leading up to its release, saying that IMAX 70mm is the way he intended it to be seen. However, only 19 theaters with the capacity to show IMAX 70mm exist in the entire United States, so the option to see it as Nolan intended isn’t viable for most people.
While Nolan and other experts said audiences would still enjoy it in other theaters, a question must be asked when the needle is pushed from a movie being an engaging narrative to a sensory spectacle. The best movies should be able to be enjoyed anywhere, simply accentuated by the magic of a theater.
While “Oppenheimer” is without a doubt entertaining, it does feel as though the correlation between the size of the screen it is viewed on and the overall audience experience is far too intertwined.
“Oppenheimer” is simultaneously emblematic of Nolan’s greatest strengths and weaknesses, but it can never be faulted for a lack of spectacle. It should be criticized out of respect for its ambition; great works of art intrinsically invite criticism due to the boundaries they have to push. “Oppenheimer” grips the audience with its unique blend of psychological despair and American patriotism, and despite its faults, is still a spectacle worth seeing on the big screen.

,"Cillian Murphy, Playing Oppenheimer, Finally Gets to Lead a Christopher Nolan Film","The day Christopher Nolan called Cillian Murphy about his new film, “Oppenheimer,” Murphy hung up the phone in disbelief.","The day Christopher Nolan called Cillian Murphy about his new film, “Oppenheimer,” Murphy hung up the phone in disbelief.
The Irish actor, though a regular presence in Nolan films going back almost two decades, had always been a supporting player. This time, Nolan wanted him to lead.
“He’s so understated and self-deprecating and, in his very English manner, just said, ‘Listen, I’ve written this script, it’s about Oppenheimer. I’d like you to be my Oppenheimer,’” Murphy, 47, told The Associated Press earlier this year. “It was a great day.”
For Murphy, it is never not exciting to get a call from Nolan. It’s just hard to predict if he’s going to. He knows there are some movies he’s right for and some movies he isn’t.
“I have always said publicly and privately, to Chris, that if I’m available and you want me to be in a movie, I’m there. I don’t really care about the size of the part,” he said. “But deep down, secretly, I was desperate to play a lead for him.”

Murphy first met Nolan in 2003. He was brought in to screen test for Batman — not just the movie, the character. Murphy knew he wasn’t right for the Dark Knight, but he wanted to meet the man who’d directed “Insomnia” and “Memento.” They hit it off and Murphy got to tap into a sinister intensity to play the corrupt psychiatrist Dr. Crane/Scarecrow, who would go on to appear in all three films. Nolan would also call on Murphy to be the conflicted heir to a business empire in “Inception” and a traumatized soldier in “Dunkirk.”
“We have this long-standing understanding and trust and shorthand and respect,” Murphy said. “It felt like the right time to take on a bigger responsibility. And it just so happened that it was a f---ing huge one.”
Soon after the phone call, Nolan flew to Dublin to meet Murphy and hand him a physical copy of the script, which he devoured right there in Nolan’s hotel room. It was, he said, the best he’d ever read.
Then the scale of it started to sink in.
This would be a film about the charismatic and controversial theoretical physicist who helped create the atomic bomb. Oppenheimer and his peers at Los Alamos would test it on July 16, 1945, not knowing what was going to happen. There was a non-zero chance that the heat from the explosion could set off a chain reaction that would ignite the atmosphere and literally set the world on fire.
It didn’t, but several weeks later the United States would drop those bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing tens of thousands of people and leaving many with lifelong injuries. Soon, the United States was at work to strengthen its nuclear arsenal, developing plans to work on an even more catastrophic weapon: the hydrogen bomb.
As Nolan has said, “Like it or not J. Robert Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived.”
“Oppenheimer,” which opens in theaters on July 21, features a starry cast including Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty, Matt Damon as the man who hired Oppenheimer for the job at Los Alamos, Robert Downey Jr. as a founder of the Atomic Energy Commission and many more rounding out the pivotal players in and around this tense moment in history.
“You realize this is a huge responsibility. He was complicated and contradictory and so iconic,” Murphy said. “But you know you’re with one of the great directors of all time. I felt confident going into it with Chris. He’s had a profound impact on my life, creatively and professionally. He’s offered me very interesting roles over and I’ve found all of them really challenging. And I just love being on his sets.”
Murphy continued: “Any actor would want to be on a Chris Nolan set, just to see how it works and to witness his command of the language of film and the mechanics of film and how he’s able to use that broad canvas within the mainstream studio system to make these very challenging human stories.”
Over the years, Murphy has come to appreciate that with Nolan there’s always something deeper to discover than what’s literally on the page. “Dunkirk,” he recalled, was only 70 pages and there wasn’t much to his character, not even a name.
“He said, ‘Look, let’s figure it out together and you and me can find an emotional journey for the character.’ And we did it. We did it out in the water on that boat. That comes from trust and respect,” Murphy said. “I’m really proud of that performance.”
As with all Nolan endeavors, secrecy around “Oppenheimer” is vitally important. Murphy loves the “old-fashioned approach” that builds interest and anticipation.
“There’s an awful lot to talk about when we can talk freely,” Murphy said with a smile.
The difference from other Nolan originals, even “Dunkirk,” is that “Oppenheimer” is rooted in historical fact and actual transcripts. You can read the book it’s based on, Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.” You can watch the 1981 documentary “The Day After Trinity” on The Criterion Channel.
And you can try to parse Nolan’s words for clues. He’s talked about recreating the Trinity test, the fascinating paradoxes, the twists, turns and ethical dilemmas; for him, the story is cinematic and both dream and nightmare. But ultimately, it’s something that just needs to be seen.
“The question will be how Chris presents it,” Murphy said. “I think people will be very surprised and wowed by what he does. Anything I say will just seem a bit lame as compared to seeing this in an IMAX theater.”
The time for discussions will be after the movie comes out. But Murphy did offer up that they worked hard to get Oppenheimer’s look right, from the narrow silhouette to the pipe and the porkpie hat. Oppenheimer, he said, “seemed aware of his own potential mythology.” But, again, those conversations will have to wait.
“I’m really proud of the movie and I’m really proud of what Chris has achieved. This was, for sure, a special one, certainly because of the history with me and Chris. We were not walking around the set high-fiving, but it did feel special.” Murphy said. “It’s an event every time he releases a film, and rightly so. Whether I’m in them or not, I always go to see his movies.”

2023-07-11 15:07:17.008000+00:00,Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy are Embracing Barbenheimer,"Christopher Nolan tells IGN the Oppenheimer-Barbie cultural phenomenon 'Barbenheimer' is going to do great things for the moviegoing experience in a recent interview, and Cillian Murphy agrees.","The time is quickly coming upon us. What time, might you ask? The time of Barbenheimer, of course — and it looks as though the Oppenheimer cast and director Christopher Nolan are pretty excited about this head-to-head film event of the summer.
""Summer, in a healthy marketplace, is always crowded, and we've been doing this a long time,” the filmmaker told IGN when asked about sharing a release date with Barbie in a recent interview. “I think for those of us who care about movies, we've been really waiting to have a crowded marketplace again, and now it's here and that's terrific.""
""I'll be going to see Barbie 100%. I can't wait to see it!"" -Cillian Murphy pic.twitter.com/0pXqikGoJQ — IGN (@IGN) July 11, 2023
As for the film’s leading man, Cillian Murphy, he’s in agreement that the Oppenheimer-Barbie double header can only be a positive thing.
""I think it's great. I mean, I'll be going to see Barbie. I can't wait to see it,” the actor gushed to IGN during the same interview. “I think it's just great for the industry and for audiences that we have two amazing films by amazing filmmakers coming out the same day. Could spend a whole day in the cinema, what's better than that?""
To be fair, Barbenheimer, when made into a mashed-up word like that, seems way more complicated than it is. But at the end of the day, it’s simply just the hybrid term given to the fact that Greta Gerwig’s highly-anticipated film Barbie and Nolan’s equally-as-anticipated atomic bomb drama Oppenheimer both release in theaters on July 21 in the United States.
""I love the fact that people are talking about going to two movies in a weekend,” Matt Damon, who also stars in Oppenheimer, explained to IGN. “Ben [Affleck] and I used to go to two movies every weekend, and I think people should do that.""
“ I think it's great. I mean, I'll be going to see Barbie. I can't wait to see it
""And also the interest in the variety of what's available is so awesome,” Emily Blunt, another famous face who is part of the star-studded Oppenheimer cast, noted to IGN during the interview. “It's awesome.""
Notably, the Barbenheimer concept has totally blown up in the zeitgeist, taking it from a quippy descriptor for a double feature at the cinema to a phenomenon spawning memes, merch, and an overall connection to the moviegoing experience that has been largely absent since the onset of COVID.
That said, which goes first in the unmissable double feature?
""Maybe Oppenheimer on the Saturday? Friday night? I don't know,"" Blunt mused before Damon asserted: ""I'd knock out Oppenheimer.""
But in Murphy’s opinion, fate is the best approach to setting up your Barbenheimer viewing plans. He smartly told IGN: ""Just flip a coin.""

2023-08-04 19:18:53+00:00,Cillian Murphy Says ‘Oppenheimer’ Deleted Scenes Don’t Exist: Christopher Nolan Doesn’t ‘Fiddle Around Trying to Change the Story’,"Don't get excited for an ""Oppenheimer"" director's cut.","“Oppenheimer” is Christopher Nolan’s longest movie at 180 minutes, but don’t expect it to get even longer whenever it arrives on home video. Neither a director’s cut of the atomic bomb epic nor deleted scenes from the movie exist, Cillian Murphy recently told Collider.
“There’s no deleted scenes in Chris Nolan movies,” Murphy added. “That’s why there are no DVD extras on his movies because the script is the movie. He knows exactly what’s going to end up – he’s not fiddling around with it trying to change the story. That is the movie.”
Nolan’s movies are often big-budget productions (“Oppenheimer” carried a $100 million price tag), and his decision to shoot on film doesn’t make things cheaper. Nolan goes into his film shoots knowing exactly what he needs to capture, nothing more and nothing less.
“I tend to try and weed things out on paper because it’s crazy expensive to shoot things that aren’t going to be in the film,” the director previously told MTV.com. “It also takes up a lot of time and energy. Pretty much with all my films, there are very few deleted scenes, which always disappoints the DVD crowd.”
At three hours, “Oppenheimer” has an Imax film print that weighs some 600 pounds and runs 11 miles long. He shot the movie using large format film cameras. Nolan told AP before the movie opened in theaters that the “best possible experience” for viewing “Oppenheimer” is the Imax 70mm film format. However, that format only exists in 25 theaters across North America.
“The sharpness and the clarity and the depth of the image is unparalleled,” Nolan said. “The headline, for me, is by shooting on Imax 70mm film, you’re really letting the screen disappear. You’re getting a feeling of 3D without the glasses. You’ve got a huge screen and you’re filling the peripheral vision of the audience. You’re immersing them in the world of the film.”
“Oppenheimer” has crossed the $400 million mark at the worldwide box office. The film is now playing nationwide from Universal Pictures.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItZGVsZXRlZC1zY2VuZXMtZG9udC1leGlzdC1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS0xMjM1Njg4MDIwL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItZGVsZXRlZC1zY2VuZXMtZG9udC1leGlzdC1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS0xMjM1Njg4MDIwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 14:30:00+00:00,We Need to Talk About Those ‘Oppenheimer’ Sex Scenes,"Perhaps the most surprising element of ‘Oppenheimer’ is its sex scenes, the first ones filmed by director Christopher Nolan.","The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry, and two films explore that abiding Robert Burns proverb this week: Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s IMAX-sized three-hour biopic of the “father of the atomic bomb,” and Barbie, a Mattel-sanctioned deconstruction of the patriarchy from the fertile mind of Greta Gerwig. Only one of these summer blockbusters, however, boasts a number of sex scenes, and it isn’t the one starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.
Oppenheimer explores the life and times of renowned theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (embodied by an admirably committed Cillian Murphy) through the twin prisms of his time as de facto leader of the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico, as the U.S. and its team of scientific avengers raced to create the first atomic bomb before the Nazis; and his 1954 security clearance hearings, where Congress sought to paint their erstwhile savior as a commie governed by anti-American hostilities and wanton sexual desire (ugly stereotypes all-too-commonly foisted on American Jews like Oppenheimer). There is also a black-and-white 1959 congressional hearing on the cabinet nomination of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr., never better), chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and a supposed friend of Oppenheimer’s, though the less said about this prolonged deviation the better.
We are treated to glimpses of Oppenheimer’s years teaching in the physics department at UC Berkeley, where he and his students made a number of valuable advances in the realms of quantum chemistry and molecular physics, and nuclear reactions in particular. This is where Oppenheimer, an attractive, slender man with piercing blue eyes, met Jean Tatlock (played by Florence Pugh), a young Stanford Medical School student and Communist Party member who wrote and reported for the Western Worker, a communist newspaper. Tatlock helped fuel Oppenheimer’s — or Oppie, as she would call him — interest in the field of psychology, as well as radical left-wing politics, and their passionate romance would eventually attract the interest of the FBI. Editor’s picks
Early on in Oppenheimer, Professor Oppenheimer is introduced to Tatlock during a Communist Party get-together, and the two immediately click. Cut to a scene of a nude Pugh-as-Tatlock riding Murphy’s Oppie like the end of Dr. Strangelove, only to pause in the action when her eye catches a book on his shelf: the Bhagavad Gita, a Hindu scripture that was a favorite of Oppenheimer’s. She turns to a section and, as she is on top of him, has him read it to her: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds” — a line famously uttered by Oppenheimer about him and his terrifying creation during a 1965 TV broadcast. In lieu of capturing the intensity of Oppenheimer and Tatlock’s affair, it comes off as clumsy and unintentionally funny. Why is Tatlock making Oppenheimer read one of his most famous quotes back to her while fucking him?
Now, it is the first sex scene that Nolan has ever filmed, after all — Oppenheimer is the first Nolan flick to attract an R rating since 2002’s Insomnia due to its sex scenes — so perhaps we should cut him a bit of slack. I mean, who can forget Spielberg’s supercharged sex scene in 2006’s Munich, a baffling mélange of sweat, thrashing, terror, and climax-as-exorcism, set to a religious hymn and intercut with scenes of Israelis being gunned down during the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics by Palestinian militants. Shooting a good sex scene is a gift that can escape even some of our greatest filmmakers. Not everyone can be Nicolas Roeg. And Nolan appears well-aware of this.
“Any time you’re challenging yourself to work in areas you haven’t worked in before, you should be appropriately nervous and appropriately careful and planned and prepared,” Nolan told Insider about filming his first sex scenes.
He added, “When you look at Oppenheimer’s life and you look at his story, that aspect of his life, the aspect of his sexuality, his way with women, the charm that he exuded, it’s an essential part of his story… It felt very important to try to understand their relationship and to really see inside it and understand what made it tick without being coy or allusive about it — but to try to be intimate, to try and be in there with him and fully understand the relationship that was so important to him.” Related

Indeed, Oppenheimer was quite the ladies’ man. In addition to his romance with Tatlock, which is said to have lasted well into his marriage to Kitty (Emily Blunt), the film implies that he’d conducted an affair with Ruth Sherman Tolman (Louise Lombard), the wife of Oppenheimer’s pal Richard Tolman, a physicist who served as scientific advisor to Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) in the Manhattan Project. Their alleged affair is explored more in-depth in the 2013 book An Atomic Love Story: The Extraordinary Women in Robert Oppenheimer’s Life.
“Robert was seen dating a number of ‘mostly very attractive youngish girls,’” during his time at Berkeley, according to the Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, upon which Nolan’s film is based. “Among others, he had relationships with Haakon Chevalier’s sister-in-law, Ann Hoffman, and Estelle Caen, the sister of the San Francisco Chronicle’s columnist Herbert Caen. Bob Serber recalled a half-dozen girlfriends, including a British emigré named Sandra Dyer-Bennett. He broke several hearts. Still, whenever Tatlock phoned him in a low mood, he came to her and talked her out of her depression. They remained the closest of friends, and occasional lovers.”
After Tatlock broke things off with Oppenheimer, who’d proposed marriage to her at least twice, he met Kitty Harrison (née Peuning), who was married at the time to Stewart Harrison, a doctor. He rekindled his romance with Tatlock while married to Kitty, though refused to say goodbye to Tatlock before departing for Los Alamos.
In 1943, on a visit to Berkeley in the midst of the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer reunited with Tatlock – even though she was seeing his friend, a psychologist named Dr. Siegfried Bernfeld. He was monitored by agents of the military during their entire rendezvous, who later reported their findings to the FBI. According to American Prometheus, those findings were that: “‘On June 14, 1943, Oppenheimer traveled via Key Railway from Berkeley to San Francisco… where he was met by Jean Tatlock who kissed him.’” The two went out for dinner and drinks, and then to Tatlock’s apartment, where Oppenheimer wouldn’t emerge until 8:30 a.m. the next morning, and the FBI report noted that “the relationship of Oppenheimer and Tatlock appears to be very affectionate and intimate.”
As far as we know, he never saw her again after San Francisco.

Aside from this clandestine rendezvous, Pugh’s Tatlock disappears for much of Oppenheimer — save a scene during Oppenheimer’s 1954 security clearance hearings that has to be seen to be believed. Oppenheimer is being grilled by seedy congressmen over his allegiances, with the blowhards repeatedly claiming that Oppenheimer’s affair with the communist Tatlock during his marriage to Kitty, and his association with her communist friends, confirmed that his loyalty to America was precarious at best.
Blunt’s Kitty is in the room as Murphy’s Oppenheimer is being interrogated by these congressmen over Tatlock and we switch to her perspective, as she envisions Oppenheimer and Tatlock — naked — having sex right in front of her, in that very room, with Pugh’s nude Tatlock grinding on Oppie’s lap. Tatlock locks eyes with Kitty in this fantasy scenario, taunting her. You get what Nolan is attempting here — to convey Kitty’s jealousy over her husband’s extramarital tryst — but the scene is so wildly over-the-top that your eyes will roll back into your head.

There is much to admire in Nolan’s Oppenheimer. It is a staggering technical achievement, its score by Ludwig Göransson is dizzyingly alive, the compositions by Hoyte van Hoytema deserve to be taken in on the biggest screen possible, and its performances are stellar across the board (save Josh Hartnett and Benny Safdie’s distracting turns). The film is brimming with ambition, but its sex scenes — and the portrait of Oppenheimer and Tatlock’s relationship as a whole — could have used some work.
Tatlock, by then a doctor whose star was on the rise, took her own life in 1944. She had battled crippling bouts of depression. The name of the first nuclear test, “Trinity,” was reportedly made in tribute to her. It is a reference to a poem by the poet John Donne, whose work Tatlock had introduced to Oppie.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yb2xsaW5nc3RvbmUuY29tL3R2LW1vdmllcy90di1tb3ZpZS1mZWF0dXJlcy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1zZXgtc2NlbmVzLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLWNpbGxpYW4tbXVycGh5LWZsb3JlbmNlLXB1Z2gtamVhbi10YXRsb2NrLTEyMzQ3OTAxMTMv0gGbAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vdHYtbW92aWVzL3R2LW1vdmllLWZlYXR1cmVzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXNleC1zY2VuZXMtY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktZmxvcmVuY2UtcHVnaC1qZWFuLXRhdGxvY2stMTIzNDc5MDExMy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Greta Gerwig’s Barbie logged a more than beachy keen international box office total of $194.3M in 69 offshore markets through Sunday, waves ahead of the $182M from yesterday’s projections (see Sunday update below for original Sunday reporting on both Barbie and Oppenheimer).
Globally and internationally Barbie is the biggest start ever for a non-franchise WB movie and the third-best of all time for a WB film worldwide, as well as the 5th best start overseas for a WB title.
The Margot Robbie/Ryan Gosling-starrer was No. 1 in 58 offshore markets and is the best 2023 start for a Hollywood movie in 24 markets including Australia, Brazil, and the UK. Also up from yesterday’s estimates, Barbie is the top WB opening of all time for WB in 26 markets (Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico among them).
In one session, Barbie has already surpassed the lifetimes of Ocean’s 8, Cruella and Birds of Prey. Also increasing against yesterday’s estimates, the international take has Barbie tracking 60% above Wonder Woman, 178% over Cinderella and 195% above The Little Mermaid as well as 259% above Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again in like-for-likes and at today’s rates. In Europe, as a region, Barbie has overtaken The Super Mario Bros Movie as the biggest launch weekend of the year.
Individual market increases in the actuals include leader the UK with $24.2M versus the $22.9M reported yesterday. This is the he 2nd best three-day start for a WB film ever behind only the final installment of Harry Potter.
Brazil also jumped, to $17.6M in the actuals versus the $15.9M Sunday estimate. France is confirmed at $10.2M for the top WB opening since the pandemic and the studio’s biggest since Joker in 2019. Italy rode the wave to $8.8M, dominating with an 83% share of the Top 5 Films in the market. This is 3% above Beauty and the Beast, 14% over Fast X and 4% ahead of Super Mario. China, where we really were not expecting much, actually increased screens throughout the weekend resulting in an $8.1M three-day; 23% ahead of The Greatest Showman and 231% over The Little Mermaid.
On Oppenheimer, offshore markets raised their running cume to $98M, up from yesterday’s $93.7M estimate (again, see Sunday update below for more on initial reports on both films).
The $98M overseas makes Oppenheimer the No. 2 opening weekend ever for a film directed by Christopher Nolan behind only The Dark Knight Rises ($131M) and ahead of The Dark Knight ($94.2M) in non-restated figures. At current exchange rates and excluding previews, the weekend result is narrowly below The Dark Knight Rises (-2%), achieves the 2nd biggest international opening for a Nolan film, more than double all other comps. It is also 49% above last week’s openings for Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One.
Meanwhile, at current exchange rates and including previews, the offshore cume of $98M through Sunday is in line with The Dark Knight Rises (-6%).
The Cillian Murphy-led biographical epic was No. 1 in 17 markets including India, Netherlands, UAE, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia and Denmark. In 42 markets (up from 36 in the estimates), this is Nolan’s best opening weekend ever. Across the Europe/Middle East/Africa region, Oppenheimer is the biggest debut for Nolan, topping The Dark Knight Rises.
Notable markets that saw increases in the actuals include the UK with $14M for the second biggest opening for Nolan, behind The Dark Knight Rises, more than double Interstellar and Tenet and the 8th best Universal three-day weekend ever.
India was up to $7.2M versus the $7M estimate; France scored $7M, up from the $6.4M estimate and landing the second-biggest start for a Nolan movie; Germany trued up to $6.6M (while Barbie was No. 1 for the frame, there was just a slight difference between the two with Oppenheimer on top Thursday and Saturday).
Other markets to see slight upwards shifts for Oppenheimer versus Sunday’s estimates include Saudi Arabia ($4M), Spain ($3.8M), UAE ($3M), Brazil ($2.7M); Netherlands ($2.6M), Hong Kong ($1.9M) and Belgium ($1.5M).
PREVIOUS, SUNDAY: It’s a Barbenheimer world as Warner Bros’ Barbie and Universal’s Oppenheimer have delivered massive global debuts of $337M and $174.2M, respectively.
At the international box office, Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, surfed a wave to an incredible $182M from 69 markets, the biggest WB offshore opening ever for a non-franchise film. At the same time, Christopher Nolan’s Cillian Murphy-led Oppenheimer in 78 markets landed a staggering $93.7M overseas.
For both titles, the performances are beyond expectations, buoyed by great critical and audience response as well as the organic worldwide Barbenheimer phenomenon which created fusion at the box office as double bills became the order of the weekend for many moviegoers around the globe.
Studio insiders across town have been agog over the past several days at the momentum – which also had a knock-on effect of expanding the marketplace. This is terrific for the industry, and welcome news before we hit what could be a somewhat fallow period if the Hollywood strikes stretch out.
Says Andrew Cripps, Warner Bros President of International Theatrical Distribution, “The incredible worldwide results we’ve seen are a testament to the filmmakers’ singular vision to provide a fun and engaging experience that audiences of all ages are responding to in a fun and powerful way.”
And for Veronika Kwan Vandenberg, President of Distribution for Universal Pictures International, “We couldn’t be happier for Chris Nolan and Emma Thomas, the phenomenal cast and crew, and our partners at IMAX and exhibition around the world.”
This is indeed a sunshine moment with two movies that couldn’t be more different dialing into a communal experience for the world. Adds Kwan Vandenberg, “This weekend has been a huge win for our industry. The market expanded and it is great to see audiences of all ages and demographics appreciating both films.”
Echoes Cripps, “It’s great to see people coming out to see both films. It’s well-deserved and well-needed news.”
Indeed, this is one of those weekends that we haven’t had for a long time where there is an awful lot to parse. It’s not just the amazing newcomers, but also the holds.
Barbie scored the 2nd biggest industry opening of 2023 internationally behind Universal’s Fast X and was No. 1 in 55 markets. This also marks the top overseas start for Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling and Greta Gerwig and the biggest industry opening of the year in 18 markets including Australia, Brazil and the UK.
Further milestones include biggest WB bow ever in 16 markets including Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico.
In like-for-like markets and using today’s exchange rates, the film is tracking 50% ahead of Wonder Woman, 161% above Cinderella, 177% over The Little Mermaid and 236% over Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.
Running down the Top 5 markets, the UK’s gigantic $22.9M ranked a clear No. 1 with records including the biggest opening for a WB film since the pandemic and the top start of 2023, ahead of Super Mario. It’s followed by a stunning Mexico debut with $22.3M, repping 73% market share and the biggest opening ever for a WB title and the 2nd best of the year.
Brazil’s $15.9M is WB’s best ever (even ahead of the DC-loving market’s number for Justice League and Batman V Superman), best of 2023 and 3rd best ever.
Australia’s $14.6M start is the best ever for a WB movie in the market and tops of 2023. And, Spain, which doesn’t always factor at the top of the lists, is next with $9.9M, the 2nd best bow of the year, just behind Super Mario (which debuted on a Wednesday discount day). Barbie in the market came in 23% above Beauty and the Beast, 39% above Fast X and 56% above Joker.
Barbie was also positively on fire in Latin America with the biggest opening of a WB movie ever, and tops for 2023 (ahead of Super Mario and Fast X). In Europe, it’s the best non-franchise start for WB ever, and in Asia overperformed as the top WB start in Malaysia and Philippines, while conferring best launches for Robbie and Gosling in multiple plays.
Meanwhile, epic biographical thriller Oppenheimer is Nolan’s biggest opening weekend globally behind only the final two films in the Dark Knight trilogy. It’s also the biggest global day-and-date opening weekend ever for a biographical film surpassing Bohemian Rhapsody ($124M), and the top worldwide launch for a drama since 2019 ahead of Creed III ($100.2M).
In like-for-like markets at historic rates it’s the 3rd highest grossing opening weekend ever for a film directed by Nolan behind only The Dark Knight Rises ($131M) and in line with The Dark Knight ($94.2M) – note that it could catch the latter in non-restated numbers.
In 36 overseas markets, this is Nolan’s best start including India, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Netherlands. In 55, it’s his best non-Batman launch including the UK/Ireland, France, Germany, Australia, Mexico, Spain and Brazil. And, it scored the biggest opened day for a Nolan title in 33 markets.
In IMAX, the film bowed to $35M globally, with 20% of the gross coming from only 740 screens. Shot with IMAX film cameras, specifically designed to be seen on IMAX screens, and playing in IMAX 15/70 film, Laser and Xenon, the film is Nolan’s top IMAX opening ever, the biggest for IMAX in July and the biggest of 2023 as well as the 2nd best ever for Universal.
International markets contributed $13.9M in IMAX, 14.8% of the offshore gross from only 329 screens. This is also tops for Nolan and tops for IMAX in July, while it’s the biggest IMAX opening weekend ever in Mexico, India, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, New Zealand and Czech Republic.
Among individual territories, the UK leads at an estimated $13.3M three-day start. That would fall in line with Dunkirk (+3%), above Inception (+76%) and Interstellar (+94%) and more than 3x Tenet.
India is on track to deliver the biggest 3-day IMAX opening ever for a Hollywood title. Estimated to reach a full $7M this weekend, it is Nolan’s tops ever, best of 2023 and Universal’s best start since the pandemic began. Note that it already beat those benchmarks on opening day, and scored the biggest non-franchise Hollywood opening weekend and 7th biggest Hollywood opening weekend in history. (Also note that censor edits were made per usual business practice in order to secure a release in certain markets; we understand that in India, nudity in a particular scene was covered up for the release there with the movie carrying a UA rating meaning it’s classified for viewers with parental guidance for children under 12.)
France gave Nolan the biggest opening Wednesday since The Dark Knight Rises with the weekend estimate at $6.4M, which would make it the biggest non-superhero Nolan opening weekend, and come in above Inception (+6%), Tenet (+30%), Interstellar (+43%) and Dunkirk (+29%).
Germany isn also estimated to reach $6.4M this session, similarly the biggest non-superhero start for Nolan and above Inception (+14%), Interstellar (+63%), Tenet (+82%) and more than 3x Dunkirk excluding previews.
Australia, with stiff competition from Barbie, is estimated to have an opening weekend total of $6.3M, ahead of Dunkirk (+54%), Inception (+24%) and more than double Interstellar and Tenet. Thanks to the astounding performance of both Oppenheimer and Barbie, total market box office on Saturday and Sunday was the highest ever recorded.
Mexico is eyeing $4.5M in the frame this weekend, the biggest non-superhero Nolan opening there, 84% above Interstellar and more than double Tenet, Dunkirk and Inception excluding previews.
Saudi Arabia is looking to reach $3.9M for the frame, the 2nd biggest weekend ever (only behind Spider-Man: No Way Home) and easily the top start of 2023.
Brazil is on track to open with $2.5M this session, which would be the biggest opening weekend for a non-superhero Nolan film.
Netherlands on Saturday overtook Barbie for No.1, delivering the biggest opening Saturday for a Nolan film and the 2nd biggest Saturday of 2023 (behind Super Mario). Through today, the estimate is $2.4M, Nolan’s best ever opening weekend.
Other market cume estimates through Sunday include Indonesia ($1.8M), Hong Kong ($1.8M) and Belgium ($1.3M).
Further of note, this weekend’s business is propelling Universal across $3B global for the year, the second studio to achieve the box office milestone in 2023. This marks the ninth time the studio has reached the threshold and only the fourth time any studio has reached $3 billion worldwide since 2019.
Of the top 10 highest grossing opening weekends at the 2023 global, domestic and international box office, Universal has released three including Illumination’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Oppenheimer and Fast X.
Along with the Barbenheimer effect and exhibition leaning into the phenomenon, kudos also go to the individual studios. Warner Bros gave Barbie a vast neon pink international campaign. Talent traveled to Australia, Korea, Mexico and London (only missing Berlin because of the strike). Universal kicked off an Oppenheimer tour in Paris in mid-July with talent walking the red carpet at the capital’s landmark cinema the Grand Rex, along with a junket before heading to London for simultaneous screenings in Leicester Square and at BFI IMAX. The actors ended up leaving early from the former, in solidarity as the SAG-AFTRA strike was called.
Looking at the holds, Paramount/Skydance’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One may have lost some momentum amid the Barbenheimer double-bill, but let’s recall that Tom Cruise himself encouraged moviegoers to see both this weekend’s movies, in effect launching a star-endorsed love-in for the expanded marketplace. M:I7 in its second frame grossed $55M from 71 markets for an overseas cume of $252.1M. Global is $371M. Significantly, the film debuted in Japan this weekend at No. 1 with $7.9M – that’s 23% above Mission: Impossible – Fallout.
China is the top offshore market at $40.6M, followed by Korea ($23.5M and No. 1 this frame), the UK ($21.1M), India ($13.2M) and France ($12.9M).
Also showing continued strength, Disney/Pixar’s Elemental is now eyeing at least a $430M global gross. It sat behind M:I7 this weekend in Korea, but is still on fire there with $38.4M to date in the market. Overall, an $18.3M international weekend from 51 markets (-37% versus last session) has brought it to a $219.4M running cume overseas and $356.6M global. Korea really is a standout where it has passed Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 to become the highest grossing studio movie released during 2023 to date as well as Pixar’s all-time highest grossing movie there (surpassing Inside Out). Japan is still to come in August. Mexico is the next best play at $18.2M, followed by China ($15.8M), France ($14M) and Brazil ($12.2M).
Screen Gems/Stage 6 Films/Blumhouse’s Insidious: The Red Door made $12M this weekend for an international cume of $84.8M to push its worldwide total to $155.8M. The Top 5 are Mexico ($12.3M), the UK ($8.4M), Philippines ($6.7M), Indonesia ($5.4M) and France ($4.1M).
Disney/Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny for its part is now at $335M global, with $176M coming from overseas. The current frame was worth $8.2M from 52 material markets. The offshore hold was -54%; there’s some uptick here (as with other movies in release) given the expanded marketplace that had folks turning up to cinemas in droves. Top 5 here are UK ($23M), France ($18.2M), Japan ($15.2M), Germany ($11.5M) and Spain ($10.6M).
Local Chinese pic Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms was new this session, debuting to an estimated $53M.
MISC UPDATED CUMES/NOTABLE
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (SNY): $2.9M intl weekend (63 markets); $300.2M intl cume/$675.4M global
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (PAR): $1.6M intl weekend (56 markets); $271.5M intl cume/$427.1M global

PREVIOUS, SATURDAY: Audiences at the domestic, global and international box office this weekend are going bonkers for Barbenheimer. Warner Bros’ Barbie is now poised for an estimated $300M+ worldwide start through tomorrow (eyeing $150M+ each, from North America and a combined 69 overseas markets). Meanwhile, Universal’s Oppenheimer is now pegged for a $165.9M worldwide bow through Sunday, including $88.9M internationally.
These figures are, for both titles, beyond expectations, confirming that there’s room and a desire for a diverse quality offering at global turnstiles.
Looking at Barbie’s trajectory, the Friday on the Greta Gerwig-directed film was its best day so far internationally with $43M on 25,451 screens from 69 markets. The overseas cume through Friday is $88.4M.
Yesterday’s newcomers included the UK which grossed $8.3M from 1,703 screens. This was a No. 1 launch with a 60% share of the Top 5 films. The Margot Robbie- and Ryan Gosling-starrer logged the best opening day since the pandemic and the 3rd biggest Friday for a WB film ever behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 and Batman V Superman.
Along with the massive start in the UK, Latin America continues to overperform with Mexico leading all play through Friday at $11.2M.
In new records, Barbie debuted to the best score ever for a Warner Bros movie in Poland.
In China, where we really didn’t expect anything significant, Barbie opened amid a slew of local titles with $1.2M and (not included in the total above) is at $4M through Saturday. It has a 9.4 from audiences on Maoyan (note that this strangely appears to be the same score for a number of recent Hollywood titles that haven’t converted to big box office).
Also of note, family-leaning Brazil, which has grossed $8.9M through Friday, is seeing unprecedented and unusual showtimes added by exhibition. We also hear that Australia on Saturday positively skyrocketed.
As for Christopher Nolan’s Cillian Murphy-led Oppenheimer, the estimated overseas launch of $88.9M would mark the filmmaker’s 3rd highest grossing opening weekend ever, behind only The Dark Knight Rises ($131M) and The Dark Knight ($94M).
What’s more, the $166M worldwide projection through Sunday would mark the biggest global day-and-date debut for a biographical film, overtaking Bohemian Rhapsody ($124M) and the top worldwide start for a drama since 2019.
In other milestones for Nolan, he’s also seeing his biggest launch day of all time in 33 markets including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, India, Netherlands, Argentina and Belgium; as well as the 2nd biggest opening day in six markets including Germany, Brazil and UK/Ireland; and the top day-one start for a non-Nolan Batman title in 46 markets including Australia, France and Mexico.
Market highlights include the UK where Oppenheimer opened to $4.2M on Friday. That’s 14% higher than Dunkirk, which we thought might have had an edge given its UK-centric story. The start was the 2nd biggest Friday ever for a Nolan film and the biggest opening Friday for a non-superhero Nolan film as well as the 10th biggest Universal opening day of all time.
Fifty-two IMAX and 70mm IMAX screens took 19% share of the Friday total in the UK with top site BFI IMAX’s Friday gross the biggest ever result for that cinema.
In France, Oppenheimer is at a running total of $3.5M through Friday, performing above most Nolan comps. Germany has reached a running total of $2.8M through yesterday; Saudi Arabia is at $2.6M and Mexico has reached a running total of $1.9M. In the latter, this is the biggest Nolan opening in IMAX with performance in the format 15% ahead of Spider-Man: No Way Home and just 13% below Avengers: Infinity War.
We will have a full rundown on Sunday.
PREVIOUS, FRIDAY: Barbenheimer has begun. With Warner Bros’ Barbie and Universal’s Oppenheimer rolling out globally this weekend, we’ve got the first numbers for both from their various international box office markets through the first two days of release.
As expected, the Greta Gerwig-directed Barbie is coming out on top with $41.4M through Thursday in 51 markets. Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is also thriving with $15.9M across its first 57 markets through Thursday. Both are breaking various records.
It’s important to remember that these movies are not direct comps to one another, with runtimes and demos differing. Still, we’re in what is hoped to be an expanded marketplace situation that encourages moviegoing and benefits from the Barbenheimer phenom (although Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One may end up taking a breath this frame, it was still tops in Korea today).
So let’s take a closer look at the Barbie and Oppenheimer numbers across their first two days internationally.
Barbie, through Thursday, is in release in 51 offshore markets, and has shattered a number of records. Thursday alone was worth $31.8M on 15,700 screens – that is simply a hugely impressive number. An additional 18 markets are opening today, including the UK and China (in the latter, and not included in the totals above, the movie did approximately $1.2M on Friday).
The top-grossing market to date is Mexico with $6.4M, logging the biggest opening day for a Warner Bros film ever. It is also the 2nd biggest opening day of 2023, and the 3rd biggest opening day post-pandemic (wow!).
Brazil dominated Thursday at No.1 with $4.9M and an 84% market share of Top 5 films, and is the biggest opening day ever for a WB title, the biggest opening day post-pandemic ahead of Spider-Man: No Way Home, the biggest opening day of 2023 ahead of both Fast X and The Super Mario Bros Movie, and the 2nd biggest opening day of all time, only behind Avengers: Endgame.
France, which unboxed the doll very strongly on Wednesday, has grossed $4.5M while Australia (also a Wednesday opener) amassed $3.4M through Thursday. The latter gave it a dominant No. 1 with a 60% share of the Top 10 films. Results in Oz are tracking well ahead of all comps, and even came in 5% above Avatar: The Way of Water (another wow!). It scored the biggest opening day of 2023 at more than double Super Mario.
Italy and Germany round out the Top 5 grossers to date with $2.4M apiece.
Looking at regions, Barbie had the biggest opening day of all time for a WB film in 13 Latin America markets, and was the biggest industry opening day ever in Argentina ($1.2M) and Colombia ($1.5M). It was also the biggest industry opening day of 2023 regionally and in eight markets. The doll further scored the 4th biggest opening day ever regionally behind Avengers: Endgame, Avengers: Infinity War and Spider-Man: No Way Home.
Elsewhere, Barbie saw the biggest opening day of all time for a WB title in Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia. And in Denmark, it clocked the biggest opening day for a WB film in 13 years while Portugal had the 2nd biggest opening ever for a WB title behind only Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.
As regards Christopher Nolan’s epic Oppenheimer, yesterday added 47 offshore markets. The Cillian Murphy-starrer will be out in a total 78 through today.
Nolan started racking up milestones on Wednesday with Oppenheimer (see below), and has now logged his biggest opening day in 23 markets including Saudi Arabia and the UAE as well as the Middle East as a whole, Netherlands and Colombia. Thursday was further the No. 2 biggest Nolan opening day in Germany, Brazil, Peru and Ecuador and his best non-Batman start in 30 markets including Germany, Australia, France, Mexico and Brazil.
Also, Oppenheimer, which was filmed with IMAX cameras, captured the best opening day ever for the format in Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Bahrain, Oman, Argentina, Mexico and Chile.
Breaking down the Thursday openers, Saudi Arabia launched to No. 1 with $1.5M for the 2nd biggest opening day of all time (behind Spider-Man: No Way Home) and the biggest opening day of 2023 (85% above Fast X), also more than double the opening Thursday of MI:7.
Australia, where Oppenheimer opened as the widest ever release for a Nolan film in 296 locations, scored $1.1M on Thursday – for Nolan, only topped by The Dark Knight Rises.
Germany debuted to No. 1 with $1.3M, more than double Dunkirk, Interstellar and Tenet.
Mexico bowed with $900K on Thursday, more than double the Friday openings of Dunkirk, Interstellar and Tenet, and well above the first Thursday for MI:7. It is the widest IMAX footprint for a Nolan title and achieved the 3rd biggest IMAX opening day of all time (behind Avengers: Endgame and Infinity War) and the biggest IMAX opening day for a Nolan film, far outperforming Tenet, Interstellar and Dunkirk.
Spain opened with $700K on Thursday and is the biggest IMAX opening day of 2023. Reactions are strong, with a very high 8 audience score on FilmAffinity, placing it within the Top 10 films of this century (yeah, again, wow!).
Brazil opened with $488K on Thursday, followed by Netherlands with an estimated $485K at No. 1 and delivering the biggest opening Thursday ever for a Nolan film. Oppenheimer also achieved the biggest IMAX opening Thursday for a Nolan film, also beating Top Gun Maverick (+23%), Avengers: Infinity War (+18%), Avatar 2 (+114%) and MI:7 (+232%).
Hong Kong too launched at No.1, with $340K on Thursday. This is the 2nd biggest IMAX opening day ever (only behind Endgame).
Other impressive Thursday starts include Denmark ($328K – biggest opening day ever for a Nolan film) and Colombia ($236K – biggest opening day for a Nolan film and biggest Thursday total box office of all time).
After debuting on Wednesday, France added $1M on Thursday for a running total of $2.4M. Indonesia added $209K on Thursday for a running total of $661K. Thursday’s result makes it the biggest Thursday gross ever for a Nolan film and the 3rd biggest Thursday of all time in the market. Belgium added $211k on Thursday for a running total of $462K. Philippines added $107K on Thursday for a running total of $232K.
We’ll have much more throughout the weekend…
PREVIOUS, THURSDAY: Christopher Nolan’s highly-anticipated and highly-reviewed Oppenheimer has begun overseas rollout with strong results versus some of the director’s previous titles. On Wednesday, the Universal film opened in 10 offshore markets, grossing $2.4M and led by France and Indonesia. These are early days as the critically-lauded Cillian Murphy-led biographical drama/political thriller will be playing a total 78 markets through Friday, across over 9,600 locations, 13,000 screens, and more than 320 IMAX screens.
While we wait for the full onslaught of the much-anticipated “Barbenheimer” double-bill this weekend, and will have a fuller picture including Warner Bros’ Barbie tomorrow, we already have initial international box office numbers for Oppenheimer, the story of the building of the atomic bomb, and the resultant aftermath.
In France, Oppenheimer debuted to $1.4M o Wednesday from 725 screens including 18 IMAX and two 70mm screens, as well as 11 Dolby Vision and six ultra-laser Kinepolis screens. The launch day is the biggest opening Wednesday for a Nolan film since The Dark Knight Rises. Excluding previews, the Wednesday admissions are above MI:7 (+23%), Dunkirk (+14%), Tenet (+28%) and Interstellar (+76%). Audience reactions are highly positive with mainstream audiences rating it 4.4/5 and cinephile audiences rating it 7.3/10, one of the top ratings for the market.
Indonesia bowed Wednesday with an estimated $451K to mark the biggest opening day ever for a Nolan film (38% ahead of The Dark Knight Rises). IMAX delivered the biggest opening day ever in the format and the biggest single day gross in IMAX, beating Avatar 2 (+11%). Oppenheimer is playing across 10 IMAX screens and a total of 495 screens in the market. Wednesday was a public holiday in Indonesia for Islamic New Year.
Belgium opened with $251K on Wednesday, the biggest start ever for a Nolan film in the market, beating The Dark Knight Rises (+13%), Inception (+23%) and The Dark Knight (+31%) as well as all other key comps.
Philippines launched with $125K on Wednesday, the top opening day ever for a non-superhero Nolan film. Oppenheimer played across nine IMAX screens and in a total of 198 screens.
Egypt had a terrific start at $74K on Wednesday with Oppenheimer delivering the 2nd biggest opening day for any studio movie since the pandemic hit, only behind Spider-Man: No Way Home. It also easily achieved the biggest Hollywood opening day of the year, more than double Fast X and the 7th biggest MPA opening day of all time in admissions, +18% above Avengers: Infinity War.
Switzerland (French-speaking) grossed $70K on opening Wednesday, more than double the launch days of Tenet and Batman Begins, above Dunkirk (+29%), Interstellar (+46%) and recent opener MI:7 (+8%).
The film also had a strong start in Iceland ($31K) for the top Nolan start outside the Batman series.
Among majors, today the film opens in Australia, Germany, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Brazil with the UK, Spain and India following on Friday.
In terms of presales, UK/Ireland is seeing strong uptake with PLFs repping a significant portion and sell-out shows across opening weekend; Germany’s IMAX presales are above Universal’s own Fast X, Jurassic World Dominion and Fast & Furious 9. In Saudi Arabia, presales are wild, currently tracking an estimated 32x greater than Fast X at the same point in time and setting a new record.
We will have much more to come throughout the weekend…",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3L2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1iYXJiZW5oZWltZXItY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktbWFyZ290LXJvYmJpZS1yeWFuLWdvc2xpbmctZ2xvYWJsLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYm94LW9mZmljZS0xMjM1NDQzMTgwL9IBqAFodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3L2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1iYXJiZW5oZWltZXItY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktbWFyZ290LXJvYmJpZS1yeWFuLWdvc2xpbmctZ2xvYWJsLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYm94LW9mZmljZS0xMjM1NDQzMTgwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-23 15:24:46+00:00,The ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ Double Feature Left Me Questioning Reality Itself,"‘Barbenheimer,’ the ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ double feature, is an exhausting spiritual journey that left me questioning reality itself.","The double feature is something of a bygone pleasure. Sure, repertory theaters will curate stacked showings of classic fare or art house favorites for the cultured cinephile in us, but the first-run double — one you might randomly drop into knowing little about either movie — seems the relic of a time when we had more hours to kill, and fewer screens to distract us from that magical silver one.
It is perhaps not entirely a coincidence that this era, the middle of the 20th century, also transformed the United States into the global superpower it has been ever since, through military and material triumph: we ended World War II, and economic prosperity followed in suburbs, superhighways, and space-age appliances. These, of course, are the broad strokes that connect Christopher Nolan’s harrowing biopic Oppenheimer, focused on the “father of the atomic bomb,” and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, which tackles similar questions of identity, legacy, and complicity with equal vigor. Released together on July 21, they probably looked like ideal counterprogramming for their respective distributors, Universal and Warner Bros. Would anyone interested in a three-hour epic about the scientific race to develop weapons of mass destruction want to see a famous doll brought to life in a candy-colored fantasy, or vice versa?
Now, of course, we know the answer: the “Barbenheimer” bill, far from remaining a speculative meme, became a viable dare that many people embraced. The National Association of Theater Owners, who amazingly go by NATO, reported that some 200,000 customers had already booked tickets to watch these films consecutively on the same day — a significant core of committed lunatics who trusted in the potential for a dialogue between disparate subjects and styles. I say “lunatic” because not even Hollywood’s most extreme theater evangelist, Tom Cruise, was in for the potential whiplash, announcing that he instead planned to see Oppenheimer on Friday, then wait until Saturday for Barbie. When a guy who drives motorcycles off cliffs for your entertainment isn’t up for a stunt, it must be serious. Editor’s picks
So I did feel somewhat braver than Tom when I strapped in for a rather full 10:30 am Friday showing of Oppenheimer in IMAX at Los Angeles’ Westfield Century City mall. As if to confirm a stereotype about Nolan’s fanbase, I was seated between two other gangly white dudes also there alone, but after AMC’s requisite 25 minutes of trailers, Nicole Kidman’s iconic ad for the chain got a reception much warmer than I expected, given the muted crowd — an indication, I think, that no one expected to laugh or smile much during the saga to come.
The structure of Oppenheimer is wildly ambitious, skipping around (and splicing different moments of) time in a purposefully disorienting fashion that has become one of Nolan’s calling cards. Here, the fractured chronology reflects the menacing, uncanny genius of its main character, a theoretical physicist who can intuit the quantum paradoxes undergirding what we incorrectly regard as stable, solid truths. As J. Robert Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy is given to haunted stares that carry the curse of prophetic power — he is taking in the full range of possible futures. Meanwhile, Nolan gives us frenetic breaks into abstract geometry, swirling atoms, a universe coming apart at the invisible seams. Nature is almost scarier than the bomb.
The effect this has when your ass is gradually going numb and your bladder is steadily filling up over the course of a 180-minute runtime should not be discounted as part of the Oppenheimer vibe. Our protagonist drifts through memories and misunderstandings of himself, desperate to preserve a semblance of humanity that allows him to survive; we in the theater struggle to maintain mental and bodily autonomy in the face of apocalyptic power. It’s fascinating that Nolan, who has often destabilized viewers’ grasp on reality with impossible action set pieces (Inception, Tenet), here accomplishes the same with scenes where people sit around and argue. Whatever your quibbles with the film — which I would rank among his very best — you can’t argue with the staggering suspense that leads toward detonation. You will be holding your breath along with the scientists at Los Alamos. Related
Duly shaken by this story, and the recognition that I was born into its aftermath, I had trouble coming back to my senses. A bustling mall did not make for the easiest reentry into linear consciousness, either. Thankfully, a quick lunch at Panda Express proved suitably mundane to bring me down to earth, and afterward, I met up at a bar with my friend Anna, who would join me for that afternoon’s screening of Barbie and, like dozens milling around the area, was wearing pink for the occasion. Over beers, I gave her a poor synopsis of what had transpired that morning, lingering on the hyped sex scenes — was Oppenheimer really such a fuckboy? — and we headed over to the multiplex, where I hoped I would not have to endure the shame of showing my next ticket to the same employee who scanned me in before.
I didn’t, but in the concessions area, I noticed that the combined force of these summer blockbusters was already taking its toll: more popcorn on the ground, and several soda fountains were out of ice. It was as if the place were subject to its own kind of fission, one that could release intense energy if not brought under control. On Reddit, theater employees have braced for this weekend like you would a hurricane, expecting huge business to result in punishing work shifts. Saturday, a fire alarm at the AMC Burbank 16 caused an evacuation and cascading entropy.
Audiences, for their part, were always bound to approach the alignment of Oppenheimer and Barbie as a battle royale event, dispensing with the usual etiquette if it meant optimizing your experience. I was dismayed to find that a family had shamelessly claimed my well-chosen seat for the latter, and, not wanting to eject a child from it, went away in search of an unoccupied chair, mumbling about the collapse of civilized order. Of course, when I had to settle for a place in the wheelchair-accessible row, I felt like part of the problem.
Barbie at first held out the potential for sheer escapism, and make no mistake: hot actors goofing around is a decent salve after sitting through the Manhattan Project. I hardly noticed how cheap Chinese food, Twizzlers, and Coca-Cola were churning together in my gut. Alas, narrative requires conflict, and after we are introduced to Barbieland in its idealized form, our flawless heroine (Margot Robbie) blurts out an intrusive thought that brings her latest blowout dance party to a screeching halt: “Do you guys ever think about dying?”
It’s a hilariously-pitched non-sequitur in the context of Gerwig’s feminist fable, but, having indeed spent the first half of my day mulling death, “the destroyer of worlds,” I had the eerie sense that Barbie could read my mind, and knew I was having trouble moving from the inferno of Oppenheimer into the utopian post-war dreamscape she is supposed to inhabit. From there, Barbie continues to pull the rug out, next invoking a Möbius strip-like continuum that bridges the realm of the dolls and our own existence. Here, the cinematic parallels are even stronger, as Barbie’s script winkingly encourages us not to overanalyze the concept, which is exactly how Nolan has managed to vanquish our disbelief in things like dream-hacking and time inversion. (Although the idea of a portal that allows Barbie and Ken to travel to the grimy Venice Beach boardwalk, and the exact area of L.A. where I was watching the movie, is more in the vein of Interstellar‘s cosmic hall of mirrors.)
Barbie is ultimately on a journey as profound as Oppenheimer’s. While he becomes a reluctant god of annihilation, she meets her own creator and has to choose whether to remain an immortal creation or accept both the pain and bliss of embodiment. And, like Oppenheimer’s chalkboards, womanhood as discussed in Barbie is a nest of contradictions — the other Barbies, brainwashed by Ken when he brings toxic masculinity back to their neighborhood from our patriarchal society, can only be reawakened when they are reminded of this. The process of self-discovery has everything to do with acknowledging the unsolvable problem of being alive.
Beyond these films’ pointed critique of men and their best-laid plans, in tandem they produce a philosophical text that distorts and subverts the ways we interpret all that surrounds us, and all that is within us. It’s no wonder that on Friday evening, out with friends, I kept finding myself lapsing into silence, unsure of how to talk, questioning the validity of whatever floated into my head, like Barbie trying to apprehend her image, or Oppenheimer wrestling with his conscience. The gauntlet had lasted only six hours plus intermission, yet I was spiritually exhausted. And still couldn’t quite believe that Barbie included a throwaway Stephen Malkmus reference. Something genuinely strange had happened to me.
Knowing what I do now, would I have nonetheless subjected myself to this accidental double feature? Absolutely. We shall never see its like again, and you have to seize that opportunity. I’m willing to admit, however, that Tom Cruise’s schedule was a bit more reasonable. Either movie by itself is enough. The fusion is straight-up nuclear.

2023-08-01 19:48:18+00:00,"Oliver Stone Turned Down an Oppenheimer Movie, Calls Christopher Nolan’s Film a ‘Classic’ He ‘Never Believed Could Be Made in This Climate’",Oliver Stone reveals he once turned down making a film about Oppenheimer because he couldn't crack the narrative like Christopher Nolan now has.,"Many reviews for Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer” noted that the film felt like the director’s own version of Oliver Stone‘s sprawling historical epic “JFK,” and now Stone himself has weighed in on Nolan’s latest achievement. The “Platoon” Oscar winner took to social media to deem Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” a new film classic, while also revealing he flirted with making his own film in the past about theoretical physicist and “father of the atomic bomb” J. Robert Oppenheimer.
“I sat through 3 hours of ‘Oppenheimer,’ gripped by Chris Nolan’s narrative,” Stone wrote. “His screenplay is layered and fascinating. Familiar with the book by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, I once turned the project down because I couldn’t find my way to its essence. Nolan has found it.”
“His direction is mind-boggling and eye-popping as he takes reams of incident and cycles it into an exciting torrent of action inside all the talk,” Stone continued. “Each actor is a surprise to me, especially Cillian Murphy, whose exaggerated eyes here feel normal playing a genius like Oppenheimer.”
“‘Oppenheimer’ is a classic, which I never believed could be made in this climate,” Stone concluded. “Bravo.”
Stone is far from the only prolific director to publicly praise Nolan’s epic. Before “Oppenheimer” released in theaters, Paul Schrader posted a rave reaction on social media. The “Taxi Driver” writer called Nolan’s film “the best, most important film of this century.”
“If you see one film in cinemas this year it should be ‘Oppenheimer,’” Schrader added. “I’m not a Nolan groupie but this one blows the door off the hinges.”
“Oppenheimer” has since become a box office blockbuster despite its three-hour runtime and R rating. The film has already surpassed $400 million at the worldwide box office in under two weeks of release. It’s now playing nationwide courtesy of Universal Pictures.

About Oppenheimer
Oppenheimer, which follows physicist J Robert Oppenheimer's work and life, is a biopic set during the Second World War. Robert Oppenheimer helped invent nuclear weapons during that time. He was known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb. The film is set during a period in history when he understood that testing the atomic bomb would destroy the world but that didn't stop him from pushing the button.
Oppenheimer India box office collection
According to a Sacnilk.com report, Oppenheimer earned ₹17.25 crore nett in India on the third day of its release for all languages as per early estimates. The film minted ₹14.50 crore on day one of its release and ₹17.25 crore on the second day of its release. Currently, the total earnings of Oppenheimer stand at ₹49 crore. Oppenheimer released on the same day in theatres as Barbie in the biggest clash of Hollywood summer blockbusters.
Cast of Oppenheimer
In Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy essayed the lead role, Emily Blunt was seen as his wife, Katherine Oppenheimer. Matt Damon played the role of General Leslie Groves, the head of the Manhattan Project. Robert Downey Jr played Lewis Strauss, a senior member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Florence Pugh, Casey Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kenneth Branagh and Rami Malek also feature in the film.
Oppenheimer earnings in US
According to an AFP report, Oppenheimer earned $80.5 million in revenue in North American box offices while Barbie raked in $155 million. The coincidental same-day release of the two starkly different but highly anticipated films created a bottom-up pop-culture phenomenon that transcended the individual marketing for either.

Christopher Nolan has described the visceral reactions of some people who have seen his latest film, Oppenheimer.
The biographical movie stars Cillian Murphy as the eponymous J Robert Oppenheimer, known as the “father of the atomic bomb”, and is due to be released on 21 July.
“Some people leave the movie absolutely devastated,” Nolan said about early screenings in a new interview with Wired magazine.
“They can’t speak. I mean, there’s an element of fear that’s there in the history and there in the underpinnings. But the love of the characters, the love of the relationships, is as strong as I’ve ever done.”
The 52-year-old British-American director added: “It is an intense experience because it’s an intense story. I showed it to a filmmaker recently who said it’s kind of a horror movie. I don’t disagree.”
Nolan even admitted that he was “relieved to be finished” with the project due to the emotional toll it took.
“As I started to finish the film, I started to feel this colour that’s not in my other films, just darkness. It’s there. The film fights against that,” he said.

Earlier this week, the historian who wrote the 2005 biography on which Oppenheimer is based said he was still “emotionally recovering” from watching the film.
The biographer, Kai Bird, who co-authored American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, said: “I think it is going to be a stunning artistic achievement, and I have hopes it will actually stimulate a national, even global conversation about the issues that Oppenheimer was desperate to speak out about – about how to live in the atomic age, how to live with the bomb and about McCarthyism – what it means to be a patriot, and what is the role for a scientist in a society drenched with technology and science, to speak out about public issues.”

,Will Cillian Murphy win the Oscar? Predicting Oppenheimer awards chances,"'Oppenheimer' will dominate awards season, as Christopher Nolan's new movie could become his first film with multiple acting nominations in the Oscars acting categories for Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt.","Oppenheimer is big, it's loud, it takes place during World War II, it's about powerful white men blowing stuff up and then feeling a little sad about it — and, to top it off, it's three hours long. While it might put some moviegoers' patience (and bladders) to the test, Christopher Nolan's new movie is everything the traditional, old-school sector of the Academy wants in a big-budget spectacle, and their hearts are about to explode in favor of the historical drama across the awards season ahead.
While the film's runtime might be a dealbreaker for casual audience members, especially given its bleak subject matter, even the most disinterested viewer will appreciate the prowess of the film's central performances.
'Oppenheimer' Oscars predictions. Universal Pictures
Oppenheimer is likely to become Nolan's first-ever film to garner multiple acting nods, 15 years after the late Dark Knight star Heath Ledger scored the sole acting nod (and subsequent win) among the director's multi-year filmography. Led by Cillian Murphy's performance as the titular physicist, the film follows Oppenheimer as he wrestles personal ambitions with an internal moral dilemma over fathering the atomic bombs that the United States would eventually use to kill tens of thousands in two Japanese cities at the end of World War II. Murphy masterfully scales Oppenheimer's mental acrobatics en route to what will go down as the performance of his career.
Emily Blunt lights ablaze the role of the dutiful wife, which could've fallen flat if she stuck to what was written on the page. Blunt, who's shockingly never been nominated for an Oscar, makes the most of Kitty Oppenheimer's scenes, which mostly see her guzzling liquor from a flask, standing behind her husband's pursuits, and reluctantly raising their children on her own. It all culminates, though, in a searing close-up scene toward the end of the film that drew applause from the audience at a preview screening in New York City, as Blunt vents all of Kitty's pent-up rage.

As for Florence Pugh, who plays Oppenheimer's former lover, Jean Tatlock, she ferociously sinks her teeth into the minimal material she has to work with, but her blink-and-you'll-miss-it screentime could work against her this season, especially in the context of a three-hour production.
And then there's Robert Downey Jr. Yes, Iron Man is in Oppenheimer, and it might take you a moment to recognize him as the controversial Lewis Strauss, a member of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission who had a hand in revoking Oppenheimer's security clearance after his time with the Manhattan Project ended. Downey's performance is the kind of supporting turn Hollywood goes nuts for: a beloved, blockbuster staple chewing scenery, showboating, and transforming (he's bald, aged, and bespectacled here) right before our very eyes. If SAG-AFTRA ends its strike and holds a ceremony this year, expect his fellow actors to gobble this performance right up.

While it feels like three of the film's performances could easily coast through the race, there's a case to be made for Matt Damon's turn as Manhattan Project director Lieutenant General Leslie Richard Groves Jr., whose mustachioed, gruff-with-a-heart-of-gold gusto provides some levity, and don't be surprised if Josh Hartnett — whose mini renaissance this year also included a role in Netflix's Black Mirror — creeps into the conversation, too.
While multiple acting nominations are a possibility, more assured category placements for Oppenheimer are in the technical categories. You'd be smart to bet on the film winning the Oscar for Best Sound, a race that it has locked up seven months before the 2024 Academy Awards ceremony for the orchestration of the atomic bomb testing sequence alone. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema (who worked with Nolan on Interstellar, Dunkirk, and Tenet) also facilitates our immersion into Oppenheimer's psyche in stunning fashion, adding a profound layer to the story that won't be ignored by his fellow DPs on the circuit.
Tying it all together, Oppenheimer will probably be this year's most obviously ""stacked"" Oscar player, with projected support from all of the Academy's individual branches, from technical artisans to the actors and directors, all aligning when it comes time to rank Best Picture votes on the preferential ballot. In pieces, the film represents top-tier filmmaking from its lensing to its on-camera performers, and cinematic chemistry like that points to a scorching ignition of support in the hunt for Oscars.
Oppenheimer is now playing in theaters nationwide.

,July 28 panel to discuss Robert Oppenheimer's Berkeley years,Add description here,"UPDATE (8/7/23): The panel discussion is now online on YouTube.
The story behind the summer blockbuster movie Oppenheimer, which opens across the nation on Friday, July 21, began at the University of California, Berkeley.
A 25-year-old J. Robert Oppenheimer arrived at UC Berkeley in fall 1929 as an assistant professor, and over the next dozen years established one of the greatest schools of theoretical physics in the U.S. — one that continues to this day. He made UC Berkeley’s physics department the center of American thought about the new field of quantum mechanics and how to apply it to atoms, nuclei and even neutron stars.He and Ernest O. Lawrence, who made the campus the go-to place for experimental particle physics with his work on the atom-smashing cyclotron, were instrumental in raising the alarm that the Germans could be trying to develop an atomic bomb, and that the U.S. should do the same.The three-hour movie, directed by Christopher Nolan and partly filmed at UC Berkeley, follows Oppenheimer through his leadership of the Manhattan Project to develop the first nuclear weapons and his subsequent humiliation when the Atomic Energy Commission stripped him of his security clearance in 1954 because of claims that he was a Communist sympathizer and an unreliable adviser.To provide a different perspective on that history, four UC Berkeley faculty members and a nuclear physicist from Los Alamos National Laboratory will assemble for a panel discussion at 11:30 a.m. on Friday, July 28, to discuss Oppenheimer's pre-war UC Berkeley years and his scientific and human legacy.
The public can register here for the in-person-only event in Chevron Auditorium at International House in Berkeley.
Christopher Nolan brought his film crew to UC Berkeley in May 2022 to film scenes for the movie Oppenheimer, opening July 21, 2023, across the U.S. Along Campanile Way, cast members seen in 1930s attire include Josh Hartnett (gray suit) playing Berkeley professor E. O. Lawrence, and Cillian Murphy (brown suit, seen from rear), playing J. Robert Oppenheimer, the Berkeley theoretical physicist who led the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb.

The discussion will be moderated by Cathryn Carson , UC Berkeley professor of history and a specialist in the history of 20th century physics, including its cultural, social and political contexts. She co-edited a volume of papers about Oppenheimer, Reappraising Oppenheimer: Centennial Studies and Reflections, that was presented during a 2004 conference celebrating the 100th anniversary of his birth.
Carson will be joined by Jon Else, UC Berkeley professor emeritus of journalism and longtime director of the documentary program at UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism. Else directed the 1981 documentary, The Day After Trinity: J. Robert Oppenheimer and the Atomic Bomb, which was the first documentary about Oppenheimer's role in the Manhattan Project. Trinity was Oppenheimer's name for the first-ever test of an atom bomb, which lit up the night sky in the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945.
The participants in the July 28 panel are Cathryn Carson, Mark Chadwick, Jon Else, Yasunori Nomura and Karl van Bibber.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iZXJrZWxleS5lZHUvMjAyMy8wNy8yMC9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1qdWx5LTI4LXBhbmVsLWRpc2N1c3Npb24tZm9jdXNlcy1vbi10aGUtbWFuLWJlaGluZC10aGUtbW92aWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Herbal cigarettes may not be full of poison, but they're not exactly health boosters either.
Cillian Murphy won't be quitting the world of acting anytime soon. But what he has decided to quit — at least for a while — is the act of fake smoking.
Recently catching up with The Guardian, Murphy confessed that his time playing Birmingham gang leader Thomas Shelby (Peaky Blinders) and Manhattan Project physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer) gave him enough faux tobacco for a lifetime. While prop cigarettes don't contain the harmful and known carcinogenic ingredients found in the real thing, they're not exactly health boosters either, per the National Library of Medicine.

Why Cillian Murphy is done playing smokers for a while
""My next character will not be a smoker,"" the actor declared. ""They can’t be good for you. Even herbal cigarettes have health warnings now.""
Nevertheless, feigning the existence of a lifelong nicotine addict was absolutely essential to playing Doctor Oppenheimer, who was almost aways seen with a cigarette or pipe in his hand. ""He would alternate between the two. That’s what did for him in the end,” Murphy explained, alluding to the fact that the real Oppenheimer died of throat cancer at the age of 62 in early 1967.
Written, directed, and produced by Nolan, the atomic bomb thriller tracks the development, creation, and aftermath of America's race to split the atom ahead of the Nazis and bring a swift end to the Second World War.
Oppenheimer proved instrumental in the project's success, though he ultimately came to regret his involvement and was blacklisted as a result. His famous quote upon witnessing the first atomic blast — ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"" — denoted the existential horror he felt at placing such an awesome power into the hands of a species known for waging one conflict after another. And he was correct to give voice to such dread as the threat of nuclear annihilation came to define the entire second half of the 20th century.

2023-08-17 15:19:46+00:00,REVIEW: Murphy and Nolan go big in “Oppenheimer”,,"When I think of Christopher Nolan I think of four things: Giant scale, loud music, Michael Caine showing up for at least a little bit and dense plots that sometimes border on the needlessly complicated.
Until now the highly respected director has stuck to fiction, be it of the superhero, science or cerebral thriller varieties, but it was only a matter of time before he applied at least a couple of these four calling cards to nonfiction.
And while it is oddly lacking in Michael Caine, the other three are all there in Oppenheimer, a sprawling look at the father of the atomic bomb that is dense and exhausting but also thoroughly impressive from a filmmaking standpoint, not to mention engaging and entertaining.
Clocking in at exactly three hours, Oppenheimer is sometimes a lot to take in. It is chock full of science talk and political maneuvering, a relentless and headache-inducing combination that often made me feel as if I was just barely understanding the bare basics of what was going on.
Compounding this is a massive and somewhat bloated roster of characters played by what must have been half of the people currently working in Hollywood, as well as a non-linear style of storytelling that covered several different time periods simultaneously, because heaven forbid Christopher Nolan do anything simply.
Sometimes I got bored. Once or twice I even got frustrated. But the fact of the matter remains: Oppenheimer is still a darn good movie, and it owes a lot of that success to its sheer ambition and scope.
Cillian Murphy is exceptional as J. Robert Oppenheimer, and I appreciate that neither he nor the scriptwriters pretend that the famous scientist was a shining hero that one must aspire to, instead presenting a flawed individual who may have done some good and certainly did a whole lot of bad.
This nuance extends to all of the characters, all of which are portrayed equally as well as “Oppie” himself.
Ludwig Göransson’s soundtrack is both bombastic and creative, underlining even the most mundane events with gravitas and meaning (I particularly enjoyed a track that utilized the clicking of a Geiger counter in its tune).
Nolan’s habit of exclusively using IMAX cameras to film pays off handsomely in Oppenheimer as well, as the film looks breathtaking from start to finish.
It is a challenging film, but the challenge is integral to its success.
The cast may be huge and it may be hard to keep everyone straight, but this just reinforces how monumental and important the creation of the first atomic bomb really was.
It may be full of complicated science and intrigue, but this speaks to the fact that history and the people who make it are messy.
All of this would be meaningless if Oppenheimer wasn’t an engaging and entertaining film, and thankfully it is that as well thanks to its compelling character work, elegant script, and everything else that makes a film worth watching. And if I were to use any phrase to describe Oppenheimer it would be exactly that: Worth watching.
Oppenheimer is now in theaters.
Sharing is caring!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlaXplcnRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4LzE3L3Jldmlldy1tdXJwaHktYW5kLW5vbGFuLWdvLWJpZy1pbi1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,People in stitches at Robert Downey Jr appearing to think Cillian Murphy is a 'niche actor',Fans hopped online to express how they felt about Robert Downey Jr commenting on the celebrity status of Cillian Murphy.,"In news we didn’t think would appear this week, apparently Robert Downey Jr isn’t too sure about who his co-star is.
When doing the promotional rounds to talk about their upcoming Christopher Nolan movie, Oppenheimer, the Iron Man actor seemingly made a blunder about the celebrity status of fellow actor Cillian Murphy.

Tweeted by user Slytherinus, they garnered over 10 million views by sharing this baffling moment for all to see and interpret.
They captioned the interview moment: “Does he think Cillian’s some kind of C tier niche Irish actor?""

He explained to the interviewer: “I think we can feel that about the way that your life changing now as you’re gonna be in front of this huge film and we always have two sets of feelings.
""One is that’s great and maybe I’ll have even more opportunities, and the other is ‘what about my privacy’.”
Having already featured in five previous Nolan hits such as The Dark Knight Trilogy, Dunkirk and Inception, this will mark Murphy's sixth film with the director to date, which might be the reason why fans of Murphy are left scratching their heads.
The video also reached Instagram where other commenters tried to rationalise RDJ’s comments towards the Peaky Blinders star.

A user wrote that 'it’s his first lead in a Nolan movie that’s what he is referring to,' which is quite a sensible assumption compared to the rest, as it’s true.
Other comments across Twitter also echoed the same sentiments, confirming that maybe the Sherlock Holmes actor was talking more so about how big this feature was compared to other works his co-star had been in.
Though, others preferred to bicker in the comments section.

One person wrote that: “This is a milestone in Cillian’s career, he’s never played lead in a film of such calibre.
""He’ll get so much more recognition and love than he already has. Downey has nothing but praise for him, don’t act smart and try to twist his words.”
This comment was quickly met with a differing opinion.
They countered: “I would agree with you if he wasn’t explicitly speaking about him as if he’s literally an undiscovered actor and not a significant actor in the industry that has been in countless Nolan films and the lead of a major TV series.”

Murphy is widely known as Nolan’s favourite supporting actor, having met each other in 2003 when doing the casting calls for the Batman Begins (2005) movie in which Murphy landed the role of tormented psychologist Jonathan Crane or The Scarecrow.
But now it seems as though the Irish actor has been bumped up to the lead at long last, as he explained in an interview with The Associated Press.
Murphy first received the phone call from Nolan where the director told him that he wanted him to be his Oppenheimer, which left the actor in disbelief.
He said that he had 'always said publicly and privately, to Chris, that if I’m available and you want me to be in a movie, I’m there'.
""I don’t really care about the size of the part,” he explained. “But deep down, secretly, I was desperate to play a lead for him.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaWxhZC5jb20vY2VsZWJyaXR5L3JvYmVydC1kb3duZXktanItY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tMTIxMTM5LTIwMjMwNzA50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-20 14:36:43.753000-04:00,Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan Wage War (Against Wigs),"Christopher Nolan avoids using wigs at all costs, and it affected his shooting schedule for ‘Oppenheimer.’ But that’s okay — Cillian Murphy hates them too.","Does Cillian Murphy wear wigs? No. Has Cillian Murphy worn wigs? No. Will Cillian Murphy wear wigs? No. When will Cillian Murphy wear wigs? Never. At least, if Christopher Nolan has anything to do with it. The two have collaborated on six movies together now (counting two cameos in the later Batman films), and there’s a bit of a mind meld happening … or is it a hair meld? The two of them abhor wigs. Christopher Nolan even dictated his shooting schedule around hair, he told the New Time Times. “I did insist on scheduling it around Cillian’s haircut,” Nolan told the Times. “Because I’m very allergic to wigs in movies. I really wanted the film to not have any obvious artifice when it came to the way characters presented themselves.” Of course, an empathetic person might wonder to themselves: What if Cillian Murphy wants to wear wigs? Is his relationship with Christopher Nolan depriving him of synthetic hair? Never fear — Murphy is in lockstep with his director. “I don’t generally do wigs,” he told Vulture in 2019. Then he took it a step further: “I think they look phony. If I see that a character has to wear a wig, I generally won’t do the part.” The lesson here? Cillian Murphy will never be cast on RuPaul’s Drag Race, no matter how much he looks like Admira Thunderpussy.

2023-07-18 17:47:00+00:00,All About Cillian Murphy's Wife Yvonne McGuinness,"Cillian Murphy is married Yvonne McGuinness, an Irish artist known for her performance installations. Get to know their love story.","With the release of Oppenheimer, the already very successful Cillian Murphy has been put in a brighter spotlight. The Christopher Nolan film about the lead scientist of the Manhattan Project was probably going to receive a lot of press to begin with, but the surprise connection the movie has made to Greta Gerwig’s Barbie film has made it part of a hotly-anticipated double feature—they’re both coming out on the same day, and fans are going wild for the box office competition.
Murphy appears to be taking it all in stride. The Irish actor seems like a pretty down-to-earth guy, and that may be partly because of his devotion to his family. Murphy is married Yvonne McGuinness, an Irish artist known for her performance installations. The couple share two sons, Malachy and Aran, with whom they live in Dublin. Murphy made the decision to be at home as much as possible despite having a Hollywood job.
“I don't need to live in Los Angeles,” he told People in 2005. “I'd be tremendously far away from my family—I'd never see them.”
Here’s everything to know about Cillian Murphy’s wife Yvonne McGuinness.
What does Yvonne McGuinness do?
McGuinness has a career in the visual arts and holds a master's degree from the Royal College of Art in London. She says on her website that her installations incorporate “film, performance, sculptural and textile elements, sound, and writing.”
Many of them include performing, so she and Murphy have that practice in common.
She has also been in charge of the household while Murphy is traveling for work, which he has praised her for repeatedly.
For his hit show Peaky Blinders, Murphy has to move to Liverpool, where he lived “zero” life, per his interview with The Guardian.
“It's cancelled life,” he explained. “You go home to your tiny apartment at the end of the day, and you feed yourself for sustenance and you learn the lines for the next day and you try to get as much sleep as you possibly can. Which isn't much. And then you get up and do it again.”
Meanwhile, McGuinness was home waiting to welcome him back after filming and support him as he decompressed from the demanding schedule.
He told GQ in an interview, “That work-life balance thing is hard. I have an amazing wife and I couldn't do this without her and her understanding. But it is a struggle…I think it is for any dad whose work takes him away, which it generally does, and which consumes him, which my work does.”
He also acknowledged McGuinness for keeping him grounded, even as he becomes a more high-profile actor.
“The fame thing was never a goal. I just want to improve,” Murphy told People. “If I can leave one film behind that's something that affects somebody, that's absolutely fine…it’s very important to have somebody like that [McGuinness]. My life hasn't changed in any way, really. I still have the same friends, and we go to the same places.”
How did Murphy and McGuinness meet?
In the late 1990s, Murphy was cast in a play called Disco Pigs, which was first put up in Cork, Ireland. It ended up being a bit hit and went on to tour, first Dublin and London and then around the world for about 18 months. Murphy told The Guardian in 2016 that McGuinness was on tour with the group.
“That time, making Disco Pigs, was kind of the most important period of my life,” he explained. “The people I met there remain my closest friends … They shaped me in terms of my tastes, in terms of what I wanted to do with my life. And it was around the same time I met my wife. She came on tour with us. It was so exciting, 20 years ago or whatever it was—we were all just kids, trying to find our way—but such a special, special time.”
How long have Murphy and McGuinness been together?
The couple met in the late '90s, but didn’t marry until 2004. They have two sons. Malachy was born in 2005, and Aran was born in 2007. He told the Guardian that he and McGuinness were able to be close to each other during her first pregnancy because he was filming The Wind that Shakes the Barley near his parent’s home in Cork.
“I was living at home with my folks, my wife was pregnant with our son, and we were running around the hills of west Cork shooting up Black and Tans. Fantastic!” he described.
At first, they raised the kids in London but decided to go back to Ireland in 2015 to be closer to family again.
“We wanted them to be Irish, I suppose,” he said. “It's amazing how quickly their accents have adapted. Even within a year of moving back, they are fading into this rakish west Brit kind of thing. Which I think, hopefully, will get them lots of girls when they're 15.”
He said in 2016 that he thinks his sons seem more confident than when he was a teen.
“I had bravado. But, deep down … I don't know, they seem better adjusted than I was,” he explained. “More sure of themselves. I'm happy about that. For me, it was something that took a long time to figure out: that it's all right to be you, that it's all right to be an individual.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvY2VsZWJyaXRpZXMvYTQ0NTc5MzI0L3doby1pcy1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS13aWZlLXl2b25uZS1tY2d1aW5uZXNzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

A number of audiences have seen the film ahead of its scheduled release on July 21, prompting Nolan to speak about how the film affected them.
""Some people leave the movie absolutely devastated. They can't speak,"" Nolan recently told WIRED.
""I mean, there's an element of fear that's there in the history and there in the underpinnings.
""But the love of the characters, the love of the relationships, is as strong as I've ever done.""
Nolan went on to say that his new film is ""an intense experience, because it's an intense story.
""I showed it to a filmmaker recently who said it's kind of a horror movie. I don't disagree.""
He added: ""But as I started to finish the film, I started to feel this color that's not in my other films, just darkness. It's there. The film fights against that.""
When asked what he thought was going on in the real Oppenheimer's head, Nolan said: ""I wrote this script in the first person. It's what I told Cillian [Murphy, who plays Oppenheimer]: You are the eyes of the audience. And he takes us there.
""The bulk of the storytelling, we don't go outside his experience. It's my best attempt to convey the answer to that question.""
In ""Oppenheimer,"" Murphy joins a star-studded cast, including Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife Katherine, Florence Pugh as psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, and Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project.
It also features Robert Downey Jr. and Rami Malek.
Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer"" by Kai Bird, the film centers on the life of Oppenheimer as he works to develop the atomic bombs that would eventually be dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.

Director Christopher Nolan has opened up about leading stars Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Florence Pugh leaving the London premiere of Oppenheimer to support the SAG-AFTRA strike.
The director said he supported the actors joining the writers who are seeking 'better pay, streaming royalties and restrictions on the implementation of artificial intelligence'.
The 52-year-old appeared on the USA's Today show and said: ""It was a bittersweet moment. We were all there. We were very fortunate.
""We had the opportunity to somewhat celebrate the film and the actors were all there to support, but then when the time came had to down tools and go off in support of all of their fellow actors and then support the writers as well.""

The Oscar-nominated filmmaker said that 'the business models have been rewritten by the companies we work for, and it's time to rewrite the deals' and the strikes marked 'an important moment in the industry'.
""Hopefully, with everybody unified, that can happen quickly as possible,"" he said.
Nolan told the cinema's audience at the London premiere last week, where Murphy, Pugh, Damon, Blunt and Rami Malek left early: ""
""You've seen them here earlier on the red carpet. Unfortunately, they're off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by SAG, joining one of my guilds, the Writers Guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of the unions, and we support them.""

He told the audience: ""They are here in spirit, and you'll get to see their incredible work and the reason we value these talented people so much and need to care for them and make sure they're looked after.
""Thanks so much for being here and we hope you enjoy the film,' he added as the audience applauded his supportive words.""
Speaking to Deadline on the red carpet, Emily said: ""I hope everyone makes a fair deal and we are here to celebrate this movie.
""And if they call [a strike], we'll be leaving together as cast in unity with everyone. We are going to have to. We will see what happens. Right now it's a joy to be together.""
The movie lands in cinemas on Friday.

Christopher Nolan’s long-awaited new blockbuster Oppenheimer is out in cinemas this week.
The film starring Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the titular role promises to tell the story of American scientist J Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic bomb.
It is partially based on the Pulitzer-Prize-winning 2005 biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer written by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin over a period of 25 years.
“Celebrated in 1945 as the ‘father of the atomic bomb,’ nine years later he would become the chief celebrity victim of the McCarthyite maelstrom,” Bird wrote in a recent opinion piece for The New York Times.
Oppenheimer is the first film to properly tackle the scientist and his legacy, which was marred by a controversial 1954 hearing that resulted in his security clearance being revoked.
Who was J Robert Oppenheimer?
Oppenheimer was born into an affluent German-Jewish family in New York City. His family’s art collection included original works by Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh.

It became apparent at an early age that Oppenheimer’s academic ability outstripped those of his peers and he entered Harvard University aged 18 where he graduated after just three years summa cum laude (with highest praise).
However, he struggled with his mental health. During his time at college, he expressed suicidal thoughts and, while pursuing a graduate degree at Cambridge University, deliberately left an apple, poisoned with laboratory chemicals, on his tutor’s desk.
By the outbreak of World War II, though, Oppenheimer had transformed himself into a respected professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and had already made numerous, significant contributions to science.
During his time at Berkeley, he fell in love with Jean Tatlock (played by Florence Pugh in Oppenheimer), the daughter of a Berkeley literature professor and a student at Stanford University School of Medicine. She was a member of the Communist Party, which later became an issue in his security clearance hearings.

It’s been confirmed Murphy and Pugh have scenes of “prolonged nudity” together – a first in Nolan’s filmography.
They broke up in 1939 and, a year later, he married Katherine (”Kitty”) Puening with whom he had two children.
During their marriage, Oppenheimer rekindled his relationship with Tatlock and the two had an affair. She later committed suicide in 1944.

The Manhattan Project
In 1941, two months before the United States entered World War II, President Franklin D Roosevelt approved a programme to develop an atomic bomb.
A year later, Oppenheimer was recruited by the National Defense Research Committee to research the building of an atomic bomb.
That September, General Leslie Groves (played by Matt Damon in the film) took over as head of the Manhattan Project (named after its inaugural offices in lower Manhattan) and selected Oppenheimer to head the project’s secret weapons laboratory.
For three years, Oppenheimer and a huge team of scientists worked towards the creation of an atomic bomb out of a military laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico.
Their work culminated in the first nuclear detonation in history, known as the Trinity test, on 16 July 1945. In an interview conducted years later, Oppenheimer claimed that a line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita, had come into his mind during the detonation: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”
A month later two of the bombs developed by the Manhattan Project were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, killing approximately 200,000 people, the majority of whom were civilians.
On August 15, Emperor Hirohito announced Japan’s surrender.

The security hearing
After the project’s success, Oppenheimer continued to act as a nuclear weapons consultant for the US government; however, he warned against their devastating capabilities.
In a 1953, speech he likened the nuclear capabilities of the United States and the Soviet Union to “two scorpions in a bottle, each capable of killing the other, but only at the risk of his own life”.
In December of that year, during the Second Red Scare in the US, Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Chairman Lewis Strauss (played by Robert Downey Jr in Nolan’s film) told Oppenheimer that his top-secret security clearance had been revoked and insisted on his resignation.
However, the scientist refused and insisted on defending himself at a highly-publicised security hearing, which he lost amid public humiliation.
Numerous sources have suggested that Oppenheimer never recovered from the incident.
The New York Times wrote in his obituary: “This bafflingly complex man nonetheless never fully succeeded in dispelling doubts about his conduct.”
Attempts were later made to repair Oppenheimer’s image – in 1963, President Lyndon B Johnson presented Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award, the AEC’s highest honour.
A chainsmoker, Oppenheimer died of throat cancer in his home in Princeton in February 1967.
In his piece for The NYT, Bird wrote: “It is my hope that Christopher Nolan’s stunning new film on Oppenheimer’s complicated legacy will initiate a national conversation not only about our existential relationship to weapons of mass destruction, but also the need in our society for scientists as public intellectuals.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL2FydHMtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9maWxtcy9uZXdzL3doby13YXMtai1yb2JlcnQtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItYjIzODA0MDUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

""It is the Biggest Story of the Last 100 Years:"" Matt Damon and Emily Blunt Talk Oppenheimer
The duo behind Oppenheimer got candid about the real-life people who inspired their characters in Christopher Nolan's new film.
When your lives are dedicated to something as potentially world-altering as the creation of the atomic bomb, things are bound to get complicated. J. Robert Oppenheimer and his wife Katherine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer, portrayed by Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt, respectively, in Christopher Nolan's latest project, Oppenheimer, were proof of that.
When NBC Insider spoke with Blunt at a press junket before the start of the SAG-AFTRA strike about her perception of Kitty’s life — which was often marred by isolation and addiction after her husband moved their family to a remote town in New Mexico in order to complete his work on the Manhattan Project — she didn’t hold back in describing how difficult it seemed.

“I think that she deteriorated as everybody sees,” Blunt said of Kitty’s mental and physical state throughout her life and, subsequently, the film. “She's sort of like decayed over the course of the film and of a lifetime because she was fostering [her husband’s] future, his plans, his pursuit.”
But, she clarified, that wasn’t all too different from other wives in the mid-20th century.
“A lot of women contorted themselves to facilitate a husband's needs,” she said. “But this was on like a world-changing scale.”
Kitty’s mental and emotional state, while not too unusual, as Blunt said, was only exacerbated by the reality she lived in. The families attached to the Manhattan Project — who were moved to the remote desert location to create and test a potentially world-ending weapon as yet witnessed by humanity — were all isolated and kept in a sort of insular community. A story like that naturally lends itself to a haunting kind of environment.

And thus, Oppenheimer is as much a thrilling horror film at times as it is a biopic about the man who created the world’s first atomic weapon.
“I feel like it is a historical film, it is a kind of a biopic, but it's not in many ways because [Nolan’s] managed to kind of smuggle in all these other genres,” Murphy said at the same junket. “Like it's a thriller, it's a love story, it's kind of got very, very strong horror elements in it I think sometimes and I think it's incredibly entertaining — but also it's provocative.”
Ultimately, Murphy concludes, Oppenheimer is a film that “asks questions of the audience,” questions we can try and answer when it premieres exclusively in theaters on July 21.

Spielberg wore a white hat with a matching jacket, jeans, sneakers and a blue-and-white shirt to the theater, while McCartney wore a blue sweatshirt, dark pants and sunglasses.
The Beatles alum referenced knowing director Spielberg as far back as 1986, when he told Rolling Stone he sought out Spielberg's advice on the possibility of making a movie about the Beatles' career.
Back in December, Spielberg noted that one of McCartney’s famed Beatles song — “Michelle” from 1965’s Rubber Soul — helped grant him an opportunity to share a first kiss with a girlfriend in college.

Oppenheimer stars Cillian Murphy as physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and features performances from Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr. and a large ensemble cast.
The film follows Oppenheimer's life and participation in the United States' atomic weapons program during World War II and beyond. Its opening weekend box office success has been tied to its simultaneous release with the blockbuster Barbie movie. One study found that Oppenheimer made nearly $5 million of its ticket sales from moviegoers who originally planned to see Barbie but made a backup plan when the comedy was sold out.
Several stars shared that they would be in line to see Barbie and Oppenheimer, including Tom Cruise, whose latest Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is also in theaters now.
""This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters. Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indy and one of the most iconic characters in history,"" Cruise wrote on Twitter in June, adding, ""I love a double feature, and it doesn't get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Oppenheimer and Barbie.""
Oppenheimer is in theaters now.

,Oppenheimer star Cillian Murphy reacts to Danny Boyle’s 28 Days Later sequel update,"‘I didnt know that,’ the ‘Oppenheimer’ star said","Cillian Murphy has reacted to the news that 28 Years Later finally seems to be happening.
Last week, the film’s director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland discussed plans to make a second follow-up to their hit 2000 horror film 28 Days Later.
Garland recently said that “an idea” for a potential new film “materialised a few years ago”, adding: “Danny always liked the idea.”
Boyle told Inverse that the pair are currently “talking about it quite seriously, quite diligently”, stating that if Garland didn’t want to direct the film, he himself would “be well up for it”.
Soon after these quotes surfaced, The Independent spoke with Cillian Murphy during the promotional trail for his new film, Christopher Nolan’s drama Oppenheimer.
Murphy played the lead role of Jim in 28 Days Later, which follows survivors of an incurable virus that ravages the world.
The sequel 28 Weeks Later (2007) focused on a different set of characters, led by Robert Carlyle, and while it’s unknown whether Garland and Boyle’s idea would include Murphy, the actor is enthusiastic about the idea of returning.
“That’s great to hear. I didn’t know that – I would be there in a flash,” Murphy said.
“I made two movies with both of those guys, and I would love to work with them again. Of course, I’m there.”
28 Days Later co-starred Brendan Gleeson and Christopher Eccleston. It grossed $84.6m (£64.2m) from a budget of just $8m (£6.1m). Murphy worked with both Boyle and Garland on the 2007 film Sunshine.

The film launched Murphy’s career, and just five years later, he collaborated with Nolan for the first time in Batman Begins. Oppenheimer marks his sixth time working with the filmmaker – but this time, he takes on the lead role, playing Robert J Oppenheimer, the man who created the atomic bomb.
Oppenheimer co-stars Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh. It’s released in cinemas on 21 July.

Christopher Nolan’s new film, Oppenheimer, is a breathtaking biopic that tells the story of the titular J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the man primarily responsible for the creation of the atomic bomb. While the majority of the three-hour film focuses on the invention of the bomb in the deserts of New Mexico and the (metaphorical) fallout from the Trinity Test, Oppenheimer’s personal life is depicted, too, including his marriage with his wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt). And, their marriage had all the drama in real life as it did on the silver screen.
Inside the Real Life Marriage Between Robert and Kitty Oppenheimer
Kitty Puening, Before She Met Robert
Katherine ""Kitty"" Vissering Puening was born in Germany on August 8, 1910. When she was nearly 3, her family emigrated to the United States where they settled outside of Pittsburg. She grew up speaking German and English, eventually going to college and traveling to Germany to study in 1930. That’s where she met the first of her four husbands, an American music student named Frank Ramseyer. This marriage was annulled in 1933.
RELATED: The True Story of Oppenheimer’s First Love, Jean Tatlock, And How She Shaped His Views
At a New Year’s Eve party in 1933, Kitty met her second husband, Joseph Dallet, Jr., the Dartmouth-educated son of a prominent businessman. Four years prior, Dallet had joined the Communist Party of the United States, and after they got a common-law marriage, Kitty joined as well. They separated in 1936, but upon learning that her mother had been hiding Dallet’s letters to her, Kitty set out to follow him to Spain, where Dallet was volunteering to fight against fascists in the Spanish Civil War. They met up in France, but before Kitty could join him on the front lines in Spain, Dallet was killed.
Upon returning to the United States, Kitty enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania to continue her studies, eventually meeting Richard Stewart Harrison, a medical doctor. They were wed in 1938 and moved to Pasadena, California. That’s where she met J. Robert Oppenheimer.
How Did the Oppenheimer's Marriage Begin?

As seen in Oppenheimer, the pair met at a party and soon began having an affair. This was after Oppenheimer had broken up with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), and he was dating around. Oppenheimer invited Kitty and her husband to join him for the summer at his New Mexico ranch, Perro Caliente, but Harrison declined. In 1940, Kitty became pregnant, and she and Harrison amicably divorced. She married Oppenheimer on November 2, 1940, and their son Peter was born the next year on May 12.
RELATED: Why Did Oppenheimer Say, ""Now I am Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" And What Did it Mean?
The Oppenheimers did indeed leave their baby son with their friends, the Chevaliers, though they retook custody of the boy before heading to New Mexico for the Manhattan Project. Kitty became pregnant again and had the couple’s second child, a girl named Katherine, on December 7, 1944. Though not depicted in the movie, Kitty left Los Alamos with Peter in April of 1945 and stayed with her parents, citing depression. She left her daughter in the care of another couple at Los Alamos who had recently lost their own son, though Kitty and Peter returned in July of 1945 before the Trinity Test.
What Happened to Kitty After Robert Died?
After the end of World War II, Kitty remained with Oppenheimer, moving to New Jersey when he accepted Lewis Strauss’ offer to be director of the Institute for Advanced Study. An alcoholic, Kitty somewhat frequently injured herself or drank and took pills to the point where she was unwell.
They remained together until the end (and Kitty held grudges her husband seemingly could not, as she didn’t shake Edward Teller’s hand as depicted in the film). Oppenheimer died of cancer in February of 1967. After his death, Kitty began seeing Robert Serber, the recently widowed friend of the Oppenheimers since their days in Pasadena and through the Manhattan Project. In 1972, they bought a yacht and intended to sail to Japan via the Panama Canal, but Kitty became ill during the voyage and died of an embolism in Panama City on October 27, 1972. Serber and her daughter scattered her ashes near where they’d scattered Oppenheimer’s ashes.

Oppenheimer: Welcome back to ""Science For Everyone"", ABP Live's weekly science column. Last week, we discussed the science behind yawning, and the fact that it does not indicate a need for sleep. Since Christopher Nolan's latest film Oppenheimer released in India on July 21, 2023, we discuss this week the Manhattan Project and the science behind the atomic bomb. The nuclear weapons developed by American theoretical physicist Julius Robert Oppenheimer through the Manhattan Project, a US government research programme, helped end World War II. The atomic bomb was designed at the Manhattan Project's laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Since Oppenheimer was the director of the laboratory, and played the central role in the development of this powerful weapon, he is known as the 'Father of the Atomic Bomb'. World War II was the first and only time such destructive weapons were used in conflict.
In Nolan's Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy plays the titular character; Emily Blunt stars as Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty Oppenheimer; Robert Downey Jr appears as Lewis Strauss, former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) who denied Oppenheimer's security clearance; and Matt Damon portrays the character of Leslie Groves, who was in charge of all Army activities relating to the Manhattan Project.
Why the Manhattan Project was a huge scientific breakthrough
The Manhattan Project was one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century. Leaders and scientists from all scientific fields and engineering disciplines had come together during the Manhattan Project to build the first atomic bombs. They explored the fields of nuclear physics and chemistry, and used the concepts of practical engineering to process radioactive materials uranium-235 and plutonium-239, and develop atomic bombs. In order to produce the nuclear weapons, the scientists leveraged nuclear fission of uranium-235 and plutonium-239, and the chain reactions that can liberate colossal amounts of destructive heat energy.
Fission is a form of chemical interaction between subatomic particles, and nuclear fission is the process in which an atom is split by bombarding the nucleus with neutrons, a type of subatomic particle carrying no charge. The other subatomic particles in an atom are protons and electrons, which are positively- and negatively-charged particles respectively. An atomic nucleus has both protons and neutrons, but no electrons, because of which the core of an atom is positively-charged. The electrons revolve around the nucleus in shells. It is the collision of atomic particles that leads to different chemical reactions.

The Manhattan Project was a success due to several factors, including scientific intellect, and communication between scientific minds.
Before delving into the chemistry and engineering aspects of the Manhattan Project, let us try to understand the events that led to this groundbreaking research programme.
In the early 20th century, fission was a newly recognised process, and in order to make the most of it, American scientists, many of whom were refugees from fascist regimes in Europe, took steps in 1939 to organise a project.
In 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland, following which GB Pegram of Columbia University arranged a conference between Enrico Fermi and the Navy Department in March that year. After this, in the summer of 1939, physicists Albert Einstein, Leo Szilard, and Eugene Wigner warned the then President Franklin D Roosevelt of the jeopardy entire humanity would be subject to if the Nazis were the first to make a nuclear bomb. They urged Roosevelt to establish a programme to study the potential military use of fission, and find ways to perform an uncontrolled fission chain reaction. In Nolan's Oppenheimer, Danny Deferrari portrays the role of Fermi, Tom Conti plays Einstein, and Máté Haumann appears as Szilard.
Roosevelt agreed, and appropriated $6,000 for the task in February 1940. A committee, headed by Lieutenant General Briggs, director of the National Bureau of Standards, which later became the National Institute of Standards and Technology, was formed to supervise the research.
On December 6, 1941, the project came under the direction of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, led by Vannevar Bush. Matthew Modine plays Bush in Oppenheimer.
After Japan attacked Pearl Harbour on December 7, 1941, the US declared war on Japan. The US became fully involved in World War II when Germany and Italy declared war on the US three days after the country declared war on Japan.
After this, the War Department was given joint responsibility for the project. In May 1942, a decision was made to proceed simultaneously on all methods that would help obtain fissionable materials, including the electromagnetic process developed at the University of California, Berkeley, under Lawrence, and the diffusion process developed under Harold Urey at Columbia University. The US Army Corps of Engineers started the construction of pilot plants, laboratories and manufacturing facilities for the scientists.
Since a significant portion of the early research had been performed at Columbia University in Manhattan, the Manhattan Engineer District, an office of engineers in New York City, was assigned management of the construction work. In September 1942, Army Officer Groves was given the responsibility of supervising all Army activities relating to the project. The research work went on to be known by its code name ""Manhattan Project"".
He chose three key sites for the Manhattan Project: Oak Ridge in Tennessee, Los Alamos in New Mexico, and Hanford in Washington.
Groves recognised Oppenheimer's exceptional scientific brilliance, and selected him to direct weapons development.
On December 2, 1942, Fermi and Szilard created the first controlled nuclear reactor, marking the beginning of the Atomic Age, an era of unearthing of atomic and subatomic marvels. Fermi and Szilard's model went on to be reconstructed into five different reactor prototypes.
In 1943, Oppenheimer chose the plateaus of Los Alamos, near Santa Fe, New Mexico, for the construction of the Los Alamos Laboratory.
Oppenheimer was searching for a way to separate uranium-235 from natural uranium, and to determine the critical mass of uranium required to make a nuclear bomb. Critical mass refers to the minimum amount of a fissile material required to initiate a self-sustaining fission reaction. The laboratory was tasked with the responsibility of developing methods to reduce fissionable products to pure metal and fabricate the metal to required shapes.
By August 1943, several scientists from Great Britain and Canada had moved to the US to join the Manhattan Project.
Plutonium-239 was the other radioactive material of interest, because the metal is highly fissionable.
The science behind the Manhattan Project
When neutrons collide with the nucleus of another atom, a tremendous amount of energy is released. Since protons as well as the nucleus of an atom are positively-charged, they will repel each other, and hence, protons cannot be used in nuclear bombardment.
Therefore, in nuclear fission, neutrons are used, and are fired towards an atom with the aim of making the neutrons fuse with the nucleus. After this, a less-stable isotope is produced. Since the isotope is less stable than the original element, it is chemically volatile, splits into two stable atoms, releases neutrons, and generates energy in the form of Gamma radiation.
However, this is not the end of the reaction. The newly released neutrons fuse with the nuclei of other atoms, causing them as well to release neutrons. In this way, a chain reaction begins, and not only are neutrons released, but also large amounts of heat radiation. The chain reaction, if left unchecked, can create an atomic bomb.
However, not every atom is fissionable, because if that were the case, there would have been no stability to matter, and chaotic energy transformations would have ensued in the world.
The isotopes of only a few elements can undergo a fissile chain reaction.
German scientists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman conducted an experiment in 1939, as part of which they added non-radioactive barium to uranium, and fired neutrons at the latter. At the conclusion of the experiment, they observed some barium atoms had radioactivity. This was surprising because they had used non-radioactive barium in the reaction.
Austrian-Swedish physicist Lise Meitner said that when uranium was bombarded with neutrons, each atom was split into two, forming two elements, one of which was barium. The barium atoms formed as a result of the splitting of uranium were radioactive.
After learning about the theory that uranium is a fissionable element, Danish physicist Neils Bohr told the entire world about the important discovery at an international conference in Washington. In Oppenheimer, Kenneth Branagh plays Neils Bohr.
Uranium occurs in three forms: uranium-234, uranium-235, and uranium-238. Uranium-238 is the most abundant isotope, and is stable compared to the other two forms. However, uranium-235, which easily undergoes nuclear fission, and can sustain a chain reaction, is rare.
Uranium-235 can cause a chain reaction if it is bombarded with neutrons travelling at adequate velocity and at an appropriate angle. The unstable nucleus of uranium-235 absorbs the neutron, becomes uranium-236, which is extremely unstable, and instantly splits into two atoms of different elements, emits two neutrons, and results in a chain reaction, which liberates gargantuan amounts of gamma radiation.
In 1931, John Dunning and Eugene Booth successfully separated uranium-235 from uranium-238, and this is how the element became the most preferred fissionable material. Only a small amount of uranium-235 had massive destructive potential.
The need to create nuclear weapons before the enemy nations created such devastating bombs themselves, and the newfound knowledge of nuclear fission culminated in the Manhattan Project in 1942.
However, two major challenges remained: obtaining sufficient fissionable material, and designing a nuclear bomb that would maintain and maximise a fissile chain reaction. Before the Manhattan Project started, Dunning and Booth had found a method to separate uranium-235 from uranium-238, but their purpose was purely scientific, and would not have served any purpose to a project that was tasked with finding a solution to ending the Second World War.
Also, none of the scientists involved in the project had the experience of developing a huge nuclear reactor that would allow a bomb to be deployed.
The biggest problem was that uranium-235 constitutes only one per cent of natural uranium, which also contains uranium-238.
Lawrence, at the University of California, Berkeley, developed the first technique to isolate a practical amount of uranium-235. Leveraging the electromagnetic properties of atoms, and integrating chemistry and physics, he separated uranium-235 from uranium-238 using a mass spectrometer.
Since Uranium-235 and Uranium-238 had different masses, and according to Newton's law, if the same force is applied on two different masses, the lighter one will be affected more compared to the heavier one, the uranium-235 atoms travelled closer to the electromagnetic arch exerting an electromagnetic force, compared to uranium-238, which is heavier.
It was important to mobilise the uranium atoms into gaseous particles. This was performed by circulating fluorine gas over a solid uranium core, in order to produce uranium tetrafluoride gas. This gas was made to pass through the arch in order to obtain a purified uranium tetrafluoride.
However, this technique proved to be largely inefficient because the maintenance costs were high, and the process was time-consuming. Millions of dollars were invested in production and repair, but only one gram of uranium-235 was retrieved.
This was when Groves purchased land in Oak Ridge and commissioned scientists to find a new technique of uranium separation. Using the theory of gaseous diffusion of uranium hexafluoride as the basis of the technique, scientists made gaseous particles of uranium pass through a porous membrane, so that according to the laws of thermodynamics, the gaseous particles of uranium-235, which are lighter than uranium-238, pass through the porous member faster than the latter, in a process known as effusion.
Since uranium 235 hexafluoride diffuses faster than uranium 238 hexafluoride, Groves concluded that the technique could be used to obtain uranium-235, according to the University of Pittsburgh.
It was important to carry out the diffusion in completely airtight conditions because the masses of the two isotopes of uranium are similar. Since grease is an organic compound, and uranium hexafluoride reacts quickly with such substances, it could not be used to seal the tubes. Therefore, scientists started fabricating new plastics, and this was how Teflon was invented.
Thousands of consecutive members were used, and diffusion tanks were sealed with Teflon tubing. Due to financial constraints, the plant at Oak Ridge carried out the process only to the point of producing a mixture of the two isotopes. Uranium-235 was subsequently isolated by subjecting the mixture to other separation techniques.
After the discovery of fissionable uranium, Glen Seaborg discovered plutonium, the 94th element in the Periodic Table. In 1942, researchers found that plutonium-239 can also sustain a chain reaction.
Scientists also discovered that if uranium-235 is exposed to alpha particles, or Helium nuclei in a reactor for extended periods of time, the atomic number of uranium-235 increases and plutonium-239 is obtained.
Thus, the scientists working under the Manhattan Project were able to use two fissile materials for developing the atomic bombs.
How the Manhattan Project helped develop the atomic bomb
By the summer of 1945, large-scale production reactors in Hanford Engineer Works produced amounts of plutonium-239 sufficient to generate a nuclear explosion.
A field test was also scheduled to check if the nuclear explosion would be a success or failure. By this time, the budget of the Manhattan Project had risen to $2 billion.
As part of the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer’s research team bombarded neutrons with plutonium or uranium-23 to initiate a nuclear fission reaction, during which the heavy plutonium or uranium nucleus split into smaller nuclei, and released huge amounts of of energy and other neutrons. These neutrons, in turn, hit other nuclei and caused them to split, releasing more energy and neutrons in the process. This is a chain reaction, which, if left unchecked, can create an atomic bomb.
On May 7, 1945, Nazi Germany surrendered.
On July 16, 1945, the first atomic bomb was exploded at the Alamogordo air base, which Oppenheimer called ""Trinity"" in reference to one of John Donne's Holy Sonnets. As part of the field test called the ""Trinity Test"", a plutonium implosion device known as ""Gadget"" was used.
On August 6, 1945, the untested uranium-235 gun assembly bomb, known as the Little Boy, was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. This was the first atomic bomb used in war. The bomb instantly killed 70,000 people, and due to the effects of radiation, over 100,000 people subsequently died.
On August 9, 1945, a replica of the plutonium-239 implosion device tested in Trinity, was dropped on Nagasaki. This bomb was called Fat Man.
This bomb instantly killed about 40,000 people, and at least 30,000 more died due to injuries and radiation poisoning by the end of the year.
The next day, the Japanese initiated surrender negotiations. Meanwhile, Groves had informed US President Harry S Truman that another bomb would be ready for delivery within a week. In Oppenheimer, Gary Oldman plays President Truman.
On September 2, 1945, Japan formally announced its surrender on board the USS Missouri.
After the hostilities came to an end, Manhattan Project physicist Philip Morrison travelled to Hiroshima to study the aftermath of the nuclear explosion, but he was so devastated by what he witnessed, that he spent the rest of his life campaigning against nuclear weapons.
The Manhattan Project was followed by Operation Crossroads, as part of which two peacetime atomic weapons tests were performed.
After this, the Manhattan Project came under the jurisdiction of the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC).
The Manhattan Project marked the true beginning of the Atomic Age. As part of the three-year project, scientists made several important discoveries associated with bomb mechanics, atomic particles, nuclear fission, and also obtained insights into nuclear fusion. Most importantly, it brought together a large number of scientists and leaders together, who put their heart and soul into making the Manhattan Project a quintessence of scientific triumph.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hYnBsaXZlLmNvbS9zY2llbmNlL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLW1hbmhhdHRhbi1wcm9qZWN0LWF0b21pYy1ib21iLXNjaWVuY2UtY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktMTYxNzU4ONIBf2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hYnBsaXZlLmNvbS9zY2llbmNlL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLW1hbmhhdHRhbi1wcm9qZWN0LWF0b21pYy1ib21iLXNjaWVuY2UtY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktMTYxNzU4OC9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 15:34:47+00:00,The Real TIME Magazine Covers Featured in Oppenheimer,The stories behind the two TIME Magazine covers featured in the movie Oppenheimer.,"This post contains spoilers for Oppenheimer.
TIME makes a cameo in the summer blockbuster Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s movie about brainiac theoretical physicist and atomic bomb architect J. Robert Oppenheimer.
Two TIME magazine covers show up in the movie: one featuring Oppenheimer, and the other depicting his nemesis Lewis Strauss, head of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. While based on real issues of the magazine, the cover photos in the film are altered to look like the actors Cillian Murphy (Oppenheimer) and Robert Downey Jr. (Strauss).
November 8, 1948 TIME cover June 15, 1959 TIME cover
The first TIME magazine that appears in the movie is the Nov. 8, 1948, issue, featuring a portrait of Oppenheimer by the artist Ernest Hamlin Baker. The cover story details the scientist’s rise to fame, and includes details about Oppenheimer’s—or “Oppie’s”—eccentricities:
Oppie would corral a handful of his favorite students, take them in his big, fast car for a leisurely feast at such San Francisco restaurants as Amelio’s and Jack’s. Good conversation was cheap, but dinner was always expensive; it was Oppie who picked up the checks. A more fluent conversationalist than in the old, shy days, the handsome and unattached Oppie was much sought after as a guest at cocktail and dinner parties. He gave bachelor dinners, serving his own expertly cooked hot Mexican dishes, and mixed a mean Martini with laboratory precision. After a late party, he would frequently sit up most of the night working on some involved problem (“How much sleep do I need? This is like what Mrs. Lenin said about the meat: ‘When we are hungry, we cook it five minutes; when we are not hungry, two hours'”). Once, on a date with a coed in the Berkeley hills, he felt the urge to solve a problem in physics, got out of the car to pace up & down, wandered off into the night. On another occasion, emboldened by his own Martinis, Oppenheimer decided to telephone a girl he “knew,” found that he could not remember her name; all he recalled was that her address was a power of seven.
The second issue of TIME in the movie appears at a key plot point, during the feud between Oppenheimer and Strauss, who stripped Oppenheimer of his security clearance. During his confirmation hearings for Commerce Secretary in 1959, Strauss is depicted in the movie as bandying about TIME’s June 15, 1959, issue, bragging to an aide that he knows TIME publisher Henry Luce and got the story placed as part of his campaign for the Commerce position. The real TIME cover story explains Strauss’ complicated personality that Nolan also explores in the movie:
For it is the personality, and not the competence, of Lewis Strauss that is clearly at issue as he nears the crisis of his career. Strauss, by the extraordinary ingredients of his makeup, is one to arouse superlatives of praise and blame, admiration and dislike. In the eyes of friends, he is brilliant, devoted, courageous and, in his more relaxed moments, exceedingly charming. His enemies regard him as arrogant, evasive, suspicious-minded, pride-ridden, and an excessively rough battler. (“He has more elbows than an octopus.”) …A vital key to Lewis Strauss’s character is a perfectionism that still seems to nag him at an age when he might have become more mellowed. It shows in the studied elegance of his tailoring, in a precision of speech that comes natural to him from long habit but seems a bit affected to unfriendly ears, and above all in a fierce reluctance to admit his mistakes, no matter how human and understandable they may have been. Some of his perfectionism traces back to a sense of being an outsider. As a Jew, he has sometimes felt the wounding edges of anti-Semitism (and again last week, that ugly term popped up). For all his wealth (he is a millionaire) and intellect (even his enemies admit that he is brainy), Strauss seems unable to live down in his own mind an awareness that he never went to college and that he started out as a traveling shoe salesman.
Strauss’s hopes that a TIME story would boost his chances of confirmation didn’t work; the Senate did not confirm him to be Commerce Secretary.

2023-08-20 21:19:59+05:30,Oppenheimer Box Office: Cillian Murphy starrer storms past USD 700 million; set to overtake Christopher Nolan's Interstellar,Cillian Murphy starrer Oppenheimer was one of the most anticipated movies not only of this summer but also of the year. The Christopher Nolan directorial continues to impress on the box office.,"Oppenheimer is on a monster run in theaters, even almost one month after the movie's release, it has continued to impress at the box office. The Christopher Nolan directorial was one of the biggest releases of the year, and it has not only met the expectations set by the director's previous movies but surpassed them with flying colors. The biopic is now entering its fifth week in the cinemas, and it is all set to take over Nolan's Interstellar.
Oppenheimer crosses USD 700 million at the global box-office
Christopher Nolan's directorial Oppenheimer continues to make big strides, inching closer to yet another remarkable achievement by overtaking the USD 700 million mark in global earnings up to this point. As it completes its fifth week of release, the grand-scale epic is anticipated to reach a total of USD 718 million, including tomorrow's figures. This feat will propel it to become Nolan's fourth highest-grossing film globally, effectively surpassing Interstellar. Moreover, the biopic will rise to no. 4 on the global box office chart for this year. In short, Universal's film is on track to add another impressive milestone to its record. In 2023, Cillian Murphy starrer holds the position of the 3rd highest-grossing movie internationally, excluding China, where its release is scheduled for August 30.

Oppenheimer became highest grossing WWII movie
Oppenheimer is still very much popular among people going to the cinema, and it should be noted that it's nowhere near the end of its box-office run. The Cillian Murphy starrer overtook another title, the highest-grossing WWII movie of all time. It overtook Dunkirk, a 2017 film that recounted the events of the Dunkirk Evacuation during the Battle of France, amassing a global sum of USD 527 million. Interestingly enough that movie was also directed by Nolan and included Cillian Murphy. This also means the classic 1998 Steven Spielberg-directed masterpiece, Saving Private Ryan, which features Oppenheimer actor, Matt Damon, now assumes the 3rd position with USD 482 million. However, this particular figure remains unadjusted for inflation. Intriguingly, if inflation were taken into account, Saving Private Ryan would actually secure the top spot in this category.
Meanwhile, since the release of the film Murphy has revealed many small tidbits of what it was like getting cast for the movie, where he admitted that the Inception director called him out of the blue and gave him the role.

2023-07-19 14:00:00+00:00,Christopher Nolan Is for the Girlies,These are serious movies. Until the internet gets a hold of them.,"Filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, and Christopher Nolan are known for being beloved by film bros around the world. If Hollywood makes “chick flicks” for women, these directors win prizes for providing what everyone believes to be the opposite thing—a type of film that, interestingly, doesn’t have a catchy, degrading name. (Gloria Steinem once wrote an entire op-ed dubbing them “prick flicks.”) This egregious misconception needs to be corrected, at least on one such filmmaker’s behalf. Despite what you might have heard, Christopher Nolan’s films are, in fact, for the girlies.
Nolan, who famously is one of the least accessible mainstream directors—I don’t mean least accessible in terms of a viewer’s ability to see or understand his movies, though that is sort of true; I mean least accessible in that this man doesn’t even have a damn smartphone—has, for years, managed to cast some of the absolute hottest men in Hollywood to talk about time travel or multiple dimensions or whatever. Considering that Nolan uses much the same roster of actors across his films, it’s almost impressive the different variations of sexiness that he can elicit out of one man. It’s so effective one would think his hiring tactic is whispering the lyrics of Mulan’s “I’ll Make a Man out of You” into the ear of Hollywood’s hunkiest specimens.

Netizens on the lookout for their next internet boyfriend have noticed. The best example this summer is, of course, Cillian Murphy, whose every appearance in promotional photos or clips related to Nolan’s upcoming film Oppenheimer—in which Murphy plays the titular physicist, who spearheaded the creation of the atomic bomb—has dominated the thirstiest corners of Al Gore’s internet. The blue-eyed Irish beauty first won the heart of Online as very hot, very tortured 1920s gangster Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders in 2013. Since then, Murphy has appeared as a side character in many Nolan films. Now he’s finally taking the main stage in a Christopher Nolan production.

Fancams (fan-edited video odes) and photos of Murphy dominated social media algorithms as press for Oppenheimer reached its peak, just before the announcement of the SAG strike, and the end of actors’ ability to do press for current projects, last week. Some have even made the tongue-in-cheek argument that a handful of photos of Murphy, who famously doesn’t do much press and is apathetic toward the idea of being “online,” have had the same effect as the incredibly deep promotional budget of Oppenheimer’s sister film Barbie. He’s been called unreal, compared with your lesbian best friend for trying out a see-through shirt, and dubbed a “summa cum laude” graduate in the art of smizing. Murphy’s Oppenheimer castmate Emily Blunt got a secondhand hit of virality for doing what any reasonable person would do when standing next to Murphy on the red carpet: grabbing on, and not letting go.

Of course, I wouldn’t be writing this if I had only one point of evidence. Nolan’s history of casting hotties who, despite the somber nature of the films they’re in, become Internet Darlings—a history that includes Murphy in Batman Begins and Murphy in Inception and Murphy in Dunkirk—starts with his second film, Memento (2000), which, thankfully, features tons of shots of a young, shirtless Guy Pearce. Let this Tumblr GIF set serve as proof of the absolute serve Pearce is exhibiting in this actually emotionally devastating film. (Get you a guy who can do both, as they say.) Next is the first film in the Batman trilogy, Batman Begins (2005), which adds Christian Bale to the pantheon. Throughout the trilogy, Bale is effortlessly beautiful as the suave but tortured billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. But he’s also rough and gruff when dressed as the titular masked vigilante. This movie also has a young Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow, who, mind you, looked like this at the time.

Nolan’s Batman trilogy offered us a visual feast: the cleft-chin wonder Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, and, of course, Heath Ledger’s iconic performance as the Joker, which is the stuff of nightmares but manifested a charisma that reminded us how hot Ledger was outside the clown makeup (the answer is very, folks). The trilogy also gave us Tom Hardy’s Bane. Hardy had his face covered here, but given the lingering memory of his glorious visage in Nolan’s Inception a couple of years prior, the role still catered to the beefcake fans among us. Zero complaints. If you’re more of the cute-quirky type of thirster, the trilogy also puts Joseph Gordon-Levitt to great use toward the end.

The pinnacle of Nolan’s secret side project (that is, quenching the thirst of the world’s man-enjoyers) has to be his 2010 film Inception, which comes after the second Batman film, The Dark Knight (2008), but before the final one, The Dark Knight Rises (2012). Though the general online consensus on Leonardo DiCaprio has soured a bit since 2010, as it’s become ever more clear he dates only women under 25 (Gigi Hadid, 27, excepted), it is undeniable that he is putting his miraculous genes to good use in this film. The cinematic achievement of Inception is not the continuously debated ending or the incredible visual effects, but DiCaprio’s face. Inception also marks the establishment of Hardy and Nolan’s working relationship (hallelujah); Murphy dazzles here as well, and Gordon-Levitt plays a deliciously handsome role too.

Nolan’s filmography is so stuffed with attractive actors that I’m running out of time to mention them all. There’s Matthew McConaughey, at peak McConaissance, looking like THIS for most of Interstellar (2014)—which does the world a disservice, but honors reality by having his face partially covered by an astronaut’s helmet for large parts of the film. Even Interstellar’s memed-to-death scene in which McConaughey’s character ugly cries might not be hot, but it is relatable! There’s also a baby Timothée Chalamet in this film, which arrived too early for Chalamet thirst per se (his character is 15 years old) but offers a good indicator of what is to come. Harry Styles, fresh from cutting his signature long hair, will make you swoon while also making you fear for his life in Dunkirk (2017), in which he appears along with personal favorite Barry Keoghan, Hardy, and Murphy. Tenet (2020) offers Robert Pattinson, the world’s boyfriend since as early as his Harry Potter or Twilight days, who is just as enticing here as he ever was.

Duh, you might say, actors are handsome! But Nolan is able to depict these men as some of the most delectable treats in cinema. I haven’t figured out the exact recipe of Nolan’s secret sexy sauce, but it has something to do with the confidence and ambition of his leading men, who are usually either incredibly smart or brooding or both. Plus, Nolan, like us all, loves a man in uniform or a suit. What’s more, you can barely hear what these guys are saying, an increasingly apparent feature of Nolan’s signature sound design. But this is all for the better: Pretty boys who barely talk?! Yeah, that’s definitely for the girlies.

If you’re a girlie who loves girls, rest assured because Nolan has you covered. There’s Hilary Swank in Insomnia (2002), Katie Holmes in Batman Begins, Scarlett Johansson in The Prestige (2006), Elizabeth Debicki in Tenet, and more. If you’re a girlie who enjoys thirsting after non-white people, well … there’s … John David Washington in Tenet? And the occasional Ken Watanabe cameo where he looks like this. But … that’s about it. And if you’re a girlie who loves swooning over emotionally and mentally healthy men, maybe solicit those in the waiting room of your therapist’s office?",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy8wNy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1tb3ZpZS1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1jYXN0Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-30 18:29:20+00:00,The Sex Scenes In ‘Oppenheimer’ Really Were Sex as Only Nolan Can Do It,'Oppenheimer' brought Christopher Nolan into the sex scene conversation and it really was sex as only Nolan can do it.,"Christopher Nolan’s work isn’t really known for the love affairs at the center of them. Nolan’s movies often feel loveless, with a few exceptions like The Prestige or even Inception with Mal and Cobb. Sex, though, isn’t really a part of his storytelling approach at all. Except, that is, when it comes to Oppenheimer.
Nolan’s latest movie focuses on the life and work of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) as he recounts his work on the Manhattan Project during his security clearance hearing in 1954. While he is questioned over “communist” connections, his romantic relationship with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) was of the utmost “importance” to the security council.
While Oppy tells his story of meeting Jean prior to his relationship with his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), we see their first sexual encounter. It’s a fascinating angle because the audio of Murphy’s Oppenheimer saying the famous Bhagavad Gita line, “Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds,” comes from this sex scene. Jean finds Sanskrit writing in Oppenheimer’s room and brings it to him to read, which he does as the two have sex. The same audio is used later in the movie during the Trinity test sequence so knowing that it was said during sex is a bit out there (and has actually received harsh criticism from Hindu audiences) but that’s not why I can’t stop thinking about the labeling of “Sex as only Nolan could stage it.”

Kitty’s version of the sex scene was very Nolan-esque
(Universal Pictures)
Kitty is present in the hearing when Oppenheimer is asked to describe his affair with Jean. As he discusses it, we the audience see their conversation in the past, both Jean and Oppy sitting naked on chairs together after they’ve had sex. But when we get Kitty’s perspective on the situation, she’s listening to them talk about the affair (which continued well into her marriage to Oppenheimer) and imagines Jean there in the hearing room, having sex with her husband in front of her, making prolonged eye contact with her. It is trippy, odd, and gives us a rare insight into Kitty’s thoughts and feelings on the situation but is very Nolan in its approach.
A lot of people often complain that sex scenes don’t have a purpose. I disagree and think that more often than not, filmmakers have a way of using the physical act of sex to tell us about the characters’ emotional state in the midst of it. With Oppenheimer, we really get to see where Oppenheimer’s head is, as well as Kitty’s.
It is really fascinating how Nolan connected Oppenheimer’s relationship with Jean with his marriage to Kitty and seeing those two worlds collide together—all while foreshadowing the Trinity test and subsequent destruction—really brought out the “Nolan-esque” mood that made this such a unique sex scene. I’ve not stopped thinking about it since.
This really was sex as only Nolan could stage it but it really does work to drive home how explosive Jean and Robert were together.
This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, the work being covered here wouldn’t exist.

2023-07-28 20:39:11+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’: Christopher Nolan told Benny Safdie not to pluck his eyebrows for months,Benny Safdie was asked by director Christopher Nolan not to pluck his eyebrows for the role of Edward Teller in 'Oppenheimer'.,"Benny Safdie was asked by director Christopher Nolan not to pluck his eyebrows for the role of Edward Teller in Oppenheimer.
Teller, the theoretical physicist known as “the father of the hydrogen bomb”, joined J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) in working on the atomic bomb at the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico.
Speaking about playing the part, the actor and Uncut Gems co-director explained how Nolan wanted him to commit to every detail, including growing some thick, bushy eyebrows.

“I am proud to say that it’s all my eyebrows,” Safdie told Vulture. “Teller had the best eyebrows.
“Every once in a while I have a straggler that I’ll just pluck out, cause it looks a little too crazy. But Chris said, ‘Don’t do that. Let’s just let it go crazy.’ I had the most insane eyebrows for months and months, and you just had to brush them out and then they shined in all their glory.”
Aside from the eyebrows, Safdie said tackling an Austro-Hungarian accent was the biggest challenge in playing Teller. “The accent was something I was so nervous about,” he said. “I remember Chris asking me, ‘How’s the accent coming?’ And I’m just like, ‘Oh my God, how am I going to accomplish this?’
“I didn’t know if he was going to want me to do it. But he sent me all of these interviews and we talked about how Teller speaks and who he is. It was a long process of working together to really nail it down.”
He added: “I remember finally I was like, ‘You know what? I could sound crazy, but I don’t care. This is what Teller sounds like and I’m just going to do it.’ I sent a voice memo where I just narrated what my breakfast was and how Teller really liked pineapple.”

Safdie’s previous acting credits include roles in Licorice Pizza, Stars At Noon and Pieces Of A Woman. He also starred opposite Robert Pattinson in Good Time, which he co-directed with his brother Joshua Safdie.
In a five-star review of Oppenheimer, NME wrote: “Not just the definitive account of the man behind the atom bomb, Oppenheimer is a monumental achievement in grown-up filmmaking. For years, Nolan has been perfecting the art of the serious blockbuster – crafting smart, finely-tuned multiplex epics that demand attention; that can’t be watched anywhere other than in a cinema, uninterrupted, without distractions. But this, somehow, feels bigger.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5tZS5jb20vbmV3cy9maWxtL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLXRvbGQtYmVubnktc2FmZGllLW5vdC10by1wbHVjay1leWVicm93cy0zNDc0ODg10gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The Cillian Murphy starrer now is on the verge of breaking a box office record,"When Christopher Nolan releases a film, it is sure to be an event. The internet phenomenon that was ‘Barbenheimer’ definitely gave Nolan’s Oppenheimer a successful run at the box office.

While the Cillian Murphy starrer was not as successful as its competitor Barbie, which raked in a whopping $775 million, it still earned quite a bit of money. However, the R-rated biopic is close to beating a particular record that was till now in the hands of legendary actor-director Clint Eastwood.
Christopher Nolan V/S Warner Brothers
Ace director Christopher Nolan’s last film was the sci-fi mind-bender, Tenet. The film was released at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, with a lukewarm response. Nolan, who is a huge proponent of the theatrical experience, was disappointed with his usual collaborator Warner Brothers with the way they handled the release. Adding to that, WB took the controversial decision in 2021 to simultaneously release their slate of films on both cinemas and the streaming platform HBO Max. The films included Wonder Woman 1984, Dune Part 1, and more.

Post this fiasco, Christopher Nolan started shopping around his script to other studios. The filmmaker had collaborated with WB on all his films starting from Insomnia. The filmmaker had given the studio many blockbusters such as The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, Interstellar, and more. He had deals such as final-cut privileges, first-dollar gross, and exclusive theatrical windows with the studio. These perks would have to be met by the next studio that Nolan would choose.
In September 2021, Christopher Nolan announced that his next film would be a biopic on J Robert Oppenheimer and that it would be produced and distributed by NBCUniversal. The filmmaker had demanded a $100 million budget and an equal budget for marketing.

Barbenheimer: The Meme Of The Century
Christopher Nolan announced that his film Oppenheimer will be released on July 21, 2023, a favored summer release date of the filmmaker. His previous collaborator Warner Brothers Studios also announced that their adaptation of the Mattel toy Barbie starring Margot Robbie and directed by Greta Gerwig will be released on the same day. Due to its polar opposite nature, with Nolan’s film being a dark exploration of the psyche of the man who created the atomic bomb while Gerwig’s film would be exploring themes of feminism in context to the playing doll, the internet did what it does best. It turned these films into a meme.
Memes hyping up the release along with people planning a double feature event in the cinemas quickly gained traction. People planned outfits that catered to each film and decided to watch both films on the same day. The trend was also exemplified by the cast and crew of both films as they appreciated each others’ works publicly and watched the films.
‘Barbenheimer’ was a huge success as many flocked to the theatres to catch the double feature. AMC Theatres released data saying that the Barbenheimer weekend was the highest-grossing weekend in AMC history. Vue International, a cinema chain said that one-fifth of the audience came for both films.

Oppenheimer Beats The Record
While both films were extremely successful at the box office, Barbie was the clear winner with a $775 million global box office. This was an expected outcome as Barbie was a typical summer blockbuster that featured stars such as Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. Oppenheimer however, was not left behind.
Nolan’s biopic on J Robert Oppenheimer has had a great run at the box office, with the drama grossing over $400 million. This exceeded expectations as the film was rated R and was not an event blockbuster film that is usually released in the summer. Christopher Nolan’s notoriety as well as the presence of stars such as Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Florence Pugh has brought the numbers in.

The film is also on the road to overthrowing veteran actor-director’s film American Sniper as the highest-grossing R-rated biopic. Eastwood’s war movie which starred Bradley Cooper explored the life of a sniper in post-9/11 Iraq. The film grossed a record $550 million at the global box office. Oppenheimer has already beaten the record set by Martin Scorsese with The Wolf of Wall Street. With Christopher Nolan’s biopic grossing $400 million in the second week, it is sufficient to say that the film will soon beat Eastwood’s coveted record.

Some actors are apparently so subtle in their precision that their performances are invisible to the naked eye. ""Oppenheimer"" director Christopher Nolan learned this fact on the set of his 2002 film ""Insomnia,"" in which Al Pacino plays a morally embattled Los Angeles homicide detective sent to investigate a murder in the rural town of Nightmute, Alaska, during midnight sun. Pacino's character required the careful execution of a wide range of emotions, oscillating constantly between avoiding accountability for his crimes and trying to bring a killer to justice — two goals in direct conflict with one another — while suffering from severe sleep deprivation.
As Nolan recalled in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Pacino made acting choices that Nolan couldn't perceive without seeing them on-screen. In response to an adjustment, Pacino had told him, ""I've already done that. You can't see it to the eye, but I've done it on the dailies."" The five-time Academy Award nominee is averse to using monitors on set and thus had to wait to review the footage at the end of the day (referred to as ""dailies"").
""I looked for it and I was like, 'Oh, my God,' because there it was,"" Nolan marveled. ""Great film actors can do that, and that's what I had with Cillian [Murphy]."" During post-production on ""Oppenheimer,"" the director was stunned by the totality of his longtime collaborator's work, sharing, ""The performance became all-enveloping, when I realized Cillian had so much more going on than I saw on set.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvb3Blci5jb20vMTM0MzMzMS9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1jb21wYXJlcy1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1hY3RpbmctYWwtcGFjaW5vLWluc29tbmlhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

9 Prominent Stars Who Brought Their A-Game in Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer
Cillian Murphy:
Being at the forefront of the 3-hour-long biopic, Cillian Murphy arguably delivers one of his best performances to date on the big screen, bringing Nolan’s vision to life. But one of the more impressive feats was the transformation he had undergone for the role, losing a substantial amount of weight in order to replicate J. Robert Oppenheimer’s physique. Although the exact number isn’t known, according to his costars, Cillian Murphy refused dinner invitations every night during the entire production, following his commitment to the job.

Robert Downey Jr:
Witnessing Robert Downey Jr. as something different other than Tony Stark was a breath of fresh air for the fans, and like Cillian Murphy, the Iron Man Star doesn’t pull punches and delivers his absolute best. Playing the role of Lewis Strauss in the film, the actor has delivered one of his best performances since playing Kirk Lazarus in Tropic Thunder. And fans are assured like his role in Tropic Thunder, his work in Oppenheimer too might land him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.
Matt Damon:
Although reports claimed Damon was reportedly taking a break from acting after Air as a negotiation with his wife during a couples therapy session, the chance of working with Nolan was too much to resist. Playing the Manhattan Project director, General Leslie Groves, the actor too doesn’t disappoint in bringing his charm to the character, and his chemistry with Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer was enticing to watch.
Florence Pugh:
As her first partnership with Christopher Nolan, Florence Pugh plays the role of Jean Tatlock in the movie, who is essential to the emotional core of the film. And like her co-stars, Pugh does an exceptional job with the material she is given, making every single scene she is involved in memorable.

Emily Blunt:
it didn’t take a lot of convincing on Christopher Nolan’s part to bring Emily Blunt on board, as reports claimed, after meeting the director in Los Angeles, she instantly accepted the role. In the movie, Blunt plays the role of Katherine Puening, who ties the knot with Oppenheimer, and she also delivers one of the most impactful scenes in the movie.

Tom Conti:
Throughout his brief scenes portraying the theoretical physicist Albert Einstein, Tom Conti partakes in some of the most gut-wrenching scenes in the movie. And the ending scene, involving the duo of him and Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer, it’s not a hot take to say that it will go down as one of the most iconic endings to a Christopher Nolan movie.

Rami Malek:
Following the long list of celebrity brief appearances in the movie, unlike many big-budget Hollywood flicks, every brief moment from these actors have a purpose, including Rami Malek’s David Hill. Although in total, the actor appears for less than 10 minutes in the movie, it doesn’t stop him from delivering his best, as his final scene ultimately decides Lewis Strauss’ fate.
Benny Safdie:
After doing a reference check with director Paul Thomas Anderson, Christopher Nolan picked Benny Safdie to play the father of the hydrogen bomb, Edward Teller. But besides doing a great job bringing the controversial figure to life, the actor was also asked by Nolan to not pluck his eyebrows for months for the movie. “I am proud to say that it’s all my eyebrows,” Safdie stated.
Kenneth Branagh:
It appears Kenneth Branagh is becoming the next constant in Christopher Nolan-led projects, as Oppenheimer marked the third collaboration between the two. Despite having a substantially lesser presence in the film, the actor shines as Niels Bohr in the movie.

But apart from everyone’s brilliance, Nolan deserves the utmost praise for his direction, as he succeeded in bringing the Cillian Murphy-led 3-hour period drama into the mainstream spotlight, which might not have been possible by any other filmmaker.
Oppenheimer is currently in theatres.

In his latest project, Murphy stars in the lead role as J. Robert Oppenheimer in Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer. Having given his all, Murphy talked about how he prepared for the role which will surely leave the fans even more impressed with Cillian Murphy.
Cillian Murphy Was Not Trying To Do An Impression
Since the character of Murphy is based on a real historical figure who was the main man behind the Manhattan Project, Cillian Murphy had to give it his all to portray the character accurately. In a report, the actor talked about the efforts that he had to put in for originality.
As per the reports, to prepare for the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the Batman Begins actor read the biography book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer alongside several others. Not only this, but the actor also worked with physicist Kip Thorne (who previously worked on Interstellar) to help him understand the role better.

“I’m not trying to do an impression of Robert Oppenheimer,” says Murphy. “It’s an Oppenheimer distilled from the Oppenheimer we see in historical materials and the Oppenheimer that I met in Chris’s script. It was a long process of reaching a synthesis of representation and interpretation.”
With the actor having such confidence in himself, fans loved Cillian Murphy in any role that he portrayed. The actor has essentially stated that Nolan’s upcoming magnum opus is essentially a cinematic experience and urged the people to watch it “on the biggest fu*king screen possible”.

Notable for his stunning production design, preferring natural setting over more artificial studio work and CGI, and booming scores, Nolan is never one to be stuck in place, directing everything from trailblazing superhero flicks to intimate biographies, and breakneck thrillers to contemplative sci-fi mind-benders.
Often found working with the same collaborators (including actors Michael Caine - his ""good luck charm"" - Cillian Murphy, Christian Bale and Tom Hardy, as well as cinematographers Wally Pfister and Hoyt van Hoytema), Nolan is a director whose films are recognisable from the first frame, and become more rewarding with time.
His quirks may sometimes get in the way of his lofty intentions - his grand themes, inventive sound mixing and mind-meltingly complex stories occasionally hard to grasp - but he's never been a filmmaker to truly drop the ball, or produce anything less than a deeply personal, impassioned feast for the senses.
With that in mind, in celebration of his latest hit Oppenheimer, here are all 12 of Christopher Nolan's films ranked from worst to best. This list will surely divide, but such is the joy of Christopher Nolan's films: a case could be made for almost any one of them being his one true masterpiece...",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd2hhdGN1bHR1cmUuY29tL2ZpbG0vZXZlcnktY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tbW92aWUtcmFua2VkLXdvcnN0LXRvLWJlc3TSAVNodHRwczovL3doYXRjdWx0dXJlLmNvbS9hbXAvZmlsbS9ldmVyeS1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1tb3ZpZS1yYW5rZWQtd29yc3QtdG8tYmVzdA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

However, it’s not just Murphy who has thrown his hat into the ring for the coveted villain role. David Dastmalchian, known for his role in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, has expressed his ambitious desire to portray a James Bond antagonist.

With unwavering determination, he has personally approached the decision-makers behind 007, pitching himself as an actor capable of pushing the iconic spy to his absolute limits.
As the world awaits the official announcement of the next Bond, Murphy’s stance and his enduring creative partnership with the filmmaker inject a burst of unpredictability into the Bond narrative, leaving us all eager to see what cinematic brilliance lies ahead.

,Oppenheimer movie review & film summary (2023),"A massive, multi-faceted look at the American Prometheus.","Sometimes the close-ups of people's faces are interrupted by flash-cuts of events that haven't happened, or already happened. There are recurring images of flame, debris, and smaller chain-reaction explosions that resemble strings of firecrackers, as well as non-incendiary images that evoke other awful, personal disasters. (There are a lot of gradually expanding flashbacks in this film, where you see a glimpse of something first, then a bit more of it, and then finally the entire thing.) But these don't just relate to the big bomb that Oppenheimer's team hopes to detonate in the desert, or the little ones that are constantly detonating in Oppenheimer's life, sometimes because he personally pushed the big red button in a moment of anger, pride or lust, and other times because he made a naive or thoughtless mistake that pissed somebody off long ago, and the wronged person retaliated with the equivalent of a time-delayed bomb. The ""fissile"" cutting, to borrow a physics word, is also a metaphor for the domino effect caused by individual decisions, and the chain reaction that makes other things happen as a result. This principle is also visualized by repeated images of ripples in water, starting with the opening closeup of raindrops setting off expanding circles on the surface that foreshadow both the ending of Oppenheimer's career as a government advisor and public figure and the explosion of the first nuke at Los Alamos (which observers see, then hear, then finally feel, in all its awful impact).
The weight of the film's interests and meanings are carried by faces—not just Oppenheimer's, but those of other significant characters, including General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Los Alamos' military supervisor; Robert's suffering wife Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt), whose tactical mind could have averted a lot of disasters if her husband would have only listened; and Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), the Atomic Energy Commission chair who despised Oppenheimer for a lot of reasons, including his decision to distance himself from his Jewish roots, and who spent several years trying to derail Oppenheimer's post-Los Alamos career. The latter constitutes its own adjacent full-length story about pettiness, mediocrity, and jealousy. Strauss is Salieri to Oppenheimer's Mozart, regularly and often pathetically reminding others that he studied physics, too, back in the day, and that he's a good person, unlike Oppenheimer the adulterer and communist sympathizer. (This film asserts that Strauss leaked the FBI file on his progressive and communist associations to a third party who then wrote to the bureau's director, J. Edgar Hoover.)
The film speaks quite often of one of the principles of quantum physics, which holds that observing quantum phenomena by a detector or an instrument can change the results of this experiment. The editing illustrates it by constantly re-framing our perception of an event to change its meaning, and the script does it by adding new information that undermines, contradicts, or expands our sense of why a character did something, or whether they even knew why they did it.
That, I believe, is really what ""Oppenheimer"" is about, much more so than the atom bomb itself, or even its impact on the war and the Japanese civilian population, which is talked about but never shown. The film does show what the atom bomb does to human flesh, but it's not recreations of the actual attacks on Japan: the agonized Oppenheimer imagines Americans going through it. This filmmaking decision is likely to antagonize both viewers who wanted a more direct reckoning with the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and those who have bought into the arguments advanced by Strauss and others that the bombs had to be dropped because Japan never would have surrendered otherwise. The movie doesn't indicate whether it thinks that interpretation is true or if it sides more with Oppenheimer and others who insisted that Japan was on its knees by that point in World War II and would have eventually given up without atomic attacks that killed hundreds of thousands of civilians. No, this is a film that permits itself the freedoms and indulgences of novelists, poets, and opera composers. It does what we expect it to do: Dramatize the life of Oppenheimer and other historically significant people in his orbit in an aesthetically daring way while also letting all of the characters and all of the events be used metaphorically and symbolically as well, so that they become pointillistic elements in a much larger canvas that's about the mysteries of the human personality and the unforeseen impact of decisions made by individuals and societies.

2023-07-26 19:37:00.927000+00:00,“Oppenheimer” Is Ultimately a History Channel Movie with Fancy Editing,"Richard Brody on Christopher Nolan’s film “Oppenheimer,” starring Cillian Murphy as the physicist who led the Manhattan Project and helped create the atomic bomb.","Leaving the theatre after seeing “Oppenheimer,” I was tempted to call it a movie-length Wikipedia article. But, after a look online, I realized I was giving Wikipedia too little credit—or Christopher Nolan, the movie’s writer and director, too much. A simple fact-heavy article about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist whose leadership of the Manhattan Project, during the Second World War, produced the atom bomb, turns out to offer more complexity and more enticing detail than Nolan’s script does. And it has more to say about the movie’s essential themes—the ironies and perils that arise when science, ambition, and political power mix—than the movie itself does.
Nolan’s bio-pic, three hours long and based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer-winning biography “American Prometheus,” charts the two main strands of Oppenheimer’s life: the scientific work that made his career and the leftist sympathies that, thanks to the country’s postwar anti-Communist crusade, were to prove his undoing. We meet Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy) as a student making the grand tour of European science capitals, in the nineteen-twenties—Cambridge, Göttingen, Leiden—before returning to the United States and taking up joint appointments at Caltech and Berkeley. At Berkeley, he becomes a union organizer and donates to the anti-Fascist cause in the Spanish Civil War. (The money is conveyed via a Communist-affiliated group.) He hangs out with Communist Party members, including his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold), also a physicist, and Frank’s wife, Jackie (Emma Dumont). Although not himself a Party member, he is spied on by the F.B.I. He meets a Communist medical student named Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and they begin an ill-fated relationship.
In 1942, General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), who is in charge of the Army’s effort to develop a nuclear bomb, taps Oppenheimer to oversee the program. Political suspicion clouds Oppenheimer’s name, but Groves vouches for him. Now Oppenheimer’s scientific life and his political one collide. He proves himself a master not only of the scientific aspects of his assignment but also of its administrative and political dimensions. But, once the Red Scare takes hold, his eminence, his proximity to known Communists, and his postwar efforts to prevent a nuclear-arms race make him an easy target. (He was stripped of his security clearance in 1954.)
The movie is structured as a sort of mosaic. Deftly edited by Jennifer Lame, it intercuts the various periods of Oppenheimer’s life—rise, struggle, fall, aftermath—continually connecting the early leftism and later pacifism with the tribulations during the McCarthy era. It’s natural to figure that such a fractured chronology would have a destabilizing effect—Nolan directed “Memento,” after all—but, in fact, the temporal scheme makes “Oppenheimer” less complex rather than more. The insistence on correlation means that events get reduced to their function within a larger morality tale. Nolan cuts his scenes to fit together like a jigsaw puzzle, and details that don’t fit—contradictions, subtleties, even little random peculiarities—get left out, and, with them, the feeling of experience, whether the protagonist’s or the viewer’s. What remains is a movie to be solved rather than lived.
The crux of “Oppenheimer” is, of course, the tension between the abstractions of physics and the brutal exigencies of war, between the freewheeling researcher and the project manager pursuing worldly goals, between the man of principle and the man whose work is directly responsible for the loss of hundreds of thousands of Japanese lives. Oppenheimer, who is Jewish as well as a leftist, fervently devotes himself to the creation of an atomic bomb because he knows that Nazi Germany is far ahead in developing one and he assumes that Hitler won’t hesitate to use it. Once Germany surrenders—in May, 1945—he gets a shock: work on the bomb not only continues but accelerates. This mission drift poses a moral crisis for Oppenheimer that determines the course of the rest of the film, and of his life. It becomes clear that joining the Manhattan Project has left him tragically compromised, committed to creating a weapon of unparalleled destructiveness while having no say in how it will be used.
Then again, the film is so intent on making Oppenheimer an icon of conflicted conscience that it pays little attention to his character over all. He was a renowned aesthete with a bearing so charismatic that his students would try to emulate it, but we get little more than a couple of artsy name-drops to suggest that he has any cultural life at all. The “overweening ambition” that Groves saw in Oppenheimer is never in evidence, nor is there any mention of his chilling readiness to go along with a plan (one that was never put into action) to poison German food supplies with radioactive strontium. There’s no glimpse of the ailing Oppenheimer, who was suffering from tuberculosis and joint pain even while running Los Alamos. It doesn’t help that Murphy portrays Oppenheimer as wraithlike and haunted, a cipher, a black hole of experience who bears his burdens blankly as he’s buffeted by his circumstances but gives off no energy of his own. The performance, no less than the script, reduces the protagonist to an abstraction created to be analyzed. “Oppenheimer” reveals itself to be, in essence, a History Channel movie. Detached from the rich particulars of personality and thought, the moral dilemmas and historical stakes that Oppenheimer faces are reduced to an interconnected set of trolley problems—with the historical context flattened to green-screen backgrounds.
This moral reckoning is oddly underplayed in the dramatic action of the film, largely because of one specific aesthetic conceit of Nolan’s. After the bombing of Hiroshima, Oppenheimer is brought to speak to a raucously triumphal assembly of Los Alamos employees. His speech betrays no misgivings, but, while he’s at the podium, Nolan shows what Oppenheimer imagines: overwhelming flashes of destruction, conflagrations that burn his audience to cinders. Representing conscience in this way, wordlessly, enables Nolan to fill the screen with visual fizz, but it doesn’t convey the presence, the inner experience, of a true moral reckoning. That’s because images alone—at least, those which Nolan offers here—can’t suggest the interior debates that must be pulsing through such a conflicted mind at this ghastly moment. Perhaps, in a movie that told its story while ranging further into the realm of visual imagination, the decision would come off as an aesthetic commitment. But, given the plethora of dialogue in “Oppenheimer,” Nolan’s choice to convey Oppenheimer’s inner life solely in images comes off as merely a cinematic prejudice. In “Memento,” Nolan was sufficiently interested in his protagonist’s thoughts to let us hear them, as voice-over; all the more puzzling, then, that we are granted no such access to the inner monologue of someone as literate, reflective, and fascinating as Oppenheimer. Although the movie is unusually and even gratifyingly talky, moving most of its action ahead by way of dialogue, we almost never hear Oppenheimer speak about his guilt—not even in intimate discussions with his wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt). The key moment in which he does verbalize misgivings is an encounter with Harry S. Truman, after the end of the war: Oppenheimer admits to feeling as if he has blood on his hands; Truman derisively offers him a handkerchief and then dismisses him as a “crybaby.” The scene is powerful, but its power is limited by Nolan’s failure to convey Oppenheimer’s opinion of the Commander-in-Chief who’d ordered the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The extended scenes of the closed-door security-committee hearing in which Oppenheimer’s political record and personal life are subjected to cruelly intrusive scrutiny come off as a scourging that he endures with a sense of self-punishment. Other scenes, of his persecutor Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), a Cabinet nominee, facing his own intrusive inquiries at a Senate committee hearing, evoke the Machiavellian realm of power into which Oppenheimer, naïvely confident in the wisdom of his mission, has ventured. Yet these notions, too, are unexplored from Oppenheimer’s own perspective. Rather than illuminating him or his times, the scenes seem pitched to spark post-screening debate, to seek an importance beyond the experiences and ideas of the characters.
A hallmark of Nolan’s method—as in such auteur-defining big-budget works as “Inception” and “Interstellar”—is to take the complexities of science, turn them into sensationalist science fiction, and then reinfuse the result with brow-furrowing seriousness. The last step is often achieved by means of chronological or visual intricacies that render objectivity as deep subjective strangeness; strip away such effects, however, and one sees characters conceived in simplistically sentimental terms that are pure melodrama. In “Oppenheimer,” sentimentality and melodrama are in plentiful supply, but visuals less so, with the exception of Oppenheimer’s visions of conflagration. Even these are strangely subdued, generic images of churning fire standing in for the destructive power of atomic weapons—and it is tempting to imagine that Nolan is, in spite of himself, admitting to the incommensurability of cinematic representation for the historic catastrophe of nuclear devastation. For long stretches of the film, Nolan’s direction is a merely literal depiction of actors dispensing dialogue with efficiency but without flair; if his name weren’t attached, the direction might well be ascribed to a serial-television journeyman.
What’s missing, above all, from Nolan’s connect-the-dots version of Oppenheimer’s life is the kind of utterly outlandish detail in which that life abounded. For instance, Nolan shows Oppenheimer, as a student at Cambridge, injecting potassium cyanide into an apple belonging to a professor who humiliates and punishes him for poor laboratory technique—apparently to no consequence. Later, Oppenheimer lets on, in a quick aside, that he was forced into psychoanalysis as a result. In fact, he was threatened with criminal charges and with expulsion, and only the pleas of his father, a prosperous businessman, spared him. In the movie, this reckless, potentially deadly whim comes out of nowhere, but there are plenty of other episodes in Oppenheimer’s life to suggest that a truly violent personality lurked within, as when he physically attacked a friend who announced plans to marry. Nolan shows Oppenheimer to be an eager class participant in his physics tour of Europe; in fact, he was an obnoxiously aggressive one, whose fellow-students signed a petition demanding that the professor silence him. Throughout his life, he was highly mercurial—expansive and sociable and whimsical when the occasion demanded it, as at Los Alamos, where he took a comic role in a play and was an enthusiastic party host.
It wouldn’t have taken a six-hour miniseries to show Oppenheimer from more angles and do justice to his range of character: the movie is as sluggish as if Nolan were underlining the script’s most salient passages onscreen, and, with a more vigorous pace, it could have amplified the script without adding a minute of screen time. As it is, the paucity of teeming, loose-ended details is rendered all the more dismaying by contrast with the movie’s finest touches—particularly one involving Oppenheimer’s brief meeting with the elderly Albert Einstein (Tom Conti). Oppenheimer has come to head up the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey, where Einstein has been seemingly put out to pasture, and the pair discuss guilt and fame, faded glory and the passing of time. In terms of the film’s plot, the scene is insignificant, but the lightning flash of worldly wisdom it offers is exactly what most of the movie fails to give us. Unfortunately, Nolan parsimoniously withholds it to the end—like a banknote that, thanks to the inflation of the rest of the movie, has lost most of its value by the time it’s used. “Oppenheimer” sacrifices much of its dramatic force to the importance of its subject, and to Nolan’s pride at having tackled it—which is to say, to his own self-importance. ♦

2023-07-24 13:00:00+00:00,Oppenheimer and the Dharma of Death,"Christopher Nolan’s massive new movie is a technical marvel, but it lacks its subject’s more metaphysical dimensions.","Early in the morning of July 16, 1945, before the sun had risen over the northern edge of New Mexico’s Jornada Del Muerto desert, a new light—blindingly bright, hellacious, blasting a seam in the fabric of the known physical universe—appeared. The Trinity nuclear test, overseen by theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, had filled the predawn sky with fire, announcing the viability of the first proper nuclear weapon and the inauguration of the Atomic Era. According to Frank Oppenheimer, brother of the “Father of the Bomb,” Robert’s response to the test’s success was plain, even a bit curt: “I guess it worked.”
With time, a legend befitting the near-mythic occasion grew. Oppenheimer himself would later attest that the explosion brought to mind a verse from the Bhagavad Gita, the ancient Hindu scripture: “If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one.” Later, toward the end of his life, Oppenheimer plucked another passage from the Gita: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”
Christopher Nolan’s epic, blockbuster biopic Oppenheimer prints the legend. As Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) gazes out over a black sky set aflame, he hears his own voice in his head: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” The line also appears earlier in the film, as a younger “Oppie” woos the sultry communist moll Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). She pulls a copy of the Bhagavad Gita from her lover’s bookshelf. He tells her he’s been learning how to read Sanskrit. She challenges him to translate a random passage on the spot. Sure enough: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” (That the line comes in a postcoital revery—a state of bliss the French call la petite mort, “the little death”—and amid a longer conversation about the new science of Freudian psychoanalysis—is about as close to a joke as Oppenheimer gets.)
As framed by Nolan, who also wrote the screenplay, Oppenheimer's cursory knowledge of Sanskrit, and Hindu religious tradition, is little more than another of his many eccentricities. After all, this is a guy who took the “Trinity” name from a John Donne poem; who brags about reading all three volumes of Marx’s Das Kapital (in the original German, natch); and, according to Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s biography, American Prometheus, once taught himself Dutch to impress a girl. But Oppenheimer’s interest in Sanskrit, and the Gita, was more than just another idle hobby or party trick.
In American Prometheus, credited as the basis for Oppenheimer, Bird and Sherwin depict Oppenheimer as more seriously committed to this ancient text and the moral universe it conjures. They develop a resonant image, largely ignored in Nolan’s film. Yes, it’s got the quote. But little of the meaning behind it—a meaning that illuminates Oppenheimer’s own conception of the universe, of his place in it, and of his ethics, such as they were.
Composed sometime in the first millennium, the Bhagavad Gita (or “Song of God”) takes the form of a poetic dialog between a warrior-prince named Arjuna and his charioteer, the Hindu deity Krishna, in unassuming human form. On the cusp of a momentous battle, Arjuna refuses to engage in combat, renouncing the thought of “slaughtering my kin in war.” Throughout their lengthy back-and-forth (unfolding over some 700 stanzas), Krishna attempts to ease the prince’s moral dilemma by attuning him to the grander design of the universe, in which all living creatures are compelled to obey dharma, roughly translated as “virtue.” As a warrior, in a war, Krishna maintains that it is Arjuna’s dharma to serve, and fight; just as it is the sun’s dharma to shine and water’s dharma to slake the thirsty.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1yZXZpZXctYmhhZ2F2YWQtZ2l0YS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,‘Oppenheimer’ review: Nolan brings complex humanity to picture of Princeton resident,"“But beyond the film’s proximity to our community and the social media frenzy of Barbenheimer, the question remains: is it any good?”","It has been the summer of Princeton at the movies. The University was mentioned in the animated smash-hit “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” and Jennifer Lawrence’s hilarious “No Hard Feelings,” but only one filmmaker had the unadulterated vision to put boots on the ground, and that was the one and only Christopher Nolan. One could say that Princetonians were on the “Oppenheimer” hype-train well before the general public (all the way back in April 2022), and for good reason — it’s not every day that a Hollywood production blocks your way to language class. The scene was not one for the cutting room floor: East Pyne can be seen clearly early in the movie, and the nearby Institute for Advanced Study is the location of some of the movie’s most memorable scenes. But beyond the film’s proximity to our community and the social media frenzy of Barbenheimer, the question remains: is it any good?
I am pleased to report that yes, Christopher Nolan delivers in this excellent nuclear opus. After “Tenet,” a film that gave the impression Nolan might have forgotten the humanity required to ground his always high concept work, “Oppenheimer” is built on introspection. The central conflict of the movie is within the protagonist, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and is not the race against the Nazis or the continuous full-contact politicking. The weight of the narrative falls upon Cillian Murphy — specifically his face. Murphy’s cold blue eyes are shot on 70mm IMAX by director of photography Hoyte van Hoytema. They consume the screen and lock the viewer into the three-hour behemoth of a character study.

The movie is long, and if I had one central complaint, it is that it feels its length at certain points. The editing and music do a lot to keep the film moving at a breakneck pace, but a three-hour psychological drama about the fate of mankind takes its toll on you. However, this story deserves to be told in its entirety at the highest caliber of filmmaking, which is accomplished by Nolan. Thus, I can forgive its runtime, especially when it sticks such an accomplished landing. There were moments when I thought I would never see the end credits of this movie, but when they finally arrived, I was shaken to my core. In fact, Nolan leaves the viewer with such a haunting final message that I woke up the next morning with a pit in my stomach. More on that later.
Certainly, the film is largely the Nolan and Murphy show, but like all films, it is a team effort. Robert Downey Jr. gives an incredible supporting performance with far more screen time than I expected — this is a packed ensemble in which A-listers and Oscar winners are essentially given cameo roles. Matt Damon provides enough comedic charm to uplift the heavier scenes. Emily Blunt is wounded but strong in the role of Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty (although the film’s female characters certainly take the backseat despite the screenplay’s insistence of their academic prowess and qualifications). Finally, as previously mentioned, the score by Ludwig Goransson and the editing by Jennifer Lame intertwine different timelines and perspectives effectively, all while building a haunting atmosphere.
J. Robert Oppenheimer is a particularly difficult character to build a film around. This is the man who introduced nuclear weapons to the world. Nolan, in a smart creative choice, takes a mixed approach to his central character. He makes it clear that Oppenheimer is manipulated by the US government. To the many bureaucrats in the film, he is simply a pawn to be used and disposed of immediately after. President Harry S. Truman even memorably calls him a crybaby. The audience can root for a man against the might of McCarthy era anti-communist fervor.
On the other hand, Oppenheimer is an impulsive, erratic spirit. He is a serial adulterer and, in an early scene involving a tutor’s apple and some cyanide, someone capable of impulsively committing acts of violence. Such is the hypocrisy of J. Robert Oppenheimer; he lacks foresight and self-control, but then laments his actions afterward. He creates the atomic bomb, but only questions its use after it drops. Like the flaming column of a mushroom cloud, Oppenheimer burns bright, but he is caught off-guard by the shockwave that follows. Nolan understands the contradiction and does not let the man off easily.
The film ends with a horrifying prediction. Each character would like to believe that they dropped the atom bomb and got away with it. The sky did not combust, the world did not end. They can grow old and rest on their laurels — content with the global peace that followed World War II. However, Nolan argues that the shoe has yet to drop. That the future is more foreboding than the past ever was. It is forever disturbed, like raindrops falling on a still pond.

2023-07-12 13:30:03+00:00,‘A spectacular achievement’: first reactions praise Oppenheimer,"Christopher Nolan’s $100m epic, out 21 July in the US, has premiered to acclaim with some calling it his finest film to date","Christopher Nolan’s epic drama Oppenheimer has received a string of positive notices after a Paris premiere.
The film, with a budget of $100m, stars Cillian Murphy as J Robert Oppenheimer, seen as the “father of the atomic bomb”. The cast also includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh and Robert Downey Jr.
Vulture critic Bilge Ebiri has called the film “incredible”, tweeting that it’s a “relentlessly paced, insanely detailed, intricate historical drama that builds and builds and builds until Nolan brings the hammer down in the most astonishing, shattering way”.
Associated Press writer Lindsey Bahr tweeted that the three-hour film is “a spectacular achievement, in its truthful, concise adaptation, inventive storytelling and nuanced performances”. She also called it “a serious, philosophical, adult drama that’s as tense and exciting as Dunkirk”.
The Los Angeles Times film editor, Joshua Rothkopf, has also called it “incredible” while critic Kenneth Turan described it as Nolan’s “most impressive film to date”. MTV’s Joshua Horowitz tweeted: “Impeccable immersive filmmaking of the highest order. Cillian Murphy gets the role he deserves. In love with Downey’s work. This one demands your attention.”
Oppenheimer is currently tracking to open to $40-50m in its US debut on 21 July but faces stiff competition from Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, which opens on the same day.
It marks Nolan’s first film for Universal Pictures after parting ways with Warner Bros. The new deal reportedly comes with a number of specific demands such as a theatrical window of at least 100 days before any form of digital release and a three-week period before the studio releases another film.
“It feels sometimes like a biopic, sometimes like a thriller, sometimes like a horror,” Murphy said to the Guardian. “It’s going to knock people out.”
In an interview with Wired, Nolan said: “Some people leave the movie absolutely devastated. They can’t speak. I mean, there’s an element of fear that’s there in the history and there in the underpinnings. But the love of the characters, the love of the relationships, is as strong as I’ve ever done.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjMvanVsLzEyL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLW1vdmllLXJlYWN0aW9ucy1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1yZWxlYXNl0gFiaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2ZpbG0vMjAyMy9qdWwvMTIvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbW92aWUtcmVhY3Rpb25zLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLXJlbGVhc2U?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Sure, it came in a distant second to “Barbie” both weekends, but with an estimated $174 million at the domestic box office thus far, it’s more than on pace to become the biggest movie of all time to never win a weekend.
The unofficial, counterintuitive, and highly-unusual “Barbenheimer” marketing campaign (“contrast the glittery comedy with a drama about the atomic bomb”) certainly helped this film’s box office, but it’s a strong enough movie that I’d like to think that it could have been a hit even without its unlikely pink ally.
Cillian Murphy (who I could tell from the first publicity photo was perfect, Oscar-ready casting) stars as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man credited as the “father of the atomic bomb.” Much like “The Social Network,” the film intercuts its usually-linear historical portion with the framing device of two hearings, one involving Oppenheimer himself, the other involving nemesis Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.
As Strauss is not a scientist himself, he and Oppenheimer never get along well professionally, but after a perceived derogatory comment made toward Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), he has it in for Oppenheimer personally.
Much of the movie is standard biopic territory: we follow Oppenheimer from his days at Cambridge, getting advice from Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branaugh) to his role as director of The Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where the bomb was designed and built.
In his personal life, Robert takes up a relationship with the married Kitty (Emily Blunt) while having an affair with Communist sympathizer Jean (Florence Pugh). Oppenheimer and his colleagues go through the expected setbacks and successes, culminating in a high-stakes demonstration and one of the most massive explosions ever put on film.

Soon the bomb is taken away from the scientists and used in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, and Oppenheimer has to forever live with the knowledge that he played an integral role in arguably the most devastating event in human history.
There’s surprisingly little violence in the film, outside of an offscreen suicide and a sequence where Oppenheimer imagines the effects of the bomb. There isn’t even that much “action,” really, unless you count carefully orchestrated test explosions.
But make no mistake, this is one of the most intense films of the year. Sure, some of it has to do with the urgency of the arms race and the stakes involved, but it’s more than that. Director Christopher Nolan knows how to expertly craft a thriller, and his tight pacing and editing will make your heart pound whether it’s bombs or tempers that are flaring.
I’ll be honest, a lot about “Oppenheimer” went over my head, from science to politics to legalese to history. And even if I did know more about all these subjects, I still might get overwhelmed by the film’s crowded cast and all the time-jumping.
Yet there was never any doubt that what was happening was of great importance, whether to world powers or the world of one. And it’s all done with Nolan’s trademark crispness. The bomb-building and hearings may not be pretty or “sleek” necessarily, but you’ll get the impression that these things cannot be done by anyone other than the people doing them.
If you’re looking for a “party” movie where everyone will find something to enjoy while they socialize and pay minimal attention, then “Barbie” is the way to go there. But if you’re ready to be transfixed by a film that will occasionally blow you to the back of your seat (seriously, this is the time to spring for a premium theater experience like IMAX), then “Oppenheimer” is the movie of the summer, maybe the year.
Grade: B
“Oppenheimer” is rated R for some sexuality, nudity, and language. Its running time is an even 180 minutes, in a precision that seems only fitting.

,How fear of nuclear war (and Sting) inspired Oppenheimer,Christopher Nolan first became interested in J. Robert Oppenheimer through a fear of nuclear war and the lyrics of Sting.,"Oppenheimer writer-director Christopher Nolan initially became interested in physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called ""father of the atomic bomb,"" back in the '80s thanks to the then prevalent fear of nuclear war and the erudite wordsmithery of pop superstar Sting.
""I first heard about Oppenheimer when I was a kid,"" says the Inception director, 52, during EW's Around the Table conversation with Nolan and Oppenheimer stars Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr. ""That Sting song 'Russians' refers to Oppenheimer's 'deadly toys.' I was growing up in the U.K. at a time when people were very concerned about nuclear armaments. When I was 12 or 13, myself and my friends were absolutely convinced that we were going to experience a nuclear war at some point in our lives. Oppenheimer stuck with me as a figure and I learned more about him over the years.""

One of the things which Nolan learned, and would include in the finished film, was the revelation that the scientists who worked at the Los Alamos-based Manhattan Project believed there was a chance the detonation of the first atomic bomb would cause a planet-destroying chain reaction in the atmosphere. ""They couldn't completely eliminate the possibility,"" says Nolan. ""For me, that was kind of the hook. It's such a dramatic moment. I referred to it in my last film, Tenet. (In the 2020 movie, Dimple Kapadia's arms dealer Priya tells John David Washington's character, 'Oppenheimer became concerned that the detonation might produce a chain reaction, engulfing the world.') I'm just very interested in taking the audience into that room, and being there, and kind of living in that moment. What would that have been like to push that button, knowing there was any possibility of that?""
Oppenheimer is based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin's Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, which further enlightened Nolan on his subject.
""One of the first things I grabbed hold of from the book, as I was reading it the first time, was you realize that Los Alamos, which would become so important in history, is just this place [where] he and his brother liked to go camping,"" says Nolan. ""That connection, the personal with the historic, I thought was really engaging.""
Oppenheimer drops in theaters July 21.

7/21/2023 17:03,"Review: Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer starring Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and half of Hollywood thoroughly wades through the life of ""the father of the atomic bomb"", J. Robert Oppenheimer",,"Films about Great Men are usually acts of hagiography, and in many ways, Oppenheimer is no different. Christopher Nolan’s biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, “the father of the atomic bomb”, is invested in Oppenheimer as a once-in-a-generation genius, a Great Man who literally moved the earth, but Nolan is also interested in all of Oppenheimer’s failures and foibles. And I do mean ALL of them, at a monster 180 minutes, Oppenheimer wades through the tides of Oppenheimer’s life if not at a leisurely pace, then certainly at a thorough one. We learn that “Oppy” is brilliant at theoretical physics but bad at math and a liability in the lab, he’s a womanizer, a bad dad and worse husband, and a big enough believer in his own importance to underestimate his own political liabilities.
Cillian Murphy plays Oppenheimer with a bright-eyed intensity and steely fortitude in turns, as he portrays the man from his student days in Europe to his post-war downfall. Nolan divides his film into three sections, one centered on a post-war hearing to renew, or not, Oppenheimer’s government security clearance; another focused on his days heading the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico; and the final section, told in black and white, from the perspective of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.) during his own senate confirmation hearing to join Eisenhower’s cabinet.
Oppenheimer is a big film, not just in minutes but in scope of story and scale of ambition. It covers decades and monumental moments in history, but also makes room for more personal moments, such as Oppenheimer’s disastrous affair with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), a gifted but troubled psychiatrist and Communist activist. Nolan, working from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s epic biography, American Prometheus, is interested in the contrast of Oppenheimer the Great Man and Oppenheimer the Lousy Asshole, though there is enough sympathy for Oppenheimer the Guy Who Changed His Mind Later that even Oppenheimer’s worst traits are a little rose-colored.
Which parts of Oppenheimer appeal the most is entirely personal. I responded most to the later portion of the film focused on Lewis Strauss’s confirmation hearing. Oppenheimer isn’t even in this portion of the film, he only appears in black and white flashbacks as Strauss recalls their fraught history to a young senate aide (Alden Ehrenreich, absolutely stealing the show). Strauss personally recruited Oppenheimer to Princeton University, but after seeing Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) in conversation, and then being ignored by Einstein, he takes a strong dislike to Oppenheimer, believing the other man turned Einstein against him.
Nolan, one of the most exacting filmmakers working today, recreates Los Alamos in painstaking detail (with production design by Ruth De Jong and set decoration by Claire Kaufman, Olivia Peebles, and Adam Willis), and re-stages the Trinity Test—minus the nuclear material—to its fullest effect. It is terrible, it is monstrous, it is awesome in the Biblical sense of the word—it is not more horrifying than even one single image of the real devastation visited upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The Manhattan Project portion of the film offers a lot of interesting stuff, from the recreated Trinity Test to Oppenheimer’s hideous home life—set to a soundtrack of screaming babies and his wife’s functional alcoholism—to Matt Damon’s reliably charming performance as the Army general tasked with keeping all these half-Commie scientists in line during the war. There is also a lot of time devoted to Oppenheimer sowing the seeds of his own destruction, as he dabbles in left-wing politics—mostly harmless before the war, but utterly devastating during the Red Scare that comes after. As smart as he is, Oppenheimer truly cannot read the room, whether it’s attending socialist rallies at the wrong moment or inadvertently betraying a friend as a possible spy.
But this portion of the film is also the most rote biopic stuff in Oppenheimer. It’s very well crafted and extremely well-acted, and it’s not exactly boring, it’s just that it doesn’t top a single line delivered during the “senate hearing” portion of the film. Oppenheimer’s security clearance hearing at least has a truly great scene with Emily Blunt as Kitty, Oppenheimer’s long-suffering wife, a talented scientist in her own right relegated to the kitchen by The Times. That scene crackles with Kitty’s repressed fury—at her husband, at the men undermining him, at the world undermining her—and comes closest to the stellar line from the senate hearing.
That line, though, it just overshadows everything, even the big bomb drop. “Did you ever stop to think,” the disillusioned aide says to Strauss, “that they didn’t talk about you at all? That they had more important things to talk about?” A lesser actor than Alden Ehrenreich would make a meal out of that line, but he delivers it with devastating casualness, as if it’s so obvious a thought it isn’t even worth the breath it takes to utter it. In truth, no one knows what Oppenheimer and Einstein talked about that day at Princeton, but Lewis Strauss built his reality around the idea that it was him. How silly of him! How asinine!
At its best, Oppenheimer is not a Great Man biopic, it’s not a technical marvel of filmmaking, it’s not a cracking thriller about the race to end World War II, and it’s definitely not a meditation on the consequences of using nuclear weapons. At its best, Oppenheimer is a story about small, petty men changing the world for the worse because they cannot fathom that THEY are not the center of it. It’s a cautionary tale less about nuclear power and more about the deleterious effect of self-important men on those around them. Oppenheimer dismisses Einstein as the best mind of his generation, past his prime and no longer on the cutting edge, but Einstein is, in fact, old enough to know that it’s not about him, a lesson literally no other man in this film learns until it’s too late.
Oppenheimer is good enough, and long enough, that everyone will have a different favorite part, though I suspect what will linger longest is not the history lesson, or the cinematic gee-whizzery, but the look on Strauss’s face when someone points out that maybe he wasn’t the main character all along. Sometimes, a person comes along and can change the world as J. Robert Oppenheimer did, ushering in the nuclear age. But always there are those men like Lewis Strauss, manipulating people and events to satisfy their vindicative agendas made up of imagined slights. We only have to cope with a transformative genius like Oppenheimer occasionally—and sometimes they even improve the world, with art and music and beauty—but we always have to navigate the detritus of the aggrieved egos of men like Strauss. Oppenheimer is about genius, about a man, about a bomb, but it’s also about the waste laid to the world by weak men.
This review was published during the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes of 2023. The work being reviewed would not exist without the labor of writers and actors. Oppenheimer is exclusively in theaters from July 21, 2023.

2023-07-28 11:09:55.035000+00:00,Cillian Murphy Says Oppenheimer Sex Scenes With Florence Pugh Were 'Vital' to the Plot,"Cillian Murphy has shared his views on the divisive sex scenes in Christopher Nolan's big-screen biopic Oppenheimer, admitting that they were ""awkward"" to film but ""vital"" to the plot.","Warning: The following contains minor story spoilers for Oppenheimer.
Cillian Murphy has shared his views on the divisive sex scenes in Christopher Nolan's big-screen biopic Oppenheimer, admitting they were ""awkward"" to film but ""vital"" to the plot.
Murphy plays J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist commonly regarded as one of the ""fathers of the atomic bomb"", while Florence Pugh stars as Jean Tatlock, a fellow physician who was romantically involved with Oppenheimer before and during his marriage to Katherine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer.
Oppenheimer and Tatlock's tryst inspires many intimate moments between the pair, including a prolonged sex scene, the first ever to be directed by Nolan. Murphy admitted no actor ""likes"" filming explicit scenes, but he thought they were ""worthwhile"" in Oppenheimer's case because they were crucial to the story.
""I think they were vital in this in this movie,"" Murphy told GQ. ""I think the relationship that he has with Jean Tatlock is one of the most crucial emotional parts of the film. I think if they're key to the story, then they're worthwhile. Listen, no one likes doing them. They're the most awkward possible part of our job. But sometimes you have to get on with it.""

Murphy's comments echo those of Nolan, who previously told Insider the sex scenes were an ""essential"" part of Oppenheimer's story as they offered insight into the type of character he was, especially in his private life and romantic relationships.
""When you look at Oppenheimer's life, and you look at his story, that aspect of his life, the aspect of his sexuality, his way with women, the charm that he exuded, it's an essential part of his story,"" Nolan said. ""It felt very important to understand their relationship and to really see inside it and understand what made it tick without being coy or allusive about it — but to try to be intimate, to try and be in there with him and fully understand the relationship that was so important to him.""
The R-rated scenes sparked controversy and discourse about whether they were necessary for the movie, with some countries opting to censor the intimate moments in Nolan's three-hour epic. Specifically, a nude scene involving Pugh's character is said to have been altered in India and the Middle East to depict her wearing a dress.
Oppenheimer is an adaptation of the 2005 Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer and is generally faithful to real-life events. However, Charles Oppenheimer, grandson of the famed nuclear physicist, would have preferred the poison apple scene to be left out.
Nolan's biographical drama makes up one part of the 'Barbenheimer' cinematic experience, a phenomenon that has left box office analysts reeling. Since its release, Oppenheimer has received rave reviews from critics and fans alike, with IGN describing the movie as a ""jolting thriller"" that is ""big, bold, and surprisingly intimate"".

2023-07-21 11:00:00+00:00,"‘Oppenheimer’ is Robert Downey Jr.’s Best Role in Many, Many Years","With no glint of Iron Man’s suit in sight, the actor approaches a role with depth and, more importantly, restraint","Oppenheimer is light on laughs, but in its final moments, there’s something that comes close to one (at least, in my screening at Waterloo’s IMAX, a few people chortled: it’s a long film, perhaps they were tired). It does not belong to man of the three hours J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), but Robert Downey Jr.’s character, Charles Strauss, who manages to paint himself, with an exquisite flair for self-sabotage, into a corner. At the end of Christopher Nolan’s film, it’s a rare moment of levity: a welcome release after many sequences of frantic laboratory research and boardroom debates. It also, handily, provides Downey Jr. the opportunity do his best work in years.
The biopic-cum-thriller-cum-science lesson, which is out today, charts the uh, explosive success of the American scientist, who studied at multiple esteemed institutions – including England’s very own Cambridge University, where he tried to murder his teacher with a poisoned apple – before settling at Los Alamos Laboratory in the Californian desert to begin the work for which he is most (in)famous: The Manhattan Project. Though the rough beats of this story are well-known for anyone who has ever taken a GCSE History lesson, Nolan brings some of the political intrigue to a wider audience. Well, wider: the film is adapted from the 2005 Pulitzer Prize-winning book entitled American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer (phew! They sure know how to write a book title!), which explores Oppenheimer’s studies, political interests, personal relationships, and legacy.
One beat that plays particularly well on the big screen is Oppenheimer’s relationship to ambitious career politician Strauss. Nolan clearly thought so, as a lot of the film’s momentum is borne from the pair’s disagreements. While Oppenheimer touches on their linked heritage – both men descend from Jewish families, at a time where there is open hostility overseas and more concealed discrimination at home – Strauss is necessarily flattened into an antagonist. With his conservative values, he dislikes the liberal Oppenheimer, though the thrust of their antagonism stems from the hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer was against developing a weapon even more powerful than the atomic bomb, while Strauss was in favour of exactly that. The film’s structure, which comprises some deftly-handled timelines, does draw out Strauss’ complications: a moral duty, his external ambitions, deep insecurity. (The final of these traits provides the film with a through-line involving Einstein.)

Downey Jr. is barely recognisable. With slick-backed grey hair, receded hairline and horn-rimmed glasses, he doesn’t look much like Downey Jr. the person, and even less like Downey Jr. the very famous actor. I am not sure if you have spent much time on Robert Downey Jr.’s IMDB page, but the broad brush strokes of his career are well-known: young success in films like Less Than Zero (the adaptation of Brett Easton Ellis’ debut novel) was followed by substance abuse issues before a career comeback in the mid-2000s. His renaissance – before Matthew McConaughey’s, if you can believe it – was marked by an was Oscar-nominated role in Tropic Thunder (the film itself has aged less well) and as scene-stealing journalist Paul Avery in Zodiac (this film has aged pretty well).
The following two decades have been marked by some serious creative troughs. There were attempts at critical acclaim (Joe Wright’s The Soloist), complete misfires (Dolittle) and imprisonment by a very red, very shiny, very constrictive suit. There are three Iron Man films, three Avengers films, and he appears in a Captain America doo-dah, too. It says a lot about Downey Jr.’s output in this year that his best work was in a retelling of Sherlock Holmes (which is actually watchable stuff).
Oppenheimer, then, allows Downey Jr. to inhabit a new character completely, one that doesn’t rely on his rough and ready charm, and actually manages to work against his likability. Perhaps that’s the privilege of ageing. It is certainly a refreshingly grown-up role for the 58-year-old, a part which relies on what he does not say, rather than what he does. Downey Jr. has likened the roles of Oppenheimer and Strauss to Mozart and Salieri. That shorthand – evoking the fictional rivalry between true-genius Mozart and successful-in-his-time Salieri – almost works, though in this film, Strauss mostly just fails. It’s to Downey Jr.’s credit that Strauss is a compelling villain, rather than a cliché one.

,Oppenheimer fans are paying hundreds to see the movie in IMAX 70mm,The Eras Tour for film buffs: Moviegoers are willing to pay hundreds of dollars on third-party resale sites to see 'Oppenheimer' in IMAX 70mm.,"The movie event of the summer has officially arrived. There's just one problem: It's basically impossible to get good seats.
Since its premiere last weekend, tickets for Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer have been selling fast. But while it's easy for any schmuck to see the epic biopic in digital, Nolan has made it clear that the best way to see his film is in IMAX 70mm — a format that only 30 locations in the U.S. are capable of playing. The exclusivity has made this the most coveted movie ticket of the summer, with fans willing to pay hundreds of dollars for a chance to see the movie in its intended format.

On Monday, a Craigslist post selling eight 70mm IMAX tickets for the whopping price of $1,400 went viral on social media. The seats in a Midtown Manhattan theater were in the fourth row, ""perfect center"" and could not be sold separately.
The post has since been deleted (leaving us to wonder if someone really spent more than a grand on movie tickets), but plenty more tickets are being resold and requested on third-party websites like Craigslist and eBay.
One eBay sale lists two mid-August tickets with a starting bid of $499. Over on Craigslist, there are a few reasonably-priced tickets — like a fair $20 for IMAX seats in Grand Rapids, Mich. — while others bump the price significantly. Some fans are even posting Wanted ads, seeking out those willing to part with their tickets.
""Will pay over retail up to $150+ for good seats and date,"" wrote one anonymous Bay Area user. Elsewhere, a New Yorker is requesting two seats for any Aug. 6 showing, promising to pay a total of $300.
Starring Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr, the movie tells the story of Robert J. Oppenheimer (Murphy), long known as ""the Father of the Atomic Bomb."" Despite not having the franchise or family appeal of most summer blockbusters, the film cracked $80.5 million in its opening weekend. The phenomenon is partially due to the Barbenheimer craze, which involves pairing the biopic with Barbie for a bizarre double feature.
In a promo for the film, the cast and crew made a point of highlighting the allure of seeing the film on the biggest screen possible.
""Oppenheimer's story is one of the biggest stories imaginable,"" Nolan said. ""Our film tries to take you into his experience, and IMAX for me is a portal into a level of emotion that you can't get from other formats.""
The filmmaker continued, ""IMAX 70mm is the highest-quality imaging format that's ever been devised. It allows you to fully immerse yourself in the story. When the audience is able to see this in IMAX, on the big screen, they will be able to experience an extraordinary moment in human history.""

2023-07-17 09:00:32+00:00,Kai Bird on Christopher Nolan's ‘Oppenheimer’ - The New York Times,Christopher Nolan’s film delves deeply into what this country did to its most famous scientist.,"Einstein was right. Oppenheimer was foolishly subjecting himself to a kangaroo court in which he was soon stripped of his security clearance and publicly humiliated. The charges were flimsy, but by a vote of 2 to 1 the security panel of the Atomic Energy Commission deemed Oppenheimer a loyal citizen who was nevertheless a security risk: “We find that Dr. Oppenheimer’s continuing conduct and association have reflected a serious disregard for the requirements of the security system.” The scientist would no longer be trusted with the nation’s secrets. Celebrated in 1945 as the “father of the atomic bomb,” nine years later he would become the chief celebrity victim of the McCarthyite maelstrom.
Oppenheimer may have been naïve, but he was right to fight the charges — and right to use his influence as one of the country’s pre-eminent scientists to speak out against a nuclear arms race. In the months and years leading up to the security hearing, Oppenheimer had criticized the decision to build a “super” hydrogen bomb. Astonishingly, he had gone so far as to say that the Hiroshima bomb was used “against an essentially defeated enemy.” The atomic bomb, he warned, “is a weapon for aggressors, and the elements of surprise and terror are as intrinsic to it as are the fissionable nuclei.” These forthright dissents against the prevailing view of Washington’s national security establishment earned him powerful political enemies. That was precisely why he was being charged with disloyalty.
It is my hope that Christopher Nolan’s stunning new film on Oppenheimer’s complicated legacy will initiate a national conversation not only about our existential relationship to weapons of mass destruction, but also the need in our society for scientists as public intellectuals. Mr. Nolan’s three-hour film is a riveting thriller and mystery story that delves deeply into what this country did to its most famous scientist.
Sadly, Oppenheimer’s life story is relevant to our current political predicaments. Oppenheimer was destroyed by a political movement characterized by rank know-nothing, anti-intellectual, xenophobic demagogues. The witch-hunters of that season are the direct ancestors of our current political actors of a certain paranoid style. I’m thinking of Roy Cohn, Senator Joseph McCarthy’s chief counsel, who tried to subpoena Oppenheimer in 1954, only to be warned that this could interfere with the impending security hearing against Oppenheimer. Yes, that Roy Cohn, who taught former President Donald Trump his brash, wholly deranged style of politics. Just recall the former president’s fact-challenged comments on the pandemic or climate change. This is a worldview proudly scornful of science.
After America’s most celebrated scientist was falsely accused and publicly humiliated, the Oppenheimer case sent a warning to all scientists not to stand up in the political arena as public intellectuals. This was the real tragedy of Oppenheimer. What happened to him also damaged our ability as a society to debate honestly about scientific theory — the very foundation of our modern world.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTcvb3Bpbmlvbi9rYWktYmlyZC1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Oppenheimer actors leave London premiere early 'to write picket signs',Cillian Murphy and 'Oppenheimer' costars left the London premiere to show support for the actors' union strike after attending the red carpet.,"The stars of director Christopher Nolan's new film Oppenheimer left the London premiere of the movie early on Thursday ahead of the Screen Actors Guild strike announcement.
Cast members Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Hartnett, and Rami Malek were all present to be photographed at the event, which began an hour earlier than had been scheduled because of the impending strike action, but the actors did not appear onstage with Nolan at Leicester Square's Odeon Luxe cinema.

According to footage from the event posted on Twitter by Deadline, Nolan first praised his cast and then explained that their absence was because of the likely strike action, which the filmmaker said he also supported.
""I have to acknowledge the work of our incredible cast, led by Cillian Murphy,"" says the director in the clip. ""The list is enormous. Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek, and so many more. And we have to acknowledge, you've seen them here earlier on the red carpet, unfortunately, they're off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by SAG, joining my guild, one of my guilds, the writers' guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of their union, and we support them.""
SAG-AFTRA's national board voted unanimously to launch the guild's first strike, the union's President Fran Drescher and National Executive Director & Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland announced Thursday.
After failing to reach a deal with the Alliance of Motion Pictures and Television Producers (AMPTP) when their June 30 contract deadline expired, the guild extended the negotiation period through July 12, but they were still unable to negotiate a contract that was agreeable to both parties. Their sister union, the Writers' Guild of America, has been on strike since May 1.
""It came with great sadness that we came to this crossroads. But we had no choice. We are the victims here,"" Drescher said during Thursday's press conference. ""We are being victimized by a very greedy entity. I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us. I cannot believe it, quite frankly. How far apart we are on so many things. How they plead poverty, that they're losing money left and right while giving hundreds and millions of dollars to their CEOS. It is disgusting. Shame on them. They stand on the wrong side of history at this very moment.""
In Nolan's film, Murphy plays theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called ""Father of the atomic bomb."" Oppenheimer is released July 21.

President Joe Biden indulged in a movie night on the same night that former President Donald Trump was indicted. He saw Oppenheimer and gave his review of Christopher Nolan's latest.
On August 1, Biden and the First Lady attended a public screening of Oppenheimer at Atlantic Theaters Movies in Rehoboth Beach, DE. The couple have been vacationing there this week.
After the screening, Biden called the film “compelling.” A reporter added that the Bidens sat in the seventh row and had half of it to themselves. They also sat through the entire three-hour runtime without getting up at all.
Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan's latest film and follows the career of its titular physicist (played by Cillian Murphy). Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr., and Rami Malek also lead the A-list ensemble.
The film was released on July 21, creating the “Barbenheimer” phenomenon as it shared its release date with Barbie. Greta Gerwig's film has been the main subject of news as it has dominated the box office — grossing nearly $800 million already — but that doesn't mean that Oppenheimer hasn't been a resounding success for Universal. The film has grossed $412 million to date after an $82.4 million domestic opening — taking full advantage of its IMAX screenings.
It's great to hear that even President Joe Biden is supporting local movie theaters. The White House screens films, but Biden proved to be just like so many others by visiting his local movie theater to see Oppenheimer. Now the question remains of whether or not he's seen Barbie.

2023-07-24 11:28:17-04:00,The Barbenheimer Exit Survey,The most important movie weekend in a long time finally came and went. It’s time to dig into the grand occasion that was ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer.’,"After months of hype and hundreds (thousands?) of memes, Barbenheimer finally arrived. Did the spectacle live up to the hype? Who was the MVP of the entire weekend? And, of course, which movie was actually better? The Ringer staff has thoughts on all of that, and more.
1. What is your tweet-length review of Barbie?
Jomi Adeniran: Cinema.
Riley McAtee: Seeing Barbie in a packed theater with an audience decked out in all pink was special. Movies are back!
Kai Grady: Barbie is a pure joy from start to finish. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling gave Oscar-worthy performances that are both laugh-out-loud funny and genuinely moving. The immaculate production and costume design of Barbie Land (and Kendom) are striking and a sight to behold. Greta Gerwig is three for three.
Kat Spillane: Barbie, a movie designed to show that even Margot Robbie can have an existential crisis while listening to the Indigo Girls. Stars, they’re just like us.
Arjuna Ramgopal: Barbie is a rare IP movie that is fun and touching, even if it just misses out on being one of the year’s best.
Austin Gayle: It’s two perfect performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. It’s also a pink Mattel™ teeter-totter rocking back and forth between clever, campy funny and too-stupid-for-me funny. But because they (very ambitiously) try to make it so much more than a toy commercial, Gerwig and Noah Baumbach overstuff the script at times.
2. And what is your tweet-length review of Oppenheimer?
Spillane: I would watch six-plus hours of Cillian Murphy tastefully smoking cigarettes on 70-mm IMAX. Oh, and it’s hard to be a brilliant man talking in rooms with other brilliant men.
Adeniran: MF-ING CINEMA.
Ramgopal: A return to form for Christopher Nolan. Oppenheimer is a tour de force of performances, even if the third act is a bit forced.
McAtee: Nolan is incapable of getting out of his own way. Oppenheimer was technically impressive and stylistically engaging, but it proceeded at such an astounding pace that there was no time to connect with any of the characters. That’s a pretty big problem for a movie that is essentially a character study!
Gayle: The first two hours of the movie strap you into a race-ready Bugatti with Murphy at the wheel and an atom bomb on the pedal. It’s wholly stunning, captivating, astonishing. But Nolan feathers the brakes a bit after the remarkable, horrifying Oppenheimer speech at the top of the third act; there’s no need to bring the sheets in for the final 45 minutes.
Grady: Oppenheimer is a breathtaking cinematic feat that is arguably Nolan’s most astounding work yet. Whether it was the haunting stare of Murphy’s piercing blue eyes or the gargantuan atomic explosion, so many visuals still remain etched in my brain.
3. What is the best moment of each movie?
McAtee: For Barbie, it’s the ending. That got an enormous laugh at the theater I attended—talk about sticking the landing. For Oppenheimer, it’s the rally after the bombs have been dropped. Nolan’s choices there created a wickedly haunted moment of “triumph.”
Gayle: Gosling doesn’t miss once, but his “I’m Just Ken” song is a true standout performance. So is his initial spat with Barbie when he’s holding court with the boys at the Mojo Dojo Casa House. Also, his acoustic guitar performance. OK, maybe I can’t choose.
Both the Trinity test scene and the final scene with Einstein are fair choices for best moment in Oppenheimer, but the right choice is Oppenheimer’s hollow speech in the bleachers. The sound design and cinematography feel new and sublime. They create a perfectly terrifying experience that you can’t look away from.
Ramgopal: Barbie had so many moments that had my entire theater in stitches, but Gosling’s “I’m Just Ken” has been living rent-free in my head for days. The song, the choreography, the performance—everything about it worked for me.
How can you not say the bomb blowing up for Oppenheimer? The scene they absolutely had to nail, they did.
Adeniran: In Oppenheimer, it’s easily the silence of watching the “gadget” explode and then the crazy sound of the shock wave hitting us as it hits the scientists. That’s an incredible feeling that won’t be replicated in theaters anytime soon.
For Barbie, the “I’m Just Ken” dance routine had my theater in tears. We also watched the film at the AMC in Century City, so all the Century City jokes landed very hard.
Spillane: When the Kens acoustically performed “Push” by Matchbox Twenty, my soul left my body. Statistically speaking, a majority of women have had to suffer through a man playing the guitar to them, usually while talking about Lindsey Buckingham. I also can’t stop thinking about Emily Blunt’s cross-examination scene in Oppenheimer. I kept waiting for her moment all movie, and to see her dunk on Jason Clarke was well worth the two and a half hours that came before it.
Grady: I adored the quiet scene on the bench shortly after Barbie made it to the real world for the first time. The camera cuts to her POV as she takes a second to observe all the beautiful chaos that surrounds her—the sound of birds chirping, wind rustling the trees, an arguing couple, a man during a lonely moment of stress, and, of course, the sweet old woman who smiles at her.
In Oppenheimer, it was the moment between Oppenheimer and military intelligence officer Boris Pash (played by a menacing Casey Affleck) when Pash was conducting an off-the-books interrogation regarding the scientist’s ties to communism. What was probably a five- to 10-minute scene felt like an eternity because of how palpable the tension was. I was on pins and needles.
4. What is the worst moment of each movie?
Adeniran: The scene with Blunt, Murphy, and Florence Pugh during the hearing (you know the one) was a tad too much in Oppenheimer. In Barbie, the white void section at the end went on a little too long.
Grady: I didn’t love the slapstick chase scene at the Mattel HQ in the second act of Barbie. It was fun for a couple of minutes, but it overstayed its welcome and got stale pretty quickly.
As for Oppenheimer, the tail end of the film, during the security proceedings against Oppenheimer and Lewis Strauss’s confirmation hearing, was probably the least interesting part of the film for me. That said, there were some dynamite conversations between Robert Downey Jr. and Alden Ehrenreich that made the in-between moments worth it.
Gayle: I audibly laughed in the theater when Albert Einstein was randomly behind that car in the third act. Was he hiding there? Did he jump off the side of the car as it started moving? Is Einstein Batman? Is this a prequel to The Prestige? (Second place is any scene with Josh Peck’s face.)
Also, I know this is going to make people upset. And I’m sorry in advance. I truly am. But I haven’t laughed at a Will Ferrell scene in over a decade. He’s still throwing the same fastball that made him a comedic icon, but that pitch is crossing the plate at 69 mph. He just doesn’t have the gas anymore. Plus, the scene in which Ferrell and the executives chase Barbie at the Mattel™ headquarters in a maze pattern and then can’t get through the entrance was heinous. Who is laughing at that? The children that didn’t laugh at the repeated “beach you off” jokes in the first 20 minutes of the movie?
McAtee: In Oppenheimer, it’s the sex scene/fever dream during Oppenheimer’s security hearing. The theater I attended burst into laughter at this scene—sometimes I think Nolan just doesn’t understand subtlety. Or emotions. Or humans in general. You’d think he’d try harder to correct his reputation for terribly written female characters, but Jean Tatlock (Pugh) was probably one of his most underserved women ever. It’s embarrassing.
In Barbie ... why was Allan in this movie? Why did he get a fight scene?? This is the only bit of fat I’d cut.
Spillane: The Chevrolet product placement car chase in Barbie … I think there was already enough product placement at that point, no? And then whatever the heck was happening with Cillian and Florence in THAT scene in the hearing room. We all know what I’m talking about.
5. You can put one performance from Barbie into Oppenheimer, and vice versa. Who are you choosing for both?
Grady: Easy. For self-explanatory reasons, I would put America Ferrera into Oppenheimer so that she could give her showstopping Barbie monologue to the women in Oppie’s life. On the other side, I would take Tom Conti’s portrayal of Albert Einstein and drop him into Barbie Land to advise Ken on the global ramifications of installing patriarchy.
Spillane: Mattel CEO Ferrell would have been a great addition to the Senate committee overseeing Strauss’s cabinet appointment. I would have loved to see him pop up as the senator from the great state of Illinois, with his passion for capitalism and “boys will be boys” ethos. Also, Josh Hartnett, a.k.a. Dr. Ernest Lawrence, as Ken? Need I say more? Hartnett is back, and he’s the original Ken.
McAtee: Let’s find Ehrenreich a role in Barbie—he was great in his limited Oppenheimer screen time. Meanwhile, Emma Mackey’s Physicist Barbie is the obvious pick to enter Oppenheimer. Maybe we can give her a scene with Olivia Thirlby’s Lilli Hornig and Nolan can pass the Bechdel test for the first time ever.
Adeniran: We’re doing a “like for like” swap. We’re trading Michael Cera (and a couple of first-round picks) for Murphy. Think about how funny that would be. Murphy could absolutely play Allan with real conviction, but imagine Cera trying to explain quantum theory, talk communism, and chat up Blunt.
Gayle: Keep Robbie and Gosling in Barbie, please. Murphy is no Ken, and Blunt is above Barbie Land. I do think Pugh would have crushed as Weird Barbie, but Kate McKinnon was hysterical. Casting Ferrell as Einstein would have been a good way to clear the theater, but I don’t think that’s the intention of the question.
Make Peck a Ken (or a second Allan) to keep him as far away from the Manhattan Project as possible. Throw Rami Malek into Barbie Land as well, just so he gets more screen time. Then cast Ferrera in Oppenheimer and have her rip that same monologue in Nolan’s ear off set to see whether his head explodes.
Ramgopal: Can you imagine Ken learning about patriarchy from our motley crew of Americans when the atomic bomb was being built in the ’40s?!
Dropping Downey’s Strauss, and all of his insecurities, into Barbie Land, where he’d be treated as a Ken, would make for some extremely moody RDJ.
6. Christopher Nolan actually built a bomb for Oppenheimer. What was your reaction to the Trinity test scene?
Ramgopal: The scene was amazing. When the sound wave actually hit, I thought I was having a heart attack. No notes.
Gayle: The sound design is just so, so impressive. Composer Ludwig Goransson is so deep in his bag the whole film, but the entire sound department really nailed it with the Trinity scene. To captivate an audience that effectively in a situation where the end result is clearly known is a stunning feat.
McAtee: Nolan did an excellent job of building up the tension for the Trinity test, which is a difficult feat given that the audience obviously knows the test will work. But the actual explosion itself I found a bit underwhelming. David Lynch did it better.
Spillane: Nolan somehow managed to create so much tension and suspense around something we already knew happened. I was gripping the seat waiting for the sound to be overpowering, so to watch it initially happen in silence really packed a punch. I found it forced the audience to confront the horror of what was unfolding.
Adeniran: One of the most impressive pieces of cinema we’ve ever seen. The tension is palpable as the team is getting ready for the test, and even though history tells us that everything will go as planned, I was still nervous. I won’t soon forget watching in awe as the bomb went off and then hearing the delayed boom in the IMAX theater.
Grady: To describe what I was feeling as “anxiety” doesn’t do it justice. I hate to be that guy, but I had the pleasure of seeing this on IMAX 70 mm, and I cannot emphasize enough how well it captured the immense magnitude of the Trinity test. My heart was beating out of my chest, and my palms were sweating profusely leading up to the detonation. In the immediate aftermath, the silence was deafening and the delayed sound of the explosion was akin to a well-executed jump scare in a horror movie.
7. We need to talk about Ken in Barbie. What did you make of Ryan Gosling’s character?
Gayle: Gosling was sensational. It’s the second-best performance of the movie only because Robbie is an absolute superstar, and it’s arguably Gosling’s top comedy performance as an actor. Ken isn’t funny at all if Gosling isn’t at the center of it.
McAtee: Ryan was more than Kenough.
Spillane: Give him the Oscar. This is Gosling’s best performance to date. He has to pull off being earnest, delusional, hilarious, and heartbreaking all while painted in the greatest spray tan I have ever seen. (I need a referral for whoever did this.) He’s committed to the bit and never breaks. I am a truther when it comes to Crazy, Stupid, Love, but this is my new Gosling apex mountain. I could watch him get repeatedly rejected by Margot Robbie for hours.
Grady: Ken being the surprise antagonist of Barbie was NOT what I saw coming, but I loved the heel turn. I think his arc was the most interesting of the film, and Gosling—who is without a doubt one of the best comedic actors of his generation—turns in a layered performance that he was born to give.
Ramgopal: While I enjoyed Gosling’s performance and his memorable bits, I actually thought he was in too much of the movie. He felt more like a lead than a supporting character. I came to see Barbie and got more Kenergy than I bargained for.
Adeniran: I would just like to say I knew Ryan Gosling had this in him the entire time.
Ryan Gosling is funny and I propose we let him be funny in more things — Oluwajomiloju (@JomiAdeniran) August 25, 2022
Everyone came for Barbie but left the movie going, “Oh my God, how good was Ryan Gosling?” In a film that literally makes fun of him for being a useless side character, he makes the movie his own. Every single joke landed. No matter how bad my life could get in the future, I’m going to be just fine knowing that I am Kenough.
8. Who is the MVP of Barbenheimer weekend?
Spillane: Warner Bros. marketing department. Everyone deserves a raise. And a vacation.
Gayle: Us! We had fun at the movies again.
Runner-up is depression, self-loathing, and existential dread. Can’t have relatable themes without those! And third place is Nolan. Give him more biopics. No more time travel and mythical space bookshelves. Give him a closed environment with clear rules and let him cook.
Adeniran: Murphy and Downey are going to win Oscars next year, but Gosling will be the people’s champ. Ken is the breakout character of Barbenheimer weekend. I can’t wait to watch the Ken show on Max in fall 2025.
McAtee: Barbie’s prop department. The horse-themed lamp shades had me rolling.
Grady: This is a cheesy answer, but it has to be the audience, right? Cinephiles and non-cinephiles alike came together to turn the “Barbenheimer” meme into a record-breaking weekend at the box office. Whether this is a good sign for the health of the theatrical experience moving forward or the last hurrah of a somewhat bygone era, this weekend was a shared moment of film celebration for so many of us. Also, Cera as Allan was pretty amazing.
Ramgopal: I’m going to go with Kingsley Ben-Adir. He was fantastic in Barbie, and he’s absolutely blowing up right now with Secret Invasion and his upcoming star turn in Bob Marley: One Love. Ben-Adir’s already worked with Nolan’s bestie, Murphy (shout-out Peaky Blinders), so would it shock anyone if he’s a future Nolan star as well?
9. Finally, the question the people need to know: Which movie was better, and why?
Grady: Oppenheimer wins by a single Letterboxd star, but both are incredible in their own right. Although I really enjoyed Barbie, I think at the end of the day the capitalistic intentions of its corporate overlords had more influence on the film than I would have liked.
McAtee: Barbie is a comedy about plastic dolls, and yet there is far more humanity in that film than in Oppenheimer. This one isn’t close.
Adeniran: I’ve got Oppenheimer, but only by a smidge. Barbie surprised me by how fun, zany, sentimental, and relevant it was despite being based on a doll from the ’50s. That being said, between the performances in Oppenheimer with Murphy, Downey, Blunt, Matt Damon, Pugh, Ehrenreich, Benny Safdie, Clarke, and many more (I mean, what a freaking cast, man!), and the tension expertly woven throughout the film, I gotta rock with Oppie.
Ramgopal: Can’t go wrong with either movie, but I’ll give the slight edge to Oppenheimer. But go see both!
Spillane: If the metric is: that was cinema, but I will likely never watch it again, then Oppenheimer. The film is a singular achievement. I had to get a beer and stare off into the distance for a couple of hours after watching it. But if we’re talking about a movie that, although not without flaws, somehow managed to make me cry with laughter and weirdly see myself on-screen a lot more than I expected for a story about a toy? Barbie all the way. I think it will be in the zeitgeist for a long time. I quoted it all weekend and referenced it a not-insignificant amount in casual conversation (apologies to friends and family).
Gayle: I left Oppenheimer plotting out time in my weekend to go back to the theater to watch the entire movie again. It’s my favorite Nolan film, and I know it’ll only get better with rewatches. It’s a better movie.
I’ll probably fire up the “I’m Just Ken” song on Spotify or search YouTube for Barbie’s opening scene, but I don’t think I need to relive the bad jokes, the Chevy ad, and the jarring tone shifts again. I’d rather rewatch Gerwig’s brilliant Lady Bird or Little Women; they don’t include commercials.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpbmdlci5jb20vbW92aWVzLzIwMjMvNy8yNC8yMzgwNTY0OC9iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItYmFyYmVuaGVpbWVyLXJldmlldy1hbmFseXNpcy1leGl0LXN1cnZledIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpbmdlci5jb20vcGxhdGZvcm0vYW1wL21vdmllcy8yMDIzLzcvMjQvMjM4MDU2NDgvYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJhcmJlbmhlaW1lci1yZXZpZXctYW5hbHlzaXMtZXhpdC1zdXJ2ZXk?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-02 18:57:07+00:00,Film Review | Bomb’s Away,,"If it can be said that sensation-lusty auteur Christopher Nolan managed to impart human qualities and frailty on Batman with his Dark Knight trilogy, something perversely inverse takes place in his overwrought Oppenheimer. In this case, the writer-director turns an extremely real person into something of a cartoon character, a complex marvel of a man caught in a crucible of human history.
The madly criss-crossing strains of Nolan’s account follows the physicist who brought quantum physics to America and was tasked with creating an atomic bomb before the Nazis, and who created the think tank/death tank in Los Alamos which led to the endless nuclear arms race and post-atomic anxiety. Interwoven into the saga, told in dizzying chapters of mixed chronology in graphic novel-like shifts in film stock and emotional temperaments, are multiple angles on the man (played by Cillian Murphy, eerily resembling the actual Oppenheimer).
It all adds up to a three-hour messy mesh of a movie — even as we’re (mostly) compelled by this all-American story.
In the pithy estimation of one observer in the film, Oppenheimer — aka the father of the atom bomb — was “an American Prometheus, who showed the world how to destroy itself and was respected for it.” The complexity and ambivalence of that implied respect — in public and personal terms — is at the heart of Nolan’s film, based on the book American Prometheus. Did he save the world, or doom it? To what degree did he experience moral quandaries, hiding behind scientific and existential/military imperatives while leading the design of a potential apocalypse machine?

Interestingly, although the tragic human toll of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki blasts are virtually kept off-screen, extended dramatic build-up is given to the initial “Trinity” A-bomb testing in New Mexico, a moment of reckoning and the literal birth of the nuclear age in practice. The scene accounts for the highlight of the film, a critical moment when the Los Alamos scientists discover if their calculations are correct — or if possibly the bomb could wreak much broader havoc than planned. Their jubilation after the success of the blast is ecstatic but sullied by a dark and ominous undertow, an “ashes in the victor’s mouth” sensation.
Much of the film focuses on the scrutiny of Oppenheimer in the post-WWII period. He is subjected to insinuations of his communist sympathies and possible betrayals as a spy and suppressor of the H-Bomb in a kangaroo court hearing and then a Senate hearing.
Unfortunately, various filmic missteps in Oppenheimer get in the way of a convincing or empathetic portrayal of our protagonist. Albert Einstein keeps popping up at junctures in the maze of a script, like a wise gnomish grandpa or Euel Gibbons surrogate. Ludwig Göransson’s musical score, a frustratingly almost wall-to-wall musical wallpaper for the film, wins honors as this year’s Most Overbearing Hollywood Score, and yet it neatly suits the general more-is-more expressive mandate laid out by Nolan.
In some way, Nolan strives to make Oppenheimer an operatic experience — perhaps partly in cross-reference to John Adams’s respected opera Doctor Atomic — but it ends up being more “soap” operatic, mixed with cartoonish qualities. One wonders if the creator of head-tripping classics Memento and Inception had applied the cleaner narrative approach seen in his Dunkirk to his latest film, we’d care more about Oppenheimer, the man, and Oppenheimer, the film.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4LzAyL2ZpbG0tcmV2aWV3LWJvbWJzLWF3YXkv0gFEaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMDIvZmlsbS1yZXZpZXctYm9tYnMtYXdheS8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

You may need to cross state or even international lines to experience the most immersive version of “Oppenheimer.” Only 19 theaters in the United States, and 30 worldwide, are showing the ambitious biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the father of the atomic bomb, using a version of the film in its most epic form.
Moviegoers in large parts of the United States and Canada would need to drive more than three hours — the film’s runtime — to get to a theater offering the Imax-70mm version of the film.

“We put a lot of effort into shooting the film in a way that we can get it out on these large format screens,” director Christopher Nolan told the Associated Press. “It really is just a great way of giving people an experience that they can’t possibly get in the home.”

Nolan’s team used Imax-specific cameras and custom-made Kodak film for parts of “Oppenheimer,” meaning massive Imax screens with taller aspect ratios and necessary projection systems will fill with additional parts of the scene relative to traditional horizontal screens.

The terminology and listings can be confusing, so look closely as you book your tickets. A film version will generally give higher resolution than a digital version. Most Imax listings will be digital, and some may not have the projection system required to fill a taller aspect ratio and give that extra immersive, uncropped feel. The movie’s website offers a detailed rundown of the options.
If you can’t make the trip to one of the 30 theaters offering the film in Imax 70mm, Nolan has assured moviegoers that the more horizontal 70mm-film version, will also be a great option. (There are a few of those in the D.C. area.) Film versions and Imax with Laser will probably be your best bet if you care strongly about the resolution of the movie.
If screen size is more your concern, chances are any screen labeled Imax will be bigger than a standard screen, though not all Imax screens are created equal. (An Imax representative recommended calling the theater if you have questions about screen size; The Post called every Imax theater in D.C. and got one human, at the AMC Georgetown, who could only confirm that the Imax screen there is “really big.”)

“There are different shapes to the screen — what we call aspect ratios,” he told the AP. “What you have to plan is how you then frame your imagery so that it can be presented in different theaters with equal success.”
Opportunities to catch the film in Imax 70mm include seven locations in California, two in London and one each in many cities including Dallas, Indianapolis, Nashville, Providence, R.I., and New York City, among others. No theater in the D.C. area or Chicago is showing it in that format.
But don’t hit the road before securing your tickets. Screenings in Imax 70mm are in high demand, with many completely sold out or a stray seat or two remaining in the front rows near the screen. Theaters are committed to showing Imax 70mm “Oppenheimer” for only three weeks, according to a Universal Pictures spokesperson, though they could extend the run if it performs well.
Here’s a full list of the theaters offering the Imax 70mm (in addition to other formats).

Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s best and most revealing work. It’s a profoundly unnerving story told with a traditionalist’s eye towards craftsmanship and muscular, cinematic imagination. Here, Nolan treats one of the most contested legacies of the 20th century – that of J Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), the “father of the atomic bomb” – as a mathematical puzzle to be solved.
In 1943, at the behest of Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer became director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, the Manhattan Project’s New Mexico site for attempting to successfully build an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer, at first, was driven by moral imperative: he feared deeply, as a Jewish man, about what would happen if the Nazis were to develop a weapon of such deadly capability (that a non-Jewish actor has taken on a role in which identity plays such a central role is, in this light, somewhat strange).
Following Hitler’s defeat, Oppenheimer continued to support the bomb’s deployment in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, convinced that such hellish destruction would not only bring an end to the war in the Pacific, but to all wars. Historians have since disputed the idea that the bombs were in any way necessary for Japan’s surrender (the real turning point, it seems, was the threat of Soviet invasion). And Oppenheimer’s own utopian vision was swiftly dismantled by fellow scientist Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) and the chair of the US Atomic Energy Commission, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr), who pushed forward with the creation of the H-bomb, a thousand times deadlier in its scope.
Oppenheimer attempted, in vain, to halt the subsequent nuclear arms race between the US and the Soviet Union. He was promptly silenced using one of America’s most cherished tools of political oppression – anti-Communist hysteria. He was attacked for his personal associations with the Communist Party, through his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold), wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), and ex-lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). It was an act of pure, public humiliation.
Nolan observes each of these chapters with sickly wonder, as Jennifer Lame’s editing work and Ludwig Göransson’s clattering score lend Oppenheimer a frightening momentum. The film is constructed in a way that allows its audience to comprehend, on an intellectual level, the profound power and chaos that led its central character to see himself as the “Death, destroyer of worlds” of Hindu scripture. I’m not sure, however, that it burrows deeper than that – into that profound, emotional space that can be both overwhelming and difficult to verbalise. It’s a little too conscious of itself, and the ways cinema crafts its own reality. Throughout, the film teases an unheard conversation between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), its inevitable reveal delivered in the same tone as the solution to the teleportation trick in Nolan’s own The Prestige.
But the prioritisation of cleverness in Oppenheimer isn’t necessarily a criticism of Nolan – more a testament to who he is as an artist. The detonation of the A-bomb, during its first test in the New Mexico desert, is depicted as booming tufts of flame in extreme close-up, coupled with enraptured onlookers. You sense its primal force, the kind of untapped power that led Oppenheimer to view himself as a kind of American Prometheus (also the title of a 2005 biography Nolan drew heavily from). But contrast that, perhaps, with how David Lynch approached the same A-bomb test in his 2017 limited series Twin Peaks: The Return. Lynch drew the camera in, slowly, confronting us with the full-scale of the weapon’s destruction, while sucking us into its very centre, damning us through its inescapability. Nolan’s A-bomb is wondrous until we consider its context; Lynch’s A-bomb is pure nightmare.
The film’s non-linear structure (de rigueur for the Tenet and Inception filmmaker), with each timeline beautifully lensed by Hoyte van Hoytema in either colour or black and white, lends a little more focus to Oppenheimer’s post-war betrayal than it does to the blossoming of his guilt. Large swathes of the film play out as political thriller, the fuel in its engine being Downey Jr’s titanic colouring of Strauss, all boorishness and manipulative charm.
But Nolan is still committed to understanding the innerworkings of his subject. Here’s a man deep in denial. When confronted with photographs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he averts his gaze. Its horrors rumble (literally) in his peripheral vision, only clear to him when he imagines such brutality inflicted on the white Americans celebrating his “victory” in Los Alamos. Murphy creates his own devastating fission: brilliance torn apart by arrogance. Scene by scene, the light behind his eyes starts to dim. He even has sex the same way he builds bombs. After his extramarital affair turns sour, his wife Kitty chastises him: “You don’t get to commit a sin and then make us all feel sorry when there are consequences.” In Oppenheimer, a man’s private, internal, and political lives are strung together, each a component of the great equation that defines a man’s soul.
Dir: Christopher Nolan. Starring: Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Tom Conti, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett, Kenneth Branagh. 15, 180 minutes.

2023-07-21 10:00:00+00:00,'Oppenheimer' features 'sex as only Nolan could stage it.' What does that mean?,"""Oppenheimer"" features Christopher Nolan's first sex scenes. What do they say about him as a filmmaker?","Oppenheimer may be the first time Christopher Nolan has made a biographical drama, but it also marks another huge milestone for the director: This is his first film featuring sex scenes.
It's nearly impossible for a movie to feature a sex scene nowadays without igniting some grand discourse, including the dreaded ""sex scenes serve no purpose"" talking point. Nolan's first foray into onscreen sex is no different. Even before the film's release, its sex scenes have already been the subject of several articles. An early reaction from The Telegraph critic Robbie Collin proved particularly intriguing, as he proclaimed the scenes as being ""sex as only Nolan could stage it.""
So what does it mean for sex to be quintessentially ""Nolan"" — especially since his films have often been criticized as sexless? Does it mean we can expect stylistic Nolan trademarks like intense crosscutting or mind-boggling visual set pieces? Are Oppenheimer viewers in for rotating hallway, wormhole circling, time inverting sex?
Not as such. Oppenheimer features two sex scenes, both between J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) and Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). And while they don't feature any timey-wimey shenanigans, the sequences speak to many of Nolan's sensibilities as a filmmaker, including his fixation on philosophy and theory, his penchant for the surreal, and his unfortunate tendency to portray women as tragic figures in the orbit of male genius.
Nolan brings a religious text to Oppenheimer's first sex scene.

For all the fuss that's been made about it, there isn't much actual sex in Oppenheimer's first sex scene. Instead, the focus becomes a Sanskrit book Tatlock finds on Oppenheimer's shelf. (Yes, on top of his work in the field of theoretical physics, Oppenheimer was learning Sanskrit.) The book is the Bhagavad Gita, a key religious text in Hinduism as well as a part of the epic poem, the Mahabharata. According to a 1948 Time article, Oppenheimer enjoyed reading the text to his friends, and he kept a Scotch tape-patched copy in his office at Princeton.
In the film, Tatlock asks Oppenheimer to read her a passage from the Bhagavad Gita as they start having sex again, and of course, he alights on the passage that Oppenheimer would later say came to mind when he witnessed the first-ever detonation of a nuclear weapon. In it, Prince Arjuna, overlooking a battlefield, asks Lord Krishna to assume his supreme form. He does so, then says, as quoted by Oppenheimer, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""
The mid-sex scene placement of such an impactful line, one forever intertwined with Oppenheimer's legacy, is unusual, but very Nolan. His films often concern themselves with the philosophy of morality: The Dark Knight even offers up a giant-sized version of the prisoner's dilemma with its ferry sequence. So if you were to tell me a famed director somehow wove the Bhagavad Gita, with its own discussions of morality and duty, into a sex scene, the first one to come to mind would be Nolan.
However, just because the scene reads as Nolan-esque doesn't mean it's entirely effective. For one, the sex between Tatlock and Oppenheimer is cold and almost passionless (more classic Nolan critiques), to the point that we don't truly get a sense of their relationship. The incorporation of the Bhagavad Gita here is more awkward than anything, an absurd ""look, he said the line!"" moment rather than an actual beat where we get to understand two characters' intimacy.
That it's Tatlock who urges Oppenheimer to translate Sanskrit for her during sex also speaks to one of Nolan's greatest flaws across his films: his treatment of women as vessels for his male leads' genius. Tatlock is frustratingly underdeveloped throughout Oppenheimer, with her opening flirtations limited to spouting Communist theory and her final scenes reducing her to a tortured mistress. In the film's first sex scene, her insistence that Oppenheimer read to her does not come across as Tatlock making the (strange) choice to bring the Bhagavad Gita to bed. Instead, it feels like Oppenheimer shoehorning a key quote into the film early on, with Tatlock serving as the best vehicle to do so.
Oppenheimer's second sex scene is more surreal — and still unsatisfying in its treatment of women.

While Oppenheimer's first sex scene is ""sex as only Nolan could stage it"" on a more thematic level, the film's second sex scene feels truer to Nolan in a formal sense. As Oppenheimer participates in a security hearing, with the United States Atomic Energy Commission picking apart his former Communist ties, his interrogators grill him over the last time he saw Tatlock. First, the scene cuts to a hotel room, where the two sit across from each other in separate armchairs, both completely naked, but with legs crossed, giving some modesty to the scene. Naturally, they spend this nude moment mostly talking about Oppenheimer's work.
When we cut back to the hearing, we see Oppenheimer completely undressed as the proceedings continue. It's a stark stylistic turn, perhaps a visual representation of his personal life being literally laid bare by the proceedings. Yet that interpretation changes when a naked Tatlock materializes atop Oppenheimer, wiggling her hips as he continues to address the board before him. Through slow pans between Tatlock and Oppenheimer's wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), sitting in the corner of the hearing, both looking directly into the camera, we realize the scene is what Kitty is envisioning as the board picks apart her husband's affair.
The injection of a fearful vision into an otherwise sterile government boardroom echoes the surreal nightmares of Inception's dream sequences. This is Kitty's subconscious rearing its head in the face of stress and humiliation. It is one of the only times in the film we get her perspective on a situation. More than that, the moment where she makes eye contact with an enraptured Jean is truly the closest two women ever get to speaking to each other in Oppenheimer — outside of a single line tossed Kitty's way by a party hostess. Jean once again becomes a vessel, this time for Kitty's own qualms about her marriage.
Like Jean, Kitty is under-served in this moment. Wives in Nolan films tend to exist in one category — dead. So the fact that she is alive makes for a nice change of pace. However, Kitty still falls into the trope of ""tragic"" wife. Her emotional journey revolves around her husband: whether he'll survive the Trinity Test, whether he'll escape the hearing unscathed, and whether his affairs will continue to hurt their family. It's the last that materializes in this surreal sex scene.
Oppenheimer's boardroom moment is neither sexy nor trying to be, but both it and the Bhagavad Gita-quoting sequence are as Nolan as a sex scene can get. And while he makes bold thematic and stylistic choices in each, Nolan's examination of Oppenheimer's relationships through sex remains frustratingly surface-level. The simple fact that onscreen sex even exists in a Nolan movie winds up feeling more impactful than the content of the scenes themselves.
Sure, Oppenheimer himself may have loved sex, but the film most certainly does not.

,Cillian Murphy was considered to play Oppenheimer in 2014 TV show,Cillian Murphy was in the running to portray J. Robert Oppenheimer on WGN's 'Manhattan' nearly a decade ago.,"Oppenheimer writer-director Christopher Nolan wasn't the first person to have the bright idea of casting Cillian Murphy as theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer.
The Irish actor came close to portraying the so-called ""father of the atomic bomb"" almost a decade ago on the 2014 TV show Manhattan, which covered much of the same historical ground as Nolan's blockbuster biopic during its two-season run on WGN America.
In a new Vanity Fair article, Manhattan showrunner Sam Shaw and writer Lila Byock discussed some of the actors they considered casting as Oppenheimer. The list included the singer Beck, The Bear star Ebon Moss-Barach, and Murphy. ""A thousand percent, Cillian Murphy was on that list,"" said Shaw. The role eventually went to Minority Report and Old Joy actor Daniel London.

To be fair to Nolan, his interest in casting Murphy as Oppenheimer might have predated that of Shaw and Brock. The director first worked with Murphy on 2005's Batman Begins, picking him to portray the Scarecrow after deciding the 28 Days Later actor wasn't right for the role of Bruce Wayne.
""When we had our first conversation I think both of us knew that you weren't going to wind up playing Batman,"" Nolan said earlier this year, speaking with Murphy for EW's Summer Movie Preview. ""But I really wanted to get on set with you, I wanted to get you on film. We did those screen tests very elaborately, on 35mm, with a little set. There was just an electric atmosphere in the crew when you started to perform. We did two scenes — there was a Bruce Wayne scene and a Batman scene — and I made sure that executives came down and watched what you were doing on set. Everybody was so excited by watching you perform that when I then said to them, 'Okay, Christian Bale is Batman, but what about Cillian to play Scarecrow?' there was no dissent. All the previous Batman villains had been played by huge movie stars: Jack Nicholson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Carrey, that kind of thing. That was a big leap for them and it really was purely on the basis of that test. So that's how you got to play Scarecrow.""
After Batman Begins, the pair reteamed for 2008's The Dark Knight, 2010's Inception, 2012's The Dark Knight Rises, and 2017's Dunkirk, with Nolan ultimately calling Murphy up to offer him the lead role in Oppenheimer.
""It was one of the best days of my life, I'll tell you that, when you called me,"" the actor said to Nolan, speaking before the start of the current SAG-AFTRA strike. ""I'll always turn up for Chris, no matter what the part is, but, secretly, it's a dream to play a lead part. The thing was, I had no idea. There was no preamble or anything, I just got the call. So it was incredibly exciting, and daunting, and terrifying, all at the same time.""

,Atomic dawn: Review of Oppenheimer,"A complex subject is given a suitably serious and grand-scale treatment in a film that nonetheless throws up many perhaps unanswerable questions and problems, finds Tom Griffiths

The atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, according to some estimates, killed in excess of 200,000 people – without even counting those suffering from radiation poisoning-related sickness and death in the years to come.
The fire-bombings in March 1945 of Tokyo which killed around 100,000 civilians and left over one million homeless, and the devastation of Dresden which killed around 25,000, had already shown the world that the Allies were willing and capable of using weapons of mass destruction. Nonetheless, the atomic bomb was a game-changer.
The firestorm that engulfed Dresden took a concentrated effort from 772 RAF heavy bombers making four raids over three days (13-15 February 1945). It took one plane and one bomb apiece to destroy Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Not only that, the cruelty of the new super-weapon and the sickness caused by radioactive fallout would create a new type of horror in the human imagination.
The creation of the atomic bomb would go on to become one of the most significant events in human history, driving and defining the Cold War and creating a threat that still hangs over us all today. The hydrogen bomb, which began its development in New Mexico under America’s then chief atomic scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer, while the atomic device was being built and tested – would be 1000 times more powerful. A new terrifying epoch had arrived.
Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds
Christopher Nolan’s biopic is a huge achievement. At the heart of this achievement is Nolan and his star Cillian Murphy’s portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer.
It is perhaps one of the greatest characters in modern drama. A character as ambitious as Macbeth and as conflicted as Hamlet; a man whose decisions have consequences that dwarf the petty concerns of princes and would-be kings. With the destruction of the world a possibility and the gruesome agonising death of thousands a certainty, it is impossible to imagine how the stakes could be any higher.
Oppenheimer is a remarkable film about a remarkable man. And like Oppenheimer himself, it is also complicated, contradictory, and flawed. At its best, the film allows us inside the mind of a man, who though incredibly driven, arrogant, and often selfish, also had severe doubts about the project which he led to make atomic weapons a reality.
When asked if he had any qualms about the number killed and maimed in the bombing of Hiroshima he replied, ‘terrible ones’. He was also obviously a quite brilliant scientist and administrator and very charming when it suited him to be so. Cillian Murphy takes this role, undeniably already packed with dramatic potential, and elevates it to remarkable heights. Murphy must surely take home a best-actor Oscar for his performance and a host of other awards besides. They will all be well deserved.
The film is also, as we’ve come to expect from Nolan, a stunning visual spectacle. Relentless, nerve-shredding, and sublime. Sonically, Nolan applies his usual sledgehammer approach, and while there are some transcendent moments of stillness (no spoilers here), the persistent score has a tendency to flatten narrative shape and blurs distinctions between perspective and timelines. The sound and score certainly deliver on intensity and excellent execution even if (as ever in Nolan’s work) they never quite let you breathe. However, that very breathlessness offers us another way into the fizzing anxiety and churning mind of Oppenheimer himself.
First-person perspective
It is interesting to note that the screenplay was written in the first person. This is highly unusual (if not unheard of), and rather than ‘Oppenheimer crosses the room’ – the script states, ‘I crossed the room’. This will have driven every creative decision in the making of the film and it will certainly have provided the platform for Murphy to build his incredible performance.
It does, however, also create a host of other problems in terms of the characterisation of the supporting cast – none of whom are particularly well-rounded or as fully formed as they could be. While the supporting cast is excellent – and it seems from interviews with them, (Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and others), that ‘supporting’ was absolutely the duty they were expected to perform – the audience is rarely given insight into what motivates and drives these secondary but nonetheless significant players in Oppenheimer’s life.
As a result, his relationships with wife Kitty (Blunt), lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), and brother Frank Oppenheimer (Dylan Arnold), are frequently unsatisfying and you are left admiring the presence and grace of these performers – as opposed to really investing in their stories or believing they’re real people. If this is an attempt to evoke Oppenheimer’s narcissistic personality, it doesn’t quite work; audiences don’t need to be alienated from these people even if the man himself was.
While Oppenheimer himself was (as he is referred to in the film) a ‘womaniser’ and lived in a very male-dominated world, it is also undeniably problematic to have one of the scarce female speaking-parts in the film, within a few seconds of their few lines – cut to a nude, sex scene. Putting us in the shoes of the protagonist is one thing, but modern audiences deserve better. While the carnality and intensity of the relationship between Tatlock and Oppenheimer was obviously one of its defining factors, Nolan has made a tone-deaf misstep here. The scene is saved though, by the implication that Oppenheimer, while clearly conflicted about the bomb, was also aroused by the power it gave him. It is here he quotes ‘the destroyer of worlds’ line to his lover. It’s another contradictory moment in a contradictory film.
This hyper-identification with the experience of Oppenheimer creates more problems still. After the success of the ‘Trinity’ test in the New Mexico desert, the score seems to join in with the jubilation of scientists at their great success. Can this note of triumphalism be explained away by the insistence of Nolan to tell us this story from Oppenheimer’s perspective?
Later of course Oppenheimer’s personal doubts set in, but it’s a moment of ambiguity that speaks of the film’s ambiguity on the need for the bomb, rather than our protagonist’s own story arc.
The problem of politics
Some commentators have condemned the film for its omissions. The test sites in New Mexico where the ‘Trinity’ detonation took place, and years of subsequent atomic weapons research and testing, has had a huge impact on native American people in the area.
In a recent article in Time Magazine, Buu V. Nygren, the President of the Navajo Nation, stated, ‘cancers, miscarriages, and mysterious illnesses [are] a direct consequence of America’s race for nuclear hegemony. It’s an accomplishment built on top of the bodies of Navajo men, women, and children—the lived experience of nuclear weapons development in the United States. But, as usual, Hollywood chose to gloss over them.’
It is also arguably a cop-out not to show the images of the Hiroshima blast victims – while Cillian Murphy’s horrified reactions are shown (and beautifully handled) – it is important when dealing with a story like this to honour the victims through complete candour about the savagery of the bomb. After all, if ever there was a plot device that isn’t simply a MacGuffin, it’s the real atomic bomb.
As the film passes into its final chapter, which focuses on the political machinations that led to Oppenheimer’s fall from grace, one can’t also help wondering if we’re being asked to empathise with the wrong man. The dead Japanese become statistics – our ‘hero’ has to face his worst crisis yet and the dogmatic subjectivity of the film once more shows its limits.
Oppenheimer was also a ‘fellow traveller’ and at times more or less sympathetic to the cause of socialism and communism. A fair amount of screen time is given to this aspect of his early life, and while it’s one of the most open and critical portrayals of McCarthyism and the persecution of ‘reds’ in America, there still remains the whiff of naivety and foolhardy romanticism around the most politically active characters in the film. Nonetheless, the American State doesn’t come out well, and Nolan at least seems piqued by its heavy-handed and undemocratic persecution of those who want a better world.
This film raises a great deal of important questions, some of which are easier to answer than others. Was it right to develop a bomb in the context of World War Two while the Nazi regime was busy developing its own? Once Germany had surrendered, was it right to hasten the end of the war with Japan by dropping the bomb? While it’s clear now that the answer to the latter question can only have been no, it is difficult to give a definitive answer to the first question. Also, were Oppenheimer’s ‘terrible’ qualms about the work he carried out enough to clear him of responsibility for the unnecessary murder of Japanese civilians and the poisoning of Navajo land? Where does the final responsibility lie? Can scientists – as so many of the New Mexico cohort, including Oppenheimer, attempted to do – really set themselves apart from the politicians and military that dropped the bomb?
Can Nolan be excused for lionising a man with so much blood on his hands? For even though the film recognises the man’s flaws– it undeniably does nothing to mitigate the mythic ‘father of the bomb’ status and allure that surrounded the real Oppenheimer – has Nolan minimised the suffering of the distant (non-white) victims of the bomb? Could or should he have done anything differently?
All of these are good questions, and many of them are unanswerable.
What this film has done, however, is to have reminded us of the fraught history of the creation of atomic weapons and shown us – however indirectly – that they are truly awesome and truly terrible. While the film may not go far enough in condemning the use of nuclear weapons, it is by no means a pro-nuclear weapons film. Everyone who leaves the cinema will (rightly) question the still extant threat of nuclear holocaust and challenge politicians who still cling onto nuclear arms. As the conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues, this threat is more real than it has been since the 1980s. It’s a threat which we cannot take lightly.
Last of all, despite all these moral and political questions, and all the questions about the creative decisions Nolan and his team have made, there is something truly transcendent about this film. All its contradictions are at least appropriate to the overwhelming complexity and scale of the subject matter.
In summary, Cillian Murphy’s performance is unmissable and so is this complicated and incredible film.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdW50ZXJmaXJlLm9yZy9hcnRpY2xlL2F0b21pYy1kYXduLXJldmlldy1vZi1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

5 Stars for Barbie; 4 Stars for Oppenheimer
By Joseph Beyer | Aug. 5, 2023
Unless you’ve been vacationing disconnected from all media, you might already be over the endless #Barbenheimer memes, cos-posts, and “have you seen it yet!?” hoopla. But I sincerely hope not.
That’s because taken together or separately, the new films Barbie and Oppenheimer could not reveal more about the state of contemporary storytelling and the still powerful impact Hollywood can have when it wants to…and when it allows creatives to control the sandbox.
One film is a bold and fearless fever dream for a new wave of feminism, led by an indie-centric director known for her honest portrayals of women onscreen. The other is a high stakes political drama about the most violent weapon ever unleashed, led by a formerly indie-centric director known for his brooding male muses.
In the hands of director and co-writer Greta Gerwig, the impossible happens in Barbie when a plastic icon not only becomes fully humanized but teaches us something about our own humanity at the same time.
At the helm of a 70mm epic, the plausible happens when director Christopher Nolan reshapes American history in Oppenheimer, adding another layer of self-reflection to a complicated country still grappling with past atrocities and moral leadership.
Each is an accomplished film and storyworld all to itself. Without any spoilers, I’ll share briefly that Barbie is a fairy tale with a punk ethos that is stunning and entertaining from beginning to end. It comes from a respectful director who managed to do it all in 1 hour and 54 minutes. Wholly original, it breaks too many conventions and stereotypes to count.
Oppenheimer is a slow-simmering morality play where not much changes between good and evil for (a sometimes agonizing) 3 hours. Familiar and confident, it’s led by a formula of gripping but occasionally stereotypical performances and feels like a noble time capsule of ideas and reckonings, staying safely within the expectations of the genre.
I have my favorite.
Mattel and Warner Bros. lavished Gerwig with a $145M budget for Barbie, which grossed almost double that in just the first week. Oppenheimer is the benefactor of the Barbie-Bump and well on the way to becoming profitable even after a $100M budget for a period biography. Box office records have been broken! Audiences are flocking to the theaters again!
To be sure, both big-budget films also star big-budget talents like Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling in Barbie or Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey, Jr. in Oppenheimer to name just a sparse few from their impressive ensembles. And no doubt many of them will be walking red carpets this fall as both films are destined to be darlings of the upcoming awards season.
The #Barbenheimer phenomenon that started as a joke may be rewarding studios with one of their best summers ever, even as the writers and actors starring in them are embroiled in a bitter labor dispute with no end in sight. We live in interesting times.
Should you complete “the cycle” and watch both, as I did over the weekend, to stay culturally relevant? It’s up to you. But you would be hard pressed to find more honest conversations about American identity than the ones happening in lobbies, bars, and car rides home because of these films.
To a critic often sitting alone in a theater, these new sights of long lines, packed houses in pink, and people leaving satisfied in surprise and delight are beyond promising. Perhaps it will remind us of the power of darkened rooms to light up our connections, and how fun that experience is when we share it with others.

2023-08-04 10:00:10+00:00,‘Our book is Barbie meets Oppenheimer’: why we wrote about nostalgia in an era of crisis,"H Is for Hawk author Helen Macdonald and her co-writer Sin Blaché on Barbenheimer, the power of the past and how late capitalism is eating itself","When we told people we were writing a sci-fi novel together during lockdown, they’d ask us what it was about. A reasonable question, but very hard to answer. “A love letter to genre fiction” felt insufficient, and “a military spy adventure mystery horror sci-fi queer romance thriller” too much. But now, in this glorious summer of Barbenheimer, a time of proliferating memes and T-shirts printed with hot-pink mushroom clouds, we usually answer the question with “It’s Barbie meets Oppenheimer”.
Set in 2010 in a universe just one perilous step from our own, Prophet was intended to be as comedic and subversive as Barbie and as darkly philosophical as Oppenheimer – and it also has scenes set in nuclear test towns in the Nevada desert overrun with animate plastic dolls. But the deepest connection between Prophet, Barbie and Oppenheimer is that all, in different ways, are shaped by nostalgia. Greta Gerwig’s film playfully interrogates the candy-lit utopia of a consumerist childhood, and Christopher Nolan’s complex response to the terrifying romance of the cold war nuclear desert reminds us of a time when the apocalypse was easier to comprehend because it only came in nuclear flavour.
Our subject, in Prophet, is the literal weaponisation of nostalgia. The plot is about a covert American military project that’s experimenting with a mysterious substance that causes those exposed to it to spontaneously create beloved childhood objects out of thin air – to quote Walter Benjamin, they literally “seize hold of a memory as it flashes up at a moment of danger”.
It’s not hard to understand why nostalgia is everywhere in this era of pandemic and economic hardship
Once they create their object, they are trapped in a deadly trance clutching it, be it a doll, a teddy bear, a Scrabble set or rocking chair. This came partly from the notion of the “Valley of Lost Things”, a literary conceit discussed in Kathryn Schulz’s wonderful memoir Lost and Found that situates all the things we’ve lost in our lives in a far, inaccessible place. The idea can be found in works as various as Mary Poppins and the 1516 epic poem Orlando Furioso. But it also came from that strange, heady pang we all feel when we see a photo of something from our childhood on social media – a candy bar or a toy or the decor of a fast food restaurant. As the historian David Lowenthal maintained, we all crave evidence that the past endures in recoverable form – that some mechanism or faith will enable us not just to know it but to see and feel it.
It’s not hard to understand why nostalgia is everywhere in this era of pandemic and economic hardship. It feels as though the world is spiralling towards fascism in the midst of an accelerating environmental apocalypse, and a yearning for a lost past that seems safer and better than our present is an understandable reaction. Nostalgia flourishes in societies after wars and times of social dislocation.

In the 18th century, however, when the word nostalgia was coined by the medic Johannes Hofer (from the Greek nostos, meaning homecoming or home, and algos, meaning pain), it was to describe a military disease experienced by Swiss mercenaries on battlefields far from home; they became indifferent and haggard, heard voices and saw ghosts. Later, nostalgia was considered a vice, the consequence of not being manly enough, before shifting in the Romantic period to become a far more positive phenomenon, linked to a sense of national or cultural pride.
Today, nostalgia has become a viciously effective way to guarantee instant emotional engagement across advertising, television, movies and social media. Hollywood is so rife with it, it feels as if it’s entering a death spiral of recycled intellectual property. Following Barbie, there are Hot Wheels, Polly Pocket and Barney the Dinosaur movies all in the works. Across every sphere, late capitalism is eating itself, using nostalgia as a seasoning.
When we asked people on Twitter what single emotionally resonant object they would retrieve from their own past if they could, the responses were bewitching and often heartbreaking. Button boxes, parental jackets, grandparents’ lounge chairs, lampshades, childhood trees, pets. Some, chillingly, mentioned ex‑girlfriends. But because, as the critic Jean Starobinski explained, our longing for home increasingly shrank in the 20th century into a longing for one’s own childhood, mostly the objects were toys.

We built Prophet from nostalgic things, weaving it from tropes pulled from old spy movies: snowbound ski-chalet lairs, secret medical laboratories, shady government operatives. We gave it Bourne-style action scenes and B-movie horrors. On a different level, it’s about the legacy of trauma, dislocation and loss, all classic nostalgia triggers.
At its heart, our novel is a fable about how dangerous it is to venerate the past at the expense of the idea of a future. We’re living at a time where believing in a livable future feels increasingly difficult. The despair this belief evokes in us makes it easy to give up, stop fighting, turn to nostalgia for our refuge. As Rebecca Solnit and others have written, it takes hard work to trust that there is still uncertainty about the future. But we need that uncertainty. We need hope. We must recognise and believe that, even now, history can still be made and changed for the better by our actions.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYm9va3MvMjAyMy9hdWcvMDQvb3VyLWJvb2staXMtYmFyYmllLW1lZXRzLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXdoeS13ZS13cm90ZS1hYm91dC1ub3N0YWxnaWEtaW4tYW4tZXJhLW9mLWNyaXNpc9IBgwFodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYm9va3MvMjAyMy9hdWcvMDQvb3VyLWJvb2staXMtYmFyYmllLW1lZXRzLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXdoeS13ZS13cm90ZS1hYm91dC1ub3N0YWxnaWEtaW4tYW4tZXJhLW9mLWNyaXNpcw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,The Best Performance in Oppenheimer Belongs to Alden Ehrenreich,An appreciation of a fantastic piece of acting in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer.,"Alden Ehrenreich plays a Senate aide, a figure who is one of the many government workers standing behind and to the side of the head honchos helping to grease the wheels of power. He has been tasked with guiding Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) through Senate confirmation hearings on his nomination as Secretary of Commerce to President Eisenhower's cabinet. Ehrenreich is essentially a PR guy, a guide for Strauss and the audience through the tangled web of Cold War-era D.C. and the front-stabbing figures who have turned politics into a battlefield. He is, by design, not that important. Dozens of other nameless aides are waiting around the corner to do this job. Ehrenreich just so happens to be there at the right/wrong time.
Being an audience avatar is often a thankless role in any film, and it’s a trope that Nolan often struggles with. Discussions of process and ideas often weigh down his films and inserting a figure of relatable naivety into this risks disrupting the narrative flow. ""Oppenheimer"" often gets away with not having one during the glut of the story since it’s so heavily focused on conversations about science, ethics, and consequences. The scenes with Strauss and Ehrenreich are a break from this, an insight into a post-Oppenheimer world and how it has impacted the system that helped to create him in the first place. Ehrenreich is not unaware, nor is he expected to play catch-up with Strauss and company. Rather, he’s the constant reminder that scientists did not do what happened at Los Alamos alone. That he is unnamed and a fictional creation of Nolan (a sharp contrast to a film populated by real historical players) hammers home the disposability of such an aide. Ehrenreich’s job is to blend in, to keep a straight face against the peacocking Strauss. It’s a role that could, too, have disappeared into the background, but Ehrenreich knows that the best scene stealers are the ones who react to the carnage.
Ehrenreich, a character actor with the face of a 1950s leading man, has always excelled in parts where he tempers his natural charisma with a dash of something sharper. In ""Hail, Caesar!,"" he steals the show from one of the Coen Brothers’ starriest casts as Hobie Doyle, the adorably clueless singing cowboy the studio tries to reinvent as a Noel Coward-esque debonair leading man. He’s the safe port of sincerity in a storm of Hollywood cynicism. As the younger brother of the tempestuous Tetro in Francis Ford Coppola's indie drama, he is appealingly innocent yet imbued with the abrasive arrogance that only a dolt of a teenage boy could truly possess. Even in ""Solo: A Star Wars Story,"" the u nfairly maligned prequel of the new Disney/Lucasfilm era, Ehrenreich’s Han is less concerned with traditional hero expectations. Audiences seemed furious that he didn’t look or act exactly like Harrison Ford. Still, Ehrenreich understood the giddy enthusiasm of the pre-jaded space cowboy and how the character doesn’t work if he’s always cool (which Ford never was in the original trilogy, something fans often overlook.) The best Ehrenreich performances allow him to dig into humanity's absurdities and petty mundanities, offering either the freaky flipside or a welcome dose of warmth. It’s never as interesting to be cool when you can be weird, dark, or earnest.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvZ2VyZWJlcnQuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL3RoZS1iZXN0LXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWluLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJlbG9uZ3MtdG8tYWxkZW4tZWhyZW5yZWljaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-17 22:06:52+00:00,Matt Damon Told His Wife in Couples Therapy That He’d Take an Acting Break Unless ‘Nolan Called’ — Then He Received ‘Oppenheimer’ Offer,"Matt Damon told his wife in couples therapy that he would take an acting break, but it would end if Christopher Nolan called.","Matt Damon revealed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that Christopher Nolan found his way into one of the actor’s couples therapy sessions. While avoiding marital specifics, Damon said that he told his wife he would take an acting break on only one condition: If Christopher Nolan called, the break could go on hold. His wife agreed to the terms.
As fate would have it, Nolan did call with an offer for Damon to star in “Oppenheimer.”
“This is going to sound made up, but it’s actually true,” Damon said. “I had — not to get too personal — negotiated extensively with my wife that I was taking time off. I had been in ‘Interstellar’ and then Chris put me on ice for a couple of movies, so I wasn’t in the rotation, but I actually negotiated in couples therapy ­— this is a true story — the one caveat to my taking time off was if Chris Nolan called. This is without knowing whether or not he was working on anything, because he never tells you. He just calls you out of the blue. And so, it was a moment in my household.”
Nolan called Damon to offer him the role of Leslie Groves, who was the director of the Manhattan Project. Groves chose Los Alamos, N.M. as one of several testing sites for the development of the atomic bomb. He also personally recruited J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy) to lead the charge at Los Alamos — a divisive choice at the time as Oppenheimer lacked a Nobel Prize and administrative leadership experience.
Murphy got his own unexpected call from Nolan with an offer to play the lead role.
“He’s so understated and self-deprecating and, in his very English manner, just said, ‘Listen, I’ve written this script, it’s about Oppenheimer. I’d like you to be my Oppenheimer,’” Murphy told Associated Press earlier this year. “It was a great day… We have this long-standing understanding and trust and shorthand and respect. It felt like the right time to take on a bigger responsibility. And it just so happened that it was a huge one.”
“[It’s] a fun way to do it,” Nolan told Entertainment Weekly about surprise offers over the phone. “But it means that it’s very difficult to call you to go out to dinner or something. Because every time you answer the phone it’s like, what’s it going to be?”
“Oppenheimer” opens in theaters nationwide July 21 from Universal Pictures.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvbWF0dC1kYW1vbi1hY3RpbmctYnJlYWstY291cGxlcy10aGVyYXB5LWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLTEyMzU2NzI0NzAv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9tYXR0LWRhbW9uLWFjdGluZy1icmVhay1jb3VwbGVzLXRoZXJhcHktY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tb3BwZW5oZWltZXItMTIzNTY3MjQ3MC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-16 17:43:43.751000+00:00,Christopher Nolan wants Oppenheimer to be a warning for Silicon Valley,Christopher Nolan spoke on a panel about his new film Oppenheimer and how he hopes it can serve as a warning to scientists and those developing new technologies.,"Around the time J. Robert Oppenheimer learned that Hiroshima had been struck (alongside everyone else in the world), he began to have profound regrets about his role in the creation of that bomb. At one point, when meeting President Harry S. Truman, Oppenheimer wept and expressed that regret. Truman called him a crybaby and said he never wanted to see him again. And Christopher Nolan is hoping that when Silicon Valley audiences of his film Oppenheimer (out July 21st) see his interpretation of all those events, they’ll see something of themselves there, too.
After a screening of Oppenheimer at The Whitby Hotel yesterday, Nolan joined a panel of scientists and Kai Bird, one of the authors of American Prometheus, the book Oppenheimer is based on, to talk about the film. The audience was filled mostly with scientists, who chuckled at jokes about the egos of physicists in the film, but there were a few reporters, including myself, there as well.
We listened to all too brief debates on the success of nuclear deterrence and Thom Mason, the current director of Los Alamos, talked about how many current lab employees had cameos in the film because so much of it was shot nearby. But toward the end of the conversation, the moderator, Chuck Todd of Meet the Press, asked Nolan what he hoped Silicon Valley might learn from the film. “I think what I would want them to take away is the concept of accountability,” he told Todd.
“Applied to AI? That’s a terrifying possibility. Terrifying.”
He then clarified, “When you innovate through technology, you have to make sure there is accountability.” He was referring to a wide variety of technological innovations that have been embraced by Silicon Valley, while those same companies have refused to acknowledge the harm they’ve repeatedly engendered. “The rise of companies over the last 15 years bandying about words like ‘algorithm,’ not knowing what they mean in any kind of meaningful, mathematical sense. They just don’t want to take responsibility for what that algorithm does.”
He continued, “And applied to AI? That’s a terrifying possibility. Terrifying. Not least because as AI systems go into the defense infrastructure, ultimately they’ll be charged with nuclear weapons, and if we allow people to say that that’s a separate entity from the person who’s wielding, programming, putting AI into use, then we’re doomed. It has to be about accountability. We have to hold people accountable for what they do with the tools that they have.”
While Nolan didn’t refer to any specific company, it isn’t hard to know what he’s talking about. Companies like Google, Meta, and even Netflix are heavily dependent on algorithms to acquire and maintain audiences, and often, there are unforeseen and frequently heinous outcomes to that reliance — probably the most notable and truly awful being Meta’s contribution to genocide in Myanmar.
“At least is serves as a cautionary tale.”
Now, while an apology tour is virtually guaranteed days after a company’s algorithm does something terrible, the algorithms remain. Threads even just launched with an exclusively algorithmic feed. Occasionally, companies might give you a tool, as Facebook did, to turn it off, but these black box algorithms remain, with very little discussion of all the potential bad outcomes and plenty of discussion of the good ones.
“When I talk to the leading researchers in the field of AI they literally refer to this right now as their Oppenheimer moment,” Nolan said. “They’re looking to his story to say what are the responsibilities for scientists developing new technologies that may have unintended consequences.”
“Do you think Silicon Valley is thinking that right now?” Todd asked him.
“They say that they do,” Nolan replied. “And that’s,” he chuckled, “that’s helpful. That at least it’s in the conversation. And I hope that thought process will continue. I’m not saying Oppenheimer’s story offers any easy answers to these questions. But at least it serves a cautionary tale.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzcvMTYvMjM3OTY2NTkvY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tb3BwZW5oZWltZXItYWktd2FybmluZy1zaWxpY29uLXZhbGxledIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The film has attained a remarkable — and a little dubious — milestone. It is poised to outshine even the 2016 hit Sing, as it positions itself to claim the title of the highest-grossing domestic movie ever to have never secured the top spot at the box office. One might posit that the success of Oppenheimer owes a debt of gratitude to the concurrent presence of the Barbenheimer phenomenon, a dynamic that played an undeniable role in propelling the film to its current status.
Regardless, this cinematic marvel has struck gold, amassing an impressive haul of over $270 million domestically within the span of four weeks since its premiere. In the preceding era, Sing had enjoyed robust commercial triumphs during its release, yet its path was dogged by a dual challenge. First, it found itself pitted against the juggernaut Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, an endeavour that ultimately garnered a domestic collection of $534.9 million, indisputably securing the top-tier slot and sidelining Sing.
Subsequently, as the film showcased its endurance, it was once more denied the top rank by the sleeper sensation Hidden Figures, a cinematic tribute to the mathematicians underpinning the historic moon landing. However, let not Sing be overshadowed, for it claimed its own victory with a global box office sum of $634.2 million, a figure that Oppenheimer is most likely to eclipse.
Oppenheimer review
WION's review of Oppenheimer read, ""As Oppenheimer unfolds, Nolan presents us with a kaleidoscope of ethical dilemmas that transcend time. The film's resonance lies not only in its historical accuracy but also in its exploration of the human condition, the pursuit of knowledge, and the choices that shape our destinies. Oppenheimer is an unmissable cinematic event. I am not quite sure if it is indeed Nolan's best work as many have said, but it definitely comes close.""

,Cillian Murphy's blue eyes distracted 'Oppenheimer' costars,'It's a real problem': Cillian Murphy's 'Oppenheimer' castmates found themselves 'swimming' in his 'ocean eyes' on set.,"Cillian Murphy's piercing blue eyes might be more powerful than a nuclear weapon.
According to the Irish actor's costars in Oppenheimer — the new Christopher Nolan drama about the American physicist who spearheaded the development of the atomic bomb during World War II — Murphy's peepers are so striking that they proved to be a distraction on set.
""It's a real problem when you're doing scene work with Cillian,"" Matt Damon, who plays Manhattan Project director Leslie Groves, told PEOPLE. ""Sometimes you find yourself just swimming in his eyes.""
Emily Blunt, who plays Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty, added, ""It's like that 'Ocean Eyes' song by Billie Eilish. We just hum it all day.""
Murphy protested, ""They're not even that blue!""

Oppenheimer marks Murphy's sixth film with Nolan, and the first in which he plays the lead role. Speaking to EW earlier this year about their shared cinematic history, Nolan revealed that it was Murphy's ""crazy eyes"" that initially drew him to the actor, leading to a collaborative relationship that began with the Dark Knight trilogy.
""I remember I was up in San Francisco writing Batman Begins and there was something in the San Francisco Chronicle about 28 Days Later,"" Nolan recalled. ""I saw a picture of you with your shaved head and your crazy eyes — no offense. I remember being struck by your presence, literally from that one photograph, and then started to look into who you were, and what you'd done, and got very excited about the idea of meeting you, and having you screen-test for Batman.""
That role went to Christian Bale, of course, but Nolan knew he wanted Murphy to take part and cast him as the villain Scarecrow. ""Everybody was so excited by watching you perform that when I then said to them, 'Okay, Christian Bale is Batman, but what about Cillian to play Scarecrow?' there was no dissent,"" he said.

When Nolan phoned Murphy and asked him to take on the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, ""It was kind of overwhelming,"" the actor admitted in a recent installment of EW's Around the Table video series, which was conducted prior to the actors' strike. ""Chris' way of operating is that he just calls you out of the blue,"" Murphy explained. ""I genuinely had no idea. He said he was making a movie about Oppenheimer and he said, 'I'd like you to play Oppenheimer.' I had to sit down.""
Check out the video above for more from Murphy and his blue eyes. Oppenheimer is in theaters now.

2023-08-08 15:00:32+00:00,"Before Oppenheimer, there was Manhattan: this underrated drama is a must-see","Despite a starry cast and strong writing, this series about the scientists living and working in Los Alamos was criminally underwatched","Christopher Nolan’s biopic Oppenheimer may have set off some existential crises and Wikipedia binges, but before that there was Manhattan. When the show launched in 2014, Mad Men was ending and television networks were looking for other historical dramas that would capture that same audience; those with a predilection for character-driven stories with a cerebral bent, an emotional anchor and stylish production.
Edged out by more zeitgeisty shows such as The Americans and Halt and Catch Fire, Manhattan was criminally underwatched and was cancelled after two seasons in 2015. But with the success of Oppenheimer, now’s the time to consider trying Manhattan – but go in knowing you should not expect to learn the ins and outs of nuclear fission or second world war geopolitics with any robust fidelity. Manhattan is a (very) fictionalised telling of the drama, secrecy and breakthroughs of the Los Alamos nuclear bomb project.
Most of the characters are not real but loosely drawn from real-world counterparts; the only two actual scientists to pop up in the show are J Robert Oppenheimer and Niels Bohr. General Groves, played by Matt Damon in Oppenheimer, is only sometimes referenced.
Manhattan instead tells the story of life on “the hill”: those working and living in the secretive Los Alamos compound. It’s a rich tapestry of the triumphs and failures of the teams charged with creating a superweapon to stop the deranged dictator laying waste to Europe.
Initially framed as a rivalry between the promising young physicist Charlie Isaacs (Australian American actor Ashley Zukerman, who you may recognise as Succession’s Nate Sofrelli) and the esteemed but authority-challenging Frank Winter (John Benjamin Hickey), Manhattan’s 23 episodes had the time and space to dive deep into the thorny moral quandaries of what it means to work for a greater good. The ethical dilemma of creating such a weapon and its appalling potential is never far from the surface.

But perhaps where it’s most compelling is in its commitment to its wider ensemble. There’s Charlie’s wife Abigail (Rachel Brosnahan, The Marvelous Mrs Maisel), a woman from a rich family whose unhappiness in her marriage leads her to explore other ventures. There’s Frank’s wife Liza (Olivia Williams), a doctor and botanist who had to sacrifice her career for her husband’s work but who is unwilling to sit idly and play house.
There are the other scientists on the hill, including Helen Prins (Katja Herbers), a Dutch physicist constantly fighting against the constraints placed on her as a woman, and Reed Akley (David Harbour), Frank’s competition working on an opposing project.
Manhattan deftly services the personal dramas of its characters along with their professional challenges while throwing in doses of intrigue, espionage and military power plays. The West Wing’s Richard Schiff recurs as an intelligence officer, while CSI’s William Petersen joins in season two as a hardman and proselytising general. (Speaking of West Wing alumni, Manhattan’s directors include Thomas Schlamme, Christopher Misiano and Bill D’Elia.)
The show, created by Sam Shaw (Masters of Sex, Castle Rock), tries to hit many notes, and while it’s not always perfect – I’d say it starts off shaky and doesn’t hit its stride until episode four – it skilfully weaves together the paranoia, hope and exhaustion of a moment in history which changed the world. The writing and the performances are excellent – so if Oppenheimer wasn’t enough for you, Manhattan is a dynamite series.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlLzIwMjMvYXVnLzA5L3R2LXNlcmllcy1saWtlLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLW1hbmhhdHRhbi13aGVyZS10by13YXRjaC1zdGFu0gFoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy9hdWcvMDkvdHYtc2VyaWVzLWxpa2Utb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbWFuaGF0dGFuLXdoZXJlLXRvLXdhdGNoLXN0YW4?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-25 13:56:53+00:00,Oppenheimer’s Frown,"Oppenheimer is a good film, and Oppenheimer himself a compelling character. But what I take away most from the film is his nervous frown.","Cillian Murphy, who beautifully evokes the physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer in Christopher Nolan’s new film, wears, through about 85 percent of the movie, a worried frown. Nolan does not lionize Oppenheimer but presents him consistently as an ambiguous character, a man tormented by inner demons, external enemies, and moral dilemmas. And Oppenheimer’s frown is, it seems to me, evocative of deep conflicts that endure in the consciousness of the West.
The first of these has to do with science and scientists. In the ancient world, the philosopher was probably the most admired figure; in the medieval context, the saint; in the modern milieu, the warrior or wealthy landowner. But in our contemporary setting, there seems little doubt that the scientist holds pride of place. By a rather deep instinct, we tend to look for wisdom, not from sages, politicians, or religious leaders, but from the practitioners of the hard sciences. It is no accident that George Lucas chose to model the face of Yoda, the Jedi wise man in Star Wars, after the visage of Albert Einstein. And Einstein does indeed figure in Oppenheimer, along with Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, Edward Teller, Enrico Fermi, as well as the eponymous main character. I liked very much the fact that Nolan presents all of these players in their brilliance and celebrates their achievements, but that he does not canonize them or present them as moral exemplars. Heisenberg, we learn, worked for the Nazis; Teller was a turncoat; Oppenheimer was self-absorbed and unfaithful; etc. There is a sharp distinction to be made between intellectual acumen and moral excellence, and in our culture, we too often mistake the former for the latter.
This gives rise to the second conflict—and it is the central theme of the film—namely, the tension between what can be done and what ought to be done. I especially enjoyed the first act of Oppenheimer, which explores the education of the keenly intelligent young American scientist under the direction of some of the leading lights of European science. The newly-minted Dr. Oppenheimer brought the still-novel discipline of quantum mechanics to our shores and commenced to show its theoretical and practical implications, including in the military domain. Animated by his left-wing political views and by his Jewish identity, Oppenheimer was eager to dedicate his science to the development of a mighty weapon that could bring down the Nazis, who were enemies of both his nation and his people. Hence, when invited, he accepted the invitation from the US Army to head up the Manhattan Project, dedicated to the development of an atomic bomb. With the help of his hyper-competent colleagues, Oppenheimer demonstrated that a bomb of epically destructive power could be created, and in the initial aftermath of the Hiroshima attack, he was elated.
Catholic teaching would never countenance doing something intrinsically evil in order that good might come of it.
But what began to bother him more was whether this awful weapon should have been used. When he visits President Truman, he comments, with real pain, that he feels he has blood on his hands. Catholic moral teaching would support Oppenheimer’s reservations, for the atomic bombings, which resulted in the deaths of over one hundred thousand innocents, clearly violated the principle of discrimination, which dictates that in any act of war, one must distinguish between combatants and noncombatants. Though a number of characters in the film, including an admittedly cartoonish version of Harry Truman, trot out the familiar consequentialist justification that the attacks saved lives in the long run, Catholic teaching would never countenance doing something intrinsically evil in order that good might come of it.
A third prompt for the worried frown of Robert Oppenheimer was the strain between his loyalty to America and his association with Communism. The third act of the film, which I frankly found more than a little tiresome, explores this struggle in some detail. What made the final section of the movie hard to take was not simply its slow pace but also its odd sympathy with the Communism of so many of Oppenheimer’s friends and colleagues. It still appears to be the case in Hollywood that being Communist is rather cool and avant-garde, amounting to a romantic devotion to the poor and the disadvantaged—and this attitude is shared by an alarming number of young people in our country today. In point of fact, Marxist-Leninist ideology has produced economic misery and mountains of corpses wherever it has been implemented, and therefore no responsible person in the twenty-first century should have the slightest regard for it. Moreover, it is simply a matter of historical record that there were indeed Soviet spies associated with the Manhattan Project and that they posed a real threat to national security. Though there were indeed McCarthyite extremists in the 1950s, those who had suspicions of certain of Oppenheimer’s associations were more than justified in their skepticism and should not have been portrayed as semi-fascist boors.
Oppenheimer is a good film, and Oppenheimer himself, in his intelligence, his passion, his deep flaws, a compelling character. But what I take away most from the film is his nervous frown.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmRvbmZpcmUub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL2JhcnJvbi9vcHBlbmhlaW1lcnMtZnJvd24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-06 14:32:16+00:00,Oppenheimer Technical Review: Brilliant Sound Design Combined With Extreme IMAX Closeups,,"So we watched Oppenheimer on IMAX Laser. After writing a vast amount of articles dealing with the cinematography aspects of the film, we didn’t imagine how great the sound is. Indeed, the sound is brilliant and layered by the outstanding score composed by Ludwig Göransson. That was combined extremely well with the IMAX closeups.
First drama shot on IMAX
Oppenheimer is not an action movie, but an epic thriller. It’s the first drama shot on IMAX film cameras. As we wrote before, Director of Photography Hoyte van Hoytema has implemented very simple and accurate cinematography techniques, focusing on character’s faces, and maneuvering between color and B&W sequences. As mentioned before, Kodak developed the first B&W IMAX film stock for the movie. There’s a solid emphasis on the certain part of the faces, which enhance the dramaturgy of this unique cast that features five Oscar winners (Sir Kenneth Branagh, Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, and Gary Oldman) and three Oscar nominees (Robert Downey Jr., Tom Conti, and Florence Pugh). Then the great acting is amplified especially when watching it on the huge canvas. There are no fast pace high-octane action shots in Oppenheimer. Just faces, and particles…a lot of particles to demonstrate the art of quantum physics. Furthermore, there is no CGI implemented. Just a minimal and precise dose of about 100 VFX shots, paired with practical cinematography, by using dedicated lenses on IMAX film cameras.
Atomic explosions created by practical effects
Here’s an intriguing fact: The Trinity detonation scene uses a combination of practical effects and digital compositing. Multiple explosions were performed practically, with a hybrid of gasoline, propane, aluminum, and magnesium substances involving big miniatures. These were filmed at high speeds from multiple angles, and then layered using digital effects to create the iconic “mushroom cloud”. You won’t see any conventional mushroom clouds in Oppenheimer. You will see a big explosion with a lot of fire. As explained – Zero CGI. This is the first time an imitation of an atomic exposition is done practically in a narrative feature. However, the factor that contributes the most to that phenomenon, is the sound. Great sound design, layered with outstanding music.
Kudos to Ludwig Göransson
The music composer of Oppenheimer is Ludwig Göransson. In fact, Oppenheimer is the second and consecutive collaboration between Nolan and Göransson, right after Tenet (2020). Frequent Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer wasn’t available since he was committed to the scores of Dune (2021) and Dune: Part Two (2023) at the time of both Nolan films. Furthermore, the score of the film doesn’t feature any drums, as directors Nolan and Göransson felt using a sound typically associated with the military would be inauthentic to musically capture the character of J. Robert Oppenheimer. The music is powerful and fits the film accurately. Moreover, the soundtrack builds the tension as it’s been escorted by intense large-format closeups, wrapped by powerful sound design.
The sound department should get an Oscar
If we had to choose one factor that makes Oppenheimer so intense, we’d pick sound. Indeed, the sound design is brilliant and powerful. As many articles have written on the cinematography behind Oppenheimer, the sound hasn’t got much love. But after watching the movie, you will understand how impactful the sounds are, which mainly demonstrate flashbacks, physical occurrences, and particles clashing with each other. As characterized by Nolan’s film, the sound is strong and in high volume. So imagine this: Closeups of faces with massive cameras, macro/micro photography of physics, great acting, intense music, and extreme sounds. Of course, all of this is accompanied by a fascinating story and script.
Complicated but not too complicated
As a Nolans’ film, Oppenheimer demands concentration. It’s fairly complicated, but not too complicated. Viewers can understand it by seeing it once. Unlike other Nolan projects (Tenet, Interstellar) which require multiple views in order to connect the dots. This is a 3-hour movie. The highlight which is the Trinity test comes after 1 hour and 58 minutes. Till then, the tension is being built. A combination of practical macro cinematography, powerful sounds, excellent music, extreme close-ups, and great acting, help to make it through these 3 hours. The audiences were glued to their seats in a huge IMAX theater without blinking.
The ‘IMAX Experience’
As explained, there’re no fancy action shots in Oppenheimer. It’s a drama. But it was carefully stitched to the IMAX. Shot on an IMAX film camera, by a cinematographer that is specialized in shooting with IMAX cameras, conducted by a director that uses only this format, makes Oppenheimer an ideal movie to be seen at IMAX theater, and not less than that. If you can, go see it on IMAX, any IMAX. We saw it on laser and it was good enough. Just the sounds are worth it since the IMAX laser is armed with better speakers and sound technology. We wrote before that Oppenheimer is important for ‘IMAX cinematography’, and after watching it, we’re even more sure about this claim. Nolan has succeeded in making a powerful IMAX film with a very minimal dose of VFX and action sequences. That constitutes an important milestone. Moreover, Oppenheimer can be used as a case study for how to shoot faces with medium-format cameras. As Hoytema said before: “Oppenheimer relies on characters’ faces”, and he is right. BTW – Tom Conti (Einstein) is AWESOME!

But it was only when Kai Bird joined as a collaborator that “American Prometheus” came to be.,"So on March 13, 1980, Sherwin signed a $70,000 contract with Knopf for the project. Paid half to get started, he expected to finish it in five years.
In the end, the book took 25 years to write — and Sherwin didn’t do it alone.
When Christopher Nolan’s film “Oppenheimer” is released on July 21, it will be the first time many younger Americans encounter the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer. But that film stands on the shoulders of the exhaustive and exhilarating 721-page Pulitzer Prize-winning biography called “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” co-written by Sherwin and Kai Bird.
Knopf published this masterwork in 2005.

The audience was 65 percent female. “For a film this pink, you would have expected the audience to be closer to 90 percent female — we got a ton of guys,” said Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros. “It exploded everywhere: large markets, small markets, coast to coast.”

Some theaters seemed to be caught off guard. One high-end theater in the Washington, D.C. suburbs went all out on promotion, with pink lights to highlight “Barbie” and a wall of movie posters featuring both films. But the theater may have miscalculated Saturday attendance. By the 10 p.m. showing, it had run out of multiple food items. It also lacked soft drinks and, amazingly, ice.
Another theater in Arlington, Va., had it worse: The air conditioning went out, leading to a sweltering experience. While the theater offered refunds, many ticket buyers stayed.
The question now is whether Hollywood can keep the momentum going. Studio executives have long pointed out that moviegoing begets moviegoing — that the habit of watching movies in theaters is crucial. Coming up, however, studios are facing another crisis: A strike by unionized actors, which started on July 14, could force movie companies to push back coming films because striking stars cannot take part in publicity campaigns. “Challengers,” a sports drama involving a love triangle and starring Zendaya, has already been pushed from September to April.
There are no talks scheduled between SAG-AFTRA, as the actors’ union is known, and studios.
“Oppenheimer” helped fuel “Barbie” and vice versa, with their simultaneous release nicknamed Barbenheimer and movie fans captivated by their wild incongruity. Nolan’s film, which cost Universal Pictures at least $100 million to make, not including a megawatt marketing campaign, is a three-hour period drama about Robert Oppenheimer, the man known as “the father of the atomic bomb.” About 200,000 people purchased tickets to see “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” as a double feature, according to the National Association of Theater Owners, a trade organization.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMjMvbW92aWVzL2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW51bWJlcnMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-22 09:00:00+00:00,"'Oppenheimer': Yes, there really was a nuclear reactor under a football field.","""Oppenheimer"" shows us Chicago Pile-1, the first-ever manmade nuclear reactor built under a University of Chicago football field.","For two years of my time as a student at the University of Chicago, my dorm building, my cafeteria, and the library where I worked all stood on the same block as the site of the world's first-ever manmade nuclear reactor.
Upon first glance, you wouldn't really know just how much this stretch of land in Chicago's Hyde Park shaped the Atomic Age. Between the hustle and bustle of students, you might be more distracted by the crayon-bright colors of the Max Palevsky dorms, the imposing brutalist architecture of the Regenstein Library, or even the glass dome of the Mansueto Library. Look past those, however, and you'll see a bronze statue by Henry Moore, titled ""Nuclear Energy,"" commemorating the construction of the reactor — and the moment in 1942 when it went critical.
That same nuclear reactor makes an ever-so-brief appearance in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, when physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) journeys to Chicago to check out his Manhattan Project colleagues' progress. He encounters physicists like Enrico Fermi (Danny Deferrari) and Leo Szilard (Máté Haumann), who confirm that they have successfully engineered the first manmade nuclear reaction. How did they do it? With Chicago Pile-1, or CP-1: a reactor made of bricks of graphite, built under a football field on an active college campus.
The scene barely takes up any time in the three-hour-long epic that is Oppenheimer, but the science behind it is crucial to the creation of the atomic bomb. Not only that, but the construction of CP-1 is fascinating enough that it could easily be its own movie. How did it work? Did it leave any radiation on the UChicago campus? And perhaps most strangely of all, why was it built under a football field?
What is CP-1, and why was it important to the Manhattan Project?

As the Manhattan Project got underway, several things became apparent. First, scientists had to determine whether controlling a nuclear chain reaction was even possible.
The principle of a chain reaction was already well understood by this point. ""If very heavy nuclei — in this case uranium — absorb a neutron, they will fission, and they will break into pieces and give up a certain amount of energy so that the nuclei fly off and everything gets hotter,"" Peter Littlewood, Chair of the UChicago Department of Physics, explained to Mashable in a phone interview. ""For every nucleus that fissures, you generate three extra neutrons. And if these neutrons get captured by another, then you get nine and you keep on building. That's what we call a chain reaction.""
On top of figuring out how to control such a reaction, the scientists also needed enough fissile material, such as plutonium or uranium, to place in the test bomb, as well as the bombs that the U.S. government would go on to drop over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Enter CP-1. In November of 1942, Fermi and other members of the UChicago's Metallurgical Laboratory — which studied plutonium — constructed CP-1 on a squash court under the west football stands of the University's Stagg Field. Stagg was once host to UChicago's football team. However, Fermi and colleagues didn't have to worry about interfering with football games or practice given that University President Robert Maynard Hutchins had ended the fairly dominant varsity football program in 1939.
""I think it is a good thing for the country to have one important university discontinue football,"" Hutchins told students in a 1940 address. ""There is no doubt that, on the whole, the game has been a major handicap to education in the United States."" (The sport returned in 1969, although by then, the old Stagg Field had been replaced by the Regenstein Library.)
Thanks to UChicago's sudden aversion to athletics, construction on CP-1 continued until December 2, 1942, when the reactor produced the first manmade, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. With the knowledge that such a a reaction was possible, construction began on a nuclear reactor in Hanford, Washington, where plutonium production for the Trinity Test bomb and the bomb dropped over Nagasaki took place. CP-1 itself was not responsible for any of the plutonium production.
""CP-1 was designed as an experiment. It wasn't designed to do anything other than prove that the principle worked,"" Peter Littlewood, Chair of the UChicago Department of Physics, told Mashable in a phone interview. ""But they were so confident that it worked that they had already designed the Hanford reactor before the experiment was completed."" Construction on Hanford only took 18 months.
How did CP-1 work?

Fermi himself described CP-1 as ""a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers."" So how did such a ""crude"" structure, 20 feet wide and 25 feet tall, create a monumental chain reaction?
On top of the graphite blocks, CP-1 also contained smaller pellets of uranium, which would help initiate the chain reaction in the first place. The graphite served as a ""moderator"" for the reaction. ""It slows down neutrons and makes them more easy to absorb by uranium atoms,"" Littlewood explained in an e-mail.
But the ultimate form of control came in the form of long wooden rods coated in cadmium, which absorbed the neutrons. ""When the control rods are all pushed in, nothing happens,"" said Littlewood. ""Then you withdraw the control rods, and every time you do that, there's a little burst of energy."" Fermi and his team monitored these bursts of energy, watching the power build up and calculating how far to pull the control rods out until the energy was self-sustaining.
Were the CP-1 experiments safe?

Upon learning that I was spending a large chunk of my time at UChicago hanging out around the site of an old nuclear reactor, I was mildly alarmed. Would I graduate from school with an extra head?
On the one hand, every tour group passing the Moore statue gets assured that the site is not a radioactive hazard. On the other hand, an old professor of mine once told my class a rumor that the café in the Regenstein Library had been moved from the basement to the first floor due to traces of radiation found in the basement. (To put it in perspective: I and many other UChicago students have spent more time in that library basement than Cillian Murphy does staring right into the camera in Oppenheimer.)
Luckily, Littlewood assured me that that wasn't the case. ""I have heard that rumor, but not really from a reputable source, so I don't buy it.""
He continued: ""The other thing is that radiation is everywhere, and it's very easy to find. Could there have been some radioactive contamination that was permanent? It would depend on how well they cleaned up the fissile material or what they did with it. At the time, and certainly later in the Cold War, we were extraordinarily lax in taking care of radioactive material... But the amount of radiation which was created by CP-1 would probably have been quite tiny."" Graphite could also have absorbed some of the radiation, acting as protection in a setting that otherwise lacked shielding.
Adding to these assurances? In a 2019 NPR story, UChicago's radiation safety officer James Marsicek used a Geiger counter to measure the radiation around what used to be Stagg Field. The counter consistently measured .02 millirems per hour, simply picking up the background radiation that naturally occurs around us.
None of this is information that you'll get in Oppenheimer — a film already filled to the brim with decades' worth of science — but it's crucial to understand just how much effort went into the Manhattan Project. One quick glimpse of CP-1 in the movie hides stories of abandoned football fields, hastily constructed power plants, and even worries (now soothed) about radioactive libraries. But Littlewood is quick to point out that CP-1's role in the Manhattan Project is only part of its impact.
When CP-1 went critical, Littlewood said that ""it became clear, at that point, that you could use nuclear power to generate energy. Following the war, there was work from the government to do that. That involved setting up what became Argonne National Lab, which is about 25 miles southwest of the city. Argonne National Lab was the place which designed and built the first set of nuclear reactors and formed the prototypes of things which have spread around the world. So it's very much a case of swords into plowshares.""
As for the UChicago Physics Department's thoughts on Oppenheimer? ""We're physicists, so we're not used to getting excited,"" Littlewood said. ""I'm sure we'll probably do a private screening of it at some point for our students.

2023-07-31 09:07:27+00:00,Oppenheimer IMAX Review,We check out Christopher Nolan's new movie in the format that it was shot in for its full effect. Check out our Oppenheimer IMAX review.,"I had been waiting a long time to see Christopher Nolan‘s new movie and so I was excited to finally get booked in to see the movie the way it was shot to be seen, so please sit back and check out my Oppenheimer IMAX review.
Oppenheimer refers to J. Robert Oppenheimer, a prominent American physicist and the scientific director of the Manhattan Project during World War II. Born on April 22, 1904, Oppenheimer played a crucial role in developing the atomic bomb. His leadership and contributions to the project earned him the nickname “the father of the atomic bomb.” Despite his scientific achievements, Oppenheimer faced controversy later in life due to his political beliefs and associations. Nevertheless, his role in advancing nuclear physics remains a significant chapter in scientific and historical discourse.
Cillian Murphey as Oppenheimer
We’ve been teased for such a long time with the trailers for Oppenheimer and when the movie was finally released on the 21st of July it was inevitable that the movie would be very popular. I am very stuck in my ways when it comes to seeing a movie in IMAX and so it took me a little longer than expected to get to see Oppenheimer in IMAX as I wanted my usual seats that give you a great view and soundscape from the screening, but in the end, I got them and on Friday I headed out to Cineworld in Broughton to finally see the movie.
As expected the Oppenheimer IMAX screening was something very special, not only does the movie look stunning with the IMAX shot sequences it also has such an amazing sound that booms out through the screen and even the quietest moments sound perfect.
The soundtrack from Ludwig Göransson (The Mandalorian, Tenet) is a delight to listen to with the bonus of IMAX sound it pulls you into every scene and certainly adds to the atmosphere of the movie.
Oppenheimer IMAX – Cillian Murphey and Christopher Nolan – Behind the Scenes
Christopher Nolan has brought us a stunning movie with Oppenheimer, it’s a movie that had me pulled in from the start and as with some of Nolan’s previous work he has given us the twist of several timelines running at the same time to tell the story of “the father of the atomic bomb”, now this may sound confusing but it isn’t.
The use of black and white scenes breaks the movie up and it looks amazing on the IMAX screen, but this also adds to the storylines very nicely giving the viewer something a little different. Kodak developed the first-ever B&W film stock for IMAX for this movie.
Cillian Murphy is brilliant as Oppenheimer and I found myself enjoying his performance the further I got into the movie, his portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer is something more than what I was initially expecting.
The rest of the cast also brings the characters to life on the IMAX screen very well, with some big names including Robert Downey Jr. Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh this is a movie that has well-known faces to bring such a powerful story to life.
Most of us know the story of Oppenheimer and why the bomb was created, but this movie takes us more into the creation and lives of those involved, the moment that the bomb is tested is a scene that works very well and when you consider it’s all physical and no CGI it looks even more amazing.
Look out for a scene with Oppenheimer giving a speech to everyone involved, the sound usage and visuals are so nicely done and show what is going through his mind after creating something that could have set the world on fire and destroyed all mankind.
For me, Oppenheimer in IMAX is a fascinating and superb piece of filmmaking, Christopher Nolan has brought us a thought-provoking movie that needs to be seen in the IMAX format and the bigger the better, this is a movie that will either have you discussing the movie with your friends on the way out the screen or, like me, have you silenced in contemplation of all that took place prior to the end of World War II.
Is there a post-credit scene in Oppenheimer?
No there isn’t a post-credit scene after the film has finished, but you can sit back and enjoy the brilliant music.

2023-07-22 11:00:00+00:00,Movie Review: ‘Oppenheimer’,"If writer-director Christopher Nolan's impressive but uneven portrait ""Oppenheimer"" (Universal) is anything to go by, famed theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer was a highly complex man.","NEW YORK (OSV News) – If writer-director Christopher Nolan’s impressive but uneven portrait “Oppenheimer” (Universal) is anything to go by, famed theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer was a highly complex man. As portrayed by Cillian Murphy in a layered performance, he was at once charismatic yet naïve, by turns a champion and victim of his times.
Just as its protagonist had his highs and lows, so Nolan’s three hour-long film has its strong passages and weaker chapters. The depiction of Oppenheimer’s collaboration with the U.S. Army’s hard-driving Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) in the race to develop the atomic bomb during World War II, for instance, is compelling.
So too is the recounting of his far more complicated relationship with former patron-turned-critic Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). A wealthy businessman who reached the rank of admiral during his time in the Navy, in the late 1940s Strauss served on the newly established Atomic Energy Commission alongside Oppenheimer — and the two came into conflict.
Strauss’ eventual opposition to him contributed to the travails the left-leaning Oppenheimer faced once anti-Communist sentiment became prevalent during the early stages of the Cold War. These troubles culminated in a hearing to see whether Oppenheimer’s temporarily suspended security clearance should be permanently revoked.
Less intriguing than the sequences devoted to these subjects are those detailing Oppenheimer’s early career and his murky personal life. Though in some respects devoted to his feisty, bibulous wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), a biologist, Oppenheimer doesn’t hesitate to comfort his troubled psychiatrist ex-girlfriend, Jean (Florence Pugh), by carrying on an affair with her.
Needlessly frank scenes of their erotic interaction, both before and after Oppenheimer’s marriage, not only prevent endorsement of this biography for youngsters but constitute material that even some mature viewers may wish to avoid. That’s a shame because, as an absorbing historical retrospective, the movie might have had considerable educational value.
If its treatment of bedroom behavior is questionable, “Oppenheimer” is on firmer ground in its balanced approach to the morality of war. Enigmatic and noncommittal, its namesake wavers between rejoicing over Japan’s belated surrender and meditating on the horrors required to bring it about.
It may never be definitively established how many soldiers and civilians would have died in an American invasion of the Japanese homeland. But it is safe to say that hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people alive today would never have been born had their forebears fallen in that struggle.
As one of the figures primarily responsible for averting such a catastrophe – at however great a price – Oppenheimer, who died in 1967, aged 62, has left a weighty legacy. While this extensive profile of him may have its flaws, it’s an immersive and thought-provoking experience that touches on both the best and worst in human nature.
The film contains strong sexual content, including graphic activity and recurring upper female nudity, an adultery theme, brief gruesome sights, about a half-dozen profanities, a couple of milder oaths, several rough terms and occasional crude and crass language.

,“Oppenheimer” and Nuclear Risks Today,,"Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is the most high-profile film about nuclear weapons ever made. It’s the tale of the beginning of the atomic age and the man who led the Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer, out in theaters July 21, comes at an incredibly risky time, and the issues it raises are critically important.
Oppenheimer is not just history, and it’s not just a movie.
Today, there are 13,000 nuclear weapons spread across nine countries. Modern nuclear weapons are much more powerful (up to 80 times more powerful) than the bomb Oppenheimer created and those that were used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Nuclear threats also are getting worse. We’re on the precipice of a new nuclear arms race. China’s arsenal is growing. Russia avoided a near-civil war, and at any moment, the war in Ukraine could go nuclear. We’ve had tons of close calls in the past, and with the combination of last century’s weapons and this century’s threats (AI, cyber, terrorism), our luck could run out.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm50aS5vcmcvYW5hbHlzaXMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItYW5kLW51Y2xlYXItcmlza3MtdG9kYXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-07 18:06:46+00:00,‘What people accused Oppenheimer of doing’: the untold story of spy Ted Hall,"In Steve James’s documentary, A Compassionate Spy, a lesser-known figure from the Manhattan Project is given the spotlight","Nearly 80 years after it rattled the New Mexico desert, the Trinity test is top of mind for many this summer. Thanks to Oppenheimer, director Christopher Nolan’s blockbuster film on the leader of the Manhattan Project, millions have relived the queasy aftermath of the first nuclear bomb detonation in July 1945 – a scientific achievement of terrible power greeted with jubilation at Los Alamos. In a pivotal scene set during post-test celebrations, J Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist played by Cillian Murphy, stokes the flames of triumphalism while seeing the ashes of future destruction.
At Los Alamos that day was a young physicist named Ted Hall, whose concerns outpaced Oppenheimer’s. Peeved by the celebrations and disturbed by the gleeful reaction to a weapon of mass destruction, he isolated himself in the army barracks. Oppenheimer would go on to hold grave misgivings about the US government’s handling of atomic weapons and the expansion of its nuclear program. But Hall, at all of 19, had already acted. Unsettled by the US government’s refusal to share atomic intelligence with its allies and the prospect of a US monopoly on the bomb, Hall shared aspects of the project at Los Alamos with Soviet intelligence – a secret that went largely unknown for nearly 50 years, and is left out of the hit movie.
“What Ted did is what people accused Oppenheimer of doing,” said the documentarian Steve James, whose latest film, A Compassionate Spy, explores Hall’s prescient skepticism, his fraught espionage and his loyal marriage of nearly half a century to his wife, Joan. (Nolan’s film makes a point of Oppenheimer’s later political rivals who twisted his longstanding leftist sympathies into career-ending suspicions of Soviet ties; “I like to think Christopher Nolan copied us – he heard we were doing this, and decided he wanted in on it,” James joked of the film, which has brought the heated debates of Los Alamos to the masses this summer.) It’s part love story, part espionage thriller, part re-contextualization of national PR for the atomic bomb (bullish, sanitized) and the USSR (hailed, then demonized).
Hall was not alone in his concerns over US handling of the nascent nuclear weapons program. Seventy scientists tied to the Manhattan Project signed a petition protesting the use of the bomb on Japan that was never delivered to the president, Harry S Truman (not that it likely would have made a difference). “There were a lot of scientists who began to really question what they were doing and questioning the fact that the Soviet Union was excluded from this effort, and were of course extremely worried about what we were going to do with the bomb,” said James. There were other physicists at Los Alamos who shared intelligence with the Soviet Union, including the German scientist Klaus Fuchs, who merits a mention in Oppenheimer.
But Hall was the youngest to act, and to the most significant degree. “Ted is just this impetuous young 19-year-old who decided he was going to do something,” said James. Not that Hall regarded his potentially life-threatening treason as dire, at least at the time. In archival interviews from the years before his death in 1999 from renal cancer (likely the result of his work with plutonium at Los Alamos), Hall recalls his mindset at 19, freshly recruited from Harvard, as one of idealism aided at least in part by youth. “I was a young person,” he said. “I saw the world, I guess you might say, through rather pinkishly colored glasses.”
“In my mind, this was a question of protecting the Soviet people, as well as all people, from attack,” he said. His fears were not unfounded; shortly after the war ended, Truman reportedly threatened to deploy a nuclear bomb on the USSR, lest they agree to remove troops from occupied Iran.
The actual transmission of information, captured in archival interviews and re-enactments, was careful, though not the work of elite subterfuge. Hall relied on Saville “Savy” Sax, a close friend from Harvard and a devoted Communist, to actually make contact with Soviet representatives; the two communicated via messages encoded in books and letters and in less artfully staged secret meetings – methods Hall later remembered as more “comedy” than thriller. Nevertheless, the two managed to communicate rough plans for the implosion bomb to Soviet intelligence, which likely accelerated Soviet progress on their own weapons – they, too, had a deployable bomb by 1949 – by about five years, estimates the historian Joseph Albright, co-author of a book on Hall.
The arms-driven cold war, and the USSR’s trajectory under Stalin, never sat easily with Hall, according to Joan – the emotional heart of the film and, it’s revealed, the steel behind Hall’s convictions, silence and conscience. James first met Joan, a “dynamo” who was “brilliant in her own right”, in 2019, when she was 91. “She was a woman out of her time, in a way,” he said. An intellectual and leftist who was briefly a member of the Communist party, she was politically active until heat from the FBI on Hall’s past forced her to recede from any organizing. (She and Hall eventually moved to Cambridge, England, with their three daughters; Joan died this past June, aged 94.) “She had an extraordinary life in her own right, and as much as anything, I wanted to tell her story as much as Ted’s,” said James.

Translating their love story to screen marked a departure for James, a documentarian primarily known for his verité work exploring the fault lines of race and class in his home base of Chicago – the acclaimed film Hoop Dreams, as well as the excellent docuseries America to Me and City So Real. A Compassionate Spy relies on full recreations of Ted’s time at Los Alamos and Ted and Joan’s romance – tussling on the quad at the University of Chicago, revealing his secret while entwined on his office floor, barely dodging the FBI’s intimidation tactics. “I knew there would be no way to visualize [Joan’s stories] unless we did it ourselves,” James said of his decision to stage re-enactments. That, and to bring Ted and Joan’s youth at the time of their consequential decisions to the fore. “I figured it would be easy to forget that when you’re looking at a 91-year-old woman telling you stories, or Ted in the 1990s when he was in his 70s telling these stories, to forget how young they were and how brave they were in doing what they did.”
“He was for his age incredibly knowledgeable and sophisticated in terms of understanding the way the world works,” said James of Hall’s time at Los Alamos, where he was the youngest scientist. “Without having access to classified documents or the president or the decision makers, he gleaned that it [could be] dangerous for the US to have this all to themselves.”
“The film tries to make the case that whether you agree with him ultimately or not, those fears were not out to lunch,” he added. Late in the film, Joan recounts with scorn how the media did not take too kindly to the reveal of Hall’s secret late in his life, regarded by many as a betrayal of his country. A Compassionate Spy serves as a moving rebuke, both personal and sweeping. History may not judge Hall’s distrust of nuclear stewardship quite so harshly.

2023-07-19 12:39:38+00:00,Emily Blunt talks Oppenheimer and responds to criticisms of Nolan's female characters,EXCLUSIVE: The actor discusses her role of Kitty Oppenheimer in director Christopher Nolan's haunting drama,"Director Christopher Nolan’s latest feature Oppenheimer takes us into the tremendous yet troubled mind of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), exploring the events of his life and the crucial role he played in the development of the atomic bomb. Always standing by his side throughout every battle (whether that be at the Los Alamos facility or at a tense hearing) is wife Kitty, played by the ever brilliant Emily Blunt.
The fierce Kitty Oppenheimer isn’t there to hold her husband’s hand. Instead, she is the driving force. Kitty repeatedly uses the word ""fight"" in her conversations with Oppenheimer, continually urging him to push forward in not only his work on the Manhattan Project, but in his later clashes with politicians. ""Why won’t you fight?"" Blunt’s Kitty firmly asks, not through exasperation but instead passion, being Oppenheimer’s biggest champion. She isn’t exactly frustrated by Oppenheimer’s sometimes unwillingness to stand up for himself, Kitty detests the way the world is treating her husband, and what that is turning him into.
For Blunt, this is what is behind Kitty’s tenacity here, as she explained to GamesRadar+: ""I think she believes in him and in his intentions, and I think she loathes seeing him dragged across the coals for their whole life, which is for public consumption. She believes that it is wrong and she knows who is the villain behind it, she has this surety about her whilst he is passive. That definitely incentivises her to push him further because he seems to be taking it as if he’s atoning for the sins of what he’s done and created. It’s really that she’s firing against his passive nature.""

In fact, one of the highlights of the film sees Kitty fight against the politicians with all that she has during Oppenheimer’s hearing, essentially giving them a piece of her mind. She’s certainly a fierce character, but beneath that are vulnerabilities as we see Kitty struggle with the likes of addiction and motherhood, complexities Blunt explores beautifully. The actor is surprised then when we mention that Nolan has often drawn criticism for his female characters, with these commentators often citing the dead wives of his filmography and suggesting that the women are regularly sidelined.
It’s one of the best parts that anyone has ever written for me
Responding with her thoughts on this, Blunt emphasises how Kitty is one of the best roles she has ever played: ""I mean - it’s one of the best parts that anyone has ever written for me. Not that he wrote it for me, but he wrote an exquisite part that is so layered. Even though she’s not a huge part, it packs a punch. I was so excited by her. And the thing that I love is that he wasn’t concerned with her being likeable, it was just a very real interpretation of the character. When you read about her in the book, they say that 'Kitty didn’t do small talk she only did big talk' which is so symbolic of the character. I really remember reading that and thinking, ‘that’s it, she’s so clear’. Usually I think women in movies have to be sort of quite likeable and warm, but she wasn’t either of those things, and he was unafraid of that and writing her as such. I just loved her.""
Will the part of Kitty Oppenheimer change the minds of Nolan's naysayers? Well, only time will tell, but one thing is certain - this Kitty has claws.

Kangana reviews Oppenheimer
Requesting people to watch it, Kangana gave away the plot of the film. She said her favourite part of the film was the reference to the Bhagavad Gita. She said in Hindi, “This is a story of a Jewish physicist who made atomic bomb during World World 2 for America. They think he is leftist. He is deeply political person. As American think that he might be an agent of Soviet Union and considers him anti-national, he ends up creating nuclear power to prove them wrong. But, amid this, his humanity rises and challenges him, which leads to a conflict. This is the theme of the film.” “My favourite part is the reference to Shrimad Bhagavad Gita and Lord Vishnu – when he channelises his inner Vishnu,” she added.
Sharing the video, she wrote, “Christopher Nolan’s best work so far. Most important film of our time… I am so excited I just didn’t want it to end… it has everything I deeply love, I am passionate about physics and politics … For me this was like a cinematic orgasm… beyond wonderful!”

“She is doing PR for the movie against RRKPK (Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani). The more people choose Oppenheimer over RRKPK, the better she will feel,” added another. One more said, “She's clearly an opportunist, who rides on whatever is the wave. Quit taking her seriously if you haven't.”
What did Kangana say?
According to a report of PTI, the actor, Kangana will be next seen in Emergency and Tejas, had said at a press conference in 2021, “We need to discourage American and English movies as they are taking over our screens. We need to behave like one nation. We need to stop dividing ourselves like North India or South India. We need to enjoy our own films first, be it Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu or Punjabi.”
“This is what they are doing here also... We don't appreciate each other, and rather see the dubbed versions of 'Lion King' or 'Jungle Book'. But we will not give a dubbed version of a Malayalam film a chance. This will not work in our favour. We must keep our people and our industry our priority.

2023-08-14 19:47:55+00:00,Oppenheimer Vanderford moves into spotlight,Dorothy Vanderford spent her whole life working behind the scenes.,"(Bill Evans/Boulder City Review) Dorothy Oppenheimer Vanderford in the desert landscaped backyard of her Boulder City home.
Dorothy Vanderford spent her whole life working behind the scenes.
The 25-year Boulder City resident has been a student, a stay-at-home mom and, since her two children finished high school, a technical writer who translates highly complex issues involving emergency communications networks for the Nevada National Security Site. It’s work she can’t really talk about because much of it is classified.
The closest she really came to a public-facing role was working as a volunteer serving food at the Las Vegas Mission. And even there, a more public undertaking was not her cup of tea.
“I tried working in the thrift store once,” she said with a chuckle sitting in the living room of her home in the area known as Golf Course Estates. “It was not for me.”
But that largely anonymous life came to an abrupt end recently.
You see, Vanderford’s maiden name was Dorothy Oppenheimer and the really famous Oppenheimer, J. Robert, the one with the title of the Father of the Atomic Bomb, was her grandfather.
That might have stayed nothing more than great icebreaker info for (classified) office Christmas parties or for when meeting new neighbors except for a little thing known as a Hollywood blockbuster.
The life of a theoretical physicist —“Big Bang Theory” notwithstanding —would not be high up on the “that sounds like great entertainment” scale for much of anyone except Sheldon Cooper who has the handicap of being a fictional character. But in the hands of Christopher Nolan (best known for things like Batman movies and films that mess with time —and the minds of audiences — including “Memento” and “Inception”) directing Cillian Murphy in the title role and Robert Downey, Jr. in a supporting role that might well earn him an Oscar nod, it’s become not just critically acclaimed but an unexpected commercial juggernaut. At the time of this writing, it was number seven on the list of 2023 box-office receipts. It’s ahead of Ant-Man. It’s ahead of John Wick. It’s ahead of Indiana Jones. It is the only movie in the Top 10 that’s not part of a franchise or associated with a toy or a comic book or a video game.
When she was asked by Rob McCoy, the director of the Atomic Testing Museum, to maybe emphasize her maiden name a little and do a few interviews with local media she agreed.
“What I didn’t know is that they had hired a PR firm. So all of a sudden the interview requests just came pouring in,” she said. When the word “inundated” was used to describe the last month, she does not disagree.
Vanderford arrived in Boulder City after a short stay in Las Vegas for the oldest reason there is.
“I came here for love,” she said. “While studying as an undergrad in Eugene, Ore., I met the man who is now my husband and he was born in Boulder City, he was born at the hospital here.”
They bought their first home in BC, one of the historic bungalows on Birch Street, in 1998 and moved into the larger home across from Veterans Memorial Park when her two sons were almost teenagers and they needed more space.
“We lived on Birch Street and I just absolutely loved that place. It was on the corner of Birch and Arizona. It was wonderful but we just needed a bigger place. But I really loved that whole area,” she recalled.
While her sons were in school, she was also continuing her education, adding to the undergrad degree in English with both a masters and a doctorate (also in English) from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
“I’ve always been someone who kept a pretty low profile,” she explained. “First, I never thought a film about my grandfather would ever happen at all. And then when it did, I still didn’t expect to have much to do with it.”
She explains that she never actually knew her famous grandfather, who died in 1967, years before she was even born. She did know her great uncle Frank, the title character’s brother who is depicted in the film and who she calls a “great person.”
“We (the family) were not involved in the making of the movie,” she said. That may be a bit of an understatement. Not only was the family not asked to consult on the film, when the book “American Prometheus” on which the film is based was being researched, historian Martin Sherwin is reported to have interviewed more than 100 people but Vanderford’s father, Peter, the son of the famous physicist, refused a formal interview.
“My brother, he invited himself onto the set. He met Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy. So he had that experience. But I had no involvement,” she explained.
“But if someone asks me to do something, I’m generally going to say ‘yes’. So Rob asked me and I said, ‘Yeah, I’ll do that.’ It was pretty crazy for a little while but it has largely died down now.”
She says she has no regrets about getting involved and calls that fact that a movie was even made with such a notable director, “remarkable.”
She said the family has two quibbles with the final cut of the film. The first, which has been discussed in other interviews was a scene at the beginning of the movie that flashed back to her grandfather’s time in college and insinuated that he had at least considered poisoning one of his instructors. “We don’t think that actually happened,” she said.
The second is all about a more recent event involving her grandfather’s security clearance which is a major plot line in the film.
“In December of 2022, the Department of Energy vacated the decision to rescind his security clearance. They recognized that it was unethically done, that it was illegal and they vacated that decision,” she said. Nothing else can be done posthumously to recognize that the original decision was wrong. Still, it took 68 years for someone in the U.S. government to officially acknowledge that.
“I would just like to say thank you to all of the people who spearheaded that effort.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vYm91bGRlcmNpdHlyZXZpZXcuY29tL25ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItdmFuZGVyZm9yZC1tb3Zlcy1pbnRvLXNwb3RsaWdodC03NzE5Mi_SAVlodHRwczovL2JvdWxkZXJjaXR5cmV2aWV3LmNvbS9uZXdzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXZhbmRlcmZvcmQtbW92ZXMtaW50by1zcG90bGlnaHQtNzcxOTIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-07-28 08:32:55.151000+00:00,I Have So Many Thoughts About Emily Blunt’s Role in ‘Oppenheimer’,"Blunt’s role plays like the Greatest Hits of clichéd, oft-mocked scenes given to the wife in a serious movie. Yet her acting is SO GOOD. We don’t know how to feel about it!","This is a preview of our pop culture newsletter The Daily Beast’s Obsessed, written by editor Kevin Fallon. To receive the full newsletter in your inbox each week, sign up for it here.
It is a story that is foundational to every religious belief that I hold sacred and true, that guides how I live and lead every day. A prophet named Moses (Paltrow-Martin) ascended (the steps of) Mount Sinai (Hospital in New York), where God (Oprah Winfrey) presented him with a tablet (iPad mini) bearing the Ten Commandments.
The list of principles are unimpeachable: Thou shalt have no other God before me, unless she is Beyoncé. Thou shalt not turn into a meeting that which could have been an email. Honor thy Daddy (Andy Cohen) and thy Mother (Nicole Kidman). And, of course, the one that is most personal to me: Thou shalt not see any movie that is over two hours long, because there ain’t no reason for that nonsense.
Well, forgive me Daddy, because I’ve been a bad boy forgive me Father, for I have sinned. I saw Christopher Nolan’s new film Oppenheimer, in spite of the fact that its runtime is three hours, thus violating a core religious belief. Adding to the heresy: I loved it.
We have several pieces at The Daily Beast’s Obsessed detailing what it is about the film that is so good—read ’em all!—but the thing that I’ve been harping on this past week (beyond, you know, the intense trauma and message of the atomic bomb sequence) is the casting.
Cillian Murphy, a tiny-waisted Irish king with cheekbones that can cut through a movie screen, is exactly who I want to spend three hours staring at in IMAX. Aside from the smattering of big names in the most prominent roles—Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Florence Pugh—I was obsessed with the endless experience of “Hey, it’s that guy, from that thing!” that the film delivered with its parade of familiar character actors in the supporting cast. Mostly, though, I’m fascinated by the casting of Emily Blunt.
Blunt plays Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer, the wife of Murphy’s so-called “father of the atomic bomb,” J. Robert Oppenheimer. Kitty is ostensibly the film’s female lead, though still very much a supporting character. In fact, she’s so much of a supporting character, she epitomizes every cliché of the long-suffering wife in an Oscar-baiting film. The underwritten female role in a male-dominated “serious” movie, that a major Hollywood actress is supposed to be satisfied with, despite its meagerness: It’s a long-standing film tradition, but one that, in recent years, has been scrutinized and mocked. (There are some hilarious TikToks skewering these kinds of roles.)
There are few substantial female characters in Oppenheimer, and their material is sorely lacking when compared to what the boys get to do in the movie. Pugh’s entire character arc as Jean Tatlock is to, essentially, flash her boobies three times and then die. (It’s history, not a spoiler.) Olivia Thirlby shows up at the Los Alamos research center and delivers a few ultimately ironic lines about wanting to do more meaningful work, despite being a woman. Inevitable complaints about the presence and portrayal of women in Nolan’s movie are undeniable.
And then there’s the complicated case of Blunt and Kitty. Kitty meets Robert while still married to someone else. They have an affair and, after she gets pregnant, she divorces her third husband to marry Robert (her fourth). From then on, she is devoted to him—whether fiercely or begrudgingly depends on how many refills she’s had of the drink that seems to be permanently glued to her hand. She tolerates the fact that he’s a philandering piece of shit who constantly cheats on her. When his integrity is called into question during a hearing on his possible ties to communism, she insists that he fight—eventually battling on his behalf.
Blunt is one of the most impressive actresses working today, especially when playing emotionally complicated parts that require a nimble juggling of wounded vulnerability and decisive, unflinching power. That she manages both in Oppenheimer is something of a miracle. She makes a meal out of a role that’s a cinematic version of a Fyre Festival snackbox.
Were you hoping for any insight into why Kitty is so devoted to and supportive of Robert? The film’s borderline astonishing adherence to every single stereotype of the aforementioned dutiful wife character means that you don’t get it. Instead, you’re treated to a gauntlet of clichés that Blunt must act her way through. It’s the Greatest Hits, really: There’s a scene where she must silently react while listening to a phone call. There’s a scene where she drunkenly throws a glass at a wall. There’s even a scene where she silently gazes into the distance while bedsheets on a clothing line billow around her, the pinnacle of all potential Wife-in-an-Oscar-Movie scenes. My favorite critique of the role is that Kitty’s “a sentient martini glass.”
But then Blunt and Kitty break out of that mold. There’s a rousing showcase of Blunt’s unique talent near the end of the film, in which Kitty, with a sniper-like precision, exposes the farce of her husband’s—and now her—interrogation. It’s the moment you’ve been waiting the whole film for anyone to do, and it’s especially gratifying that it’s Kitty who does it—and Blunt who executes it so well.
It’s the kind of scene that gets an actress an Oscar nomination, and it very well could get one for Blunt. But should it? It’s almost embarrassing how exactly the role adheres to clichés and stereotypes, to the point that I wondered if we were all being trolled. Blunt, however, manages to be mesmerizing in spite of the material—in her big scene, yes, but also, quite surprisingly, in those eye roll-inducing ones too. It’s an interesting place to come from when endorsing an actor for awards recognition: I can’t believe how ridiculous this role is, but she’s so good that I want her to be nominated anyway.
I’d argue that this could—and maybe should—be Blunt’s fifth nod. Hindsight is 20/20, and we can clearly see now how outrageous it is that she wasn’t nominated for The Devil Wears Prada. At least twice, she’s come close to being nominated after a long awards season—for Young Victoria and Mary Poppins Returns—and I think we really undersell how brilliant her SAG Award-winning work was in A Quiet Place.
Sometimes you’re one cube of cheese a day and a stomach flu away from your goal weight. Sometimes you’re one almond a day away from the greatest role of your career. And sometimes you’re one clichéd, long-suffering wife from the deserved Oscar nod that’s eluded you for decades.

The actor plays J. Robert Oppenheimer in Christopher Nolan’s new biographical epic about the creation of the atomic bomb, which recently passed $500million (£392m) at the global box office, making it the most successful WW2 film ever.
The film was involved in a highly publicised box office battle and social media face off with Barbie, which came out on the same day, leading the unofficial double bill feature to be dubbed ‘Barbenheimer’.

In an interview with The Independent, Murphy said he was going to see Barbie, but also picked his ideal Christopher Nolan double bill with Oppenheimer, which would come down to “two options”.
“You could go Interstellar, which is very… explores similar scientific, physic themes,” he said. “Or you could watch Dunkirk, which is also set in World War II. Dunkirk is shorter, so that might be a good match ‘cause it’s like an hour-and-a-half, and then you can go into [Oppenheimer].”
When asked which other Nolan film he would like to have appeared in, Murphy chose 2017’s Interstellar. He has collaborated with the director on six films: Oppenheimer, Dunkirk, Inception and the Dark Knight trilogy.
“I adore Interstellar just because I find it so emotional,” he said.

“I remember seeing it in the cinema when I had little kids. It just had a big impact on me. It broke my heart. I love watching his films when I’m not in them because you don’t have to freak out about the size of your ears, or whatever.”
Speaking to NME recently, Murphy said that he likes playing characters that are “unknowable, ambiguous, kind of enigmatic”, adding: “To me that’s human life: the knotty, weird grey areas… A good man’s life is wholly uninteresting.”
In a five-star review of Oppenheimer, NME wrote that the film was “not just the definitive account of the man behind the atom bomb”, but a “monumental achievement in grown-up filmmaking”.​",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5tZS5jb20vbmV3cy9maWxtL2NpbGxpYW4tbXVycGh5LXJldmVhbHMtdGhlLWZpbG0taGVkLWRvdWJsZS1iaWxsLXdpdGgtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItMzQ4Mzc3M9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-25 09:41:00+00:00,The real story of Jean Tatlock and how Oppenheimer fails her,"Christopher Nolan's saga of questionable female characters continues: played by Florence Pugh, Jean Tatlock's real story shapes the main male character's story.","Oppenheimer spoilers follow.
Note: The following article contains discussion of themes including suicide and depression.
Oppenheimer’s Jean Tatlock was a key figure in the life of J Robert Oppenheimer, but her role in Christopher Nolan’s movie (she's played by Florence Pugh) is underwhelming to say the least.
Tatlock’s story is fairly accurate when compared to her real biography, though it feels too story-driven, too calculated, too eager to fit into a pattern of 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' meets 'high-intellectual sexual fantasies' meets 'mental-breakdown, irrational mistress'.
This might be the most questionable aspect of an otherwise excellent movie.
Of course, at the centre of the story is Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), known as the father of the atomic bomb, but even as everybody gravitates around him, characters like Jean Tatlock feel particularly underwritten, her merits underplayed.
We first see Pugh’s character at a gathering among left-leaning people at Berkeley University in 1936, where she meets Oppenheimer, talks a little bit about communism and supporting Spanish Republicans, and minutes later they’re having sex while reading Sanskrit.

The staging of this moment feels like pure hetero-male fantasy: a topless Pugh makes a pit stop while having intercourse to grab from the bookshelf behind her one of the most sacred Indian-Hindu scriptures, the Bhagavad Gita, so Oppenheimer can read aloud: ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.""
Somewhere in the world, Zack Snyder nods with a smile.
Oppenheimer was enthralled by Tatlock, even proposing to her twice, but the movie shows how their relationship takes a turn due to her never-explained erratic behaviour, simply shown as a sort of ""female hysteria"" that foreshadows her tragic demise years later.
The physicist then goes on to marry Kitty (played by Emily Blunt), but he maintains occasional sexual encounters with Tatlock, who in the following years will fall into a severe depression. On January 4, 1944, she died by suicide.
According to Tatlock's father memory of it (via Vanity Fair), the scene was pretty similar as how it’s shown in Nolan’s movie — the drugs, the cushions piled next to the bathtub — but included a note that partially read: ""I think I would have been a liability all my life — at least I could take away the burden of a paralysed soul from a fighting world.""
Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures
We don't hear or read these words in the movie. We also don't get to grasp Tatlock's fascinating work as a reporter and writer, or why she believed so strongly in the communist cause beyond being a passionate, idealistic young student.
In the book , which Oppenheimer is based on, the authors speculate she may have been struggling with her sexuality at the time, which is something that might have added some layers of understanding to the unexplored mental health problems the movie portrays.
As it turns out, Tatlock was a deeply complex person struggling with some serious issues we might never know the full extent of.
However, in the movie, Tatlock sometimes seems more like a figment of Oppenheimer’s imagination, a catalyst for torment, a nightmare-inducing presence in the protagonist's life akin to the sparks and stars that sometimes keeps him awake at night.
But, alas, she was a real person, even if the movie’s narrative sees her as another ticking time bomb heading for an explosion that will leave scars on other people’s lives.
Maybe Tatlock proved a tad too complicated for a writer like Nolan, who, despite being a terrific storyteller and one of the most heralded filmmakers of the 21st century, does not have the best track record regarding female characters.
Universal
Going from numerous dead wives and love interests in films like Memento, The Prestige and the Batman trilogy, to a filmography-record number of zero named female characters in war epic Dunkirk, women in Christopher Nolan movies are too often tied to the male's journeys, needs and desperate searches for purpose.
Tatlock is a new, frustrating case to add to the list. Despite being one of today’s most captivating actresses, there's only so much Florence Pugh can do to bring layers and life to the character, attached to a mysteriously troubled — but of course, sexy — personality that can only be attributed to careless writing.
Both Tatlock and Oppenheimer’s wife, purely defined by her alcoholism and occasionally delightful sass, represent once again Nolan’s worst tendency. Still, it doesn't go unnoticed how the filmmaker makes an effort to show how women were involved in Los Alamos during the years of the Manhattan Project, from wives-turned-secretaries to promising scientists.
Pointing out this questionable aspect of Oppenheimer doesn’t diminish the merits of the movie, a stunning three-hour biopic filled with visual wonder and led by an Oscar-worthy performance by Cillian Murphy.
Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures
Since the movie spans most of Oppenheimer’s life, and despite its extensive runtime (the longest in Nolan’s filmography), maybe the problem affecting Jean Tatlock’s portrayal is simply a lack of time.
As Digital Spy's review puts it: ""There are so many characters, in fact, that not everybody can make an impact.""
Perhaps the movie tried to cover too much, so characters like Pugh’s ended up being small things you find along the way, little pieces in a carefully put-together jigsaw, instead of fully realised characters able to do justice to their real-life counterparts.
Even in somebody else's story, supporting characters can aspire to be rounded individuals, and a woman's pain can be used as carefully as the harrowing feelings of the father of the atomic bomb.

,"Film Critic Harlan Jacobson reviews ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One""",WBGO Film Critic Harlan Jacobson reviews Oppenheimer and Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One,"DD: Not just one Mission Impossible, but two, the latest Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One with Tom Cruise returning as agent Ethan Hunt in the 7th installment in the series, and Oppenheimer, with Cillian Murphy in Christopher Nolan’s large-screen epic about the race to beat Germany to the atomic bomb in WWII. Our film critic, Harlan Jacobson, ties them together and jumps.
HJ: The film universe is atwitter – you should pardon the expression--with Barbieheimer, the race between two mass market films, Barbie and Oppenheimer, that are both opening this weekend to chase big numbers at the box office like the old days, pre-everything. At least as interesting is the performance test between Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning and Oppenheimer. Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer are in their way similar and what the industry needs—fresh auteurist visions where one is light satire with a feminist intent, and the other a dark mea culpa on the use and abuse of male power. But Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning represents the continued uninspired retooling of past franchises – Bond, Bat, Super and Spiderman, Marvels that are no longer marvels -- that are the default position of risk-averse corporate filmmaking. This is the cancer that was eating away at theatrical attendance 30 years before the pandemic landed theaters in the ICU.
Harlan Jacobson Tom Cruise stars as ""Ethan Hunt"" in Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One
Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie’s Dead Reckoning with Tom Cruise hopping from planes to trains and at least one clown car, and Oppenheimer with the lesser-known Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man who birthed the atom bomb and regretted it even before the fallout rained down, however, are both about missions impossible—to save the planet for good or ill. Oppenheimer, however, is the bet made by visionary filmmaking associated with the great American indie explosion of the early 70s in Marty Scorsese and especially Francis Ford Coppola that the way forward is by investigating the American character, in fiction or in history, to take the pulse of the culture in which we now live.
Dead Reckoning did well in its first week out. And given that everyone in the industry, specially during these strike months, is watching the vital signs of both theatres and distributors, that’s a cheering sign if you care about the biz. But the health of the art — meaningful, fresh character narrative that has Tolstoy’s aspirations to paint the broader moment and David Lean’s imperative to make it big – lies with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, lensed by his cameraman on Tenet, Dunkirk and Interstellar, Hoyte Van Hoytema. It's spirit may lie with American indie filmmaking, but Oppenheimer was made using the elite and expensive cutting edge tech tools of film, crafted by people at the top of their art, with limitless resources backed by a studio, Universal, releasing it in standard film, digital IMAX, and in its best iteration that matches how it was shot on a 70-millimeter IMAX film camera – shown at a premium price of $26.99 at Loews 68th Street in NYC, one of 19 theaters in the US and 30 worldwide equipped to show it.
Nolan’s 12th film – you may remember his Memento back in 2000 about what we need to remember -- has two principal concerns on its mind: 1) the moral no-man’s land entered by Oppy, the scientist given a sports team nickname when he led the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos to build the atomic bombs dropped on Japan to end the war, and 2) the ensuing security driven fascism of the Communist witch hunt in Congress less than a decade later that destroyed Oppenheimer’s reputation and his career. At three hours and distilled from the 2006 Pulitzer Prize winning 700 -page book, American Prometheus, The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by former Nation columnist Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film’s arc follows Oppenheimer from his days as a university student who was a lab klutz but a good theoretical physics thinker, through his selection to bring the bomb to bear on the war effort, and the multiple layers of tragedy that ensue.
There are the overlapping politics of university life, military protocols, the war, the post war madness, and the personal dynamics, from marriage to professional egos, that must be threaded and orchestrated on a metronome keyed at first to the German head start on developing a bomb, led by Werner Heisenberg, he of the already famous Heisenberg principle that if you can see it, you’ve altered its nature. Then the metronome of The Red Scare takes over, and we watch Murphy’s 60-foot face trying to reconcile his heartsickness with the inexorable political buzzsaw of petit tyrants coming at him that Sean Connery’s James Bond or Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt routinely escape.
The film is peopled by front rank actors at the top of their power – Murphy as Oppy, Emily Blunt as his wife Kitty, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr. in a standout turn as Oppy’s Brutus, Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh (as Niels Bohr), David Krumholtz, Bennie Safdie (Edward Teller), Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Florence Pugh and Gary Oldman as a chameleon Harry Truman. Nolan returns to the screen 80s British leading man Tom Conti as Albert Einstein and Josh Peck, lost since Nickelodeon’s 2004 series, Drake & Josh, as the nervous wreck here who pushes the button at Los Alamos.
Nolan’s film positions Oppenheimer to understand the necessity of the project, even as the swirl historically pondered how, especially where and whether to use it. Oppenheimer in Nolan is divided against himself. Even on a screen as large as a football field, there’s a lot of one-on-one ruminations before and after the countdown to the Trinity test blast, which Nolan creates in a fireball, and the ultimate bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki delivered more demurely here over a radio report and newsreel aftermath. Oppenheimer is ultimately ruined as a Communist security risk by Senate investigations shown here that drop out to IMAX in black and white. But how we see him hinges on one line, when he responds to a colleague’s private suggestion that the bomb is so terrible they really ought to keep the Soviets in the loop. The film stops for a beat. “That would be treason,” Oppenheimer says here, and he’s having none of that. Ergo, chalk up Oppy as another wronged patriot and a man so traumatized by doubt he’s incapable of defending himself in the face of the fascist McCarthy period.
Everything in America always does come down to how Walt Kelly summarized it in Pogo long ago: “We have met the enemy, and they is us.” This Oppenheimer is brave, ambitious, magnificently accomplished in its filmmaking and on point.
This 7th in the series of Mission Impossibles, Dead Reckoning, begins in a super stealth Russian sub that yields a lot of dead Russians bobbing up beneath the Arctic ice cap and a two-part, interlocking brass key vital to defeat the enemy and save the planet. The hunt is on! Through two hours and 43 minutes, I never did figure out who the enemy is that Cruise as the returning rogue agent Ethan Hunt is battling. He’s got it going on two fronts: his own CIA on the one hand and on the other what?, who? huh?
It helps if the times you live in afford an enemy that corresponds to the real world, but here it’s abstracted into a metaphor called The Entity. (How’s that for a screenwriter hedge?) After all the high tech stuff the CIA uses and Cruise abuses in this film, I never did get how the fate of the planet hinges on finding a brass key? I kept thinking that key sure looks like the one my parents used to open a Chinese dry bar (with pearl inlays) that my father bought for our living room in 1958 at the LS Ayres Dept store in Indianapolis and which my brother transferred from my pile to his pile when we closed up the house in Toledo. “Ethan, don’t kill yourself, my brother has a key like that on Fullerton Ave in Chicago,” I wanted to shout.
No worries, as Cruise, Hayley Atwell as hot female agent Grace, Ving Rhames as the sidekick and Simon Pegg as the techie, engage in a millisecond by millisecond never-ending pitched battle with The Entity, transversing the globe to do chop-socky stunts on the roof of a speeding train, a slap-stick shift tear through Rome in a circus yellow Fiat 500, and leaps of faith over rooftops in Venice and the Swiss Alps and across the sands of Abu Dhabi in a mission that plays out as really quite possible after all to save the world. Yes, Tom Cruise is a Unicorn, as my son calls him. And as with all franchise victories, Carvel Cone afterwards.

2023-07-11 17:18:29+00:00,Elie Wiesel reviewed ‘Oppenheimer’ — and it made him shudder,"""Oppenheimer embodied the questions, not the answers,"" Elie Wiesel wrote in 1969 for the Forward in a rare piece of theater criticism.","Editor’s note: In March 1969, in a rare piece of theater criticism, Elie Wiesel was moved to write about a production of German playwright Heinar Kipphardt’s In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer, based on the physicist’s 1954 security clearance hearing. Oppenheimer objected to the play for what he called “improvisations which were contrary to history and to the nature of the people involved,” including its choice to present him as regretting his work on the Manhattan Project. But watching it on Broadway, Wiesel “shuddered” at what he regarded as the play’s “truth.” The article, originally published in the Forward on March 12, 1969, is below.
When McCarthyism swarmed over America, I was still living in France. It’s still hard to comprehend how one demagogue with several followers managed to terrorize an entire nation. How was one hysteric able to endanger the very foundations of American democracy?
Naturally, there were logical reasons — the Korean war, the Soviet atomic developments, the spread of Communism and its aggressive ambitions. The most powerful country in the world had at once lost its monopoly on all its domains. Suddenly Stalinism’s real face was revealed and so doubts about Roosevelt’s loyalty to the Russian dictator wasn’t a costly mistake. Bringing forth circumstances for an irresponsible demagogue with an answer to everything and a scapegoat for all sins.
It’s difficult, practically impossible, to digest that era’s psychosis. Seems to me the same is true for many American citizens. They recall the events, but avoid speaking about them. It’s almost a taboo topic: it’s not to be investigated, in order not to open an old wound, an ancient shame.

I mention this now because of an innocent coincidence. I had the opportunity to see Heinar Kipphardt’s play about the Oppenheimer investigation at the Lincoln Repertory Theatre. The experience was so deep, I felt an obligation to report to readers, despite the fact that I’m not a professional theater critic, nor do I want to infringe on my critic colleague’s boundaries.
Why did the play cause me to shudder? With its content and presentation, it ripped through me and made me hopeful once more about the individual’s struggle, and the visions of artists and dreamers.
It shook me up due to its portrayal, its truth. Robert Oppenheimer intrigued me for years: his poetic genius, his tragic fate. Despite a deeply felt humanism, he created the atomic bomb: despite being pro-communist in the 1930’s, he remained loyal to America: despite being a notable Jew, he remained at a distance from Yiddishkeit.
Related How a Jewish spy infiltrated the U.S. atomic program — and helped the Soviet Union build the bomb
How does one weave together so many contradictions? How to clarify so many childish errors (during the investigation against him) and such an acute mind? What did he wish to achieve, and did he achieve it and if so, when?
As I mentioned, I wasn’t living in America when, as a result of the McCarthyist psychosis, the sadly, well known investigation began about Oppenheimer’s loyalty. But I read everything about the case—and am not any smarter for it.
It often seems to me that he was a pretentious intellectual, dancing at several weddings at once, while worshiping several gods simultaneously. He wanted to develop weapons, but not have to use them: befriend communists, but toss their ideas; engage with international political issues but only as a scientist not as a politician. His identity was so split, so variously defined that he alone didn’t fully know what he thought.
And so, at his apex, as well as in the darkest moments of his career, he presented critical introspective questions having to do with human knowledge: at what point are we remaining loyal and to whom? At what point must we step up and say ‘enough?’ Those questions rattle all atomic thinkers. They know that today they are sitting in secure laboratories toying with abstract concepts the results of which could be the destruction of millions of souls. Intellectuals aren’t free from similar doubts. One can fool around with words in order to write a poem or allegory. But how did Oscar Wilde put it? “One man’s poetry is another man’s poison.” Not for nothing did Oppenheimer at the time of the first atomic bomb explosion recall passages from the “Baghavad Ghita”: “I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” In the last several generations the Angel of Death has had the final say.
My interest in Oppenheimer also has to do with his being current. It’s no coincidence that so many young people are going to see the play. They identify with his struggle, with his lonely battle against uncomfortable authority, with his protest against bellicose instincts that rage throughout government circles. The college students attempting to revolt against biological weapons production, for example, are following in Oppenheimer’s footsteps. His problem was that he hadn’t created any positive theories. We know what had to be done, but how do we save humanity from suicide. Even Oppenheimer didn’t preach de-weaponization, at a time when the Communist bloc is strengthening its military capability. What is to be done? Oppenheimer had no answer for that. It seems there is no answer.
Oppenheimer embodied the questions, not the answers. He endlessly posed riddles, not solutions, and so we must go see him at Lincoln Theatre. Him? Yes. The actor portraying him—a tall, intelligent and palpably Jewish young man named Joseph Wiseman—has so fully incorporated his character that he resembles him physically.
Wiseman, one of the best actors on the English language stage, plays his role with such sensitivity, with such restraint that it’s simply impossible not to be moved. Each word sounds right, he doesn’t stumble. Thanks to him, Oppenheimer is clearly depicted. He answered many of my qualms. I have much to say about Wiseman, but, as I mentioned, I’m no theater critic; I’m merely a witness of Oppenheimer and Joseph Wiseman.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZm9yd2FyZC5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS81NTM2NTUvZWxpZS13aWVzZWwtcm9iZXJ0LW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXBsYXktcmV2aWV3L9IBVGh0dHBzOi8vZm9yd2FyZC5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS81NTM2NTUvZWxpZS13aWVzZWwtcm9iZXJ0LW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXBsYXktcmV2aWV3Lz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-07-26 16:00:00+00:00,The Shelter Island-Oppenheimer connection,,"(Courtesy image)
Shelter Island has a connection to one of the summer’s blockbuster movies.
In an April 2021 profile of James and Linda Eklund and their Ram’s Head Inn, Reporter feature writer Charity Robey uncovered the fact that in June 1947, 25 of the best minds in physics met at the hotel over three days.
Officially dubbed the “Conference on the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics,” it was an historic meeting, headed by Robert Oppenheimer. Also in attendance were world-renowned scientists Linus Pauling, Edward Teller and Richard Feynman.
The National Academy of Sciences stated that the “conference was in fact nothing less than a who’s who of postwar American physics. Interestingly, the attendees were treated like celebrities when they arrived at Greenport, Long Island, where they stopped before heading on to Shelter Island.”
According to the American Physical Society, attendees “attacked quantum mechanics problems with the voracity of pirates plundering an enemy ship’s trove. Three days later, the scientists emerged victoriously with a booty that was far more valuable to them than any shiny doubloons: they had tackled some of the most perplexing mysteries of physics. In doing so, they put Shelter Island on the map of monuments of physics historical importance.”
A second conference, held in 1983 at the Ram’s Head, brought physics luminaries together again, this time including Stephen Hawking.
Ray Williamson, science teacher at Shelter Island School, brought his students to the Inn in 1983 to meet the physicists. Ms. Eklund asked the spouses of some of the participants if they usually came along for conferences.
“They said they had to,” she said. “These scientists think on such a level that operating a toaster oven is difficult for them.”
No reports — yet — of any life-sized Barbie sightings on the Island.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vc2hlbHRlcmlzbGFuZHJlcG9ydGVyLnRpbWVzcmV2aWV3LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3LzI2L3RoZS1zaGVsdGVyLWlzbGFuZC1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1jb25uZWN0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Cillian Murphy, who in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer played the titular role of theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, was recently asked whether he will be down to play the role of Ken if there is a sequel to Barbie.
He said, “Sure! Let’s read a script. Let's have a conversation."" He then went on to describe how excited he is to see Greta Gerwig-directed film (which has Margot Robbie in the lead role), saying: ""I can't wait to see the movie, I think it's great for cinema, you know, you've got all these great movies happening this summer.""
What is Oppenheimer all about?
Oppenheimer, both written and directed by Nolan, is a sweeping opus of historical significance that draws inspiration from Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin's seminal biography, American Prometheus (which everyone should definitely read).
Oppenheimer has a complicated legacy and is remembered as the father of the atomic bomb for his contribution to the Manhattan Project. Adding to the film's appeal is an impressive ensemble cast, featuring Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh. WION's Kshitij Rawat wrote in his review of Oppenheimer, ""As Oppenheimer unfolds, Nolan presents us with a kaleidoscope of ethical dilemmas that transcend time. The film's resonance lies not only in its historical accuracy but also in its exploration of the human condition, the pursuit of knowledge, and the choices that shape our destinies. Oppenheimer is an unmissable cinematic event. I am not quite sure if it is indeed Nolan's best work as many have said, but it definitely comes close.""
What is Barbie all about?
Directed by Gerwig and written by Gerwig and her partner Noah Baumbach, Barbie is a live-action fantasy comedy. The film features a huge starry ensemble cast with names like America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, Ariana Greenblatt, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, Helen Mirren, and Will Ferrell.
WION's Shomini Sen wrote in her review of Barbie, ""I would still say that the film very smartly shows how society is and humanises the iconic doll. For decades Barbie has been one of the most popular toys for young girls, setting unrealistic standards of beauty. Sure, Mattel has reinvented the doll and made every girl believe that they can be whatever they want to be - just like their favourite doll, but the narrative of everything being overtly perfect has also done damage to several. Greta, in that sense, spins the narrative and adds a layer of cynicism to Barbieland to show how things are in real. Flawed, depressed, and definitely not perfect- even though the plastic remains constant.""

Oppenheimer's contradictions, his family, and his colleagues are explored. He sought to warn of the dangers of nuclear weapons, but was punished for it. The book looks at his life, his tragedy, and his quoting of the Bhagavad Gita.","July 28, 2023 09:35 am | Updated 01:04 pm IST
On August 6, 1945, at 15 minutes past 8 a.m., an atomic bomb flashed over Hiroshima, Japan, killing over 100,000 people. Six survivors wondered “why they lived when so many others died”, wrote John Hersey, an American journalist, in The New Yorker (1946).
On August 7, 1945, Japanese radio had broadcast an announcement that a new type of bomb had been used at Hiroshima. It was a time when America was routinely bombing Japanese cities towards the end of World War II. But Hiroshima, and then Nagasaki, were obliterated by the atomic bomb, the first time the weapon had been used.
It all began with the Manhattan Project, led by J. Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb”, a brilliant American theoretical physicist who had learned quantum physics in Germany in the 1920s. His family had moved to the U.S., made wealth in business, and he went from New York to Los Alamos in New Mexico to lead a team of scientists to invent “the gadget”.
‘A Faustian bargain’
Oppenheimer was “America’s Prometheus”, who headed the effort to “wrest from nature the awesome fire of the sun for his country in the time of war”, write Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin in their gripping Pulitzer-winning biography, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer (2005). The book, the primary inspiration for British director Christopher Nolan’s latest film, Oppenheimer, traces the rise and fall of a scientist who was an enigma guided by “his extraordinary intelligence, his parents, his teachers at the Ethical Culture School, and his youthful and professional experiences”.
The insightful biography profiles “Oppie” and his many ambiguities, by talking to his family and colleagues, fellow scientists and brilliant minds. It quotes physicist Freeman Dyson who saw deep and poignant contradictions in Oppenheimer. “He had dedicated his life to science and rational thought,” Dyson observed. Yet, Oppenheimer’s decision to participate in the creation of a genocidal weapon was “a Faustian bargain”. Like Faust, Oppenheimer tried to “renegotiate the bargain” — and was punished for doing so. “Oppenheimer had led the effort to unleash the power of the atom, but when he sought to warn his countrymen of its dangers, to constrain America’s reliance on nuclear weapons, the government questioned his loyalty and put him on trial.”
The first half of the book outlines Oppenheimer’s rise to fame and iconic status in the 1940s; his personal life and tragedies, such as the passing away of his girlfriend; his politics; and the fact that he loved to quote from the Bhagavad Gita, and gift it to his friends. When the bomb was tested for the first time and the mushroom cloud was sighted, Oppenheimer said this line had come to his mind: “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds,” which scholars have said should read, “I am time... the source of destruction of all the worlds.”
Tide of anti-communist rising
The second part chronicles his downfall, quickened by the tide of anti-communism rising in post-war America. “His post-war resistance to the Air Force’s plans for massive strategic bombing with nuclear weapons — plans he called genocidal — had angered many powerful Washington insiders.” And for this, he had to endure unimaginable agony and humiliation in 1954. He died in his sleep when he was 62 years old, and his wife Kitty confided in a friend how his passing was pitiful. “He turned into a child first, then an infant. He made noises. I couldn’t go into the room.”
It’s impossible to read American Prometheus and not think of one cold fact: that the nuclear path could have been avoided for military purposes. The war was already ending. Japan had sent feelers that it was willing to surrender. The compelling reason behind the nuclear race was no longer an issue. Germany had not come out with an atomic bomb despite whispers to the contrary. Today, the nuclear Damocles’ sword hangs over every powerful and not-so-powerful country.
In 2017, Daniel Ellsberg of the Pentagon Papers fame wrote in his devastating book, The Doomsday Machine, that senior American army commanders were discussing in the 1960s how many people would die if, in the event of war, 40 megatons of N-bombs were dropped on Moscow: the “curve of deaths” was estimated at 100 million with more than half the population of the Soviet Union killed from radioactive fallout alone.
The world has not learnt its lessons, as Oppenheimer had hoped.
The writer looks back at one classic every month.

For its opening two-thirds, the film builds at a breakneck pace to the instant in which both man and civilization are irrevocably changed by an act of fission: the July 16, 1945, “Trinity” test of the first atomic bomb on the plains of the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range, 210 miles south of Los Alamos. That scene is the initial climax of Christopher Nolan’s IMAX-sized masterpiece, and a bravura expression of the film’s intertwined formal and thematic ideas, all of which meld together and split apart in a big bang whose concussive power shakes reality itself.
Oppenheimer may be the story of a scientist figuring out a way to put theory into practice, but it moves at the speed of an apocalyptic thriller, with the fate of everyone and everything hanging in the balance of quantum physics pioneer J. Robert Oppenheimer’s (Cillian Murphy) race to beat the Nazis to atomic supremacy. That comes to a head in the New Mexico desert, where Oppenheimer and his colleagues hurry to meet the Potsdam Conference deadline set by President Truman (Gary Oldman) and pushed by their Manhattan Project director Leslie Groves (Matt Damon).
It’s the pivotal make-or-break moment that will determine the success of not only this groundbreaking scientific endeavor (and vital military undertaking), but possibly of World War II. Moreover, humanity itself hangs in the balance, since there’s a slim (“near zero”) chance that an atomic explosion will bring about Armageddon.
Nolan infuses this critical passage with the inexorable dread of witnessing the inevitable in all its paradigm-altering glory and horror. Piece by piece, technicians assemble the device, with Nolan cutting between that construction and sights of Oppenheimer and his team finalizing preparations for the Trinity trial run.
The sandstorm winds howl and the rains punish the arid land as Oppenheimer, his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold) and Groves discuss blast radiuses and the distance people will have to be from ground zero to avoid incineration and contamination, and late debates break out over whether the weapon will fire when soaked—leading to a monetary bet that’s so out of place (given the stakes of this venture) that it merely heightens the undertaking’s pressure-cooker hysteria. “Try not to blow up the world,” Groves recommends with a wryness that can’t mask the fear and stress engulfing everyone. “Break a leg,” says Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) to her husband, the cliché so small and inadequate, it’s as if words have failed her in the face of such an epochal event.
When morning dawns and the downpours have subsided (as Oppenheimer, an expert on New Mexico weather patterns, accurately predicted), Oppenheimer puts the pedal to the metal, hurtling toward the second that the past will conclude and the future will commence. A clock ticks down as Nolan segues between countenances stricken with a distress and anticipation that’s so concentrated as to be almost unbearable.
‘Oppenheimer’ Review: Christopher Nolan’s Devastating, Explosive Magnum Opus
Positions are manned, final tasks are completed. In a shed with Oppenheimer, Kenneth Bainbridge (Josh Peck) stands over the cancellation button, his hand trembling with terror. At one outpost, Richard Feynman (Jack Quaid) and Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett) take their seats in a car—as if at a drive-in movie—and Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) sits beside their vehicle in a chair, coating his face in glistening UV-protecting sunscreen and donning sunglasses to shield his eyes. Elsewhere, Isidor Isaac Rabi (David Krumholtz), Groves, and others lie on blankets, holding up silvery cards to protect their retinas from the coming explosion.
Ludwig Göransson’s score crescendos in a cacophony of shrieking Psycho-esque strings that are underscored by chest-rattling low tones, both heralding doom. Jennifer Lane’s edits accelerate and the film becomes a harried series of faces, so many faces, overcome by excitement and alarm. Finally, Nolan cuts back to Oppenheimer musing to himself, “These things are hard on your heart” (another piercing understatement that casts the enormity of it all into sharp relief) and then the clock turns to zero and it arrives, finally, in a flash of light that’s so bright it blinds, and so powerful it knocks the wind out of the universe and the breath out of the film, its characters and the audience, all of them struck silently dumb by the blossoming clouds and towering columns of fire that rise and cascade across the screen. Lawrence slightly recoils, Teller softly goes “pooh” with his lips, and Oppenheimer removes his goggles and, after steeling himself, opens his eyes to stare upon his handiwork.
Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures
The quiet is palpable, the awe overwhelming, and it’s shattered by a boom and blasts of air and sand that are as thunderous as the preceding hush was oppressive. Cheers, handshakes, and cries of “it worked” ensue, with Teller (a man who covets an even greater bomb) smiling, Rabi looking far less enthusiastic, and Oppenheimer overcome with the dazed joy of an inventor who has pulled off—and witnessed—a miracle. It’s the alpha and the omega, an end and a beginning. As befitting Oppenheimer’s fixation on dichotomies, Nolan envisions it in heightened contrasts: loud and noiseless; swift and patient; exhilarating and dismaying; close-up and panoramic; and triumphant and tragic, the last of these embodied by Oppenheimer’s legendary quote of the Bhagavad Gita upon the completion of his creation, “I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""
A woozy celebration ensues, followed by Oppenheimer being informed by a military officer, “We’ll take it from here.” With that, Oppenheimer steps forward into its new day, which is also like its prior one, with Murphy’s physicist both inherently altered and forced to figuratively re-experience Trinity at a celebratory speech wracked by light, then silence, and finally a roaring boom—a manifestation of his dawning guilt over what he’s done.
Universal Pictures
The closing hour of Nolan’s film is a bifurcated, chronologically fragmented study of the cataclysmic chain-reaction aftermath of its centerpiece, from which there is no recovery, for Oppenheimer or anyone else. As Nolan so brilliantly evokes, the maiden atomic bomb has transformed everything, begetting in its apocalyptic fire and brimstone a tomorrow that will never be like yesterday, and yet will also always be defined by July 16, 1945. In that respect, Oppenheimer’s show-stopping “Trinity” sequence is a depiction of a specific dream realized and the birth of mankind’s greatest nightmare: fear of annihilation, ever-present and eternal.

,Pat Stacey’s TV review: Terrific Oppenheimer miniseries gets a welcome BBC reshowing,"LONG before Cillian Murphy there was Sam Waterston, and long before Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer there was Peter Goodchild’s Oppenheimer (BBC4, Friday), which is being reshown for the first time in decades.","Peter Goodchild’s brilliant seven-part drama is from a far more creative era of TV

LONG before Cillian Murphy there was Sam Waterston, and long before Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer there was Peter Goodchild’s Oppenheimer (BBC4, Friday), which is being reshown for the first time in decades.
Goodchild, who was interviewed by Variety last month to coincide with the film’s release, started his BBC producing career in radio drama and later moved to television with the science documentary series Horizon.
When Horizon diversified into science docudramas in the 1970s, Goodchild, who holds a chemistry degree, got to combine his two interests in a successful series about Marie Curie.
The supporting cast was made up almost entirely of American actors based in Britain.
It was his idea to make a seven-part miniseries about J Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, played by Waterston. First shown on BBC2 in 1980, Oppenheimer was a big hit with viewers and critics, winning three Bafta awards. It also garnered Emmy and Golden Globe nominations after it was shown on PBS in the United States.
The budget of £1.5m (about €7.5m today) – 90pc of it coming from the BBC, the rest from WGBH Boston – might seem like a grain of New Mexico sand compared with the £100m price tag of Nolan’s Imax epic.
Back then, however, it was a huge spend for a British drama.
A huge physical production, too, with scrupulous attention to detail. For maximum authenticity, Goodchild, now 83, told Variety, the Manhattan Project’s Los Alamos Laboratory was recreated on a purpose-built set in Colorado Springs, complete with water tower and replica bomb.
One million film goers expected as Barbenheimer released
The supporting cast was made up almost entirely of American actors based in Britain.
Two notable exceptions were future Poirot star David Suchet as the excitable, voluble Hungarian physicist Edward Teller and Edward Hardwicke (Dr Watson to Jeremy Brett’s Sherlock Holmes) as his Italian colleague Enrico Fermi.
Viewers who have grown used to watching even modestly budgeted dramas shot on HD video that mimics celluloid film may find the switch from Oppenheimer’s interior scenes, which were mostly shot on videotape in a studio in the UK, to the ones shot on film in America a little jarring at first.
But the story is so engrossing you cease to be aware of the contrast after a while.
What’s remarkable is how well Oppenheimer, which was written by Peter Prince and directed by Barry Davis, holds up 43 years later.
There’s none of the slowness or staginess you sometimes see in dramas from the period. Friday’s opening two episodes positively zipped by.
He conveys Oppenheimer’s charisma, intelligence, brilliance and charm, especially to women.
They spanned the years 1938, when Oppenheimer was at the University of Berkley, to 1942, when Lieutenant General Leslie Groves (Manning Redwood), ignoring warnings about Oppenheimer’s long associations with active communists and championing of left-wing causes, put him in charge of the Manhattan Project, which was to be housed in a high-security facility in Los Alamos.
Waterston, just four years ahead of his best actor Oscar nomination for playing Siydney Schanberg in The Killing Fields, is fantastic as Oppenheimer.
You can see why the BBC was prepared to pay him well above the normal rate for appearing in one of its dramas and to put him up in a luxury hotel during filming.
He conveys Oppenheimer’s charisma, intelligence, brilliance and charm, especially to women.
But we also see his ruthlessness and arrogance.
When we meet him, he’s romantically involved with psychiatrist and communist Jean Tatlock (Kate Harper), who suffered from clinical depression (she died by suicide in 1944), yet thinks nothing of casting her aside when he sets eyes on his future wife Kitty Puening (Jana Shelden), who at that time is married to someone else.
They tumble into an affair. In one particularly cruel moment, he humiliates Jean by turning up at a dinner party at her home with Kitty on his arm.
Even at this stage, the seeds of Oppenheimer’s downfall are being sown. Naively unconcerned about the dangers of having communist friends, he doesn’t realise he’s already under FBI surveillance.
A terrific drama from a far more creative age of TV.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5pZS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3RlbGV2aXNpb24vdHYtcmV2aWV3cy9wYXQtc3RhY2V5cy10di1yZXZpZXctdGVycmlmaWMtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbWluaXNlcmllcy1nZXRzLWEtd2VsY29tZS1iYmMtcmVzaG93aW5nL2E0MzkyNTE0NTguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

“Rob, off the back of Tenet – where we refer to Oppenheimer – and I had wrote a thing about this incredible moment that Oppenheimer and the scientist of the Manhattan Project had where they could not completely eliminate the possibility that when they triggered that first gadget, that first atomic device, they might start the chain reaction that would destroy the world,” Nolan explained in a YouTube interview.

“We used that as a metaphor for Tenet, which Rob was in. As a wrap gift, he gave me a book of Oppenheimer‘s speeches from the 1950s, where you’re reading these great intellects trying to deal with the massive consequences of the way in which they’ve changed life forever, for all of us.”

,Cillian Murphy: Oppenheimer grabs you by the throat and you don't take a breath from start to finish,"Cillian Murphy, the star of Christopher Nolan film 'Oppenheimer', speaks about playing J Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, his experi","What has it meant for you to portray the lead character of J Robert Oppenheimer in a Christopher Nolan film supported by such an extraordinary star cast?
What did you think when you first saw the completed film?
You've worked with Christopher Nolan in several films, how would you describe him as a director?
Have you seen any change in Nolan over the years, working with him on these different projects?
Why do you think Oppenheimer's story resonates and connects with us all?
Why do you think it is so important for audiences to experience this film in cinemas?
After years of faithfully filling in the supporting cast for director Christopher Nolan , Irish actor Cillian Murphy is finally set to take centre stage with the film, 'Oppenheimer'. Since first getting his hand on the script in Nolan's Dublin hotel room to sinking into the narrow silhouette of J Robert Oppenheimer , the journey has been a 'dream', said Cillian in an exclusive statement to ETimes.As he gears up to present to the world a film about the charismatic and controversial theoretical physicist who helped create the atomic bomb, the actor got candid about working on the new Nolan film with an all-star cast, his experience watching the film on the IMAX screen and why this Oscar-favourite will resonate with everyone.Excerpts:It's a dream, really. I never imagined working with all these actors in one movie. I think it's one of the greatest modern ensembles that Christopher Nolan has put together. But that just shows you how everybody wants to work with Chris. These actors will turn up because they love his movies and his writing. He's an incredible director! So, yes, it was a gift for me every day. Also, when you wake up knowing you are doing a scene with Kenneth Branagh , Emily Blunt, or Gary Oldman , it's just kind of electrifying. So, you have to turn up the volume on your own performance a little bit.Well, with Chris there is no video village or monitors or anything like that. It's film cameras; so, you don't see any playback. The first frame of the movie that I saw was the first trailer. And then, when I finally got to see the finished film, it was completely overwhelming. But, because there had been a gap between wrapping the movie and watching it, I suppose I had some distance. I hate looking at myself, and I don't really know any actor that enjoys the experience, but I found I was completely blown away by Oppenheimer. It's a truly essential, cinematic, and immersive experience – particularly in IMAX. And I felt that. I would like to watch it maybe once more with an audience.Well, I think he's kind of the ideal director because he writes, directs, and produces movies. He’s incredible visually, and he is extraordinary with actors. Very few directors have all those talents in one person.I guess he's become more and more confident in the sort of stories that he wants to tell. And I think he's more and more confident in making films within the studio system that actually challenge the audience. I have always loved that he has presupposed the level of intelligence with audiences, knowing they are smart enough to go with him, and he never patronizes them. He's never prescriptive or didactic in his movies. They are always kind of a challenge to you; so, you need to do the work, but the reward you get is terrific. I've learned so much from him. Working with Chris has changed my creative and professional life, and I hope I continue (to work with him).There's a universality to it that people connect to. People understand the themes that are in this movie. There are big questions being asked of the audience, and no answers being given – which I think is always excellent filmmaking. But it's also a thriller and a love story, and to me, there are elements of horror in there as well. So, all that just resonates with an audience. And I think the period setting, however familiar or not you may be with what happened in 1945, will wrap you up in it too. This movie grabs you by the throat from the beginning, and you just don't take a breath from start to finish. We are now living in a nuclear age because of what happened then. I mean, Oppenheimer changed the world, and we are living with the fallout of that event ever since.For me, it's the best way to experience a film – in a darkened space with strangers. There's just no interruption: you're not going to answer the door or make a cup of tea. You're invested, you paid your money, you’ve got your snacks, and you're there. There's something hugely romantic about it to me, and there always will be. Also, I think what's extra special about this movie is that it’s talking about the world. It's really digging up what it means to be human and our responsibility as humans on this planet, and what we do with the power that we can harness – which in this case is this extraordinary destructive and appalling weapon. I think it was Truffaut who said that we go to films not only to escape from life but also to learn about life. And I believe Oppenheimer is one of those great movies that is incredibly entertaining, but also makes you think.'Oppenheimer', which is rooted in historical facts and actual transcripts, releases in theatres on July 21.

Dorothy Oppenheimer Vanderford never could’ve imagined that her grandfather would be one of the absolute heroes of the summer, more popular with moviegoers than Dominick Toretto, Ethan Hunt and even Indiana Jones.
Not bad for a theoretical physicist.
“You know, I didn’t know that so many people were even aware of (J. Robert) Oppenheimer or the history of the building of the atomic bomb,” says Vanderford, who works at the Nevada National Security Site and has called Boulder City home since 1998. “It’s really exciting to see how much public interest there is in watching this movie.”
“Oppenheimer,” a three-hour biopic, portions of which were filmed in black and white, is the sort of prestige picture more accustomed to opening in the final weeks of the year for awards consideration. Instead, it shocked the industry last weekend with an $82 million-plus domestic opening, earning more money in its first weekend than any Christopher Nolan-directed movie not named “The Dark Knight” or “The Dark Knight Rises.”
It’s earned an estimated $174.1 million domestically through Sunday, with few signs of slowing down anytime soon. Globally, it has topped $400 million in sales.
‘Almost surreal’
Vanderford, one of three children of Oppenheimer’s son, Peter, was born in 1973, more than six years after the death of the man known as “the father of the atomic bomb.” But that hasn’t stopped her from becoming one of his leading proponents. Along with her brother, Charles, she’s been caught up in a whirlwind of interviews tied to the movie’s release that culminated in Thursday’s sold-out discussion hosted by the Atomic Museum.
“This has been almost surreal,” Vanderford says. “I spent my life being under the radar, so to be out in the public talking is unusual and a bit of a challenge for me.”
The advocacy for the man she never knew began in earnest when she started working with Charles’ Oppenheimer Project. The organization is designed to promote their grandfather’s legacy and the advancement of nuclear energy, including his desire to cooperate with other nations, something that landed him in hot water during the Red Scare of the 1950s.
“I’m not really in a position to give juicy tidbits that no one ever knew before,” Vanderford says in her unofficial role as an Oppenheimer spokeswoman. “But his legacy is so significant that I can certainly talk about how important the work he did was and how important it still is today.”
The family tends to take a hands-off approach to projects about the famed scientist. They weren’t involved in the production of “Oppenheimer” and had little to do with its source material: “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” the 2006 Pulitzer Prize winner by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin.
“Oppenheimer” follows the biography pretty closely, so there were no big revelations, Vanderford says. She was able to appreciate it as a movie and not be distracted by the family connections.
“Partly because I didn’t know him. I think that probably helps,” she says. “In some ways, he’s a character. People see him as sort of mythological. So I can separate the real person from what’s being shown on the screen.”
‘He was complex’
She liked the movie, overall, but a couple of things stood out. Primarily the sequence in which Oppenheimer, portrayed by Cillian Murphy, injects cyanide into an apple left on the desk of his Cambridge University tutor, before coming to his senses and throwing it away.
“He didn’t try to kill his tutor. There’s no proof that that actually happened,” Vanderford insists. “So it’s unfortunate that that’s going to be presented as a factual thing.”
Then there was the amount of time the movie spent on Oppenheimer’s extramarital relations.
“I’m not sure that all the information about (his) affairs was accurate,” she adds, “but I think it’s perfectly fine to portray a complex person on the screen. He was complex. That’s fair.”
If anything, the movie has brought her family closer. Her father didn’t talk about Oppenheimer much when she was growing up, but that’s changed. “It’s been a form of family bonding, really, talking with my parents, both my mom and my dad, and my siblings,” she says. “We talked a lot more lately.”
As for what she wants audiences to know about her grandfather, Vanderford says, “I like to think of him as a hero, because he did his duty and his service to his country. He led this enormous scientific project, not just because he was brilliant, but because he could get all these different people together to get a job done in a short amount of time to serve a bigger purpose.”
“He was treated poorly,” she says of Oppenheimer’s later years, including the 1954 hearing over whether to revoke his security clearance that forms one of the main arcs of the movie. “But he still kept talking about the values that were important to him, about open communication and sharing of information. So I tend to see him as heroic, because of his ability to persevere and speak his mind, even in the face of severe resistance.”

,"Watch Oppenheimer discuss use of the atomic bomb in 1965 interview: It ""was not undertaken lightly""","Manhattan Project mastermind J. Robert Oppenheimer, often credited as the father of the atomic bomb, spoke with CBS News in 1965.","Twenty years after the nuclear attack on Hiroshima, physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, often credited as the father of the atomic bomb, said he didn't have a good answer to the question of whether dropping the bomb on Japan was necessary.
Oppenheimer in 1965 told CBS News that he believed the decision to use the bomb in WWII was arrived at by military leaders ""in good faith, with regret, and on the best evidence that they then had"" at the time.
Germany had already surrendered by the time Oppenheimer tested the atomic bomb in New Mexico, on July 16, 1945, but Japan was fighting on. An atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima three weeks after the test. A second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki days later. Japan formally surrendered on Sept. 2, 1945.
""The ending of the war by this means, certainly cruel, was not undertaken lightly,"" Oppenheimer said in the interview. ""But I am not, as of today, confident that a better course was then open.""
Oppenheimer had built the weapon that won the war, but questioned the ""sin of pride"" of the scientists involved in the bomb's creation. The development of the bomb left its mark on many of those engaged, he said.
""I think when you play a meaningful part in bringing about the death of over 100,000 people and the injury of a comparable number, you naturally don't think of that with ease,"" he said. ""I believe we had a great cause to do this, but I do not think that our consciences should be entirely easy at stepping out of the part of studying nature, learning the truth about it, to change the course of human history.""
The story of Oppenheimer and the development of the atom bomb is detailed in ""Oppenheimer,"" a Christopher Nolan film starring Cillian Murphy, set for release Friday. The movie is based on ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,"" a biography written by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin.
""It's complicated to take on a historic icon like Robert Oppenheimer and deal with the history faithfully and yet turn it into a cinematic experience,"" Bird told CBS ""Sunday Morning"" ahead of the film's release.
Oppenheimer, born Julius Robert Oppenheimer in 1904, grew up in New York City, according to a Manhattan Project National Historical Park post. He attended the Ethical Culture School and, after his graduation in 1921, he traveled to Germany and fell ill. The following year, he went to New Mexico to recover. Twenty years after his trip, he suggested the state's isolated Los Alamos Ranch School be used as a secret laboratory during the Manhattan Project.
He began studying at Harvard University in the fall of 1922 and was accepted to study at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England, in 1925. Oppenheimer was awarded a doctorate in physics in May of 1927. In 1929 he started teaching at the University of California, in Berkeley.
He began a relationship with medical student and Communist Party member Jean Tatlock in 1936. He engaged with the politics, but never joined the Communist Party. Oppenheimer's relationship with Talock ended in 1939. That year, Oppenheimer met his future wife, Katherine ""Kitty"" Puening. She was a member of the Communist Party.
Oppenheimer's communist connections led to difficulties getting a security clearance when he was called on by Army Gen. Leslie Groves to develop the atomic bomb, Bird said.
Others believed Groves' pick was outlandish, Bird said, but the Department of Defense noted Groves and Oppenheimer ""had the talent, drive and leadership qualities that enabled production of the bomb on a very short timeline.""
""[Groves] could see in Oppie the smarts and the charisma to bring all the scientists together in this secret city and make it happen,"" Bird said.
Oppenheimer started collaborating with physicist Ernest Lawrence on questions of atomic bomb development early in 1941. In the spring of that year, the Roosevelt administration created a committee on atomic bomb creation. Groves took charge of the project in September of 1942 and, with his support, Oppenheimer was appointed as the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory at a secret laboratory.
Barracks and laboratories were built in Los Alamos. Scientists worked day and night. Oppenheimer chain smoked four to five packs of cigarettes a day as he worked. He was also under surveillance during the bomb's development. His home and office were wiretapped.
In July of 1945, the bomb was tested in the desert of New Mexico.
""Oppenheimer supposedly said, 'Lord, these affairs are difficult on the heart,' before the final test of the atomic bomb,"" Alan Carr, historian at Los Alamos National Laboratory, said.
He recalled the moment years later, saying it brought to mind a line from Hindu scripture.
""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds,"" he said in a 1965 NBC interview.
Oppenheimer plunged into a ""deep depression"" after the war, Bird said.
In the 1965 interview, Oppenheimer told CBS News that he tried to think and talk of hopeful things.
""There are 100 reasons for seeing no hope at all, and I take it for granted that everybody can think of them without being reminded,"" Oppenheimer said. ""It's harder to think of anything on the other side and I have tried to say that, however frail and however tentative and however limited, they do exist and they look to me like a bridgehead to a livable future, but not without work.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3Mvai1yb2JlcnQtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItYXRvbWljLWJvbWItdXNlLWphcGFuLWNicy0xOTY1LWludGVydmlldy_SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9qLXJvYmVydC1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1hdG9taWMtYm9tYi11c2UtamFwYW4tY2JzLTE5NjUtaW50ZXJ2aWV3Lw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-17 16:26:14+00:00,"""Watch Oppenheimer Deliver His Infamous ""I Am Become Death"" Speech""",Chilling.,"Ahead of the release of Christopher Nolan's long-awaited Oppenheimer (and Lin Manuel-Miranda's even more anticipated Hip Hoppenheimer) this week there has been a renewed interest in its central character, the real-life J. Robert Oppenheimer.
Oppenheimer was the theoretical physicist often referred to as the ""father of the atomic bomb"" for his work as director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. The project was a success, and on July 16, 1945, Oppenheimer and others involved in the project watched as the first nuclear explosion took place.

Two atomic bombs were later dropped on Japan, killing hundreds of thousands of citizens and ending World War II. Others on the project justified their part in this way.
“The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ended World War II. There can be no doubt of that,"" Lieutenant General Leslie R Groves, former director of the Manhattan Project set to be portrayed by Matt Damon in the movie, said years later. ""While they brought death and destruction on a horrifying scale, they averted even greater losses – American, English, and Japanese.”
Oppenheimer, with more responsibility than most on the project, was aware of the weight of that decision. In a famous interview for a documentary titled ""The Decision to Drop the Bomb"", he said that as he watched the explosion he was reminded of a passage from the Bhagavadgita.

""We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed. A few people cried. Most people were silent,"" Oppenheimer said. ""I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavadgita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that one way or another.""
Oppenheimer apparently felt a tremendous amount of guilt about the creation of nuclear weapons following the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, telling President Truman ""I feel I have blood on my hands"".
""If atomic bombs are to be added as new weapons to the arsenals of a warring world, or to the arsenals of the nations preparing for war, then the time will come when mankind will curse the names of Los Alamos and Hiroshima,"" he said in 1945. ""The people of this world must unite or they will perish. This war that has ravaged so much of the earth, has written these words. The atomic bomb has spelled them out for all men to understand.""
He went on to oppose the US Government's plan to expand its nuclear arsenal with more powerful hydrogen bombs, just a few years after the war. But it was too late. The genie, as they say, was out of the bottle.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlmbHNjaWVuY2UuY29tL3dhdGNoLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWRlbGl2ZXItaGlzLWluZmFtb3VzLWktYW0tYmVjb21lLWRlYXRoLXNwZWVjaC02OTg1N9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-14 13:00:00+00:00,“This Can’t Be Safe. It’s Got to Have Bite”: Christopher Nolan and Cast Unleash ‘Oppenheimer’,"Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan, Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt and Matt Damon on the stakes of making a three-hour, CGI-free summer film.","One windy night in March 2022, in the desert outside Belen, New Mexico, Cillian Murphy was waiting to climb a 100-foot steel tower, a copy of the one that held the first nuclear bomb ever detonated in 1945. The conditions were right for summoning the emotion of the historic scene the Irish actor was about to play as physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. “You could see this sand coming up off the desert and the skies were ominous,” Murphy says. “I remember thinking, ‘Oh my God, this is fucking great.’ “
Nearby, as gusts whipped at the production tents, producer Emma Thomas was having the opposite reaction. “Imax cameras shooting film in the middle of a windy desert. The absolute worst,” says Thomas. “Miserable for people. Terrible for cameras.”
Though tense for the film crew, the sandstorm on the set of Christopher Nolan‘s Oppenheimer replicated the one the scientists and military officers had faced the night before the real Trinity test, as the U.S. Army code-named the effort. And Nolan — the rare filmmaker who can still convince a studio to back such an ambitious movie — was determined to keep shooting. “Chris always gets told that he’s lucky with weather, and I think he is,” says Thomas, who is also Nolan’s wife and the mother of his four children. “But I think he also feels like he creates his own weather.” As it had in 1945 before the nuclear test began at dawn, the wind stilled abruptly, and Nolan got his shots.
It says something about the director’s reputation for a near-religious commitment to big-screen spectacle that when news first broke online about Nolan shooting the Trinity test scene without using CGI, a fair number of movie fans assumed that meant he had literally detonated an atomic bomb on set. “It’s flattering that people would think I would be capable of something as extreme as that on the one hand, but it’s also a little bit scary,” Nolan says during an interview in mid-June, in the Los Angeles offices of his and Thomas’ production company, Syncopy Inc. All the interviews for this story were conducted before SAG-AFTRA called a strike on July 13 — a move which prompted the cast members in attendance that day to walk out of Oppenheimer’s London premiere.
It’s not just in his filmmaking that Nolan prefers to rely on analog methods. He doesn’t use email or carry a smartphone, and when he writes his scripts, he does so on a computer that isn’t connected to the internet. “My kids would probably say I’m a complete Luddite,” he says. “I would actually resist that description. I think technology and what it can provide is amazing. My personal choice is about how involved I get. It’s about the level of distraction. If I’m generating my material and writing my own scripts, being on a smartphone all day wouldn’t be very useful for me.”
Oppenheimer, which chronicles the Manhattan Project’s development of nuclear weapons and the political and emotional fallout for the people who built them, is both an ode to and a cautionary tale about humanity’s ability to harness science and technology. The $100 million movie, which Universal will release July 21, is inspired by the 721-page, Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin.
The sprawling, starry cast boasts 79 speaking roles, including Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty; Matt Damon as Leslie Groves, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officer who directed the project; Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss, chair of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission; and Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock, a psychiatrist with whom Oppenheimer had a passionate but tortured affair. The group of actors playing the scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project, including Josh Hartnett, Benny Safdie and Swedish actor Gustaf Skarsgard, are so numerous that they have their own WhatsApp group, called the “Oppenhomies.” Kenneth Branagh, Matthew Modine and Gary Oldman also appear. “It was the cast of Ben-Hur,” says Downey. “Everybody would have their moments. There were no small scenes.”

There are seat-rattling explosions, multiple steamy sex scenes and existential stakes. But Oppenheimer is also a biopic of a theoretical physicist, a man whose work is so abstract that it’s impossible to see. It’s R-rated, three hours long, with large chunks shot in black and white on Imax film developed expressly for Nolan and his cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema. And it contains a level of moral complexity that doesn’t exactly cry out summer popcorn movie — instead of the fictional CGI cities that are demolished in the third act of most summer films, Oppenheimer’s work led to the destruction of real cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and more than 200,000 casualties.
“[Nolan] said to me, ‘This is the kind of movie that they used to make in the ’90s,’ ” says Damon. “It feels like when an Oliver Stone movie would come out and you’d go, ‘That’s one of the movies I’m going to see this year no matter what, because everyone’s going to be talking about it.’ But those movies have disappeared from the multiplex.”
The seed of Oppenheimer was planted in Nolan’s 2020 science fiction film, Tenet, in which a character references the physicist when comparing the creation of a doomsday device to the development of the first atomic bomb. Robert Pattinson, who co-starred in Tenet, gave Nolan a collection of Oppenheimer’s speeches as a wrap gift, and when Nolan read the speeches the physicist made in the 1950s, after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he saw the makings of a fascinating character study. “When you read the words of people speaking at that time, you see them wrestling with the implications and the consequences of what’s happened and what they’ve done,” Nolan says. “I started to get very excited about, rather than using it as an analogy in a science fiction sense, telling the actual reality of the story, really trying to be there, to give people the experience of what it would have been like to be Oppenheimer in those moments.”
Nolan, 52, grew up in the U.K. at the height of nuclear anxiety. In the 1980s, he watched as young people flocked to join the country’s growing Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, saw movies like the 1986 animated nuclear disaster film When the Wind Blows and heard the 1985 Sting song “Russians,” which includes the line, “How can I save my little boy from Oppenheimer’s deadly toy?” Nolan became fascinated by one point he learned over the years, which would come to animate him as a filmmaker: that there had been a moment when the Manhattan Project scientists realized they couldn’t completely eliminate the possibility of a chain reaction from an atomic bomb that would set fire to the atmosphere and destroy the world. “In the absence of being able to completely eliminate the possibility, they went ahead and pushed the button,” Nolan says. “That’s an incredible room to be in, an incredibly dramatic moment to take an audience to.”
The resulting movie is “sort of an origin story in a strange way, not a million miles away from the things we were doing with Batman and the Dark Knight trilogy,” Nolan says. “I got excited by his intellectual curiosity and adventurism in the 1920s, which was shared by all his peers. It was a revolution in physics that corresponded very closely to all the other revolutions in all aspects of life — the music of Stravinsky and modernism and literature, Picasso painting.”
One of the most unusual creative choices Nolan made was to write much of the script in the first person, including stage directions — instead of “Oppenheimer walks into the room,” for instance, the script reads, “I walk into the room.” Nolan did this, he says, to distinguish between two timelines: one from Oppenheimer’s point of view, shot in color, and the other, more objective, in black and white. The script detailed how Nolan planned to make the conceptual physics real for an audience through use of image and sound. “What does it look like, how things exploded and crashed against each other,” says Blunt. “All the visuals were very detailed in his stage descriptions.” Tonally, the movie would have to take the audience from the triumph of scientific achievement to the devastating realization of its impact. “Very often when you’re planning a film, whatever the most seemingly difficult challenge is, the way to deal with it is to embrace it as the biggest strength of the material,” Nolan says. “For me, the idea of going with these scientists from the absolute highest high to the lowest low in as dramatic and compressed a way as possible, that became the hinge point, the engine of the film.”

Oppenheimer is Murphy’s sixth film with Nolan. He has always played supporting roles: the Scarecrow in the Dark Knight films, a businessman in Inception, a shivering soldier in Dunkirk. Nolan says he doesn’t have actors in mind when he writes, but when he finished his Oppenheimer draft, casting the lead was obvious. “I’ve been staring at the cover of the book American Prometheus for so many months, and there’s this photograph, black and white, a light blue-eyed stare, very intense, of this guy,” Nolan says. “And I thought, ‘Well, I know who could do that.’ ” Murphy, who also played a physicist who designed a bomb in the 2007 Danny Boyle science fiction movie Sunshine, jokes that he has “resting physicist’s face.” Murphy was at home in Ireland when Nolan called, offering the role of a lifetime. “He’s just so understated and matter-of-fact and British,” Murphy says of Nolan. “It was like, ‘Cillian, look, I have a script, it’s Oppenheimer and I’d like you to play Oppenheimer.’ That was it.”
Nolan prefers to hand-deliver his scripts rather than email them. “People will say, ‘Why do you work in secrecy?’ ” Nolan says. “Well, it’s not secrecy, it’s privacy. It’s being able to try things, to make mistakes, to be as adventurous as possible. And to be able to sit with somebody who’s just read what you’ve written and get their take on it, see how they connect with it in a very human, face-to-face way.” In Murphy’s case, Nolan flew to Ireland and waited while the actor read the document; Downey went to Nolan’s home in L.A. to read it. “I was like, ‘Wow,’ ” Downey says. “And he was like, ‘So will you do it?’ I was like, ‘Uh, usually, there’s 38 phone calls.’ But he’s Chris Nolan. So I was like, ‘Yeah, I think I will.’ ”
Nolan’s movies have made more than $5 billion at the global box office, and he is almost singular in his ability to attract broad audiences not only to franchise fare like the Dark Knight trilogy but also original ideas like 2010’s Inception ($836.8 million) and 2014’s Interstellar ($773.8 million) and historical fare like 2017’s Dunkirk ($525.2 million). After being delayed three times because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tenet was the first Hollywood tentpole to launch in theaters in the summer of 2020, a time when most U.S. cineplexes were operating at less than half capacity. In that diminished box office environment, the movie made $363.7 million worldwide, but the film and the pandemic helped usher in the end of Nolan’s relationship with what had been his longtime home studio, Warner Bros. When the company announced in December 2020 that it was dropping its entire 2021 theatrical slate directly onto its then-nascent streaming service, HBO Max, much of the industry complained in private, but Nolan was the most prominent director to publicly criticize the studio. “They don’t even understand what they’re losing,” Nolan said in a statement to THR at the time. (Nolan is himself a voracious moviegoer with varied and sometimes surprising tastes — for instance, he and his family watch Love Actually every Christmas and he enjoys the Fast & Furious franchise. “He watches every single movie, of every type of genre,” says Blunt. “And you never hear him shit-talk other people’s movies. He knows how hard it is to direct a great movie.”)

The current writers strike is driven by many of the same issues that frustrated talent about Warner Bros.’ pandemic-era policies, including transparency and residuals. “In the last few years, it’s very often not been clear what a studio’s intention is,” Nolan says. “Why they’re making a particular project, what they’re then going to do with it, how they monetize it. Do they monetize it at all? Is it a loss leader to drive subscriber growth? A lot of the reason that there’s a strike right now is we have to make the streamers pay the true cost of production. The business models don’t work right now.”
Nolan says he voted to ratify the contract the Directors Guild struck with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers in June. “The parameters of the deal are certainly going to help the other guilds in negotiations,” he says. “It’s very important that all the guilds get a great deal right now. It is a transitional moment. The move to streaming has thrown up all kinds of economic issues with all the guilds and in particular, the writers. And now is the moment that we need to fix those things.”

In mid-2021, Nolan had left Warner Bros. and was meeting with the other major studios about making Oppenheimer. “I told them it was a three-hour film,” Nolan says. “I told them it would be R-rated. I told them what the budget would be. Emma and I, we’ve taken a view that telling studios exactly what we’re doing and sticking to that is the clearest, simplest thing to do.”
Through their kids, Nolan and Thomas were friends with Donna Langley, now the chairman and chief content officer of the NBCUniversal studio group, and Langley saw Nolan as an ally in the studio’s attempt to resuscitate the theatrical business. “Coming out of the pandemic, we were wondering what would make audiences come back to theaters,” says Langley. “[Nolan] is one of a handful of directors whose name alone inspires audiences globally to go to the movie theater.” Universal guaranteed Nolan an exclusive theatrical release for between 90 and 120 days on Oppenheimer, far longer than the studio’s pandemic-era exclusive windows, which ranged from 17 to 31 days. “Given Chris’ experience with his prior movie, it was clear the theatrical window was important to him,” Langley says.
By February 2022, production was underway, with locations including Oppenheimer’s actual house in New Mexico and Albert Einstein’s office in Princeton, New Jersey. The film secured permission to shoot at the White Sands Missile Range, where the Trinity test occurred, but because it is still an active military base, the hours were inconvenient, and instead production designer Ruth De Jong re-created the site in the desert. Some of the scientists followed the shoot and worked as extras. “You’d be in a scene and you’d casually chat to someone and he was a high-end physicist working in Los Alamos,” says Murphy.
Nolan’s sets feel different from most, say the actors. “There aren’t a lot of people running around on phones. There’s no video village. There’s no chair with your name on it,” says Downey. “It was focused and Spartan, almost a monastic approach to what we’re doing.” Despite Nolan’s reputation for precision, there are no marks on the floor for actors to hit. “He’s like, ‘We don’t need to put down marks because you shouldn’t be looking for them, and my team should be able to find you wherever you are,’ ” Downey adds. “It’s actually kind of super loose within this controlled format.” Nolan’s notes to his actors are concise and focused. “We did a scene a few times and I wasn’t getting it,” says Murphy. “I may have come in a bit hard. He leaned over to me and said, ‘He’s not a boxer, he’s a chess player.’ Boom. You just go, ‘Totally get it.’ You get used to these big, huge fucking cameras moving toward you, but you’re really there in the moment doing it as truthfully as you possibly can.”

Early on in his research, Nolan had a conversation with physicist Robbert Dijkgraaf that signaled a potentially enormous problem for the film. Dijkgraaf explained that in the early 20th century, during the transition from classical physics to quantum mechanics, “one of the things that had been challenging and alienating for physicists was that, as [Dijkgraaf] put it, they could no longer visualize the atom,” Nolan says. “And of course, to me that was very frightening. I said to him, ‘Well, that’s my job. That’s what I have to do. What do you mean you can no longer visualize it?’ He said, ‘Well, you can’t because it’s energy fields lying on top of each other. It’s not ping-pong balls flying around.’ ”
Nolan came to the conclusion that he would rely on his editor, Jennifer Lame, to help him create a visceral feeling of the physics, layering visual effects, sound and Ludwig Göransson’s score. “I got excited by, how can cinema help you understand something not intellectually, but emotionally, that it’s really impossible to visualize in other ways?” Nolan says. He relied on special effects supervisor Scott Fisher and visual effects supervisor Andrew Jackson to help him create a representation of the physics on film through the use of practical effects — the effects department’s experiments included smashing ping-pong balls together, throwing paint at a wall and shooting at various frame rates. Out of a desire to preserve the illusion, Nolan declines to say what actually created the finished effect, except that it is definitely not computers — there is no CGI in the film at all. “CG inherently is quite comfortable to look at,” Nolan says. “It’s safe, anodyne. And what I said to Andrew on Oppenheimer is, ‘This can’t be safe. It can’t be comfortable to look at it. It has to have bite. It’s got to be beautiful and threatening in equal measure.’ “

Oppenheimer is eerily topical. In March, against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, the United Nations said the risk of nuclear weapons use is higher now than at any time since the Cold War. Another technological innovation, artificial intelligence, has prompted scientists to do the kind of soul-searching that Oppenheimer eventually did — after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. “Oppenheimer’s story is the most dramatic example I know of the fraught relationship between science and government,” Nolan says. “The relationship between technology and government right now is one of the most difficult and frightening areas.”
Oppenheimer is set to open in theaters opposite Warner Bros.’ Barbie, which appears likely to win the weekend, a phenomenon the extremely online have dubbed “Barbenheimer” in a series of memes, including one with an atomic mushroom cloud exploding in a plume of pink smoke. Universal struck an unusual agreement with Imax for Oppenheimer to have all the Imax screens in North America for three full weeks — a move that has frustrated Tom Cruise, whose Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One opened a week earlier. “There is room for them all to do well,” says Langley. Nolan’s movies, she notes, tend to attract audiences far beyond opening weekend. “You see the movie once, you want to go back and see it again,” Langley says. “That’s going to help.”
A major part of the pitch to audiences will be that this is a movie you’ll need to get off the couch to fully appreciate. “This is not a biopic, this is an experience,” says Blunt. “There’s no way you’re going to feel the scope of it watching it on your iPad.”

Here's your guide to ""Barbenheimer"" weekend.","Ryan Gosling in ""Barbie.” Warner Bros. Pictures
Editor’s Note: The following contains mild spoilers about “Barbie,” which was released Friday.
For the last 62 years, Ken has been the original accessory — designed only to match or complement his predestined life partner, Barbie. If Ken is a compass, Barbie is north. According to toy manufacturers Mattel, just one Ken doll is sold for every seven Barbies.
But while this may be his origin story, after the release of Greta Gerwig’s long-awaited “Barbie” movie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, it is certainly not Ken’s future. (“Barbie” is distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is also owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)
""An accessory to Barbie’s life"": Ken debuted two years after Barbie on March 11, 1961 (a day that Mattel still refers to as his “birthday”), after members of her young fanbase wrote to the company pleading that she be given a boyfriend. An army of Kens has since been unleashed into the world: “Surf City” Ken, “Western Fun” Ken, “Ice Capades” Ken and “Great Shape” Ken, to name just a few. Yet, despite being half an inch taller than Barbie, he has long stood in her shadow.
“Quite honestly, Ken’s fashion when he launched was in relation to Barbie and dressing for the dates they were going on,” Kim Culmone, head of design at Mattel, told CNN in a phone interview. “Everything related back to his role as an additional expression (of) and, frankly, an accessory to Barbie’s life.”
Culmone worked to immerse Gerwig and the movie’s costume designer, Jacqueline Durran, in Barbie and Ken’s storied fashion history. Culmone sifted through Mattel’s archives, hunting for vintage Ken dolls that could be shipped to Durran to study, and provided detailed imagery of his evolving style and career choices (from 1963’s “Doctor” Ken and 1973’s “Pilot” Ken, through to “Lifeguard” Ken in 2019). The result was a selection of costumes that, while not exact replicas, were heavily inspired by Ken’s history. Only a handful of original Mattel looks appear in the movie, including “Palm Beach Sugar Daddy” Ken and “Magic Earring” Ken, as well as “Growing Up Skipper” and “Pregnant” Midge, a doll character played by Emerald Fennell.
“(We wanted to give Durran) all of the foundations, then, to really create and tell her own fashion story for Ken,” Culmone said. “She just got the importance of fashion as a storytelling element.”

The ""Kenaissance"": Gosling’s Ken begins a voyage of self-discovery after his visit to the “real world” with Barbie becomes a crash course in gender relations. A second-class citizen at home, Ken quickly realizes that, outside Barbie Land, men come out on top. “Men rule the world,” he whispers to himself in disbelief.
Clothes are one of the first ways in which Ken recognizes this newfound influence. The outfits that catch his eye are coded symbols of machismo. He ogles a man strutting across the street wearing a floor-length white mink coat, gazes at a group of businessmen in boxy tailored suits and ponders the sweat-stained ‘80s-style sleeveless vests worn in a nearby gym. In that moment, Ken’s limited understanding of masculine dressing communicates three things: wealth, power and muscle. His life, once defined by his unrequited love for ”Stereotypical” Barbie, as the movie labels Robbie’s character, is given new focus when he discovers the patriarchy.

,Robert Downey Jr. Says Cillian Murphy Made Biggest Sacrifice of Any Actor He's Ever Seen for 'Oppenheimer' (Exclusive),Robert Downey Jr. tells PEOPLE of his 'Oppenheimer' costar Cillian Murphy: 'I have never witnessed a greater sacrifice by a lead actor in my career',"Like many who have seen Oppenheimer, Robert Downey Jr. was floored with Cillian Murphy's transformative performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American physicist who led the U.S. effort to create an atomic bomb during World War II.
Speaking with PEOPLE for this week's issue, Downey, 58, said of his Oppenheimer costar, ""I have never witnessed a greater sacrifice by a lead actor in my career.""
Downey, who plays Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss in the film, says he was impressed by Murphy's ""commitment"" to the massive undertaking of leading Christopher Nolan's three-hour epic.
""He knew it was going to be a behemoth ask when Chris called him. But I think he also had the humility that is required to survive playing a role like this,"" says Downey.

""We'd be like, 'Hey, we got a three-day weekend. Maybe we'll go antiquing in Santa Fe. What are you going to do?' 'Oh, I have to learn 30,000 words of Dutch. Have a nice time.' But that's the nature of the ask.""
Universal Pictures
Florence Pugh, 27, who shares most of her scenes with Murphy as Jean Tatlock, one of the major loves of Oppenheimer's life, offered further praise.
""Chris had one of the most incredible leads in Cillian,"" she tells PEOPLE. ""He is an actor that I have been watching for quite some time and have been desperate to work with for ages. You’d have to be mad to say no. It was truly one of the best experiences that I’ve had.""
""Working with him was hugely impressive,"" she continues. ""Every single day he shows up knowing every single possible way, intonation, inflection of how to bring this character to life. That was hugely impressive to me. There's a reason why he is one of the greats.""

Murphy's commitment to the role included following a very restrictive diet to closer resemble Oppenheimer.
His costar Emily Blunt, who plays his onscreen wife Kitty Oppenheimer, recently told Extra, ""He had such a monumental undertaking. And he could only eat, like, an almond every day. He was so emaciated.”
The Irish actor addressed his dramatic weight loss for the role during a recent interview with IndieWire, stressing, “I don’t advise it.”
Oppenheimer is now playing in theaters.

2023-08-02 17:12:26-07:00,Rand and Oppenheimer: The Atomic Bomb Movie that Wasn’t,Ayn Rand interviewed Robert Oppenheimer in 1946 while researching a planned screenplay called “Top Secret.”,"Subscribe to the New Ideal podcast here.
With the release of Christopher Nolan’s film Oppenheimer, the epic story of creating the atomic bomb has received renewed attention. Almost seventy years ago, Ayn Rand headed up one of the earliest projects aimed at adapting that story to film. “Top Secret,” conceived and partially written by Ayn Rand in 1946, was intended to dramatize the idea that important inventions like the atomic bomb are possible only to free minds in a free society — a controversial theme that Rand explained and defended to her producer at the outset of the project. Rand’s research included two interviews with J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who served as scientific director of the Los Alamos Laboratory. Archival documents — including Rand’s conceptual proposal, her research, her interviews, and her partial screenplay — provide a fascinating glimpse of the film that might have been.
Ayn Rand and “Top Secret”
In 1944, Ayn Rand signed a contract to write screenplays for Hal Wallis, the Hollywood producer who had brought Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon to the big screen. In late 1945, just after World War II ended with the decisive Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, Wallis gave Rand a new assignment: a screenplay centered on the Manhattan Project.
Rand’s first step was to outline her conceptual approach to making the film. In a twenty-six-page document called “An Analysis of the Proper Approach to a Picture on the Atomic Bomb,” Rand explained to Wallis why the movie’s theme should be: “Man’s greatest achievements are accomplished through free, voluntary action — and cannot be accomplished under force, compulsion and violence.” She emphasized that key scientists on the project became refugees because “Statism destroys, exiles and paralyzes men of genius,” because “these men could not work under compulsion,” and because “they could produce what they produced only in a free country.”
Before undertaking the project, Rand needed Wallis’s understanding and support. “If there is any reason why this picture cannot be made honestly — it is better not to make it at all,” Rand wrote. “The responsibility is so great and so terrifying that unless we have the courage for it, we’d better leave the subject alone.” Without Wallis’s agreement, Rand was unwilling to continue. “If you agree with this exposition and wish to make the picture on this basis,” she wrote, “I shall consider it an honor and a privilege to work on the screenplay.”
Wallis accepted, and Rand plunged into the research phase. To understand atomic science, she read Atomic Energy for Military Purposes, the lengthy and scientifically challenging official government report on the bomb’s development, written by the chairman of Princeton University’s physics department, Henry DeWolf Smyth. She also consulted with a technical advisor, a young physicist from the California Institute of Technology. To understand the human story, she sought interviews with key figures, including J. Robert Oppenheimer.
Interviewing Oppenheimer
Years later, in biographical interviews now preserved in the Ayn Rand Archives, Rand described her first meeting with Oppenheimer, noting that he seemed apprehensive and suspicious of the motivation behind Rand’s Hollywood project. He expressed worries about “the fate of science in the popular minds” and the “resentment of scientists for creating this weapon.” When Rand assured Oppenheimer that her screenplay was to “show that the atom bomb was a great achievement of the human mind, and that it can be done only by free minds,” the mood in the room suddenly changed. According to Rand, “What disarmed me was the way he looked at me after that. He literally said, ‘Oh, is this what you want to show?’ From then on . . . he began to talk much more warmly, personally, much more eagerly . . . he began to tell us anything we wanted, to tell stories.” They spoke for about an hour, and when the time was up, Oppenheimer requested that she “stay a little longer.” They talked all the way to the car as Rand departed, and seven days later, a second interview was scheduled.
With her theme for the movie clearly in mind, Rand asked Oppenheimer during that second interview whether the Los Alamos scientists worked under orders. “He looks at me,” Rand later recalled, “and in the way the best of my characters would have said it, he said, ‘There was never an order given at Los Alamos,’ and in that quiet, morally indignant tone.” In her interview notes, she wrote: “Reasons instead of authority.” By the end of the month, Rand had interviewed several other important players in the Manhattan Project, including Major General Leslie Groves, Colonel Kenneth Nichols, and Dr. Frederick Reines (who later won a Nobel prize in physics). She even spoke with Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty.
Drawing on her research and interviews, Rand began writing the screenplay and completed seventy-two pages (about one-third of the projected total length). This first part of the script includes scenes depicting the struggles of important nuclear scientists — including Enrico Fermi, Albert Einstein, Lise Meitner, and Niels Bohr — against growing statism in Europe. President Roosevelt makes an appearance when he is warned by the world’s foremost scientists that atomic weapons are possible and that the Nazis might be building a nuclear bomb. Rand also planned to include scenes that showed the contribution of American industrialists to the project, producing the uranium and plutonium that would make the bombs possible.
In March 1946, much to Rand’s surprise and disappointment, Wallis sold all rights to the “Top Secret” project to MGM for $100,000. MGM then shelved it, and Rand’s screenplay was never completed or filmed. The project’s abrupt end came as a blow to Rand, but the timing was in one sense propitious. Her creative imagination was teeming with possibilities for the project that would become her magnum opus, Atlas Shrugged, and she spent the next few months planning and outlining that novel.
Interestingly, Rand’s experience with Oppenheimer helped inspire the character of Dr. Robert Stadler in Atlas Shrugged. In a series of notes written in the summer of 1946, she considered whether Oppenheimer could properly be described as the type of creator who works for his own destruction:
. . . he is so sure of what is right and that he is capable of deciding it, while others are not, that he must force it on those inferior others, for their own good. In such an attitude, there is the natural impatience of the intelligent man who can’t bear to see things done wrong, when they can be done right and he knows how to do it. But this attitude is applied to a crucial error in thinking — that one man can decide what is right (or good) for another. . . .
Readers of Atlas Shrugged will recognize ways in which the Stadler character was inspired by Rand’s interactions with Oppenheimer.
Current controversies surrounding Nolan’s film, Oppenheimer, raise an interesting question: What kind of movie might Wallis and Rand have made together if “Top Secret” had come to fruition? Archival holdings permit well-founded speculation that the result could have been a masterpiece, if it had embodied Rand’s distinctive theme. As an expression of that theme, consider the line of dialog that Rand had planned for the final scene. After the bomb has fallen on Hiroshima, Dr. Oppenheimer’s young security guard looks to the sky and says: “Man can harness the universe — but nobody can harness man.”

2023-08-10 16:05:00+00:00,How ‘Oppenheimer’ Created Its Mushroom Cloud for the Trinity Blast,"No CGI for Christopher Nolan, so the DNEG VFX team went old-school by experimenting with practical simulations in tanks shot on 65mm IMAX cameras.","In keeping with Christopher Nolan‘s preference for shooting in-camera practical effects whenever possible — and a desire to steer clear of CGI on “Oppenheimer” — the director created his own real-life VFX Manhattan Project to create the subatomic world and Trinity atomic blast. That’s why VFX supervisor Andrew Jackson (“Tenet,” “Dunkirk”) was the first crew member Nolan asked to read his script.
“He needed me to get on board really early to start investigating what we could do,” Jackson told IndieWire. “And in that first discussion, we looked at the options. At one end of the spectrum, there’s trying to reproduce the subatomic electrons orbiting a nucleus and an atom spinning at trillions of times a second because the film is so much about trying to experience the story through the mind of Oppenheimer [Cillian Murphy], and we were trying to visualize what might be going on in his head at a time when there weren’t really good images of all these things.
“So an accurate representation would be meaningless. And then at the other end of the spectrum is some sort of infographic representation that the audience can understand. So we landed somewhere in the middle with an artistic interpretation of ideas inspired by the script and the thought processes in his mind.”
After reading the script, Jackson compiled a montage of tests he filmed throughout his career and screened them for Nolan to start ideating with some basic ideas. Then he spent the first two months of pre-production working with special effects supervisor Scott Fisher (“Tenet,” “Dunkirk,” “Interstellar,” “The Dark Knight Rises,” “Inception”) and his team, shooting an extensive library of microscopic particle elements on iPhones and digital cameras, from smashing ping-pong balls together to throwing paint against a wall and concocting luminous magnesium solutions and other liquids. Then Nolan would take a look and let them know what interested him.
“Oppenheimer” Universal
This developed into more elaborate experiments with a small VFX unit that worked alongside the main unit. They shot assorted objects in cloud tanks with 65mm IMAX cameras (assisted by cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema) at different shutter speeds and frame rates. These included spinning beads on long wires, aluminum flakes, pieces of wood, and burning thermites. However, to reach inside the tanks, the IMAX cameras required special wide-angle probe lenses developed by Panavision senior vice president Dan Sasaki.
These experiments formed the basis of Oppenheimer’s subatomic visions of electrons and atoms or light waves and particles interacting and combining. He also had more astronomical visions about the cosmos, in which black holes were formed by imploding stars.
“And, in the end, we had this enormous library of material,” Jackson said. “Some of it applied directly to specific lines in the script and didn’t need any work in post. It could just be cut straight in. Then other things needed to combine multiple layers to be treated and manipulated [in the computer].”
These particle simulations were also applied to Oppenheimer’s darkest fears that the atomic bomb would cause a chain reaction that destroyed the planet. “We filmed real missiles and little miniature ones for the trails coming through the clouds and slowed them down and scaled them so they felt bigger,” said Jackson. “For the impact on the sky, we shot cloudscapes from helicopter aerial shots in Zurich. The clouds catching fire was just another one of the elements that we shot. But, for the earth on fire, we shot burning edges to incorporate those wider shots of the whole planet catching fire.”

For the Trinity atomic bomb blast, Fisher’s effects department created large and small explosions with gasoline, propane, and magnesium and aluminum powder to create the flash and overwhelming brightness.
“That big volume of burning fuel tends to make itself into a mushroom shape,” Jackson added. “We placed it between the practical tower that was built and the camera so that it was scaled by bringing it closer to the camera.” They were shot at 48 frames-per-second with 65mm IMAX and Panavision Panaflex System 65 Studio cameras, while detailed sections were additionally shot at 50 frames-per-second with 35mm cameras.
The final 100 VFX shots were stitched together through complex compositing of more than 400 practical elements from a team of 150-plus DNEG artists. “We shot them from different distances and then, in post, we took all of those elements and slowed them down even more so that they appeared much bigger than they were,” said Jackson, “and then layered them over the top of each other, so that we could build a bigger event outta the smaller pieces.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvY3JhZnQvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItYXRvbWljLWJsYXN0LXZmeC1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1kbmVnLTEyMzQ4OTMzMTEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-26 09:00:00-07:00,Benny Safdie Is Really Proud of How His Eyebrows ‘Shined’ in Oppenheimer,"The Oppenheimer actor, who plays Edward Teller in Christopher Nolan’s latest film, explains that accent: “I remember finally I was like, You know what? I could sound crazy, but I don’t care. This is what Teller sounds like.”","“Every once in a while I have a straggler that I’ll just pluck out, ’cause it looks a little too crazy. But Chris said, ‘Don’t do that. Let’s just let it go crazy.’” Photo: Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures
Benny Safdie is an acclaimed director in his own right, but over the past couple of years he’s been recognized for terrific supporting turns in films like Licorice Pizza, The Stars at Noon, and Are You There, God? It’s Me Margaret. Now, he gives one of the most memorable performances in Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer as the controversial Hungarian American physicist Edward Teller, who joined the Manhattan Project under J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) and eventually became known as the father of the hydrogen bomb — a nuclear hawk, in opposition to the more conflicted Oppenheimer. Somewhat amazingly, Safdie himself had considered becoming a physicist in high school before deciding to go into film. That fascination with the wonders and paradoxes of science appear to have informed his interpretation of Teller. We spoke last month, before the SAG-AFTRA strike, about his journey with Nolan’s movie, and his thoughts about this character.
What did you and Christopher Nolan talk about initially with respect to the part of Edward Teller?
We were talking about the movie in general and about science and physics. I said to him, “This is actually a very interesting confluence of things, because I was a millisecond away from becoming a physicist.” It was such an unbelievable coincidence. When I was young, I wanted to become a nuclear physicist. I had studied the standard model in high school. I was working with a physicist at Columbia University. I was doing cosmic rays. It actually is a deep passion of mine! So then, when he asked me to play the part of Edward Teller, it was a no-brainer, because I knew who he was.
How did you work on Teller’s accent?
The accent was something I was so nervous about. I remember Chris asking me, “How’s the accent coming?” And I’m just like, Oh my God, how am I going to accomplish this? I didn’t know if he was going to want me to do it. But he sent me all of these interviews and we talked about how Teller speaks and who he is. It was a long process of working together to really nail it down. I would ride my bike listening to these interviews. Whenever Teller spoke, he was always kind of posturing, so we were trying to figure out what he sounds like when he’s not performing in that way. Then Chris sent me this one interview that Teller did talking about his friend who had just passed away, Johnny von Neumann. He’s quiet and gentle, but you still get his cadence of speech.
The accent sounds extreme, but this is a man who was one of the models for Dr. Strangelove, no?
He really was! I remember finally I was like, You know what? I could sound crazy, but I don’t care. This is what Teller sounds like and I’m just going to do it. I sent a voice-memo where I just narrated what my breakfast was and how Teller really liked pineapple.
Chris also said to me, “We need to figure out a way for your voice to change when you get older.” So before each take, I said, “Okay, I’m going to yell. I’m going to really break up my vocal cords.” It makes such a big difference. We also came up with this weird laugh-snort that Teller has when Kenneth Branagh is talking and we realize the Germans are behind and we’re ahead of them. Snorting and hitting the leg. We spent so long on that! Just that little snort. You’re not afraid to look stupid in a lot of ways, because when you’re free like that, it’s a fun place to be.
And I am proud to say that it’s all my eyebrows. Teller had the best eyebrows. Every once in a while I have a straggler that I’ll just pluck out, cause it looks a little too crazy. But Chris said, “Don’t do that. Let’s just let it go crazy.” I had the most insane eyebrows for months and months, and you just had to brush them out and then they shined in all their glory.
You were surely more familiar with the science than I was, but I was struck by how the film always feels like it’s on the verge of giving you too much science — but it never does. It gives you just enough.
I had seen these videos of Richard Feynman talking about the world at large, and he talks about rubber bands and how when you look at a rubber band, all the energy and all the atoms are constantly banging against one another in order to keep themselves connected. I thought to myself, That’s such a crazy way to walk around. How could you live your life that way, seeing things that aren’t there? One day, at the lodge at Los Alamos, there were all these real physicists there. So during the downtime, I talked to them about that specific question, and they said, “Look, you may say that to me, but I look at you and say you’re seeing the world the wrong way.” That was so profound. But that’s kind of what the movie is doing. It’s showing you somebody who’s really struggling with that. “I know this information, and I know what’s possible. Do I show the world?”
It feels like Teller and Oppenheimer wind up on two opposite sides of that question.
There was this Teller interview that I sent to producer Emma Thomas. It was all about how a scientist’s job is to discover. It’s not up to them how it’s used or not, because their point in life is to find and research. One of the examples he gives is fertilizer. Because without it, we would have no food, people would die. But that fertilizer also gave rise to explosives. So he feels it’s not up to the scientist to make that moral decision. But that’s such a shaky ground to go on. The movie plays with this idea of what it means to be a scientist. It’s a fine line.
The thing that I remember when I watched the film that was so crazy was, as they’re getting ready to test the bomb, I was so excited. I was sitting there thinking, I cannot wait to see this thing go off. I cannot wait! It’s like you’re in the mind of a scientist. “I figured this stuff out, I want to see the end result. Let’s go.” Then as soon as it happens, you immediately think, Oh my God, what’s wrong with me? What did I just root for? What did I just want to watch? That’s what Oppenheimer went through. So for a movie to put me in exactly that position on such a large scale, it’s crazy.
There’s a speech that Cillian gives after the bombs are dropped. It’s so powerful and scary and so intense; that’s where the movie took off to another level. What’s so amazing about Cillian’s performance is that it is Oppenheimer, but it’s also an interpretation of who Oppenheimer might be, from a point of view of trying to understand what his struggle was. It’s an interpretation that’s fully internalized. You’re watching someone exploring and living in that mind. I saw it when I was acting with him, but when you see the whole film together, you realize how it plays through.
How is a man this smart able to convince himself of that? Maybe that’s what he had to do to be able to live.
Even toward the end, when he’s speaking out against nuclear proliferation, it feels like Oppenheimer hasn’t fully reconciled himself with his role in this whole thing. But the people around him are much more certain about who they are — whether it’s Isidor Rabi, or Kitty Oppenheimer, or Leslie Groves, or Teller. It’s almost like you guys have to batter him with explosives to get him to express himself.
Emily Blunt did such an incredible job with that — exactly what you just said. She’s frustrated that he can’t do what he feels, and she really understands him. She wants him to be somebody who he refuses to be. “Why are you doing this? Why are you tarring and feathering yourself in front of them?” You see this look on Cillian’s face where it’s almost like he has to do that. It’s his penance for seeing something through.
There was a moment when we were all in the makeup trailer, getting old together in a matter of six hours. Then we’re in that room at the end and I had to shake their hands. Going into the scene, I felt so good. Like, “Okay, we understand each other.” Then the way she turned her head to me — it was such a gut punch. Chris had sent me all these things about Teller. I remember finding out that after that moment, Teller actually went and cried. It was a horrific experience for him. He was hated.
We did have a lot of fun with Teller’s character because he’s so different than Oppenheimer, and yet there’s this respect that exists between them. There was one moment when I had to enter — my first entrance in the movie. Chris gave me so much stuff to have to carry into that room, on purpose: jacket, bag, lunch bag, so that I was constantly fidgeting with all these things. Once I came in, Cillian was like, “Oh, hello, Teller.” I just said, “Yes.” That was how I said hello. It’s very funny.
What was the vibe on set like?
I didn’t know what to expect going into one of Chris’s films because they’re so well crafted and you don’t really know how they’re put together. But on set, it was so open. The blocking, the discovery of the shots — it was collaborative in a very deep way where you felt really good about everything that you were doing. Literally at one point, Hoyte van Hoytema was just rolling on the floor with the dolly — no track, just rolling the dolly, moving it around, just finding the right way to see it while you’re there.
As a filmmaker, I remember sitting in the lodge and I’m like, We’re going to be here for a while because this is like seven, eight scenes. It’s a hundred people. It’s period. They banged out everything so fast! We moved to a new location before lunch. I said, “I have no idea how you did that.” It was just perfect execution, while still feeling free and light on your feet.
From a technical point of view, I’d never even seen an Imax camera. And I had never heard an Imax camera. I’m sitting in this scene, and I’m about to give the testimony to the Senate, and there’s all these bright, intense lights because they’re shooting black-and-white Imax. Then all of a sudden I hear [makes a loud engine sound]. I’m just like, “Oh my God. Something is going wrong here.” I turn around, and I see everybody totally calm. I make eye contact with Chris, like, “Are you going to cut?” He was so gentle. His hands were like, “Just go forward. Just go through.” I turned around and then proceeded with the scene. I’d never seen so many intimate scenes shot on Imax, because when you actually hear what that thing sounds like, how we were able to even perform is remarkable. You’re seeing real conversations and moments, not just these big vistas in that large scale.
I talked to Jennifer Lame, the editor, about the way the film focuses on things like droplets and ripples, or the breaking of crystal or the blowing sparks inside an explosion. I thought that was a fascinating and poetic way to try and address some of the science.
I was just at the Natural History museum yesterday. There’s the whole new wing, and it goes back to Powers of 10, the Eames film, where they zoom in and they zoom out. It’s the same thing. There’s this big room where it’s a big projection and it goes into the brain and you see how the brain works and how information travels along the nerves and it’s zooming in and out and it goes through a forest. Then you see the roots of the ground and how water travels through the roots up into the tops of the trees. And the organisms in the bottom of the ocean look very similar to the stars and space. I was looking at this big giant crystal. If you cut out the edges of the crystal and you look at the center, it looks just like the universe. There is all this interconnectivity to everything. If you’re religious, you can go toward there. Or if you’re scientific, you could just say that everything is a mirror of itself, because once it figured out how to work, it just did that again and again with different organic matter.
But what I got that to mean in the film was that was Oppenheimer’s brain working through the science. You’re seeing these synapses kind of fire and trigger. It’s not that dissimilar to a chain reaction in an atomic bomb in that way. The movie is following that process of discovery. And to see how each scientist can provide a specific element — how one person can focus just on the explosives, and one person can focus on how you actually direct that explosion into the center. It really is that process of each person doing what they do well. It mirrors itself in a lot of ways.
So, the film’s structure actually winds up mirroring that concept of a chain reaction — it just keeps going and going, until the world ends.
Yeah, and the thing that’s so interesting about Teller and his obsession with the hydrogen bomb — the Super, as he says — is that, yes, we all know that you need a fission bomb to make a fusion bomb, but we know a fusion bomb is possible, so why not just go right for that? Again, that’s the scientists getting ahead of themselves and wanting to do the best of the biggest. With Teller, there were parts of him that were just blind to what he was doing because he wanted to see through his idea at all costs. He really truly believed that nuclear weapons were going to change the world. You could build canals, there were no health effects to it — all of these things he gives interviews about later on in his life. How is a man this smart able to convince himself of that? Maybe that’s what he had to do to be able to live.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvaG93LWJlbm55LXNhZmRpZS1tYXN0ZXJlZC1hLWh1bmdhcmlhbi1hY2NlbnQtZm9yLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Cillian Murphy Says 'Oppenheimer' Sex Scenes with Florence Pugh Were 'Awkward' but 'Vital' for Plot,"Cillian Murphy spoke with 'GQ' about filming the sex scenes in 'Oppenheimer,' which he shares with costar Florence Pugh","WARNING: Spoilers for Oppenheimer below.
Cillian Murphy had no issues filming the sex scenes in Oppenheimer, though he admits it wasn't the most comfortable experience.
The Irish actor, 47, spoke with GQ about portraying Manhattan Project physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer in the newly released explosive biopic from Christopher Nolan. In the interview, he was asked about whether he felt his sex scenes with Florence Pugh were needed to tell the story.
""I think they were vital in this in this movie,"" Murphy answered. ""I think the relationship that he has with [Pugh's character] Jean Tatlock is one of the most crucial emotional parts of the film. I think if they're key to the story then they're worthwhile.""
But, he clarified, ""Listen, no one likes doing them, they're the most awkward possible part of our job. But sometimes you have to get on with it.""
Oppenheimer is rated R for ""some sexuality, nudity and language."" It's the first of Nolan's films to include sex scenes; the director is known for movies like the Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, Tenet, Dunkirk, Interstellar and more, many of which feature Murphy in supporting roles.

Asked in an interview with Insider published last month about whether he was nervous how audiences might react to sex scenes in the movie, Nolan, 52, said, ""Any time you're challenging yourself to work in areas you haven't worked in before, you should be appropriately nervous and appropriately careful and planned and prepared.”
""When you look at Oppenheimer's life and you look at his story, that aspect of his life, the aspect of his sexuality, his way with women, the charm that he exuded, it's an essential part of his story,"" he added.
In a recent interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, Murphy explained that his sex scenes with Little Women actress Pugh, 27, were ""written deliberately"" by Nolan and not included for a ""gratuitous"" reason.
""[Christopher] knew that those scenes would get the movie the rating that it got. And I think when you see it, it's so f----ing powerful. And they're not gratuitous. They're perfect. And Florence is just amazing,"" Murphy said.
In the blockbuster, Pugh portrays Jean Tatlock, the titular scientist’s mistress. And per The Hollywood Reporter, places with strict censorship laws, like the Middle East and India, edited in a CGI dress on Pugh for her nude scenes. (In one unedited scene, Jean is topless as she sits across from Oppenheimer in a hotel room. However, in the altered version, she is covered with a computer-generated black dress.)

THR added that nudity is forbidden in cinema in the Middle East and in India, and children under 12 years old are expected to have a parent present for projects with a UA rating.
Since Oppenheimer’s release on Friday, Indian officials have also spoken out about Pugh and Murphy’s sex scenes in the historical drama, calling them “a scathing attack on Hinduism."" On Saturday, Save Culture Save India (SCSI) Foundation’s Uday Mahurkar expressed his feelings toward the film on social media.
“It has come to our notice that the movie Oppenheimer contains a scene which make a scathing attack on Hinduism. As per social media reports, a scene in the movie shows a woman makes a man read Bhagwad Geeta aloud while getting over him and doing sexual intercourse. She is holding Bhagwad Geeta in one hand, and the other hands seems to be adjusting the position of their reproductive organs,” Mahurkar penned to Nolan in part, in a lengthy Twitter post.
He went on to say that “The Bhagwad Geeta is one of the most revered scriptures of Hinduism,” and those who practice it “do not know the motivation and logic behind this unnecessary scene on life of a scientist.”
Mahurkar was not alone in his disapproval. Variety stated that India’s minister for information and broadcasting, Anurag Thakur, called for Pugh and Murphy’s intimate moments to be removed from the film.

2023-07-24 16:23:38.585000+00:00,Cillian Murphy: “I wasn't great craic to hang out with on the Oppenheimer set”,"Cillian Murphy talks to GQ about Oppenheimer's controversial sex scene, skipping out on cast dinners and filming the ending.","“You’re an Irishman, are ya?” Cillian Murphy says, his features visibly softening, as I begin talking over Zoom. “Thank god.”
Two truisms about Cillian Murphy that are often repeated online: He hates doing interviews, but he loves Ireland. If he must talk to the press – which, being the lead of Christopher Nolan's mammoth blockbuster Oppenheimer, he absolutely must – the least I can do is give him a chance to talk about our shared homeland. So, with this introduction, we're off to a good start.
It's about 10 days before Oppenheimer drops, but Murphy and the big A-bomb movie – along with Greta Gerwig's Barbie – already seem to be taking up the majority of the internet's consciousness. In the film, he plays J Robert Oppenheimer, the man credited with leading the creation of the atomic bomb during World War Two. Though he has starred in a handful of Christopher Nolan blockbusters already, this is his first as a proper leading man. So, the scrutiny is greater than ever. He is wearing it well. “I'm not a huge fan of talking about myself,” he says, “but I fully believe in this movie, and I love promoting it. So I'm very comfortable with all of that.”
GQ: How often do you get people calling you “Sillian”?
Cillian Murphy: Less and less now actually. But it doesn't bother me. Then I very pedantically explain to them that there's no ‘K’ in the Irish language and it gets really boring.
You used to live in London, but moved to Dublin in 2015. I heard you said your kids were getting English accents so you took them home.
Yeah. That was a joke. [Laughs].
Well, people have really run with it. Do you need to personally relate to characters, and could you do so with Oppenheimer?
Well, first of all, it's imperative not to judge the character. Because then you've lost as a performer. You have to try and understand [them]. You have to be like a kind of emotional detective. But your job primarily is to define the truth in the character to try and portray them in a truthful way.
Emily Blunt said recently that during filming you didn't go for cast dinners because your ‘brain was too full’. Robert Downey Jr. said that at times it felt like you were ‘icing’ him. How much did playing Oppenheimer affect you?
It was a big part, and there were big, big questions that were grappling with, these huge ethical, moral questions. And Chris had written the script in the first person. So I knew that a lot of the weight was on my shoulders, even though we have this incredible ensemble. There was a responsibility that I felt about playing the part. That's just the way I work. I get very consumed by the work, and I don't really have time for hanging out. And in this movie, I was [regularly] skipping dinner, you know, so I wasn't great craic to hang out with. But that's just the way it was. It's just the nature of the work.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdxLW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvLnVrL2NpbGxpYW4tbXVycGh5LW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWludGVydmlldy0yMDIz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-02 22:04:05+00:00,Christopher Nolan Let an ‘Oppenheimer’ Actor Tweak His Script to Add a Shocking Line: ‘No One in the Room Knows How to React’,"Christopher Nolan encouraged his ""Oppenheimer"" actors to research their characters, and the info they learned changed the script.","One of the most shocking lines in Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer” was not scripted by the writer-director himself. It arrives during a scene where Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer is meeting with U.S. Secretary of War Henry Stimson and other government officials about where to drop the atomic bombs in Japan. Stimson tell the group to avoid bombing Kyoto because that’s where he and his wife honeymooned. It’s a stomach-churning line given Stimson’s off-hand delivery and the way he frames the atomic bombs’ destructive repercussions around his own interests.
During an interview with The New York Times, Nolan revealed that it was James Remar, the actor playing Stimson, who created that shocking line of dialogue. Because “Oppenheimer” features such a sprawling cast and Nolan’s script is mostly told through his main character’s perspective, the filmmaker encouraged his supporting actors to do their own thorough research on their roles. That’s where Remar discovered Stimson honeymooned in Kyoto.
“There’s a moment where James Remar… He kept talking to me about how he learned that Stimson and his wife had honeymooned in Kyoto,” Nolan said. “That was one of the reasons that Stimson took Kyoto off the list to be bombed. I had him crossing the city off the list because of its cultural significance, but I’m like, ‘Just add that.’ It’s a fantastically exciting moment where no one in the room knows how to react.”
“Each actor was coming to the table with research about what their real-life counterpart had been,” Nolan said earlier in the interview. “They had tons of homework to do. They had a great resource with ‘American Prometheus.’ They then did their own research and what it meant for me, which isn’t something I’d ever really been able to do in the past. So, for example, with the scene in the section classroom with all the scientists, we would be able to improvise the discussion. The script is there, but they could come into it with passion and knowledge based on all of their own learning.”
“Oppenheimer” has become a box office powerhouse for Universal Pictures since its July 21 release date. The film crossed the $180 million mark at the domestic box office in less than two weeks, and it’s already soared past $412 million worldwide. Considering “Oppenheimer” is a three-hour, R-rated biographical drama, these numbers are staggering.

“Hollywood is very glamorous — especially for women — and it's hard for an audience to see past that,” Pugh added. “Whenever I've not needed to be glam or have a full face of makeup, I fight to keep it that way. It helps the audience.""

“Even at the beginning of my career, I was always fighting to control my image,” Pugh also said. “It helps me when I'm wearing less makeup because then I'm less of a sparkly thing on screen. I feel like I'm allowed to do ugly faces, like it's more acceptable.”
After her appearance at the Met Gala, the Oscar nominee was spotted rocking her shaved head in Rome while shooting her upcoming romantic drama We Live in Time, costarring Andrew Garfield.
The British actress has recently been completing a press cycle for her next starring role in Christopher Nolan’s biopic thriller Oppenheimer, where she plays Jean Tatlock, the love interest of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy).
Pugh appeared on the red carpet for the movie's U.K. premiere in London last week sporting short hair, which has grown out from the initial buzzcut that she debuted in May. The actress continued to express herself by changing her hair color from a soft pink to a fiery orange.

Discussing the all-star film, Pugh told Radio Times, “It's one of the biggest movies I've made. Chris' approach is similar to indie movie-making.""
She continued, ""It reminded me of the early days when I was used to a fast-paced way of working — where, if you lost a scene from the day, you would lose it from the movie.”
“When I walked on set, I couldn't believe there was that similar, incredible adrenaline, which I hadn't felt on a massive movie for a long time. It's a wonderful thing to inject into a film set — believing in yourself and what you're making,” the Midsommar actress added.

2023-07-09 09:00:01+00:00,Robert Downey Jr.’s Post-Marvel Balancing Act,"“I regained my connection with a more purist approach to making movies,” says the co-star of “Oppenheimer.”","Talk Robert Downey Jr.’s Post-Marvel Balancing Act
“This summer,” Robert Downey Jr. says, “is the battle for the soul of cinema.” Like a lot of things said by the actor, who co-stars in the thriller “Oppenheimer,” directed by Christopher Nolan and opening in theaters on July 21, that statement was delivered with a soupçon of knowing sarcasm, but there’s truth to it. In a cinematic season dominated by series, superheroes and pre-existing I.P. all aimed at the widest-possible market, whether there is still a theatergoing audience sizable enough to sustain the work of a highly individualistic, highly ambitious director like Nolan — whose latest is a three-hour epic focusing on, among other weighty themes, the moral dilemmas faced by the title character, called “the father of the atomic bomb” — remains an open question. (In the film, Downey plays Lewis Strauss, the former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and the chief antagonist of J. Robert Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy.) As if that weren’t enough, the film also represents a career reset — famously not the first — for Downey, who in June premiered “Downey’s Dream Cars,” a docuseries in which some of his classic cars were refitted to be more eco-friendly. It has been an awfully long time since the 58-year-old has shown up in a big movie playing a major part that wasn’t Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man) or other would-be franchise material. “You start to wonder,” says Downey, a rollicking and digressive talker, “if a muscle you have hasn’t atrophied.”
Even though Christopher Nolan is a marquee name, a movie like “Oppenheimer” isn’t exactly a guaranteed box-office slam dunk. Then consider that in the light of a show like “Perry Mason,” which your company co-produced and which everyone seemed to like, but that wasn’t enough to keep it from being canceled. So from where you’re sitting, do you feel as if you’re able to make sense of the business right now? Since my ship came in in 2008, when “Iron Man” had that big weekend, I have been a self-described expert on the ways of the world of creativity and commerce. It’s not that the playing field changes — it’s that it morphs into something that you can’t even really call a playing field anymore. It’s a kind of mosaic of what it was moments before. If I am running a major streamer — which sounds like a big No. 1; how serious is it if the mind immediately goes to peepee? — anyway, you look at the budget, you look at the numbers and it comes down to a spreadsheet.
But how does knowing that affect your choices about what to make? You just go, “Welcome to Thunderdome.” I think it has been great in that we can all say that not one of us can entirely hit our ass with both hands right now, so let’s just keep doing what we believe is the best course of action.

Is it right that you’re remaking “Vertigo”? We are certainly looking into it. You know why?
God bless. I’ll tell you why. I have been rock climbing before and gotten stuck in that panic freeze, and if not for the sheer embarrassment, I would have asked to have been hoisted off that rock. I lost my confidence in my positioning, the drop was too far, my body reacted. It wasn’t fight-or-flight; it was freeze-and-about-to-faint. I’ll never forget it, and it made me think there are cinematic devices that have yet to be fully utilized that I think would provide an experience in trying to say, “What does it feel like to be psychologically silly with fear over something that should be manageable?” That might be entertaining.

How come? That drive that had been built up by being the kid on the other side of the fence — there was no longer a purpose for that. The water broke on what had seemingly been this unrequited thing. But what was requited? You realize you still have grief about a, b or c, or a not particularly irrational fear that d, e or f could happen. These external goals — there’s only so much space on the hard drive to function, and it was all geared toward getting this thing, and then when you meet it, it just goes, OK, big shot, can we get back to the process of unpacking a lifetime of experiences, fears, hopes, desires?
In that decade-plus when you were mostly doing Marvel movies, did you have any concerns about what effect that might have on your acting? I say that as someone who thought you did amazing work with Tony Stark. But you did play the same role for a long time. Yes. A hundred percent, and I knew there was a point where Chris Nolan was endorsing, let’s work those other muscles, but let’s do it while rendering you devoid of your usual go-to things.

I respect that there are things you don’t talk about in interviews, but can you make the connection for me between Strauss’s sense of service and your own? I’m not following. I’m saying that doing the right thing for the right reasons gives you an advantage in spirit. For instance, my son is in Little League. He also thinks I am his personal P.T. masseuse. I’m like, “Dude, I love you, but do I really have to give you another foot rub?” Once I get past that and realize, yes, I’ve had a long day but he’s probably had a longer day — there’s this sacred moment when he’s already fallen asleep and I’m still doing my shiatsu moves on him and you just feel right-size. You are getting so much gratification from this process of putting yourself in this position of service, and no one’s keeping score. That is something that I learned as I was tunneling my way back to being a functioning member of society, one teaspoon of dirt at a time. And looking at Strauss, I saw that he was a guy who had his nose to the grindstone and was a civil servant for decades. I have something I can relate to.
That tunneling-your-way-back line is reminding me of something I wanted to ask about: I watched this 2004 clip of you on “Oprah,” about a year after you got clean, and the subtext of the interview is that you were bad and now you have to convince everyone that you’re good — which is a dynamic that showed up in so many old TV appearances and magazine articles about you. I’m curious to know how you understood the public’s expectations for how a celebrity is supposed to behave in order to earn redemption. I remember with great pride that I was able to even address something like that in a public forum. Yet it would irk me deeply. It felt strangely punitive and unnecessarily humiliating. The challenge, though, is, yeah, so what? [Expletive] what you’re going through. Can you show up for this? There’s a great story about this guy — this would never play nowadays — he was in one of his last Zen trainings, and he was told to go to the lingerie section at Lord & Taylor and just stand there until women felt uncomfortable. It’s this idea of purposefully putting yourself in a situation where you will feel judged. The only difference between that misguided aspiring Zen master and me is I didn’t sign up to have that kind of experience. But once you’re there, you gotta roll with the punches. I am close with people right now who have gotten caught up in this iteration of the pendulum-like nature of culture deciding who is and isn’t OK. It is baffling. But yeah, shock, self-damnation, feeling exposed, feeling disabused of any progress you might have made — we’re also talking about me in my 40s and 30s, and there’s something great about pushing 60, which is I still have many of the old defects; I just know them so well. They’re like telemarketers. It’s like, “Come on, guys.”

What advice are you giving to people you’re close with who the culture has decided are not OK? I feel a bit fugazi when I’m trying to apply the metrics of the ’80s, ’90s and the early aughts to what’s occurred in the last five or seven years, but I think there’s usually a two-year turnaround on sinking to the depths of the Mariana Trench until you get back up to the surface. You come up too quick, we know what happens. There are many points in a comeback or being seen in a favorable light by your peers that, I’ll speak for myself, I wanted to happen sooner than it did, and I felt victimized by the timeline. But mankind’s greatest challenge is to be still. Stay on the bus. The scenery’s changing. You don’t get to decide where you get off the bus. The driver will let you know when you’ve arrived at your stop. But that’s that intolerable thing of how will I know when this nightmare is over?
How do you know? Because you wake up.

At the beginning of the conversation, you referred to “Sr.” as “content.” I’m guessing you wouldn’t use that word to describe “Oppenheimer.” So what’s “content” and what’s not? Pull out the list, and I’ll tell you yes or no.
“Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.” Not content.
“Avengers: Age of Ultron.” Content.
“U.S. Marshals.” Debatable.
“Back to School.” Not content.
Yeah. “Sr.” is so personal, but to everyone else it was a piece of content that they could have chosen to click on and watch or not.
How’s that different from anything else you do? Whether it’s a movie or “Downey’s Dream Cars” or your business ventures, you put things out there and people engage with it or not, right? Because it’s a way for me to let myself know that just because this may be the most important thing that I ever commit to a data card on a camera, doesn’t mean it isn’t [expletive] content to everyone else. You know, there’s part of me that thinks I should be a writer or an entrepreneur or I could blah, blah, blah. But then I think about it and go, I’ve made my peace with what I am at my core: There’s really only one thing I’ve ever been any goddamn good at. So to keep imagining that I’m going to suddenly transform into this formidable multihyphenate? I’m just starting to not buy my own hype. It’s about: Can I feel good about what I’m doing? OK, yes, then I’ll feel good about it.

2023-07-24 10:41:07+00:00,Barbie and Oppenheimer smash the box office in fourth biggest weekend ever,Barbie and Oppenheimer brought the biggest box office weekend since Avengers: Endgame,"Barbie and Oppenheimer – or Barbenheimer, as the internet has affectionately named them – combined forces to smash the box office, bringing in numbers way ahead of expectations.
Together, the films spurred the fourth biggest box office weekend ever, and the biggest since Avengers: Endgame was released back in 2019.
Per Variety, Barbie brought in an astonishing $155 million domestically, while Oppenheimer scored an equally impressive $80.5 million domestic tally. That makes Barbie the year's biggest debut – a remarkable fact, considering 2023 has seen the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and Mission: Impossible 7 already.
It also means Greta Gerwig has scored the biggest opening for a movie directed by a woman ever; the record was previously set by Captain Marvel, which was co-directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck.
Globally, Barbie brought in $337 million total, while Oppenheimer scored $174 million. Considering Barbie's budget is put between $128-145 million, and Oppenheimer's at $100 million, both films have been amazing successes.
The weekend marks the biggest of the pandemic era – and, in pre-pandemic times, the only openings to bring in higher totals were Endgame, Avengers: Infinity War, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Considering neither Barbie nor Oppenheimer are sequels – and the latter is an all-original, R rated movie that runs three hours – that's a spectacular result indeed.
Variety notes that ""hundreds of thousands"" of people showed up this weekend to watch both movies; the meme-machine that is the internet turned this weekend into a cultural event, with ""Barbenheimer"" becoming shorthand for seeing both movies in a double bill.
Both films are still playing in theaters now if you want to get in on the action – and for much more on both movies, see our pieces about the films below:",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzcmFkYXIuY29tL2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLXdlZWtlbmQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-15 11:00:00+00:00,"8 wild stories about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the 'father of the atomic bomb'",From predicting the existence of black holes to being insulted by Einstein — J. Robert Oppenheimer led an intriguing life. Here are eight facts you didn't know about the father of the atomic bomb.,"J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904 -1967) is infamous for spearheading the development of the world's first atomic bomb — but the physicist's life was far from boring outside the lab. Here are eight intriguing stories about Oppenheimer, drawn from the biography ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer"" (Knopf, 2005), by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin.

1. He was the first to propose the existence of black holes

Oppenheimer was a tireless dilettante and loved to pursue his intellectual curiosity in any direction it took him.
After having been introduced to astrophysics by his friend Richard Tolman, Oppenheimer began publishing papers on theorized, yet-to-be-discovered cosmic objects. These papers included calculations of the properties of white dwarfs (the dense glowing embers of dead stars) and the theoretical mass limit of neutron stars (the incredibly dense husks of exploded stars).
Perhaps his most stunning astrophysical prediction came in 1939, when Oppenheimer co-wrote (with his then-student Hartland Snyder) ""On Continued Gravitational Contraction."" The paper predicted that, far in the depths of space, there should exist ""dying stars whose gravitational pull exceeded their energy production.""
The article received little attention at the time but was later rediscovered by physicists who realized that Oppenheimer had foreseen the existence of black holes .
2. Einstein called him a fool

Oppenheimer's stunning intellect and vast learning didn't always overcome his emotional immaturity and political naivety.
One such instance was a disagreement he had with Albert Einstein during the height of the McCarthy Red Scare. After bumping into Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, he spoke with his colleague about the growing efforts to revoke his security clearance.
Einstein counseled his colleague that he needn't submit himself to a grueling investigation and trial by the Atomic Energy Commission; he could just walk away.
But Oppenheimer replied that he would do more good from inside the Washington establishment than from the outside, and that he had decided to stay and fight. It was a battle Oppenheimer would lose, and the defeat marked him for the rest of his life.
Einstein walked to his office and, nodding at Oppenheimer, said to his secretary, ""There goes a narr [Yiddish for 'fool'].""
3. He may have tried to poison his professor with an apple

Oppenheimer faced trying times while studying for his doctorate in physics at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England. His intense emotional issues and feelings of growing isolation drove him into a period of deep depression.
Oppenheimer's adviser at Cambridge was Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett, an intelligent and gifted experimental physicist whom Oppenheimer envied. Despite Oppenheimer's renowned impracticality, Blackett pushed his student into laboratory work.
Oppenheimer's constant failures in the lab and his inability to win Blackett's approval made him intensely anxious. Consumed by his jealousy, Oppenheimer may have gone to extreme lengths. A longtime friend, Francis Fergusson, claimed that Oppenheimer once admitted that he laced an apple with noxious chemicals and left it enticingly on Blackett's desk.
However, there is no evidence of this incident beyond Fergusson's claims — and Oppenheimer's grandson, Charles Oppenheimer, disputes that this ever happened . But if there was a poisoned apple, Blackett didn't eat it. Oppenheimer is said to have faced expulsion from the school and possible criminal charges, before his father intervened and negotiated that his son instead be put on academic probation.
4. President Truman called him a crybaby

Oppenheimer was very persuasive in relaxed settings, but he had a terrible tendency to crack under pressure.
Just two months after the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , Oppenheimer met with President Harry S. Truman in the Oval Office to discuss his concerns about a possible future nuclear war with the USSR. Truman brushed off Oppenheimer's worries, assuring the physicist that the Soviets would never be able to develop an atomic bomb.
Maddened by the president's ignorance, Oppenheimer wrung his hands and said in a low voice, ""Mr. President, I feel I have blood on my hands.""
Truman was enraged by this remark, and promptly ended the meeting.
""Blood on his hands, dammit — he hasn't half as much blood on his hands as I have,"" Truman said. ""You just don't go around bellyaching about it."" Truman later told his secretary of state, Dean Acheson, ""I don't want to see that son-of-a-bitch in this office ever again.""
Truman regularly returned to the subject of the Oppenheimer meeting with Acheson, writing in 1946 that the father of the atomic bomb was a ""cry-baby scientist"" who came to ""my office some five or six months ago and spent most of his time wringing his hands and telling me they had blood on them because of the discovery of atomic energy.""
5. His students were obsessed with him

Oppenheimer was a verbal physicist by temperament. He didn't rely solely on math to understand the world; he also reached for useful ways to describe it with words. His rhetorical felicity, and his erudition on topics far outside of physics, made him a captivating speaker.
Oppenheimer was so gifted at crafting beautiful sentences — often on the fly — that he enraptured the students he lectured. Some of these students became so obsessed with Oppenheimer that they began to dress and act like him — donning his gray suit and ungainly black shoes, chain-smoking his favorite Chesterfield cigarettes and mimicking his peculiar mannerisms.
The starstruck students were nicknamed the ""nim nim boys"" because they carefully imitated Oppenheimer's eccentric ""nim nim"" humming.
6. He was a passionate student of the humanities and could speak six languages, including ancient Sanskrit

Oppenheimer loved an intellectual challenge and relished any opportunity to demonstrate his prodigious ability to soak up information. He spoke six languages: Greek, Latin, French, German, Dutch (which he learned in six weeks to deliver a lecture in the Netherlands) and the ancient Indian language of Sanskrit.
Oppenheimer also read a lot of books outside of his field. He told friends that he had read all three volumes of Karl Marx's ""Das Kapital"" cover to cover on a three-day train trip to New York, that he had similarly devoured Marcel Proust's ""A La Recherche du Temps Perdu"" (""In Search of Lost Time"") to cure his depression while on vacation in Corsica, and that he had learned Sanskrit so he could read the Hindu scripture the Bhagavad Gita.
Oppenheimer's close reading of the Gita gave him his most famous quote. In a 1965 NBC interview, he recalled his thoughts upon seeing the mushroom cloud from the first successful atomic bomb test:
""We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that one way or another.""
7. At age 12, he was mistaken for a professional geologist and was invited to give a lecture at the New York Mineralogy Club

From age 7, Oppenheimer became fascinated with crystals because of their structures and interactions with polarized light. He became a fanatical mineral collector and used his family typewriter to begin lengthy and detailed correspondences with local geologists.
Unaware that they were writing to a 12-year-old, one geologist invited Oppenheimer to deliver a lecture at the New York Mineralogy Club. Oppenheimer wanted his dad to explain to the club that his son was only 12, but his father was tickled by the incident and urged him to go.
The room of surprised geologists burst into laughter at the revelation that the boy was their mystery correspondent, but they soon provided him with a wooden box so he could reach the lectern. Oppenheimer delivered his speech and was met with applause.
8. He code-named the first atomic bomb test in honor of his dead mistress

Oppenheimer first met Jean Tatlock in 1936, and began a passionate romance that continued throughout his marriage to Katherine Puening and ended with Tatlock's death in 1944. When Tatlock and Oppenheimer met, Tatlock was an active member of the Communist Party and persuaded Oppenheimer to allay his concerns about the poverty he was witnessing during the Great Depression by donating to the party.
Oppenheimer's reputation as a communist sympathizer soon attracted the attention of the FBI, whose agents began to follow and wiretap him.
In 1944, Tatlock was found dead in her apartment from an apparent drug overdose. She had suffered for much of her life with intense bouts of depression and left an unsigned note, so her death was ruled a suicide. Nonetheless, conspiracy theories — some alleged by her brother — about intelligence agencies' supposed involvement in her death abounded.
Tatlock introduced Oppenheimer to the poems of John Donne, whose work she loved. He drew from Donne's poem ""Batter my heart, three-person'd God …"" when he assigned the code name ""Trinity"" to the first test of an atomic bomb.
The FBI's monitoring of Oppenheimer and Tatlock came back to bite him during his trial at the Atomic Energy Commission's 1954 security hearing, where his affair was exposed and used to allege that he had still held communist sympathies late into World War II. The trial, which resulted in the revoking of Oppenheimer's security clearance, hounded him from public life — making him one of the most prominent victims of McCarthyism.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9waHlzaWNzLW1hdGhlbWF0aWNzLzgtd2lsZC1zdG9yaWVzLWFib3V0LWotcm9iZXJ0LW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXRoZS1mYXRoZXItb2YtdGhlLWF0b21pYy1ib21i0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Matt Damon has described a time he “fell into a depression” while filming a particularly regrettable movie project.
The Bourne Identity star, 52, went into the story during an interview with the YouTube channel Jake’s Takes.
Damon declined to mention the name of the project in question. While the Oscar-winning Good Will Hunting star has appeared in a number of acclaimed films throughout the years, he has also featured in a number of critically panned releases, such as The Great Wall (2016), Suburbicon (2017) and Downsizing (2017).
“Without naming any particular movies... sometimes you find yourself in a movie that you know, perhaps, might not be what you had hoped it would be, and you’re still making it,” he said.
“And I remember halfway through production and you’ve still got months to go and you’ve taken your family somewhere, you know, and you’ve inconvenienced them, and I remember my wife pulling me up because I fell into a depression about like, what have I done?”
Damon has been married to Luciana Barroso since 2005. He went on to recall his partner’s reaction to his ordeal.
“She just said, ‘We’re here now’,” he said. “You know, and it was like... I do pride myself, in a large part because of her, at being a professional actor and what being a professional actor means is you go and you do the 15-hour day and give it absolutely everything, even in what you know is going to be a losing effort.
“And if you can do that with the best possible attitude, then you’re a pro, and she really helped me with that.”

Oppenheimer premiered in Paris on Tuesday (11 July), and early critical reactions have already made their way online.

The Dark Knight trilogy director had worked with Pattinson before in Tenet where they got to talking about Oppenheimer.
“Yeah, Rob, off the back of Tenet, where we refer to Oppenheimer, and I had wrote a thing about this incredible moment that Oppenheimer and the scientist of the Manhattan Project had where they could not completely eliminate the possibility that when they triggered that first gadget, that first atomic device, they might start the chain reaction that would destroy the world,” Nolan said in an interview with journalist Tara Hitchcock.
Nolan continued, “We used that as a metaphor for Tenet, which Rob was in. As a wrap gift, he gave me a book of Oppenheimer‘s speeches from the 1950s, where you’re reading these great intellects trying to deal with the massive consequences of the way in which they’ve changed life forever, for all of us.”
As to why Pattinson is not part of the Oppenheimer film, Nolan says that “he was busy” and “he’s very much in demand these days.”
Pattinson will reprise his role of Bruce Wayne in The Batman sequel and was recently announced to be part of the cast of the serial killer comedy Average Height, Average Build.
The cast of Oppenheimer includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek and Kenneth Branagh, among others. Oppenheimer drops in theaters on July 21.

,"Oppie—“A very mysterious and delphic character.” Interview with Kai Bird, co-author of American Prometheus","Kai Bird, one of the co-authors of ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer""—which 25 years to complete—explains why he once described biography as: “The hardest form of history. And the most expensive.”","Kai Bird is one of the co-authors of American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 2005 and later became the basis for the newly released major Hollywood movie “Oppenheimer.”
By all accounts, Oppenheimer was a complex figure; over the years, commentators have used words as disparate as “complex, contradictory,” “ambitious,” “charismatic,” “mystical,” and “flawed” to describe him. About the only thing pundits seem to agree on is that Oppenheimer was brilliant.
Bird gives his take on the man in this interview with the Bulletin’s Dan Drollette Jr and describes what he and his co-author, Martin Sherwin, discovered in their journey to make their 721-page biography. Bird delves into Oppenheimer’s personality, his leadership as the head of the scientific end of the Manhattan Project, his climb to the heights of fame, and his fall from grace.
Bird also describes the recent—and, happily, successful effort—to restore Oppenheimer’s legacy to its rightful place in American society.
The executive director of the CUNY Graduate Center’s Leon Levy Center for Biography since 2017, Bird also explains why he once described biography as: “The hardest form of history—and the most expensive.”
(Editor’s note: This interview has been condensed and edited for brevity and clarity.)
Dan Drollette Jr: It must have been a bit intimidating to be made a co-author of this project rather late in the game. Hadn’t your co-author, Martin Sherwin, already spent 20 years researching J. Robert Oppenheimer by the time you got on board?
Kai Bird: Yes, but by then I was already very familiar with long-term biographical projects. I had already done a biography of John J. McCloy[1]—and one of McGeorge Bundy and his brother.[2] And I’d already gotten to know Marty Sherwin. Initially it was through The Nation, where I was an associate editor in the ‘80s, and he was writing a cover story.
Drollette: What was the story on?
Bird: Hiroshima, appropriately enough.[3]
But we really got to know each other later on, in the mid-90s, through our mutual involvement in the Smithsonian museum controversy over the Enola Gay. I was part of the advisory committee to it.
Drollette: Can you tell me a bit more?
Bird: Sure. The Smithsonian had wanted to put on a 10,000-square-foot exhibit at its Air and Space Museum to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. It was supposed to go into the highly nuanced and complicated issues surrounding the decision to drop the atomic bomb on Japan—you know, some generals, like Dwight D. Eisenhower, had criticized the use of the bomb as unnecessary, as the war was nearly won. And Truman’s chief of staff, Adm. [William] Leahy, had called it a “barbaric” weapon.
So the Smithsonian had wanted to put in all these points and counterpoints in the exhibit, but then the American Legionnaires and the Air Force Association cried foul. They wanted patriotically incorrect history and began demanding that they censor this and that. It became a big political controversy; Congress weighed in. It was a nasty fight.
To counter this, Marty and I formed a little committee of historians to defend the museum, and we wrote some op-eds together.[4]
We became good friends during that controversy; I found Marty to be a feisty, funny guy. That was in ’95, while I was still working on my Bundy biography.
By ’98, I had published it, and was searching for another project. That was when Marty came up with the idea that we should join forces on Oppenheimer.
Drollette: What did you say?
Bird: I told him no.
Drollette: Really? Why?
Bird: I told him that after the first biography I had undertaken with a co-author, we stopped being friends.
I told Marty that I liked him too much to do that.
But Marty was persistent. He kept coming down to have dinner with me and my wife, and talking it up—you know, stuff like, “It’s just such a great project.” And yes, he had done 20 years of research by then, but he kept telling me “Oh, Kai, you know, if you join me, there’s still enormous gaps in the research that you could fill; we don’t know enough about the 1930s.”
And he was very funny in his pitch. He said: “If you don’t join me on this project, my gravestone is going to say ‘He took the book with him.’ ”
So I was persuaded. (Laughs.)
Drollette: And how did it turn out?
Bird: It was a great collaboration. Marty knew the material inside and out, so when we drafted chapters, he could see what was missing. He was a real wordsmith.
Just as important, Marty had done tons of research, and had acquired 50,000 pages of archival documents—including 8,000 pages of FBI documents obtained under FOIA [Freedom of Information Act].
Bottom line: It worked out well. I started to write chapters, and that stimulated him to write—and we went back and forth.
Though it still took another five years before the book came out.
Drollette: In a way, I guess you were lucky to have all these recordings from those wiretaps. If you wanted to know verbatim what Oppenheimer had to say back in 1941 about something, there it was, on these old FBI tapes.
Bird: Oh, there was some of that for the early years. Although it wasn’t in the form of FBI recordings you could listen to so much as 8,000 pages of records of meetings, interviews with people who knew him, and such.
But by the time the 1954 hearings came around, then you could read transcripts of the FBI microphones that were wiretapping Oppenheimer at the time.
So yes, there was an incredible wealth of material. Marty had done 100-plus interviews and had them all neatly transcribed by his graduate students—incidentally, you can hear many of them online at the Atomic Heritage Site.[5]
So it was a wonderful collaboration.
Drollette: Did you have any idea the book would do so well, critically and commercially? I don’t think many biographies are picked up by Hollywood.
Bird: Well, when the book came out in 2005, I thought it was terrific, and I was very proud of it. So was Marty. And I remember telling him about eight months after the book came out that I thought it was a candidate for the Pulitzer. And he said, “Oh, no, don’t say that, you’ll jinx it.”
And I can understand that, it’s such a subjective process.
But indeed, we won the Pulitzer.
However, even before that happened, there was a film interest. It didn’t happen, actually, until Christopher Nolan came along decades later. He was handed the book in the spring of ‘21, read it—and without even contacting us, he sat down and spent the summer writing a screenplay.
It was only in September of that year that Nolan contacted us to say that he had picked up the film option and was now dealing with Universal Studios
The tragedy was that we learned all of this in late September, and then two weeks later, Marty died of nonsmoker’s lung cancer.
Drollette: Well, at least he got to see this accolade…
Bird: Yes, he was around long enough to know that it was going to happen. But it’s still very sad. I wish he was here; Marty would have had a lot of fun, looking at the hoopla around Hollywood and the film release.
Drollette: One of the things that I liked about the book was how it captured some of the details of big science: the little pecking orders between the theoretical physicists and the experimental physicists and the engineers, the rivalries that go on. I mean, it’s a human endeavor, subject to the same kinds of things as any other group effort.
Bird: Oh yes, very much so.
Drollette: And I also picked up on some little things that you and Marty mentioned in passing in the book, such as how the physicists at the Manhattan Project “loved the verbal wrestling that’s inherent in the process of explanation.” That used to drive me up the wall when I was editing a magazine at CERN, where I was surrounded by physicists—because they’d want to pick things apart forever while I’m on deadline. But now I see it’s not just me, it’s part and parcel of the physicist psyche.
Bird: Yes, I think so.
Drollette: There was one other thing the book touched on: the connection between music and physics. I’ve noticed that almost every physicist I’ve run across has a passion for music; I don’t really know why that is. So it was something to find out that someone else had picked up on that as well—it wasn’t just a figment of my imagination.
Bird: I think that if you want to be a good physicist—particularly a quantum physicist in the 1920s and 30s—it helped if you were a polymath. It helped if you were curious and interested about music or poetry or literature, and Oppenheimer was all those things.
And Oppenheimer was particularly adept at being articulate; he could talk in plain English, and explain to a non-physicist what was going on.
That’s precisely why he was hired to be the director of Los Alamos by Gen. Leslie Groves, head of the Manhattan Project. Groves could see that Oppenheimer was not only a smart physicist but someone who could explain—in plain English—what was going on.
Drollette: Which is important if you’re asking for funding on the scale of billions of dollars.
Bird: Absolutely.
Drollette: And I suppose that’s a good skill set to have if you’re trying to corral all these brilliant people and get them going in the same direction—while dealing with sensitive egos.
Bird: Yes, that’s the other thing that happened when Groves was deciding whether to hire him: Oppenheimer came up with the notion that if you wanted to invent this “gadget,” then instead of isolating the scientists in different university labs all over the country, what you needed to do was put them all in one place and have them collaborate together.
And because you’re concerned about security and leaks, and it’s wartime, then it makes sense to put them on a high plateau, surrounded with a barbed-wire fence, where they can collaborate and talk freely among themselves inside—but kept isolated from the rest of the world.
That idea appealed to the general in Groves, very much.
And from reading the book, you know that Oppie knew exactly the place he wanted to do this. Because as he told his brother, his ambition in life was to combine his two passions: physics and life in New Mexico. And he did it, by creating Los Alamos, the secret city.
Drollette: I managed to interview one of the last surviving scientists from the Manhattan Project—a physicist named Roy Glauber—before he died, and he gave me some of his impressions. Glauber said that when you first met Oppie, you wouldn’t have thought he could inspire such loyalty. The way he put it was that Oppenheimer always liked to pepper everyday conversations with references to things like Indic poetry. But these were not affectations, Oppenheimer genuinely had an interest in that kind of thing; that’s just who he was. There were no pretensions or put-ons.
And the physicists kind of respected that, Glauber said, because Oppie was so true to himself. The attitude toward Oppie seemed to be something like: “Okay, he’s different. He’s odd. But he’s genuinely odd.”
Bird: Absolutely, I think that’s a good characterization. Oppenheimer was very eccentric. And yeah, he could quote the [Bhagavad] Gita—he’d taken the trouble to try to learn a little Sanskrit so he could read it in its original text.
He was a very mysterious and sort of delphic character.
But at Los Alamos, whenever they were grappling with some problem to produce the “gadget”—as the atomic bomb was known—often Oppenheimer’s style was to stand at the back of the room and just listen and let everyone argue: the chemists versus the engineers versus the physicists versus the explosion experts. And then after a long time, he would sort of intervene and summarize in a very quiet, soft voice what everyone was saying in a way that pointed the direction forward.
And the consensus then became: If we’re going to make any progress, then this is the next step forward; everyone had to admit that he was right. So he was quietly charismatic in this spooky way.
Drollette: Let’s talk about what happened after the book came out. I saw where you and your co-author helped contribute to the effort to rehabilitate Oppenheimer. Did you ever expect that there would be this nullification of the 1954 Atomic Energy Commission decision that stripped him of his security clearance? Were you optimistic from the get-go?
Bird: Well, no.
After American Prometheus won the Pulitzer, Marty happened to be living in Washington, D.C.—the same city I was living in—and we would socialize together. And one day we were talking about it when we said, you know, we ought to use this extraordinary platform we have now. We ought to write a letter to someone to try and persuade the powers-that-be to look at this 1954 hearing and see if there is anything that could be done to rectify the terrible thing that had been done to Oppenheimer.
Our first notion, oddly enough, was to go to a lawyer and see if there was a way that we could file a court case. We persuaded a prominent law firm in D.C. to assign a young associate to investigate this for a few months, pro bono. And funnily enough, after a couple of months, we got an apologetic phone call from this young associate who said, very sheepishly, that one of the senior partners in the law firm was C. Boyden Gray, the son of Gordon Gray, who had chaired the security panel that convicted Oppenheimer—and C. Boyden Gray didn’t want anything to be done that would damage the reputation of his father. Gray didn’t want anything that suggested that his father had made a mistake; he thought that would be a scurrilous charge.
So the law firm in question had to back out. Consequently, it was referred to another firm in D.C., and they eventually came back to us and said: “There is nothing to be done, from a legal point of view. The only recourse may be to appeal to the president or maybe the Secretary of Energy to issue an executive order.”
So we began to pursue that. And this took years.
We worked on it often, if fitfully, and wrote some long memos documenting all the egregious violations that the 1954 Atomic Energy Commission had done, violating their own rules on how to conduct a security hearing. Just outrageous things—like the fact that they used all those FBI documents in the hearing against Oppenheimer, but denied Oppenheimer’s lawyer any access to them, saying that they were still classified. When Oppenheimer’s lawyer tried to get the right kind of clearances so that he could read the evidence, they denied him a security classification.
Drollette: So it really was a kangaroo court.
Bird: Yes, that was pretty clear; everyone we talked to pretty much agreed.
But oddly enough, when we we appealed to the Secretary of Energy during the Obama Administration—Ernest Moniz, who was a physicist himself—and made these arguments, we didn’t get the response we expected. He was sympathetic, but he caved to the advice of his veteran lawyers in the Energy Department, who told him: “No, you can’t do this.”
Their thinking was that to exonerate Oppenheimer—or to nullify the decision from 1954—would send the wrong message and set up a double standard in the security system. They thought it would open up the department to lawsuits by people who have subsequently been dismissed for security violations, opening up a whole can of worms.
And in addition, in their view, Oppenheimer had lied. They and Ernest Moniz believed that Oppenheimer had lied in the security clearance hearings.
And of course, Oppenheimer had not told absolutely the whole truth in 1943 when confronted by a security officer about the so-called Chevalier incident.[6] He had, in fact, been telling the whole truth when questioned about it in 1954. But in ‘43, he had merely left out part of the story because he was trying to defend his friend Chevalier—who had naively passed on this feeler from a friend, George Eltenton, about whether information could be passed on to the Soviet consulate. And Oppenheimer’s immediate response had been: “No, that would be treason.”
Drollette: I would have thought that would be the end of it. I mean, you know, it was a feeler, and Oppenheimer said: “No.” End of story.
Bird: But the security people were concerned about the fact that Oppenheimer didn’t volunteer this information for three months. And then when he did volunteer it on his own—without any prompting—this worried the security officers, and they began questioning him. As in: “Well, how do you know this? Who told you this?”
And he then made up what he later called a cock-and-bull story, to try to say: “Well, you should investigate this guy, George Eltenton. But I can’t tell you the name of the person who approached me directly.”
Drollette: Not to mention that by that point, it was 1954, and they were asking him about events that had occurred nearly 20 years earlier—such as “How did you meet Jean Tatlock, who may have been a fellow traveler?”
Bird: Yeah, right, it was a lot of ancient history.
But that’s what made the Oppenheimer story so interesting.
You know, when Marty Sherwin persuaded me to join him on this project in the year 2000, at one point he commented that “You know, Kai, you and I wouldn’t be spending so many years on this man’s life if it was just a story about the father of the atomic bomb—if it was just about a physicist who invented weapons of mass destruction. What makes the story really interesting and gives it an arc in storytelling is the fact that in 1945 he was hailed as the most famous scientist in America. And then nine years later, he was publicly humiliated and stripped of his security clearance, with questions raised about his loyalty.”
Oppie became a non-entity after 1954, and his life as a public intellectual was pretty much destroyed.
And that is what makes his story interesting: There is a triumph, but also a tragedy.
Drollette: I read somewhere—maybe in your book—that when Oppenheimer died in 1967, Senator Fulbright took to the Senate floor and said: “Let us remember, not only what his special genius did for us—let us remember what we did to him.”
Bird: Right. I love that quote, it really summarizes, in a dramatic way, the egregious nature of the harm that was done to this very sensitive soul.
Drollette: There was another line that said: “Vulnerability ran through his personality like a geological fault…”
Bird: He was a fragile personality, going back to his childhood and then his prolonged adolescence and his struggles in Cambridge, when he was first learning quantum physics in the 1920s. This is sort of what makes him so human—that he was aware of his own fragility, and he was aware of the fact that he was vulnerable.
And so that made him empathetic to other human beings. He could be very sweet and patient and nurturing to students and to the common citizen that he met in the street—and yet he could be extremely snide and insulting to people above him, in positions of authority.
Which I also find sort of endearing.
Drollette: I’ve got to say that the person who gets short shrift from history was Gen. Leslie Groves. Yes, he was the hard-charging and goal-oriented military man in the development of the bomb, but he had the vision, the awareness, to realize what he had in Oppenheimer. I mean, he elevated Oppenheimer to the supreme position at Los Alamos.
Bird: They were two very different personalities, so it was very improbable that they should get along. But they did. And Grove saw the genius in Oppenheimer, and his humanity.
Groves was very loyal to Oppie; he hired him knowing full well about all his left-wing proclivities in the 1930s. But Groves absolutely trusted him.
Likewise, you would think that Oppenheimer would not get along with this gruff, rather politically conservative army general. But the two men understood that they needed each other. And while it was a very improbable collaboration, it was a successful one.
Drollette: Are the kinds of things that happened to Oppenheimer still happening today? Are scientific facts still being distorted for political gain?
Bird: I’m afraid the answer is, obviously, yes.
We just have to look back to the recent pandemic where the integrity of scientists and public health officials was being questioned by the public and by politicians—a very dangerous thing.
We live in a very complicated, modern society, drenched with technology and physics, and we need the knowledge of scientists. And more than that, we need their opinions as public intellectuals to help provide guidance to understand the public policy questions that we face. Not that they have any gilded wisdom, but they have certain expertise that we lack as ordinary citizens.
But unfortunately, the role of the scientist or the expert witness in American society is very low. They don’t have much standing. There is a downright suspicion of scientific expertise.
And I think at least part of this lack of trust in science and scientific expertise dates back to what happened to Oppenheimer in 1954 when America’s most famous scientist was publicly humiliated. That had a chilling effect on scientists everywhere, making them wary of speaking out on public policy issues—no matter how much we need them to. The notion is that scientists have to beware of contradicting the conventional wisdom spouted by politicians, because you could be tarred and feathered.
I can’t think of a scientist today who has the sort of public standing that Oppenheimer had in 1945, when his image was put on the cover of Time magazine, and he was celebrated as a scientist and as someone to be listened to. We just don’t have the sort of large public intellectual like that anymore, who has a scientific background.
And that’s a curious and unfortunate thing.

[6] Haakon Chevalier was a friend of Oppenheimer’s, whom he met in the late 1930s while both were on the faculty of the University of California at Berkeley. (Chevalier taught Romance languages, Oppenheimer taught physics.) In 1942, around the same time that Oppenheimer was appointed to the Manhattan Project, Chevalier told Oppenheimer of a disturbing conversation he’d had with a third party named George Eltenton, a scientist at the Shell Oil Company who had connections to the Soviets—then our allies in World War II. Chevalier thought that Oppenheimer should know what happened; Oppenheimer cut him off. But because Oppenheimer let several months go by before reporting the conversation to US intelligence authorities, it became a key issue nearly a decade later, in subsequent hearings about Oppenheimer’s trustworthiness.

Robert Oppenheimer,” June 29, 1954. https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/opp06.asp",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3RoZWJ1bGxldGluLm9yZy9wcmVtaXVtLzIwMjMtMDcvb3BwaWUtYS12ZXJ5LW15c3RlcmlvdXMtYW5kLWRlbHBoaWMtY2hhcmFjdGVyLWludGVydmlldy13aXRoLWthaS1iaXJkLWNvLWF1dGhvci1vZi1hbWVyaWNhbi1wcm9tZXRoZXVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"“He did not speak the ordinary language”: Memories of Oppie, from a Manhattan Project physicist",One of the last surviving eyewitnesses from the effort to build the first atomic bomb gives his impressions of the Manhattan Project’s driving force: J. Robert Oppenheimer.,"During the middle of World War II, teenage physics major Roy Glauber found himself plucked out of college on the East Coast and assigned to work at a mysterious new government research center in the far-off deserts of New Mexico.
His destination turned out to be a laboratory at Los Alamos, a part of the Manhattan Project, where he was assigned to work under groundbreaking theoretical physicist Hans Bethe to help calculate the smallest amount of fissionable material—the critical mass—needed to set off a sustained nuclear reaction.
Glauber was one of the youngest scientists in the 1,400-person Los Alamos staff, and afterward he went on to a distinguished career in physics, earning a doctorate—and later becoming a professor—at Harvard University. His work focused on a wide variety of topics, including quantum dynamics, the collisions of high-energy particles such as hadrons, and the behavior of light particles, especially in clarifying how light had the characteristics of a wave and a particle simultaneously. In addition to his research, Glauber was known for his sense of humor, such as being the official “keeper of the broom” at an annual mock scientific conference sponsored by what has been called the MAD magazine of science, where his role was to sweep the stage clean of paper airplanes. (It’s become a tradition for members of the audience to throw paper airplanes at the stage to celebrate the end of the night’s proceedings.)
In 2005 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics; some years later, the 91-year-old Glauber attended the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting, where he agreed to an interview with me. Sadly, he died a year-and-a-half later, in 2018.
In this interview, one of the last surviving eyewitnesses from the effort to build the first atomic bomb gives his impressions of that project’s driving force—the director of the Los Alamos lab, J. Robert Oppenheimer. Glauber describes what it felt like to be working there as a young physicist; experience the overwhelming need for secrecy—and witness the test explosion of the first atomic bomb.
(Editor’s note: This interview has been condensed and edited for brevity and clarity.)
Dan Drollette Jr: To start things off, I thought we might look at these photos on my laptop of 1940s security ID badges from Los Alamos. As you can see, each one has a name, an ID number, and a kind of small black-and-white photo—but at least they each show the individual faces of the people who worked there at the time.[1] (See photo at top of page.)
Roy Glauber: Oh, yes. (Looks through array of photos on screen.)
There’s Dorothy McKibbin.[2] [McKibbin was Oppenheimer’s right-hand at the Manhattan Project and unofficial den mother to all the newcomers.]
And there’s a very young Richard Feynman.[3] Though they all look young.
You know, there was very little sense at Los Alamos at the time that any history was being enacted which would be of interest after the war was over. So, there was very, very little photography devoted to the individuals.
Although there was a large photographic division, which photographed all the experiments—including all the failures, and there were vast numbers of those. (Laughs.)[4]
But there was not much on simply recording the way people lived, and where we hung out.
Drollette: I like that smirk on Feynman’s ID photo. It’s a funny expression. (See below.)
Glauber: Well, for all intents and purposes, he was the resident clown. You would often find that wherever people gathered for lunch, there would always be a little knot of about half-a-dozen women all in the corner, laughing—and in the center would be Feynman, telling stories. He really made quite an entertainer of himself. He happened also to be possibly the brightest young mathematician in the place. I met Feynman in the year 1943, when I arrived there.
Drollette: And how old were you when you went to Los Alamos?
Glauber: I was 18.
Drollette: From the description you gave for an oral history about the Manhattan Project,[5] it sounded like they didn’t tell you much about what you were getting into.
Glauber: That was a matter of security, of course.
But I quickly got a general impression of what might be in the air, because the story of fission had been really big just a few years earlier, in 1939. All during the middle ‘30s, [nuclear physicist Enrico] Fermi had been subjecting many elements to irradiation by neutrons… By 1938, he was doing it with uranium. He found all sorts of funny particles flying out, which he could not analyze, and which were found to have strange chemical properties. And researchers had developed the idea that maybe they might be evidence of the fissioning of uranium.
That was a really great discovery, which then led to speculation about the possibility of a chain reaction. It made a big stir in the newspapers for a time, and it was an exciting story, at least for a kid like me.
But then it all just … disappeared. Not another word about it. There was speculation that fission might have some strategic importance, and so it was declared secret, at least in America. And one really heard nothing more of it, in the several years that followed. The story went subsurface. It just went nowhere.
Drollette: But you had a general kind of sense?
Glauber: Well, I don’t know if I’d say that, but that was what had been going on in the background. All I knew for sure was that we were at war, I was in college, I’d registered for the draft, and I was expecting to be going directly into the armed forces….
But suddenly other things began to happen … and happen quite rapidly. It all started quite soon after I filled out this questionnaire that had arrived from Washington, from an organization which has almost never been heard of before or since, called the “National Roster of Scientific Personnel.”[6] It was intended to put people who were trained and with the right skills into the right places—and there was a great shortage of people who were well-trained.
While filling out that questionnaire I wrote down that I had taken all these courses, which were almost all things that one takes much later, in graduate school. So, to make a long story short, they came and got me—I received instructions to leave Harvard as soon as one could leave that school term and get a ticket for the first train to Chicago.
Drollette: But weren’t you only in your first year of college?
Glauber: Well, you have to understand that by ’43, they were tired of drafting older men—particularly those with families. They wanted young guys for the military. And it all makes sense, given my personal history: I had skipped some grades in high school—which was much more common back then, when they really pushed people forward academically, regardless if they were really mature enough—and I’d been involved in all kinds of science projects, and a high school teacher had given me some books on calculus. Which all meant that I got a little ahead.
And then after I did get into college, all the professors started leaving to go work in the war effort, and the college administration announced that this would be the last chance for many of us to take some of the more advanced courses for the duration of the war. So, the whole education business was kind of telescoped for us—meaning that I had all these graduate-level classes on my school record.
Drollette: What happened next?
Glauber: It was very secretive; they would not say where one was going after Chicago. After I got there, I had to make a phone call to someone at some agency, who gave me another train ticket that turned out to go to a place in New Mexico I’d never heard of, called Lamy—not much more than a wooden boardwalk for a station. And it was there that I was supposed to get off, and someone would meet me. Meanwhile, any personal belongings I wanted to ship out—books and clothing—would go to a post office box. I still remember the address: Post Office Box 1663, Santa Fe, New Mexico.
Well, I had never been west of Chicago. So that alone was quite an exciting business for me, riding on the Santa Fe Railroad, seeing bona fide cowboys, and watching people who were bronze in color and wearing furs and blankets get on the train.
When I got to Lamy, I was met by a tall, slender fellow who to all intents looked like a cowboy: He literally had a 10-gallon hat and wore a checked yellow shirt and dungarees. And this cowboy picked up not only me from the train but a short man with a derby hat and a navy-blue overcoat who also got off at that same stop—whom I later found out was John von Neumann.[7]
The most remarkable thing was the geography. I’d never seen anything quite like that before; mesas and gulches and mountains, with narrow roads dug into the sides of canyon walls…
And this chap, this cowboy figure I’ve described to you, was a mathematician that previously worked with Neumann, and they started talking about what was going on in “the research up on ‘the Hill.’ ”
They had to resort to this way of talking, because they felt that was what one had to do in order to preserve the lab’s secrets—they didn’t know my state of clearance at all. So they described in terms appropriate to them the terrible things that were going on in a particular computation. It was not in the real world, but they were describing it as if it were the real world.
The fact that matter was being annihilated was to them a simple description of a mathematical mistake, while to me it was a description of the most incredible feats going on in the real world. So it was a very unusual sort of introduction to this kind of life.
Drollette: What were your first impressions?
Glauber: Well, I mentioned the geography: all canyons and plateaus. Los Alamos was placed in a virtually impassable area, miles from the nearest town. At the stage that I got there, there were still some log houses remaining from what had formerly been the Los Alamos Ranch School for Boys—a tuberculosis sanatorium—and the beginnings of more new structures. They had started putting up dormitories and some small apartment buildings a few months earlier, but none of them had space for more than four apartments with small families.
And there were quite a few small families, and many families that got appreciably larger. It had one of the busiest maternity hospitals, I think, that were run anywhere by the US Army. (Laughter.)
You have to understand that these were all young people; the older people didn’t want to go to this godforsaken location.
Drollette: What was the very first day of work like at the Manhattan Project?
Glauber: The first morning I was there, I was given a list of people to march around and meet. It was as if they had to compete for new personnel—to speak up and say “I want the new guy.”
Out of them all, I best remember an interview with Robert F. Bacher, who was head of the physics division.[8]
On meeting me for the first time, Bacher said: “I bet you’re interested in what we’re working on here.” And I said I didn’t know.
So he said: “What’s your best guess? What do you think we’re working on?” He was asking me—an 18-year-old!
So I told him that “Judging from the treatment that the story had been given by the newspapers earlier, you’re probably trying to create a chain reaction based on fission.”
He said: “Well, that’s a very erudite guess. But I have to tell you, we succeeded in doing that a year-and-a-half ago”—he was describing the fact that they had indeed gotten a reaction to occur in Chicago, although that had nothing to do with Los Alamos.
And he added: “I have to tell you, however, that we are indeed working on a chain reaction here, it just happens to be a fast chain reaction, not a slow one.” And he then went on to explain that it was a bomb.
I was really quite upset by that—the notion that this was not going to be so much about a gift to mankind, but a weapon.
And it did take some weeks and months to overcome that feeling … and to discover that there were really interesting mathematical problems involved in making this bomb. And those really did keep me busy for the next two years.
So anyway, that’s how I learned what the story was.
Drollette: Was there any kind of orientation?
Glauber: There was something called the Primer, which you had to go and read—a sort of text for beginners. It was available in the library, and you had to sign out a copy, where you could learn of all of the speculations about the bomb that had been voiced in the months earlier.[9]
Drollette: Were you at the Trinity Test?
Glauber: Well, how to put this… I saw it. (Laughs.)
They didn’t want us to fear its presence, so it was okay to view it from a distance.
But I had no authorization, if that’s what you mean. Just as important, there was also a considerable shortage of transportation. Very few people had cars at Los Alamos, and gasoline rationing meant you couldn’t go very far, anyway.
Luckily, I did get a lift to a mountain near Albuquerque, to the only place where a road goes to a really high altitude at that area, called Sandia Peak… I think there may have been 20 or 30 people altogether who went to the top of Sandia to try to see that test.[10]
Unfortunately, we had no radio contact with the people running the Trinity Test, which was on a plain almost due south of Albuquerque. Now, we knew the test was supposed to be a couple of hours after midnight. But there was, in fact, a lightning storm at that time so it was delayed. I don’t know if lightning was striking right there at that testing spot—but frankly, it would have been very scary to be anywhere near there, because the bomb was held in a 100-foot-tall steel tower. And the lightning striking around there would have had a considerable chance of striking that tower.
Anyway, after a while, we saw some flashes, little flashes—which would have been considerable disappointments.
So by 5:30 in the morning, nearly everyone had left, because you got tired of just sitting there with no indication of when it was going to happen.
But I was a little more stubborn. The others had left, but I was sitting there facing in that direction when at 5:30 in the morning, it was as if the sun was rising from the south.
Drollette: So you saw it?
Glauber: I saw it. (Pause.)
Drollette: That must have been some experience.
Glauber: Yes. (Pause.)
Drollette: What was Oppenheimer like?
Glauber: He was a remarkable choice. Oppenheimer was an ultra-intellectual American, and he loved to express himself in poetic images and phrases. When he was in college—I think it took him only three years to go through Harvard—he developed the knack of reading Sanskrit and a passion for Indic poetry. Now, I can’t begin to tell you how deep or how accurate his knowledge was of these areas—none of us could. There was no one else at Los Alamos who knew about this sort of thing.
But he had studied it, and he used those phrases often. Oppenheimer used them particularly to describe the unearthly things that one saw in a nuclear explosion. He had a passionate involvement with expressing himself in literary language. He did not speak the ordinary language of New York, which many of us did.[11]
Drollette: You’re referring to his comment “I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”?
Glauber: Exactly, exactly.
So he was very different. He did not sound like a typical American leader at all. Yet somehow all of us respected that—and even admired that. He was about as opposite an individual as you could imagine from General Groves [the head of the military side of operations at Los Alamos].[12] They were like two polar opposites.
But they often appeared together in public—the leader of the science side and the leader of the military part. They were very careful that at important, strategic times, they would both appear together. There was something really symbolic about that, and you’ll notice it in many of the photographs.
Drollette: Let’s see if I can call it up on the screen—okay, here’s the ID badge photo of Oppenheimer.
It’s not very good, more like the picture you have on your driver’s license. But even in the security picture, I get a sense of him as being sort of otherworldly.
Glauber: That’s a good word. He acted otherworldly, a little. Women found him somewhat strange.
I knew one woman he had gone with before he married, and she thought that he behaved very strangely. She described how one time they had driven up to some place or other above Berkeley. He had left her sitting in the car and went off on some kind of solitary walk by himself one night, leaving her. (Laughs.)
There were many such stories about him. He was a rather different sort of person. He had already had some difficulties.
He was rather—how should I say it—an aesthete.
And in Britain, he had a rather difficult time: He tried joining an experimental group, and there was some sort of serious trouble.[13] I can’t remember what the trouble was, but it was really quite serious. He left Britain and went to Germany. And there, he began working under [renowned theoretical physicist] Max Born and decided that he was a theorist, not an experimenter. He would never have been a decent experimenter, he was altogether too nervous. He never stopped smoking, he always had a cigarette in his mouth. He was a very nervous, tense man.
But he expressed himself quite beautifully. And the scientists really seemed to respect that. He never had any serious trouble with the scientists; no insurrection or disagreements.
Drollette: Was he soft-spoken?
Glauber: He was, yes.
And the remarkable thing, which you’ll catch in my own photos when I show them tomorrow, is that as a theorist, Oppie went around and visited all the experimental sites. He involved himself with the experimenters as much as possible—even though he never touched experiments and never went near the performance of experiments himself, after his bad experience in Britain.
Drollette: Is there something that makes theoretical physicists different from experimental physicists? They just seem to be a different group.
Glauber: Well, they are, they really are. First of all, many of them are physically clumsy.
You put them in the laboratory and the glassware starts breaking. (Laughter.)
Although that isn’t true of all of them, of course.
And I’ve got to say that when I was a kid, I myself thought that I was going to be an experimenter—and then mathematics moved me away. I felt later that that was a mistake, and that I should have become an experimenter. But it was too late.
Drollette: What did Oppie do that made Los Alamos so extraordinary?
Glauber: Well, he was extraordinary. He was a man of really considerable insight. The curious thing is how few things he actually did himself; there is next to nothing known by Oppenheimer’s name. But he understood it all and described it very well—and made quite a contribution that way.
Drollette: So he was a good manager, he understood the people he was dealing with?
Glauber: Well, you never would have thought that; he had had zero experience as a manager. And putting him in charge was the most imaginative thing that General Groves ever did.
He was rather an aloof person, and not easy to get to know.
But on the other hand, Oppie somehow created an atmosphere at Los Alamos that was unique, where everyone was working together on a mission. Consequently, even if you were a student, you could talk to a famous physicist.
All the physicists who were there were very accessible, and very involved. The only exception that comes to mind is Edward Teller.
Drollette: What was Teller’s role?
Glauber: Teller was one of the early theorists about chain reactions. And he had worked on why the stars shine—the thermonuclear reactions which go on in stars. He was known for that sort of thing.
But Teller was also a very impatient man, and very outspoken.
And I must say, when I got to Los Alamos, he was absent. There was an office next to mine which had the name “Teller” on the door, but there was no Edward Teller. He had determined in late 1943 that he had not been given the important positions that he wanted, and he had left in a huff. He left for something over a month, and then came back.
He was a big noise.
But Oppenheimer welcomed him back and gave him a division all his own, that would deal with what was called the “Super”—and the Super turned out to be the only passion that Teller truly had.
Drollette: What was the Super?
Glauber: That was the idea that one could use the fission reaction from the atomic bomb as a sort of match to ignite the kind of enormous continuous release of energy that occurs in a thermonuclear reaction—the kind that the stars burn. So, Teller’s notion was that you would use the fission bomb to ignite a thermonuclear reaction, which would release unlimited amounts of energy. And eventually, by 1954, that was what happened.
Drollette: So Teller was the man behind the H-bomb.
Glauber: Well, he tried hard to be the man behind the H-bomb. When the war was over and a great many people began leaving Los Alamos, Teller was the one person who would not leave. Teller felt his mission was still to start the thermonuclear reaction—and he had no success at it.
And that failure to discover how to ignite that reaction continued on through 1949, which was the point at which the Russians tested their first fission bomb.
So, immediately there was pressure on President Truman to get the Super project regenerated, in order for the United States to have the hydrogen bomb—an order of magnitude of destructive power above what we had been working on during the war.
And I must say that the hydrogen bomb has never done anybody any good. It does exist, and it is an enormous threat, but it has accomplished nothing in constructive terms.
Nothing for science.
Nothing for anybody.
Nothing for security.

[2] As Oppenheimers’ deputy, McKibbin was the all-purpose administrator of the Manhattan Project, on-call 24 hours per day, and often the first person that new arrivals met. She issued passes so newcomers could get on the grounds, arranged housing and transportation—and sometimes kept an eye on secret papers. According to an account in Gatekeeper to Los Alamos, she would burn all the papers she produced at the end of each work day. She also helped make the arrangements for many of the staff’s weddings—several of which were conducted in her home.
[3] In 1985, this Nobel Prize-winning mathematician and physicist released a lighthearted book, Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!

[6] To this day, information about the roster is limited. But some information can be found in the February 1944 edition of The Scientific Monthly, published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
[7] John von Neumann was a mathematician who went on to pioneer many of the basic principles of modern computer science, as well as make major contributions to quantum mechanics. According to the book The Pentagon’s Brain: An Uncensored History of DARPA, von Neumann also played a vital role in developing and promoting the concept of “mutual assured destruction” which underpinned much of the strategy of the Cold War. In 1999, von Neumann was to be named “Person of the Century” by the Financial Times.
[8] Bacher, a nuclear physicist, later became head of what was called the “Gadget Division” at Los Alamos, responsible for designing everything about the atomic bomb except the explosive lenses.
[9] What became known as the “Los Alamos Primer” was developed by physicist Robert Serber in April 1943 to help newcomers get up to speed. In the words of a subsequent retrospective in the September 2017 issue of Physics Today: “…the Primer is an extraordinary document. Perusing it gives one a sense of being there at the start of the Los Alamos project. In its 24 pages, Serber both adroitly summarized the state of existing knowledge and laid out a prescient road map for the work ahead and the challenges that might arise.”
[10] As the crow flies, the site of the atomic bomb test—now known as the Trinity Site—was in the desert roughly 150 miles due south of the Los Alamos lab where the work was done. Sandia Peak was more than 50 miles closer to the test site, and the informal viewing platform at Sandia Peak was more than half-a-mile higher than the elevation at Los Alamos.
[11] Many of the researchers literally spoke with a New York City accent—appropriately enough, for something code-named the “Manhattan Project.” A large number had even attended the same, tuition-free, public, STEM-oriented magnet schools in the five boroughs of New York—particularly the Bronx High School of Science, founded just five years earlier. The Wikipedia entry for “Bronx Science” says that “With eight Nobel Prize-winning alumni, seven in physics and one in chemistry, it has produced the most Nobel laureates in science of any secondary school in the world.” Glauber himself was born in New York City, and was in the first class to graduate from Bronx Science.
[12] The Atomic Archives describe Gen. Leslie R. Groves as a “practical-minded military man, brusque and goal oriented… Groves demanded that the Manhattan Project scientists spend all their time on the bomb and resist the temptation, harmless enough in peacetime, to follow lines of research that had no direct applicability to immediate problems.”
His former aide, Col. Kenneth D. Nichols, was less diplomatic, describing his old boss as “the biggest S.O.B. I have ever worked for. He is most demanding. He is most critical. He is always a driver, never a praiser. He is abrasive and sarcastic.” Nichols also said, however, that if he were in charge, he would “pick General Groves to head [the military side of] the Manhattan Project” because of his unquestioned ability, according to the autobiography that Nichols later wrote, titled The Road to Trinity: A Personal Account of How America’s Nuclear Policies Were Made.
[13] The Oppenheimer biography American Prometheus describes his bouts of depression at this time, including an incident involving conflicts with authority figures and a “poisoned” apple that caused Oppenheimer to be put on probation by the University of Cambridge and see a psychiatrist. The next semester, he transferred to the University of Göttingen in Germany, then a hotbed for the developing field of modern physics.

,"""Oppenheimer"" 70mm film reels are 600 pounds — and reach IMAX's ""outer limit"" due to the movie's 3-hour runtime","""Oppenheimer"" is set to run in 30 IMAX theaters when it premiers, and director Christopher Nolan recommends seeing it in that format.","Director Christopher Nolan recently revealed ""Oppenheimer"" is his longest film yet. Now, we know just how long the film is — literally. The movie is set to run in 30 IMAX theaters, and the reel of 70mm film is a whopping 11 miles long, Nolan told The Associated Press. It also weighs 600 pounds.
""Oppenheimer"" will premiere Friday worldwide and be shown on standard screens as well as in IMAX. But Nolan said he recommends seeing the film at an IMAX theater. Before digital recording became the norm, movies were usually recorded on 35mm film. IMAX movies printed on 70mm film, however, have a wider and taller aspect ratio and are projected onto a larger screen.
In a May interview with Total Film, Nolan said it was his longest movie yet, revealing it was ""kissing three hours,"" which is slightly longer than his 2014 movie ""Interstellar,"" which runs about 2 hours and 47 minutes.
Previously, IMAX platters — which hold the large reels of film being projected — could only hold enough film for a 150-minute runtime, Nolan told Collider's Steve Weintraub earlier this month. When he made ""Interstellar,"" the director asked IMAX if they could make the platters wider to accommodate the longer film.
Nolan said he had to go back to IMAX again when he was creating ""Oppenheimer.""
""I went to them and I said, 'Okay, I've got a 180-page script. That's a three-hour movie on the nose. Can it be done?' We looked at it, they looked at the platters, and they came to the conclusion that it could just be done,"" he said. ""They're telling me this is the absolute limit because now the arm that holds the platter went right up against it. So, this, I think, is finally the outer limit of running time for an IMAX film print.""
Sequences of ""Oppenheimer"" were shot with an IMAX camera so some scenes will be able to expand to fit the wider IMAX screen, according to the movie theater company. Nolan employed a similar tactic of shooting some scenes in IMAX and others in a different format with his previous film ""The Dark Knight.""
The movie is about J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the ""father of the atomic bomb,"" and parts of it are in black and white. Because of that, the first black and white IMAX film stock was created by Kodak and Fotokem, according to the AP.
""We shot a lot of our hair and makeup tests using black and white. And then we would go to the IMAX film projector at CityWalk [Theater] and project it there,"" Nolan told the AP. ""I've just never seen anything like it. To see such a massive black-and-white film image? It's just a wonderful thing.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItcnVudGltZS1pbWF4LWZpbG0tbGVuZ3RoLXdlaWdodC_SAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1ydW50aW1lLWltYXgtZmlsbS1sZW5ndGgtd2VpZ2h0Lw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 14:41:00+00:00,I Want an Alden Ehrenreich and Adam Driver Buddy Comedy,"Driver is ""my son, technically"" in Star Wars, the actor reminds Esquire.","This interview was conducted prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike.
Alden Ehrenreich has a hell of a lot of funny stories. Ehrenreich was discovered by Steven Spielberg at a friend's bat mitzvah, he did three months of extensive lasso training for Hail, Caesar!, and he knows how to survive a bear attack (even if said bear is on cocaine and made of CGI). But according to the Oppenheimer star, one of his greatest loves is improv comedy.
In the latest episode of ""Explain This,"" Ehrenreich jokes with Esquire about a Star Wars fan wanting to see him and Adam Driver in a comedy together. For context: while many Star Wars actors do get to share the screen together, Ehrenreich played a younger version of Han Solo is his own spinoff prequel, Solo. Responding to a fan who wrote on Twitter that they would love to see Ehrenreich and Driver in a buddy comedy together, the actor hilariously brought up that Driver is ""my son, technically"" in Star Wars canon. ""So, maybe like one of these Bad Grandpa things that [Robert] De Niro does with these young guys,"" Ehrenreich quips.
The actor also poked fun at his role in Oppenheimer—which is in theaters now—describing it as, ""a senate aid who is overseeing Robert Downey Jr.'s character's senate confirmation hearing."" It's a three-hour-long drama, folks! ""That's really gonna get people into the theaters,"" he says with a laugh. ""That sentence."" Oppenheimer has a large cast, but Ehrenreich says that he plays, ""probably the only character in the entire film—which has a thousand million people in it—who isn't an actual historical figure.""
Well, hopefully Ehrenreich will soon star in what sounds like the opposite of Oppenheimer: a Star Wars-themed, Bad Grandpa-esque film... opposite Adam Driver.

2023-07-14 19:36:05+00:00,Who was J. Robert Oppenheimer? Biographer Kai Bird delves into the physicist's fascinating life and legacy,"Kai Bird, co-author of ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer"" opens up on the physicist's life and legacy.","With a single tremendous flash across the New Mexico desert, J. Robert Oppenheimer — the director of the Manhattan Project that developed the world's first atomic bomb — became the most famous scientist of his generation.
The piercing light, dimming to reveal a terrible fireball growing in the sky above the July 1945 Los Alamos test site, heralded the dawn of the atomic age. A physicist, polymath and mystic, Oppenheimer recalled greeting the mushroom cloud with a line from the Hindu scripture the Bhagavad Gita that he had taught himself Sanskrit to read: ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.""
The creation of the atomic bombs and their subsequent devastation of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki brought an end to World War II, beginning a new era and transforming Oppenheimer into a historical icon. Yet his remorse for what he built and his opposition to its further development drove him into conflict with the U.S. military, and the government revoked his security clearance due to his communist sympathies. Oppenheimer ultimately died a broken man.
Ahead of the July 21 release of Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer,"" Live Science sat down with historian Kai Bird, Oppenheimer's biographer and co-author of ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer"" (Knopf, 2005), the Pulitzer Prize-winning book that inspired the film.
We discussed Oppenheimer's rise and fall, his development of the bomb, and the way he altered human history forever.

Live Science: The Manhattan Project was an immense effort. It took thousands of scientists working tirelessly throughout the war — spending the modern-day equivalent of $24 billion — before it was completed. How instrumental was Oppenheimer in the construction of the bomb? What was his motivation for building it?
Bird: Well, he became the director of the scientific lab for the Manhattan Project, and it was his notion to have the main lab and build the bomb in Los Alamos. He built the gadget in two and a half years, and everyone who worked on it that we interviewed all said that it would never have happened if Oppenheimer had not been the director. He inspired people to work hard and to figure out, in a timely fashion, all the various engineering problems associated with building the bomb.
As for his motivation, it was quite clear. As a young man, he studied quantum physics in Germany under Max Born. While there, he'd attended lectures by [Werner] Heisenberg — the famous German theorist of quantum mechanics' uncertainty principle — and he knew that Heisenberg and other German scientists were just as capable as he was of understanding the physics of the atomic bomb and the potential for a weapon of mass destruction, and he feared that by 1942, the Germans were probably 18 months ahead in the race to build this weapon.
Politically, he was a man of the left. He feared fascism and feared that the German scientists were going to hand this weapon of mass destruction to Hitler, who would use it to win the war. That was his worst nightmare.
Live Science: Yet by the time they had built and successfully tested the bomb, his motives had become muddied. You write that he was anxiously puffing his pipe, repeatedly referring to Hiroshima's citizens as ""those poor little people."" Yet that same week, he was giving the military precise instructions on how to make the bomb explode over them with maximum efficiency.
Bird: I'm glad you picked up on that. It's a really incisive anecdote that gives you a sense of the man, his complexity and his ambivalence about what he was doing.
By the spring of 1945, all the Los Alamos scientists working so hard to build this gadget knew that the war in Europe was over. So why were they doing it? They actually had a meeting to discuss this difficult political issue. Oppenheimer attended — he stood at the back of the room, listened to the arguments and then stepped forward to quote Niels Bohr .
Bohr had arrived in Los Alamos on the last day of 1943. He greeted Oppenheimer with, ""Robert, is it really big enough?"" He wanted to know if the gadget was going to be big enough to end all war.
Oppenheimer made this argument to his ambivalent scientists in Los Alamos. He told them that this weapon is known now, there are no secrets behind the physics, and the power and awfulness of this weapon needs to be demonstrated in this war. Otherwise, the next war is going to be fought by nuclear-armed adversaries, and it will end in Armageddon. That was the argument. It was an interesting argument. It was also a rationalization.

Live Science: After the war, Oppenheimer became nuclear weapons' most vocal critic — resisting efforts to make a more powerful hydrogen bomb and referring to the Air Force's plans for massive strategic bombing with nuclear weapons as genocidal. What caused this reversal, and how did the military and intelligence establishments react?
Bird: This is what leads to his downfall. Because very soon after Hiroshima, we know from the letters that Kitty, his wife, wrote to friends that Oppenheimer had plunged into a deep period of depression; he became extremely morose.
Then he went back to Washington, and he learned more about how close the Japanese were to surrendering in September 1945. And he also learned more about the attitude of those in Washington and of the Truman administration to this new weapon — i.e., they want to build more of them and make U.S. national security entirely dependent on a huge arsenal of these weapons.
Oppenheimer thinks this is a mistake. As early as October 1945, he gave a public speech in Philadelphia in which he said that these weapons were weapons for aggressors. They are weapons of terror, they are not weapons for defense and the U.S. needs to find a way to construct an international control mechanism to prevent their proliferation.
He was coming out against the notion that we should rely on these weapons for our defense. And that was a direct threat to the War Department, the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, who all wanted bigger budgets to acquire more of these weapons.
So Oppenheimer became a threat. And this was precisely what led, in late 1953, to the first steps to strip him of his security clearance, put him on trial in a kangaroo court setting and publicly humiliate him.

Live Science: Some of the people who knew Oppenheimer felt he was — in the words of his fellow physicist and friend Isidor Rabi — someone who ""never got to be an integrated personality."" And Einstein referred to him using the Yiddish word ""narr"": fool. What were they getting at with these remarks?
Bird: Oppenheimer was a polymath and somewhat of a mystic, and he was attracted to Hindu mysticism, which Rabi thought was a sign of a less-than-integrated personality. But I do think Rabi was onto something. And Einstein too.
Before his trial in 1954, Oppenheimer visits Einstein to explain that he's about to go down to Washington. He tells him he'll be absent from the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton [where Oppenheimer served as director from 1947 to 1966] for some weeks because he's going to be put on trial in this security hearing.
And Einstein turns to him and says something along the lines of, ""But, Robert, why are you bothering if they don't want you and your advice anymore? You're Mr. Atomic; just walk away."" Oppenheimer replies with, ""Oh, you don't understand, Albert. I need to use my status and my platform to influence Washington policymakers and give them my advice. They don't understand this technology, and I need to use my celebrity for a good purpose.""

In fact, Oppenheimer was fighting the security hearing precisely because he wanted to be a player. He wanted to be inside the establishment. He wanted to walk the halls of power in Washington and to have meetings with the president in the Oval Office. He was attracted to all of that, and he found it difficult to walk away from. So after Oppenheimer leaves the room, Einstein turns to his secretary and says, ""There goes a narr.""
And yes, he was being foolish and naive, politically. He had no idea what he was about to walk into. The security hearing in Washington was all rigged against him. He'd made really powerful political enemies in Washington, and he was going to be destroyed. Einstein was right to call him a narr.

Live Science: Oppenheimer's legacy is tied to a terrifying weapon that we have avoided using in war again. Let's say we skip 100 years or so into the future. How do you think people will remember him?
Bird: That depends on what happens and how well we live with the bomb. Say that in the next few years or decades there's another nuclear war. Oppenheimer is going to be seen as the scientist who is responsible for that, too.
The incredible thing is, we will still be talking about him in 100 years. Human beings are increasingly drenched in science and technology. We're now going to be grappling with artificial intelligence . You would think that we would be turning to scientists and technology experts to ask the right questions about how to integrate all the science into our daily lives without destroying our humanity.
And yet, many people seem to have an innate distrust of scientists and expertise. I trace some of that back to the roots of Oppenheimer's public humiliation in 1954. It sent a message to scientists everywhere: Do not get out of your narrow lane, do not become a public intellectual and do not speak out about politics or policy.
But, unfortunately, that's precisely what we need. We need more Oppenheimers who are willing to speak the hard truths about how to integrate science and make it so that it's not destructive but an empathetic part of our human existence.

2023-07-23 17:00:00+00:00,Kitty Oppenheimer Really Did Stand Up for Her Husband at His Security Hearings,"She was also a botanist, former member of the Communist Party, and, eventually, a yacht captain.","J. Robert Oppenheimer is the tortured genius at the center of Christopher Nolan’s latest film, but the people in his orbit also come into focus. One of them is his wife, Katherine, who remained by his side through his time directing the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos and the brutal security hearings that critiqued his communist associations and past work. Played by Emily Blunt in Oppenheimer opposite Cillian Murphy, “Kitty” was also interested in the sciences, was involved with the Communist Party, and was one her husband’s staunchest defenders. Here’s what else to know.
She was a botanist.
Kitty was born Katherine Puening in Germany and grew up in Pittsburgh. The daughter of an engineer, she had a privileged upbringing in a wealthy suburb. (And was even believed to be distantly related to royalty.)
She also had quite an eclectic educational background, attending the University of Pittsburgh, University of Munich, Sorbonne University, University of Grenoble, and, later, the University of Pennsylvania, where she earned her degree with honors in botany. She also pursued graduate studies at UCLA, according to Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer (the source material for Nolan’s film).
Kitty’s interest in botany continued later in life, as she kept a garden in Princeton, New Jersey, where she lived, according to her New York Times obituary.

She met Oppenheimer after a few failed marriages.
Oppenheimer saw a number of women after his relationship with Jean Tatlock died down, but he met Kitty in 1939 at a garden party in Pasadena, according to American Prometheus. She was just about to start her graduate studies at UCLA.
By then, Kitty had already technically been married three times. The first was to musician Frank Ramseyer, whom she met in Paris. Their union was annulled only a few months later, and she rarely acknowledged this as her first marriage. The second was to Joseph Dallet, a communist organizer, who died in 1937 fighting for the Spanish Civil War. The third was to doctor Richard Harrison, whom she divorced to marry Oppenheimer in 1940.
When she and Oppenheimer started dating months after their first meeting, she was still married to Harrison. In 1940, Oppenheimer even invited the couple up to spend the summer at his ranch in Perro Caliente with his friends. Only Kitty could attend, and she stayed two months. At the end of the summer, she was pregnant, and it was Oppenheimer who broke the news to Kitty’s husband. They agreed that Harrison would divorce her so Oppenheimer could remarry her. “It was all very civilized,” Bird and Sherwin wrote. The new couple married in Virginia City, Nevada the day Kitty’s divorce was finalized. They lived in Pasadena, California before moving to Los Alamos in New Mexico, where Oppenheimer worked on the Manhattan Project.

Kitty still studied throughout her pregnancy and kept her ambitions of becoming a botanist. But she was a bit overwhelmed by motherhood. In 1941, after welcoming their firstborn, Peter, Oppenheimer asked Haakon Chevalier and his wife, who were close friends, to take care of the boy while he and Kitty spent time away. They stayed at Perro Caliente for two months, often riding horses, as depicted in the film.
During their time at Los Alamos, Kitty didn’t want to be restricted to a traditional wife role. She worked part-time as a lab technician under Dr. Hempelmann, who studied the health hazards of radiation, but quit after a year. She still had her own career ambitions and “felt increasingly trapped” and “stymied professionally,” Bird and Sherwin wrote. Living in the isolated Los Alamos didn’t help. She felt similarly years later at Princeton, where her husband was director of the Institute for Advanced Study. There, Kitty felt pressured to “play the role of ‘director’s wife’” and “was like a tigress caged,” report Bird and Sherwin. On December 7, 1944, she welcomed their second child, a daughter named Katherine, in Los Alamos.
Kitty was intelligent, but known to have a sharp tongue. However, she and her husband leaned on each other. “Her career was advancing Robert’s career, which was the overwhelming, controlling influence on her from then on,” Oppenheimer’s collaborator and friend Robert Serber said, per American Prometheus. Verna Hobson, Kitty’s friend and Oppenheimer’s former secretary, also said in the book, “She was Robert’s greatest confidante and advisor. He told her everything. … He leaned on her tremendously.”

She struggled with alcoholism.
Bird and Sherwin report that Kitty “had a fair share of martinis” at Los Alamos, but, by the time she and Robert moved to Princeton, her drinking worsened. Hobson recalled, “She would get drunk sometimes to the point of falling down and not making much sense. Sometimes she passed out. But so many times I have seen her pull herself together when you didn’t believe she possibly could.”
On the contrary, Serber insisted years later that Kitty’s drunken appearance was the result of her taking strong sedatives for her pancreatitis. He said she “never drank excessively for a normal person.” Friends of the couple noticed that Oppenheimer was passive about Kitty’s drinking.
She was questioned about her communist background, but firmly stood her ground.
Kitty Oppenheimer was introduced to communism through her previous husband Joseph Dallet. At first, she was only allowed to join the Young Communist League, a membership she earned after handing out copies of the Daily Worker, according to American Prometheus. She paid dues and met other members of the party through Dallet. She went on to serve as the party’s “literary agent” in 1935. She even attended a protest in Paris of the West’s neutrality to the Spanish Civil War.
These activities would later come back to haunt her and her husband, especially in the ’50s, during his security hearing by the United States Atomic Energy Commission. In one of the most gripping scenes of Oppenheimer, Kitty (played fiercely by Blunt) puts on a remarkable show, facing her interrogators with great tenacity, when she’s called in as a witness. Turns out, that’s not too different from how her real-life testimonies went down. Many of her lines in those scenes were taken right from the transcript of the hearings.
Despite being nervous, as Kitty later revealed to a friend, she appeared composed and unflappable. Bird and Sherwin write, “She acquitted herself easily, coolly and precisely answering each question.” And she appeared “forthright and unflustered,” probably a result of her parents teaching her strict discipline as a child.
When asked about the distinction between members of the Communist Party of America and the Communist Soviet Union, Kitty said, per a transcript: “There are two answers to that as far as I’m concerned. In the days that I was a member of the Communist Party and our country had its Communist Party. I thought that the Communist Party of the United States was concerned with problems internal. I now no longer believe this. I believe the whole thing is linked together and spread all over the world.”
When she was called in again, Kitty reiterated that she had left the party and continued to stand up for her husband. “Kitty did not give an inch,” Bird and Sherwin wrote. “Not even [Roger] Robb [the attorney cross-examining at the hearing] could touch her. Calm and yet alert to every nuance, she was undoubtedly a better witness than the husband she was defending.”

She died in 1978 at the age of 62.
J. Robert Oppenheimer died in 1967 in Princeton, at age 62, after battling throat cancer. His wife spread his ashes at their home at St. John in the Virgin Islands. She later moved in with their longtime friend Robert Serber. Kitty died in 1978, also at age 62, at a hospital in Ancon, Panama following an intestinal infection and embolism in her right arm, per the NYT .
At the time of her death, she was a captain of her yacht, the Moonraker, having just completed a tour of the Caribbean. She and the crew were planning to sail to Japan, passing through the Panama Canal. She was survived by her and Robert’s two children, Peter and Katherine.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvbW92aWVzLXR2L2E0NDYxMzQ0NC9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1raXR0eS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci10cnVlLXN0b3J5LWV4cGxhaW5lZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-28 11:10:30+00:00,Steven Phillips-Horst Reports from the Front Lines of Barbenheimer,"""As day turns to night, the city morphs into Pink Halloween,"" writes Steven Phillips-Horst, on the box office spectacle of Barbenheimer.","Barbie and Oppenheimer came out on the same weekend. The excitement generated over this scheduling coincidence might’ve convinced you it was the first time two movies with different vibes—let’s say, a fun one and a serious one—had ever come out simultaneously. It is not. There was, for example, Mamma Mia and The Dark Knight in 2008. There’s Something About Mary and The Mask of Zorro in 1998. Indecent Proposal and The Sandlot in 1993. None of these double-headers became event viewing, maybe because they didn’t have Barbie’s nuclear, $150 million marketing effort, which in turn buoyed the Twitter-driven memetics of “Barbenheimer.” Or maybe their unwieldy, compound word branding was less piercing. “Indecent Lot” doesn’t sound like an unavoidable juggernaut. Neither does “Mamma Knight,” although “There’s Something about Zorro” would’ve been a good headline when Zorro beat Mary at the box office. “Barbenheimer” is more than sum of its parts: the matronly, German roundness of “Barben” attached to the terrifying, weapon-like “heimer,” evokes, well, a hammer coming down on our attention spans—the monoculture as cudgel.
Movies are dying, we hear, yet despite the writers’ strike, the self-defeating financials of the streaming model, and a pervasive creative bankruptcy that favors superheroes and sequels, Hollywood hoisted itself up by its pink bootstraps and broke box office records without any capes or numbers at the end of its title. Maybe it’s the originality. When Interview asked me to see both films on the same day, I endeavored to test another theory, that our collective enthusiasm for these two mid-century borne American fables is tinged with nostalgia, for an era when the Empire was on the up and up. Are we reenacting some boomer-inherited trauma as we creep into the darkened theater to investigate our Americanness and wear pink to see the doll movie in the shadow of the atom bomb movie?
“I am become Death, destroyer of worlds,” is the Bhagavad Gita quote Oppenheimer himself so self-consciously offered as he looks on, in pride and horror, at his creation. Oppenheimer was a destroyer of worlds, but also of flesh. In Hiroshima, skin melted off bodies. The allied victory gave way to the decadence of post-war America, with its manicured lawns and dishwashers, and what better symbol of its sunny promises than Barbie? Pure consumerist fantasy, plasticine suburban joy. We had to destroy flesh—the real kind—in order to make it anew, this time in plastic. Faker, shinier, happier, pointier. Fantasy, you see, is impossible without the destruction of reality. To test my theory, I will have to see Oppenheimer first.
A trailer implored me to “see it on the biggest screen possible,” though the film is mostly comprised of close-ups of people in conversation. On Fandango, I count at least seven projection options for Oppenheimer on opening day in New York: “70mm,” “50mm,” “Large Format” (which feels like a redundant description of what a movie theater is), “IMAX,” “IMAX 70 mm,” “Regal Premium Experience” (which refers to the seats reclining slightly), and the always humiliating “Standard.” Barbie has no such delineations, because only Oppenehimer is a sacred totem of male pretension that demands worship via technical codex. I opt for “Large Format” because I don’t know what “70mm” means and I’m terrified of disappointment.
At 2 PM on Friday, Regal Union Square is teeming with people. I seem to recall this theater threatening to shut down, but then, so have a range of businesses in the post-pandemic sympathy sweepstakes, only to gin up tearful eulogies that may lead to an infusion of VC funding. I am here to see Oppenhimer, but Barbie is already pushing her weight around. Pink fabric invades the hallways like a dust storm in Los Alamos, girls in pink tank tops, boys in pink polos, girls in pink leggings, some Barbie-branded. I consider that “the color pink” is a pretty easy costume prompt. I, too, am wearing a pink hat, with a graph-paper shirt, to embody the spirits of each film, the girl (pink) and the physicist (graph paper).
The teenage employees are not used to this many customers. A gay concession worker is arguing with someone, who I then realize is a gay I know, also here to see Oppenheimer. The concession gay is in a pink sequin top (I can only assume all employees were encouraged to wear pink but only the gay men obliged), and claiming the stand he is working at is closed, despite the apparent workingness of the popcorn machine spewing kernels and the other customers receiving their tubs of soda.
The “large format” theater is, as expected, regularly sized, filled with mostly under-30-year-olds. One guy holding a small dog and wearing Uggs turns out to be a crazy person, who talks to himself loudly as the movie begins, striking fear into the hearts of cinephiles here to behold Christopher Nolan’s opus in quiet reverence. A few minutes later, he screams “I’m not supposed to be in Oppenheimer!” and loudly exits. The rest of us nod in ascension.
Oppenheimer favors montages, heavy strings, cubist art and lots of cathedrals of higher learning, all of which signal “genius.” Nolan’s or Oppenheimer’s? It is a smart movie for dumb people, and that is a compliment. It is not easy to make so much history and science legible, and the scene, the one big scene for which we needed the biggest screen possible, had my entire body stricken, my heart pounding, my blood vessels in large format. This was a boy movie, and my boyness was riveted. I did laugh, however, at the image of Albert Einstein in a sweatshirt, and at every scene with Emily Blunt’s character, who follows most filmic tropes of Suffering Wife of a Man Who Does History: she is always pregnant or drunk and only those things, constantly pouring nips of alcohol not surreptitiously into coffee mugs but into existing martini glasses already full of alcohol, often at a party or bar where everyone is drinking and it would be just as socially acceptable to simply drink more of the drink you are already holding. The movie ended to some light applause. As the throngs of people filed out, two girls remained, fast asleep, their heads nestled in one another’s shoulders like two perfect half-spheres of plutonium. Hopefully they will wake up in time for Barbie.
I chatted with the friend of my friend who argued with the pink concessionist, who reveals she saw Barbie the previous night and almost wore pink but felt stupid and disrobed. What began as self-actualized revelry—making the bright lie of cinema a momentary physical, bodily truth through costume— became an exercise in mass delusion. She didn’t want to be another brainwashed consumer, man. And which movie got her vote? “I preferred this,” she said, referring to Oppenheinmer.
With a few hours to kill before the main event, I decide to consider the moral quandaries of the Manhattan Project at the fast-casual bowlerie “Dig.” As I enjoy my charred salmon, a girl one table over, whose pink-bowed hair suggests she’s just seen Barbie, starts in with the spoilers: “I liked when they were in Barbieland, but the real world part didn’t work as well.” My theory in action. “That’s because the terror of nuclear war destroyed our conception of the real,” I wanted to say.
As day turns to night, the city morphs into Pink Halloween. A trio films TikTok choreo outside the theater while another girl squad arrives in “Happy Danni Jo’s 25th Birthday” t-shirts. A 25th birthday is not usually a custom merch-level event, but the slumber party appeal of Barbie has clearly proven too irresistible for Danni Jo and her acolytes. I am witnessing the real-time bachelorettification of a supposed paean to feminism which, in retrospect, will make a lot of sense.
I order the Barbie-branded “Pink Icon” (a margarita), and the bartender informs me he has to leave to get more Sour Patch Kids for my cocktail. For months, the Barbie marketing department unleashed its own Manhattan Project on the world, blanketing cities in mushroom clouds of pink, from park benches to Zara purses to Chevy Blazers. The marketing tactics were not as ubiquitous as the discussions about them: can you believe how thorough they are, the devil works hard but Mattel works harder, etc. Universal, the studio behind Oppenheimer, skipped all the bomb-themed activations, because boys don’t have to try so hard, do they? Girls have to put their face on, boys just roll out of bed.
As I wait for the Sour Patch restock, a guy behind me in salmon-hued shorts has an idea. “They should do an Oppenheimer drink,” he chuckles. “A scotch neat and a cigarette.” Everyone is in on the joke. We have been marketed to and it has worked and that is fun because we want to belong. We all dressed in pink because our secular, technologic society lacks ritual. Alienated from community, siloed in our phones, we crave ceremony.
The mood in my theater of unspecified screen format is jovial. The crowd skews younger than Oppenheimer, although I see one dad in a pink polo with his daughter in a pink dress, which is cute. There is a trailer for a Hunger Games prequel, then one for the Willy Wonka prequel, then a superhero movie. I consider that despite the praise for not being a sequel, Barbie is still based on the world’s most famous toy, still a retread of existing intellectual property. Then again, Oppenheimer isn’t exactly original (based on a book, based on a person), and neither was the original Barbie doll (based on a German doll, based on the concept of a woman). Maybe all ideas are leftovers. Shakespeare “cannibalized existing IP” when he did a bio-play of Henry V, we just didn’t say so.
The film begins and Greta Gerwig’s girlboss fantasia washes over the audience like a Dua Lipa track at SoulCycle. We are powerless to resist. Every joke lands. Dua Lipa herself appears in the first five minutes as a mermaid amidst the delirious, cotton candy production design, in case you weren’t sure if you should scream “yas queen!” Most of the writing is a sort of clichéd, self-conscious Twitter-speak—“everyone’s staring at me, yet there’s an undercurrent of violence?” Barbie wonders aloud as she skates through the “real world” of Santa Monica, where all of the men are lecherous. The audience howls. “That’s right!” the woman next to me shouts when Barbie’s grandmother-ghost figure states that “life’s uncomfortable and then you die.” “Yes ma’am!” she cries again when America Ferrera’s character launches into a diatribe that forms the film’s thesis, listing society’s impossible expectations of women like, “be a boss, but don’t be mean” and “be healthy, but not too thin,” and a host of other straightforward guardrails that honestly seem like good advice for anyone.
Barbie seems to love being a girl, or at least being high femme. But her path to feminist realization still leaves her in a full beat and heels. Barbie is a trans allegory in some ways—all gender, no sex. All performance, no biology. The film gets some mileage with jokes about her and Ken lacking genitalia but seems confused about where the male gaze should rest. Here is where Barbie’s fantasy can’t exist without destroying reality first. A performance needs an audience, just like a sleepover needs hairbrush microphones and other weapons of the patriarchy. Gerwig hasn’t figured out how to reconcile the two. It is not just Barbieland that is ersatz, but the feminism therein, where being “president” or being a “doctor” simply means smiling and looking cute in a dress. But, post-Oppenheimer, my cynicism can’t stop me from lapping it up. Life in plastic is pretty fun.
In Oppenheimer, Nolan sands down the title character’s edges—he is a womanizer, but the women only come to him; he is arrogant, but only to others who are also pompous—so the audience can focus on the Big Moral Question. On Wikipedia, I learned the real Oppenheimer collected works of impressionists, a detail that might’ve been interesting to include—a man with earthly desires and classist pretensions, not the monastic figure the movie treats him as. He was also more shrewd about his public persona, an architect of his own mythology; he came up with that Bhagavad Gita quote, after all. Barbie never had such control over her image. Had she been interviewed by Life in 1956, perhaps she, too, could’ve uttered something prophetic, intimating that she was aware of the Pandora’s box of her brilliance, trapping girls in an endless pursuit of clear skinned, pointy-breasted perfection. “I am become Blonde, Destroyer of self-esteem.”
After Barbie, the ad-hoc focus groups forming in the lobby were resoundingly positive: “That was so funny!” Ryan Gosling “stole the whole movie… he ate that!” Besides the irony of claiming a man won the film, the patriarchy didn’t seem too oppressive. On the subway, an old gay guy approached a group of girls awash in pink: “Did you see the movie?! Ooo I’m jealous! I’m Skipper!” he cried, dating himself. I saw Barbies and Kens, dolling themselves up, Kens in Sambas talking about fake IDs, contoured Barbies preening and posing. Everyone trying to impress each other. It was fun, but not much seemed at stake. Maybe we were in Barbieland.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludGVydmlld21hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9maWxtL3N0ZXZlbi1waGlsbGlwcy1ob3JzdC1yZXBvcnRzLWZyb20tdGhlLWZyb250LWxpbmVzLW9mLWJhcmJlbmhlaW1lctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

During an inquest into the actions of J. Robert Oppenheimer by the FBI, the agency investigated the ""father of the atomic bomb"" on suspicion of crimes including espionage and the dissemination of nuclear information to the Soviet Union.
As depicted in Christopher Nolan's summer blockbuster biopic ""Oppenheimer,"" Oppenheimer's behavior came under renewed scrutiny in 1953 after William Borden, a staff director of the congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, sent a letter to the FBI accusing Oppenheimer of being sympathetic to the Communist Party and possibly knowingly employing spies from the Soviet Union on his project developing the atomic bomb.
Borden's letter was most likely sent at the suggestion of Oppenheimer's political nemesis Lewis Strauss, a businessman turned member of the US Atomic Energy Commission.
While Oppenheimer's relationships and loyalties had been investigated prior to receiving his security clearance, efforts to discredit the physicist were redoubled by his rivals after he successfully led his team to create the atomic bomb, and the letter from Borden accelerated a chain of events that led to Oppenheimer losing his security clearance.

The renewed investigation into Oppenheimer's loyalties as his security clearance came up for renewal cited the letter's accusations, Oppenheimer's associations that the US government found suspicious, as well as a wiretap the FBI ordered on his phone — now widely described as illegal — as evidence of his questionable loyalty to the United States.
Documents from the investigation include hundreds of pages of phone records, along with interviews with his colleagues.
Kenneth Pitzer, the dean of UC Berkeley's school of chemistry at the time, told agents in 1952 in an interview regarding the renewal of Oppenheimer's security clearance that his opinion of Oppenheimer had changed over the years — earlier, in 1947, he said he had ""the utmost confidence in both the loyalty and the scientific ability"" of Oppenheimer, according to FBI records.
During the investigation, though, Pitzer said he had new doubts about Oppenheimer's loyalty to the country because of Oppenheimer's initial reservations about the development of the hydrogen bomb, which some believed were an indication that he wanted the Soviet Union to develop the weapon first. Pitzer said Oppenheimer had ""impeded"" other scientists' progress on the bomb after his concerns were overruled.

Another professor, Ward Evans of Loyola University Chicago, said he felt Oppenheimer did not hinder the production of the H-bomb and said he was ""less of a security risk than he was in 1947"" when he was cleared by the Atomic Energy Commission over a separate matter, according to the investigation.
The other main accusation against Oppenheimer was that he might be a security risk over ties to communism. The scrutiny was fueled in part by his relationships with known communists like the psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, with whom Oppenheimer had a romantic relationship.
In FBI reporting, Oppenheimer was also linked to Bernard Peters, a graduate student of his who was at one time a member of the German Communist Party — these ties added to suspicions about Oppenheimer's objections to the H-bomb; critics attributed those objections to a loyalty to the Soviet Union rather than any conscientious objection over the development of the weapon.
The Atomic Heritage Foundation does consider Oppenheimer likely to have held communist sympathies, but it maintains that information in the FBI's report of its investigation was exaggerated. The AHF says it was ""unclear"" whether Oppenheimer ever formally joined the US Communist Party.

At the end of the inquest, despite no definitive proof that Oppenheimer was a Soviet spy or that he had employed spies in his work, Oppenheimer's top-level security clearances were revoked — a devastating blow to the scientist.
In 2022, US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm nullified the decision to revoke Oppenheimer's security clearance, saying in a statement that Oppenheimer had a ""central role"" in World War II and the Department of Energy had a ""responsibility to correct the historical record and honor Dr. Oppenheimer's profound contributions to our national defense and the scientific enterprise at large.""
""As time has passed, more evidence has come to light of the bias and unfairness of the process that Dr. Oppenheimer was subjected to,"" Granholm said in the statement. ""While the evidence of his loyalty and love of country have only been further affirmed.""
The FBI, the Department of Energy, and the Atomic Heritage Foundation didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

2023-07-14 12:31:51-04:00,Cillian Murphy Doesn't Understand Oppenheimer's Physics Either – But He Did Learn Dutch,Cillian Murphy explains what it took to become J. Robert Oppenheimer — including Christopher Nolan's influence.,"Don't ask Oppenheimer's leading man Cillian Murphy to explain the physics — theoretical or otherwise — behind the atomic bomb. He doesn't understand the logistics behind making J. Robert Oppenheimer's potential world-destroyer anymore than the audience. But the 47-year-old Irish actor, who's taking the reins of a Christopher Nolan project for the first time after years of collaboration, is no slouch.
Not only do his co-stars have the highest regard for his work as both an artist and scene partner, but Murphy himself revealed to NBC Insider the level of dedication he gave to the starring role.
RELATED: Why Cillian Murphy Says He's Done Playing Smokers For A While After Oppenheimer
""It was ... six months, and I would have taken more [to prepare],"" Murphy said. ""You kind of just go at it. You break it down and say, 'Alright, we need to work on this today.' I used to set aside, 'I'll work on this for a week and I'll work on that for a week.'
""The Dutch, our [Director of Photography] Hoyte van Hoytema is Dutch so I got him to record the Dutch into my phone,"" he explained. ""And then I slowed it down — you know how you can slow it down on your phone? And then I listened to it for like three [weeks]. I still remember that speech in Dutch, actually.""
Murphy's longtime fans likely aren't surprised by his sheer determination to get the pronunciation down pat. In his best-known roles — as Birmingham gangster Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders or his other Nolan roles such as Batman Begins and Inception in which he's affecting an American accent — Murphy is something of a chameleon. So being able to memorize and spout out a bit of Dutch after listening to the words over and over again couldn't be that much work for his usual level of dedication.

Working on a Nolan set is, he admitted, a big help in getting into character, as well.
""He does make movies on a huge scale. The sets are extraordinary but it never feels like that when you're working in them because it feels very intimate and kind of private,"" he mused. ""There's no video village or monitors, it's just him and his DP and the boom op and the actors. So it's very calm — incredibly calm and it feels very safe just to experiment and try stuff.""
Oppenheimer premieres exclusively in theaters on July 21.

2023-07-14 20:21:36+00:00,"The Story Behind Barbenheimer, the Summer’s Most Online Movie Showdown","Both movies often trend on social media when the other releases a new asset — a trailer, a picture, an interview.","The very online showdown between Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” all started with a date: July 21.
It’s not uncommon for studios to counterprogram films in different genres on a big weekend, but the stark differences between an intense, serious-minded picture about the man who oversaw the development of the atomic bomb and a lighthearted, candy-colored anthropomorphizing of a childhood doll quickly became the stuff of viral fodder.
There’s even some disagreement over whether it’s “Barbieheimer” or “Barbenheimer” or “Boppenheimer” or yet another tortured portmanteau — a phenomenon on which the AP Stylebook has yet to offer guidance, but for the purposes of this article will be “Barbenheimer.”
It didn’t hurt that both Nolan and Gerwig have very passionate and very online fandoms eager to join in. Never mind that many of those fans overlap — the memes, allegiances, and T-shirts were just too fun.
Both movies often trend on social media when the other releases a new asset — a trailer, a picture, an interview. On one level, it’s a marketing department’s dream. Awareness could not be higher, the conversation couldn’t be louder, and neither film even has official reviews out yet.
“'Barbenheimer' is a marketing gift borne out of social media and I think it’s benefiting both films,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for analytics firm Comscore. “You’re certainly aware of both movies in a more profound and compelling way than I think might have otherwise happened had they been released on different weekends.”
AMC Theaters reported that 20,000 of its AMC Stubs members had purchased tickets for a double feature. If you're counting, that's 294 minutes of moviewatching. Even Margot Robbie— Barbie herself — and Tom Cruise, the star of another summer blockbuster, have started plotting the ideal “Barbenheimer” day.
“It’s a perfect double bill,"" said Robbie at her movie's London premiere Wednesday. ""I think actually start your day with ‘Barbie,’ then go straight into ‘Oppenheimer’ and then a ‘Barbie’ chaser.”
Cruise — whose “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” opened a little over a week before the “Barbenheimer” showdown — said at his premiere he'd plan to see both on their opening day, likely starting with “Oppenheimer,” which seems to be the internet's preferred viewing order as well.
“Barbie” actor Issa Rae thinks there's a reason for that.
“I think that there’s a very specific order that if you see them in. If you see ‘Oppenheimer’ last then you might be a bit of a psychopath,” she diagnosed at the London premiere.
The showdown has made armchair marketing experts out of everyone, quick to scrutinize every move by Warner Bros. and Universal — as though it’s possible to compare two extraordinarily different campaigns.
One has infinite opportunities for very pink, sparkly photo opportunities, whimsical brand partnerships for seemingly everything from underwear to pool floats, large-scale fan events with autograph signings and pop stars like Billie Eilish posting about the soundtrack. In other words, the “Barbie” campaign can go nuclear.
“Oppenheimer” has the bomb, the alluring mystery and the big screen hook, but it’s not the kind of movie that lends itself to, say, a frozen yogurt collaboration.
Is the competition real, though, or just a meme? Some in Hollywood wondered if Warner Bros. plopped “Barbie” on the weekend as a slight to Nolan, who had opened many films for the studio in that corridor including “Inception” and “Dunkirk.” He left Warner Bros. amid its controversial decision to send a year’s worth of movies to streaming and made “Oppenheimer” with Universal instead. But a pointed box office war doesn’t exactly make sense for a studio that has talked recently about wanting to lure Nolan back.
There is an unspoken code of conduct: Never badmouth another studio’s film, publicly at least. This is partly decorum, especially when it comes to “box office showdowns” which all will say are a creation of the press and sideline spectators. But it’s also rooted in some truth: The conventional thinking is that having eyes on one movie is good for other movies — you see their posters and trailers and on some level everyone benefits.
And social media has allowed movie stars to get in on the game, too. Following reports that Cruise was irked the latest “Mission: Impossible” was going to lose its IMAX screens to “Oppenheimer” after only a week, Cruise posted photos of himself and director Christopher McQuarrie standing in front of posters for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” holding tickets for each.
“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters. These are just a few that we can’t wait to see on the big screen,” Cruise’s Instagram caption read.
The official accounts for “Indiana Jones,” “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” responded with supportive notes. Gerwig and Robbie even followed with a similar photo series a few days later, which the official “Oppenheimer” Instagram account reposted in its stories. Charged with playing Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy told the AP at his movie's London premiere that “of course” he'd be seeing “Barbie.” The sporting cross-promotion between four studios — Universal, Warner Bros., Disney and Paramount — is something the film business has not quite seen before.
""Not only is Tom Cruise the biggest box office star in the world, but he’s also an incredible ambassador for the movie theater, for the movie theater experience and boosting other movies,"" Dergarabedian said. “And that collegial atmosphere within the framework of what is seen as the very competitive box office derby is kind of a nice thing.”
Still, everyone likes a No. 1 debut, and both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” reportedly carry $100 million production price tags (not including the millions spent on marketing). As far as box office tracking goes, “Barbie” has it in the bag with forecasts showing that it could open above $90 million in North America. “Oppenheimer” meanwhile is tracking in the $40 million range. Then there’s the wild card of “Mission: Impossible 7’s” second weekend, which could snag second place.
Still even with a second- or third-place start, “Oppenheimer” could be destined for a long, steady, profitable run into awards season. Adult audiences for R-rated movies are not often the ones who pack theaters the first weekend.
Back in 2008, in the midst of the recession, Warner Bros. and Universal faced off on the same July weekend with another Nolan film that went up against a lighthearted confection: “The Dark Knight” and “Mamma Mia!” — both of which went on to be enormously profitable (though Nolan did win the first weekend).
The bigger worry is that what's been heralded as Hollywood’s post-pandemic comeback summer has had more ups and downs than anyone might have hoped. That's putting quite a bit of pressure on “Barbenheimer” to overperform and boost the lagging summer box office, which pales in comparison to the bigger issues facing the industry as actors join the writers on strike.
But with just over a week to go, it's still a source of amusement. Even “Barbie” co-star Will Ferrell threw the gauntlet in his winking way at the London premiere.
“I think the world maybe wants to see ‘Barbie’ a little bit more right now,” Ferrell said. ""Just saying!”

2023-07-21 04:00:33+00:00,Emily Blunt: ‘Women are still pressured to be warm and likable. Men are not’,"The star of Christopher Nolan’s nuclear epic Oppenheimer discusses sexism in cinema, her support for the strikes and speaking a secret language with her sister","When Emily Blunt was 13, she was in the chorus of the school play. Then the lead fell ill. Could she learn The Caucasian Chalk Circle overnight? No need! “She was already off-book,” says her sister, Felicity Blunt. “Em had been watching the whole time in rehearsal, not gossiping like everyone else.”
Felicity, 17 months her senior, is a literary agent. When she reads manuscripts, she says: “If I’m thinking: ‘Is it good?’ it’s not good. If it’s great, you can’t stop thinking about it.” Such was the case seeing her little sister smash Brecht in the gym that night. “It was just incredible. She made it look so easy.”
The drama teacher was also floored. “It was very, very impressive,” says Alfred Bradley, now retired, but still in touch with his former pupil. “A really mature performance for one so young.” When the curtain fell, he was mobbed by people asking why he hadn’t cast her in the first place. He should have, he says. Even then, “she had a mission, a focus and a fortitude” rare among adults, let alone children.

He can still picture her “ready, crouching in the wings”, before a crowd scene in Twelfth Night. “Those big, blue eyes incredibly alive to what was going on.” She had just turned 11.
Blunt is now 40 and the biggest British female movie star of her generation: currently pipping Knightley and Mulligan; a natural successor to Weisz and Winslet. You can trace the lineage back further – some Dench deprecation, a little Mirren wither. A very shredded Maggie Smith.
In her new movie, she plays another early starter. Kitty Puening was a botanist and one-time US Communist party campaigner who had four husbands before she was 30, the last of whom was Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called father of the atomic bomb.
Christopher Nolan’s huge and chewy new drama shows how Kitty sustained Robert through his development of the weapon in remotest New Mexico and during a later campaign to smear him for espionage. Yet she was far from your cookie-cutter supportive spouse (sample line: “The brat is down! Where are the martinis?”).
Watch the trailer for Oppenheimer.
“There was something flighty and wild and nonconformist about her,” says Blunt. “It was a time where contortions were happening to women, as they tried to kind of mould themselves into perfect housewives. But Kitty was a terrible mother and she wasn’t a very good housewife – and had no desire to be one.”
Simmering in a pinny was a fate shared by “a lot of women with great minds – that brilliant brain gone to waste at the ironing board. I know so many women of a certain age who are angry at their lives being defined by being someone’s mummy or someone’s wife. And I have empathy for that. It’s OK that that’s not enough for them.”
Blunt is speaking over video, two miles down the road. It is the final day of the Oppenheimer press tour; in fact, it is the final day of press for actors in the Sag-Aftra union for the foreseeable. The air is hectic, the schedule scrambled. The premiere that evening has been moved forward an hour so its cast can walk the red carpet without crossing a picket line.

She is pro-strike: “I am a big believer in unions getting exactly what they want.” She is also pro-resolution: “I’m a huge believer in getting our crews back to work – the people who will suffer most.” For Blunt, the industrial action is also quite well timed. A few weeks ago, she mentioned in a podcast that she was taking a year off to spend with her daughters, Hazel, nine, and Violet, six, and her husband, the actor and film‑maker John Krasinski. Actually, she says, that has been overplayed: “I’m not quitting Hollywood. It’s OK, guys. Just taking a little bit of downtime.”
But she does want to make the most of motherhood before they are teenagers – “I adore babies and children” – a feeling channelled into recent hits such as the Mary Poppins sequel and two Quiet Place thrillers. Kitty, meanwhile, according to Oppenheimer’s biography, “had absolutely no intuitive understanding of children”. There are multiple scenes of her being frosty towards inconsolable tots. Particularly stressful to shoot was one showing the couple driving home with their two-year-old, Peter. The young actor was “distraught, kicking off, screaming, so clingy with his mum, just exhausted. Snot pouring out of his nose.” As the cameras reloaded, Blunt sang him to sleep. They did four further takes, with the child conked out in her arms. Nolan chose the first version, “where I looked like the worst mother in the world”.

Over the phone, he grins at the memory: “It was hard. Emily is an amazing mother and made this child feel immediately so comfortable and loved. I’m not sure Kitty shared that.” In fact, his film blunts Kitty’s claws. According to the book, she left both babies with friends for months. Oppenheimer died alone because his wife found his final-hours regression to infancy “pitiful”.
A lot of women tend to try to dance around things because we’re not often given a platform to speak honestly
“Just horrific,” says Blunt. “She was pretty ruthless in so many ways. She worshipped Robert, but also really called him on all his shit.” Still, Blunt gamely attempts empathy. Perhaps some people are just allergic to weakness? And don’t label Kitty an alcoholic: surviving on cigarettes and martinis at Los Alamos was understandable, she says. Plus, Robert’s genius got him a free pass denied to his wife. His gender, too? “Yes, I think so. I wonder what the world would feel if it was Kitty Oppenheimer who created this bomb.”
When he was writing the film, says Nolan, “I thought about running away from Kitty. She is a frightening character.” He recruited Blunt to “humanise” her, then was surprised how keenly she embraced Kitty’s worst angles: “No vanity, no fear of humiliation, no wanting to control the way she would appear.”

In her mid-20s, Blunt told this paper that “bitchy gets boring” – a line, she says today, from a time when she was “still working out how to talk to journalists”. It is a good one. Back then, fresh from breakthroughs in My Summer of Love and The Devil Wears Prada (“Such a cow, but terribly funny and likable,” says Bradley), Blunt was worried about typecasting. But over the past 15-odd years, she has leaned into women with acid tongues and hearts of flint: the bruised FBI agent in Sicario; Tom Cruise’s relentless survival trainer in Edge of Tomorrow; the vengeful mother in The English. Even softer outings, such as The Girl on the Train (gaslit drinker) and The Young Victoria (rare corset), climax in shows of steel. In this autumn’s Pain Hustlers, she plays a hardscrabble single mother who shuts her eyes to the effects of the fentanyl she is helping to distribute. Maybe bitchy is just richer?
For female actors, she says, “I think there is still a pressure to be likable, and sort of warm and understood, and men are not held to that same standard. No one cared if Leonardo DiCaprio was likable in The Wolf of Wall Street.”

In Oppenheimer, Kitty attacks Robert for being “so fucking gentlemanly”. Are women, broadly speaking, more forthright? Yes, says Blunt, “but I could equally generalise and say a lot of women tend to try to dance around things because we’re not often given a platform to speak honestly. Or you’re considered too ambitious or emotional if someone appears to be speaking their mind with spirited opinion.”
Kitty was revolted by her husband’s desperation to atone for his sins. “She just wanted him to own it. You see that explosion of frustration and rage start to build. I remember Chris saying to me: ‘She’s wild, she’s unpredictable, the drinking is now out of control, but she’s right!’ And she was always right, and she knew it.’”
Blunt likes righteous anger. She is great at flashing eyes and squashed small talk. “I’m always really awestruck by people who are so completely comfortable in their own skin and uncompromisingly own who they are,” she says. “People for whom there’s nothing blurry about their conviction of themselves.”

Kitty’s husband may have been the flakier half of the marriage, yet it was he who was elevated to role of quasi-messiah, with acolytes to wow and, sometimes, exploit. Has anyone ever captivated Blunt like that? She thinks for a few seconds. Nolan, she says – inevitably, but convincingly: “I’ve never met anyone as authoritative. When he walks in, the air changes in the room.” (He is duly flattered: “You want to be held in high regard by Emily. Her opinion matters.”)
Who else? Malala Yousafzai, she says. This also feels genuine, if a no-brainer. “I was blown away by her serenity and sweetness after so much trauma.” (Yousafzai, too, is touched to make the cut and emails to say she was struck by Blunt’s calmness: “The first time we met we had tea and talked for a long time. She just puts you at ease.”)
Anybody else? Felicity. “So devastatingly brilliant and funny. She continues to be such a vital presence in my life. A source of such comfort and ease.”
Such choices suggest Blunt is not someone easily swayed by false prophets. They are also one of the reasons I ring her sister (plus, because of the strike, no actors are available). I read the quote back to her. Felicity splutters. “That is probably the most extraordinary compliment anybody will ever manage to pay me,” she says. “That’s really more moving than I was expecting from this call. I’m gonna kill her! How dare she embarrass me like that?”

The sisters grew up in Roehampton, a leafy south London suburb, and attended Ibstock Place, then a small private school that promoted learning through play. Their parents – Oliver, a QC, and Joanna, a former actor – had the girls and then, a decade later, two more children.
The timing cemented their bond. “We were fellow travellers through all the big moments,” says Felicity. “New school, puberty, first boyfriends, no boyfriends, first jobs, no money, first hangovers. She’s always been there.” Their dependency is mutual, she says. At Emily’s 40th this year, Felicity said in her speech: “I wouldn’t know how to be me without you.”
AI unnerves me ... do we have to put into action everything that we create? Does it better us?
In their late teens, they rented a flat in Edinburgh, “which is where we really fell in love with one another”. Emily was in a school play they had taken to the festival. It got her an agent, then the agent got her a role in a Peter Hall production in the West End as Judi Dench’s granddaughter. Film roles swiftly followed. Looking back, says Felicity, it was very swift: no drama-school buffer, solo in Los Angeles at 19. “She had to be so independent from such a young age,” she says. “At the time, it seemed fine. Now, I look back and think: ‘Jesus Christ!’ And she’s sane! That’s amazing.”
The sisters separately tell me they share a secret language. Felicity clarifies: mostly, it is just knowing what the other is thinking. But they do also call each other “Slothy” and converse in cod-Mrs Doubtfire accents: “Deeply irritating for other people. But our husbands are incredibly indulgent about it because thankfully they happen to love both of us.”

Felicity met her husband, Stanley Tucci, at Emily’s wedding in 2010 (at George Clooney’s place on Lake Como in Italy). That the two main adults in her life are very famous gives her unusual authority on how that can affect people: “I’m endlessly glad I get to go to the bathroom and not be followed.”
She talks of “bodyguarding” Tucci when they are out with their children; of the ways social media is “such a strange and murky part of being a public figure”; and of “watching and learning from Em. She’s so careful and dextrous about how she manages the personal versus the private.”
Officially, Blunt is not on social media. “But,” she says, groaning lightly, “I have been prone to getting occasionally pulled into lurking on Instagram, and it just makes you feel terrible. I don’t feel good after doing it. I don’t feel like I’ve done anything beneficial to myself. I feel a little bit wobbly. Like I’ve wasted some time.”

There is a great line in the film, in which Oppenheimer tells a friend that only a fool or an adolescent would presume to understand someone else’s relationship. Today, you could add to that number every consumer of celebrity news. Blunt’s relationships – with her husband and with her ex-boyfriend Michael Bublé – have been picked over by strangers for two decades. “I have always tried to see speculation as white noise,” she says. “I’m not always successful. Sometimes it’s going to permeate.” Her policy now is resignation. “I remember someone saying to me years ago: how you relate to the issue is the issue.”
Things beyond her control are less reconcilable. “I am very easily overwhelmed by the idea of the vastness of the never-ending universe,” she says. Contemplating black holes “would be the depths of hell”. She is shaky on the nuclear physics casually strewn through the movie – and uneasy about more recent technological advances: “AI unnerves me. It’s human nature to propulsively want to keep inventing new things. But do we have to put into action everything that we create? Does it better us? Or does it really start to eviscerate what it is to be human?”

She leans back on the bed in her hotel room. “Sometimes I’m like: oh my God, I’m such a dusty old fart about this stuff. But I can’t wrap my head around how beneficial it will be to us, as people, in our souls.”
As the strikes have highlighted, actors hate AI – Blunt, perhaps, even more than most. Her business is built on a gift for reading people; AI would make a nonsense of that.
Back at school, acting boosted her confidence so much that it cured a stammer. Yet the stammer helped the drama, too. Had she been chatting, she would never have committed that Brecht epic to memory. “It might have been formative, because she learned early to observe and soak it in,” says Felicity. “My husband always tells me: ‘When a scene doesn’t work, it’s because the other person isn’t listening. They’re just waiting to say their line.’”
Her sister’s trump card, she thinks, is that she pays attention: “I think she’s highly attuned and sensitive to people’s behaviour. And I also feel she knows herself and, in the best sense, likes herself. Emily goes to bed happy. She works really hard. Her children and her husband are at the centre of everything. She’s a good friend. She’s a brilliant actress. She’s loving. She doesn’t have anything to prove.” She pauses. “I think she’s the best person I know.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjMvanVsLzIxL2VtaWx5LWJsdW50LXdvbWVuLXByZXNzdXJlZC1vcHBlbmhlaW1lctIBVGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjMvanVsLzIxL2VtaWx5LWJsdW50LXdvbWVuLXByZXNzdXJlZC1vcHBlbmhlaW1lcg?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-20 15:11:09+00:00,CNN’s Chris Wallace Puts Oppenheimer Star Matt Damon On The Spot About Dropping Bomb on Hiroshima: ‘What Would You Have Done?’,"CNN's Chris Wallace put Matt Damon on the spot about the U.S. decision to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, asking him ""what would you have done?""","CNN anchor Chris Wallace put actor and producer Matt Damon on the spot about the U.S. decision to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, asking the Oppenheimer star “what would you have done?”
On this week’s episodes of Wallace’s Max/CNN series Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace, Wallace interviewed Damon and film star Laura Linney. The Damon interview was conducted prior to the SAG/AFTRA strike, which prompted Damon and his castmates to walk out of the Oppenheimer premier.
In a preview clip that has not aired, Wallace asked Damon about a central question from the film, which depicts the Dr. Robert Oppenheimer-led U.S. effort to build an atomic bomb and use it to end World War II:
WALLACE: Your latest movie is just out, Oppenheimer, about the scientist who led the effort to create the first atomic bomb. You play, General Lesley Groves, who is the military leader of the Manhattan Project. Why did you want to play this role?
DAMON: The director, Chris Nolan, is one of the best directors to ever live. And he makes extraordinary movies. It plays like a thriller, like you’re on the edge of your seat the entire time
WALLACE: Anyone who deals with this subject, and I wrote a book and you’re now in this movie, I think ends up having to deal with the central question. Was the US right or wrong to drop the bomb on Hiroshima? Where do you come down on that?
DAMON: That’s such an impossible question. I remember talking to Ben Affleck’s grandfather who was a Marine. And he said I, when we heard about the bomb dropped, we cheered and he said I you know this is 50 years later, he’s telling you this (Right) and he goes, I you know, I live with the fact that I cheered, because but this is what they were telling us, you know, that they were going to fight to the last man and that we and that we were going to you know, you cover in your book they said between 250,000 and a million Americans…
WALLACE: Man, you read my book. (I did read it, it was fantastic) Which we should say it’s called “Countdown 1945.” And it’s available on Amazon.
DAMON: It actually is, not to be shamelessly pumping your book but it really is great.
WALLACE: So what would you have done?
DAMON: Boy, I, I probably, I probably would, would have had a head of gray hair, but you know what I mean, it’s like, those presidents that their hair goes white. Like, you know. It’s funny because when you look at it you think there’s really only one choice to make, and yet you’ve looked at the people who made that choice. I mean, I don’t think Groves for instance, ever lost a night of sleep about it. He was, he fulfilled his mission. (Right.) But you know, but, but Oppenheimer and a lot of the other scientists…once they went through the test, you know, they started going oh my god, and they and you know, it was like it was like a shockwave going through them.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZWRpYWl0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9jbm5zLWNocmlzLXdhbGxhY2UtcHV0cy1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1zdGFyLW1hdHQtZGFtb24tb24tdGhlLXNwb3QtYWJvdXQtZHJvcHBpbmctYm9tYi1vbi1oaXJvc2hpbWEtd2hhdC13b3VsZC15b3UtaGF2ZS1kb25lL9IBnAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZWRpYWl0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9jbm5zLWNocmlzLXdhbGxhY2UtcHV0cy1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1zdGFyLW1hdHQtZGFtb24tb24tdGhlLXNwb3QtYWJvdXQtZHJvcHBpbmctYm9tYi1vbi1oaXJvc2hpbWEtd2hhdC13b3VsZC15b3UtaGF2ZS1kb25lL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Q&A: Documentaries will take audiences behind the scenes of Oppenheimer-era weapons testing,"Filmmaker Ross Lipman talks about his in-depth look at “Crossroads,” which will be shown at the Billy Wilder Theater July 30.","Christopher Nolan’s film “Oppenheimer” has generated a massive wave of renewed interest in the events surrounding the birth of the atomic bomb.
Now, viewers have an opportunity to view not only a seminal documentary about 1940s atomic weapons testing, but also one filmmaker’s view of how that documentary came together.
“Crossroads,” which was produced in 1976 by Bruce Conner, is 36 minutes of extreme slow-motion replays accompanied by an original score by composers Terry Riley and Patrick Gleeson. Its source material is government footage from the 1946 atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, which were dubbed Operation Crossroads.
When the film was restored in 2012, the effort was overseen by Ross Lipman, a former UCLA Film & Television Archive preservationist, and filmmaker Michelle Silva of the Conner Family Trust. Lipman was so fascinated by “Crossroads” that he produced his own live documentary about its unique production, called “The Exploding Digital Inevitable.” (A live documentary is a curation of media clips accompanied by analysis in live narration.)
In an interview for UCLA Newsroom, Lipman explained why he wanted to make his own documentary about “Crossroads,” and why Conner’s footage has fascinated him for nearly 30 years.
On July 30 at 7 p.m., the Billy Wilder Theater at UCLA will screen “Crossroads” and Lipman will present “The Exploding Digital Inevitable,” followed by a live Q&A with Lipman and Silva. The program is being presented by the UCLA Film & Television Archive as part of “Archive Treasures,” a showcase of works from the archive’s holdings. “Crossroads” is also being shown as part of the exhibition “Together in Time,” which runs through Aug. 20 at the Hammer Museum at UCLA.
When did you encounter “Crossroads”?
Although I’d known Conner’s films for years, “Crossroads” jumped onto my radar in a significant way around 1995, when I was working at the Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley. They were doing a restoration of the film in conjunction with the Academy Film Archive here in Los Angeles, and I ended up writing about it in the Journal of Film Preservation in 1996.
Eventually, Bruce Conner’s films were moved to UCLA, where I was by that time working as a film restorationist. I began working on “Crossroads” with Conner’s former editor and my longtime colleague Michelle Silva.
Why did you think it was important to make “Digital Inevitable”?
I created this presentation in large part to help contextualize “Crossroads.” Not that it needs it, but there’s a lot of great information out there that I wanted to share — for instance, the historical context on what exactly it was that Conner was looking at in the footage he obtained.
The first half of “The Exploding Digital Inevitable” is really more about the history of the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb tests. Oppenheimer is one of the figures who’s discussed in that history. In the second part, I talk about Bruce Conner in great depth, and about his making of the film.
How did all of the pieces for your film fall into place?
Conner was a bit an archivist himself, and he kept extensive documentation on the making of the film. Somewhere in the process of our restoration, I began working with a lot of these documents. I also managed to interview the composers Terry Riley and Patrick Gleeson, who both had a lot to say. Pat is wonderful firecracker, full of interesting information and great stories.
At some point it struck me that I had all the makings of a documentary. I chose to do it live because the format allows me to be a bit more informal, and have some fun with it.
Speaking of Gleeson and Riley, what interested you most about the composers’ roles in “Crossroads”?
Both composers are very significant to the history of modern music. They’re both alive today and thriving, even though they began their careers in the 1960s. They tried to work on “Crossroads” together, but for various reasons it didn’t work out, leading Conner to have them do two separate parts, which he then joined in the film.
How Conner divided it is particularly brilliant. But I’ll leave that for the viewer to see.
It sure worked out nicely that the Billy Wilder Theater program takes place amid all of the “Oppenheimer” buzz.
We had actually been talking about doing this program for some time, and then we realized that “Oppenheimer” was going to be released shortly after the Hammer was launching the “Together in Time” show. It just made sense to time the event around it all.
But the program is unique in that it’s about an experience and generating thought and meditation on some of the events of our times — what they signify and how we might want to respond to them.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20udWNsYS5lZHUvc3Rvcmllcy9pbnRlcnZpZXctcm9zcy1saXBtYW4tY3Jvc3Nyb2Fkcy1hdG9taWMtd2VhcG9ucy1kb2N1bWVudGFyedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

In the director’s upcoming biopic, Cillian Murphy plays scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer who is credited as the “father of the atomic bomb” for his role in the Manhattan Project. The film is set to be released on July 21, 2023.
Speaking in an interview with Wired, Nolan explained that there’s some similarities between Oppenheimer’s ending and the ambiguous final scene in Inception, where it was left unclear whether Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) was still in a dream.

Asked whether he believed his films have an optimistic or “anti-nihilistic” outlook, Nolan said: “I mean, the end of Inception, it’s exactly that. There is a nihilistic view of that ending, right? But also, he’s moved on and is with his kids. The ambiguity is not an emotional ambiguity. It’s an intellectual one for the audience.”
“It’s funny, I think there is an interesting relationship between the endings of Inception and Oppenheimer to be explored. Oppenheimer’s got a complicated ending. Complicated feelings.”
Asked how audiences have reacted to the ending so far, Nolan replied: “Some people leave the movie absolutely devastated. They can’t speak. I mean, there’s an element of fear that’s there in the history and there in the underpinnings. But the love of the characters, the love of the relationships, is as strong as I’ve ever done.”
Other cast members in Oppenheimer include Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Benny Safdie, Josh Hartnett, Michael Angarano and Jack Quaid.

,Christopher Nolan Explains Why He Doesn’t Have a Smartphone: ‘It’s About the Level of Distraction’,'Oppenheimer' director Christopher Nolan explained in a recent interview why he chooses to stay unplugged,"Christopher Nolan won’t let anything distract him from his films — especially a smartphone.
The Oppenheimer director, 52, revealed in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that he is pretty much unplugged when it comes to communication, by not carrying a smartphone or using email.
He also told the publication that he writes the scripts for his films on a computer that doesn’t have an internet connection.
“My kids would probably say I’m a complete Luddite,” Nolan said, using the term for a person opposed to using new technology.
However, he noted to THR that he “would actually resist that description."" And while he thinks “technology and what it can provide is amazing,” the Oscar nominee actually has a good reason for staying off a smartphone.
“My personal choice is about how involved I get,” he explained. “It’s about the level of distraction. If I’m generating my material and writing my own scripts, being on a smartphone all day wouldn’t be very useful for me.”

Nolan previously told PEOPLE in 2020 that he uses a flip phone that he takes with him “from time to time” and that staying unplugged is beneficial to his art.
“I'm easily distractible so I don't really want to have access to the internet every time when I'm bored,” he said. “I do a lot of my best thinking in those kind of in-between moments that people now fill with online activity, so it benefits me.”
The Dark Knight filmmaker also explained his aversion to contacting people through the email, saying that he has “never been particularly interested in communicating with people in that way. I just calling people from a landline.”
He added, “I mean, everybody finds their own way to communicate with people and deal with things.”
Nolan’s latest film follows J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), the scientist who famously led the Manhattan Project — the effort to create an atomic bomb during World War II. It is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography titled American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer and also stars Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh.

,'Oppenheimer' star Cillian Murphy acknowledges Rays' Tyler Glasnow as his doppelganger,The Rays pitcher bears a strong resemblance to the star of Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer',"For most people on Earth, there's a good chance they have at least one doppelganger who looks virtually identical to them somewhere. For Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Tyler Glasnow, it just so happens his doppelganger is currently one of the world's biggest film stars.
Ever since the release of Christopher Nolan's blockbuster ""Oppenheimer,"" many have pointed out the resemblance between Tyler Glasnow and Irish actor Cillian Murphy, who portrays J. Robert Oppenheimer in the biographical picture depicting the theoretical physicist's role in the Manhattan Project. It's reached the point where even Murphy himself has caught wind of it, and he acknowledged the strong resemblance between himself and Glasnow during an interview on ""Happy Sad Confused.""
Granted, it isn't as though the resemblance between Murphy and Glasnow is perfect -- Glasnow is, after all, about 18 years younger than Murphy as well as a foot taller. There's also something to be said about the two having entirely different skillsets in their respective lives.
""He's a lot better at baseball than I am ... We've all got our skills,"" Murphy said.
Glasnow's latest outing on the mound was a strong one, as he struck out eight while pitching seven innings in a win over the Miami Marlins.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vbWxiL25ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc3Rhci1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1hY2tub3dsZWRnZXMtcmF5cy10eWxlci1nbGFzbm93LWFzLWhpcy1kb3BwZWxnYW5nZXIv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Jzc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9tbGIvbmV3cy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1zdGFyLWNpbGxpYW4tbXVycGh5LWFja25vd2xlZGdlcy1yYXlzLXR5bGVyLWdsYXNub3ctYXMtaGlzLWRvcHBlbGdhbmdlci9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-21 03:00:59+00:00,How Mr. Rogers And Orson Welles Helped Prepare Cillian Murphy For Oppenheimer,"Believe it or not, Cilian Murphy looked to Mr. Rogers and Orson Welles when crafting the voice used to play J. Robert Oppenheimer in Christophe Nolan's movie.","You may have noticed over the years that, despite his very distinctive appearance, Cillian Murphy has a history as a bit of a chameleon — even within his collaborations with Christopher Nolan alone. His various performances all stand apart from each other, utilizing several different accents and mannerisms to bring such characters to life. For the talented Irish actor, it's an underappreciated facet of his work and one that he really put the time and effort to get right in ""Oppenheimer."" In an interview with BBC Radio, Murphy revealed the rather surprising influences that went into how he ultimately figured out his voice as Oppenheimer:
""Well, from the beginning we didn't want to do an impersonation or an impression. That's not part of my skill set at all. However, he was very distinctive in the way he spoke and that kind of timbre and that pitch that he had. It's an accent you don't hear anymore in an American. You know, it's very kind of like Orson Welles, Mr. Rogers, kind of from that same world.""
""He was a reference for us! Just in terms of the tone, really. I just spent a lot of time walking around in my basement talking to myself, you know? As you do.""
It's not all that surprising the actor would look to older generations of American icons to model his take on Oppenheimer after their specific speech patterns, but it likely will raise a few eyebrows to hear that Mr. Rogers ended up on his mood board. But taken together with Welles, it does make a certain amount of sense when you go back and really listen to how they talked. It just goes to show that you never quite know where your research will lead.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTM2NjA3NS9jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1tci1yb2dlcnMtb3Jzb24td2VsbGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Earlier this year, the “Top Gun: Maverick” star was praised by Steven Spielberg for having “saved Hollywood’s ass” at the box office. Now, Cruise has taken to Twitter to encourage audiences to see this year’s summer blockbusters on the big screen.
“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,” Cruise tweeted. “Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indy and one of the most iconic characters in history. I love a double feature, and it doesn’t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with ‘Oppenheimer‘ and ‘Barbie.'”
Cruise allegedly also applauded DC tentpole film “The Flash” ahead of its premiere. His own summer action film “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” has already received positive critical reactions ahead of its July 12 debut in theaters.
The next month sees the summer movie season ramping up. Harrison Ford’s presumed final appearance as Indy in “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” hits theaters June 30. “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” are set to battle it out at the box office with a shared July 21 release date.
“Vanilla Sky” and “Eyes Wide Shut” actor Cruise’s expansive Hollywood career has seen him become a advocate for the sanctity of theaters. Cruise allegedly convinced Paramount to give “Dead Reckoning” a theatrical release without undercutting the box office with a 30-day streaming window premiere on Paramount+.
A recent Puck report also claimed that Cruise has personally called rival studio executives and exhibitors in hopes of convincing them to relinquish PLF (premium large-format) screens for “Dead Reckoning” screenings. PLF screens come with an upcharge fee. “Oppenheimer” is already confirmed to be taking over all IMAX screens in North America for three weeks, which could kick out “Dead Reckoning” screenings.
An IMAX representative told IndieWire that IMAX will still house a three-week “Oppenheimer” plan for 1,550 out of IMAX’s total 1,700 venues worldwide while the Christopher Nolan film premieres later in China and Japan. “Oppenheimer” was entirely shot in IMAX.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9icmVha2luZy1uZXdzL3RvbS1jcnVpc2UtYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWRvdWJsZS1mZWF0dXJlLTEyMzQ4Nzk1Mzkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

‘Oppenheimer’ Actor Robert Downey Jr. Declares “Men Start Wars And The Entire Planet Should Be A Matriarchy”
Robert Downey Jr is Lewis Strauss in OPPENHEIMER, written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan.
Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss in Christopher Nolan’s upcoming Oppenheimer film, recently declared he believes the entire planet should be a matriarchy after filming the movie.
In a recent interview about the upcoming film with the Associated Press, the outlet asked, “I was curious if you took away any, like, commentary on patriarchy and war?”
Downey Jr. responded, “Men start wars and the entire planet should be a matriarchy. But I’ve never changed position on that.
When asked if he already had that going into the film, he replied, “Well, this was just a triple confirmation.”

Erlier in the interview, Downey Jr. stated, “Context is so critical. The timing of the Manhattan project, the need for it, the deployment of it, necessary or not, you can read plenty of data that would support either. But regardless, the why can be debated, but the here we are now that’s the cold hard truth.”
“So being able to, under Chris Nolan’s direction, to kind of invite the audience to be involved in this meditation; it’s kind of — we all know the films of the last 50 years that have kind of been important in that way as well as entertaining and thrilling and just cool to watch. And I guess that’s the transcendent thing about certain films and I got to be in one, yeah.”
Downey added, “It’s arguable that we are less safe now than at the height of the Cold War. It’s a lot to take in, but I think that great films are meant to humble us to the point where we can have these sorts of dialogues to being with.”
Downey does not usually make bizarre comments like this unlike many of his peers. However, at the premiere of his Doolittle film he seemingly admitted to becoming a vegan.
While praising his wife and producer of the film Susan, he told Variety, “She is the greatest creative producer in the history of cinema. And I make faces for cash and chicken. Even though no, I’m off chicken now.”
His wife responded, “Not chicken anymore.”
Variety reported Downey retorted facetiously, “I’m going plant-based! For cash and legumes.”

Back in 2019 he also launched a company called The Footprint Coalition where he aims to clean up the planet with robotics and nanotechnology. During the announcement he described himself as a “one-man carbon footprint nightmare colossus.”
Apparently part of cleaning up the planet is convincing people to eat bugs. The Footprint Coalition invested in French-farming startup Ÿnsect back in 2020. The company aims to “revolutionize the food chain which, literally, stars from the basics: insects and soil.”
The company’s founder Antoine Hubert also noted, “Ÿnsect isn’t just about insect farming: with climate change and increasing populations worldwide, we need to produce more food with less available land and fewer resources, so that we’re not clearing forests and emptying our oceans. We believe Ÿnsect can play a pivotal role in this global solution.”
Hubert also said that Downey’s investment would help the company convince people to eat bugs, “It could help us increase our visibility especially among younger people. [Downey Jr.] is so famous for his movies, and at the same time has a lot of humanity, using the money he has made from films to help clean up the planet.”

,"After ‘Oppenheimer,’ a look back at Princeton’s complicated role in nuclear history","Last spring, filming for Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” at the Institute for Advanced Study and in East Pyne courtyard stirred excitement. The University settings in the film point to a complex history of nuclear development and protest at Princeton.","Last spring, filming for Chistopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” stirred excitement at the Institute for Advanced Study and in Princeton’s East Pyne courtyard. The 1940s-era biopic, which opened with positive reviews on July 21, invites reflection on the role University faculty members, Princeton residents, and J. Robert Oppenheimer himself played in the Manhattan Project and the subsequent development and governance of nuclear weapons.
“The big news of the week — the big news of the century — in the world of science.”

That was the front page of the Princeton Herald a few days after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki took over 200,000 civilian lives, brought World War II to an end, and eternally raised the stakes of global war. The Herald covered Princeton’s instrumental role in developing “the greatest discovery in modern warfare.”
Dr. Zia Mian, co-director of the University’s Program on Science and Global Security (SGS), points to that headline as giving a crucial insight into atomic history.
“You might think that you wouldn’t be so proud of having worked on nuclear weapons, given where we are now at Princeton,” said Mian in a recent interview. “But back then, it was seen as this great thing Princeton had done. Princeton benefited afterwards because of its special role [in the project].”
Princeton’s part in this atomic history involves a range of players, from J. Robert Oppenheimer himself to the rarely-credited women who “crunched the numbers,” and the physicists responsible for the world’s first anti-nuclear non-governmental organization.
Oppenheimer at Princeton
Oppenheimer’s story stands out among those central to the Manhattan Project, the wartime operation that was responsible for the development of the world’s first atomic bomb. A faculty member at UC Berkeley, Oppenheimer is commonly attributed with helping bring quantum mechanics to America.

In 1942, he was recruited to direct the laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico, which became the most famous nuclear development site to come out of WWII. The Trinity site — where the bomb was first tested in July 1945 — stood 220 miles south. Notably, the development of these sites displaced parts of the Navajo Nation and southwest Pueblo nations who inhabited the land.
Following the war, Oppenheimer surrendered the helm of atomic weapon development. Reportedly, he told President Harry Truman “[he felt he had] blood on [his] hands” when meeting him in October 1945 after the introduction of such a threat into the world and the destruction at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
While Oppenheimer would refer to his role in the bomb’s creation as “the fulfillment of an expectation” for years to come, he championed policy regulations of atomic weapons and advised against the US government’s development of the thousands times more powerful hydrogen bomb without success.
In 1947, he was appointed with support from his future foe, Lewis Strauss, to become the third director of the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey. The IAS, though officially independent from Princeton, has had a strong relationship with the University and shared library resources since its founding.

IAS Archivist Caitlin Rizzo noted that there was a scholarly cross-exchange between the two institutions through “seminars, conferences, and even positions to attract the best scholars.” Albert Einstein is also associated with Princeton through the IAS, of which he was a founding member.
Oppenheimer became an important figure in Princeton life. He lectured in McCosh 50 while bringing young scholars and new disciplines to the IAS. At the same time, he was shifting his public efforts to atomic regulation as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)’s science advisory board.
“When you open any door in Washington, Oppenheimer’s in that room,” said Dr. Michael Gordin, a historian of science at Princeton, about Oppenheimer’s days on the board. “For that period of time, he was a key advisor to many aspects of atomic policy.”
Early connection to the development of the bomb
“Oppenheimer himself has often been discussed as ‘the father of atomic bombs,’” explained Assistant Professor of Anthropology Dr. Ryo Morimoto, in an interview with the ‘Prince.’ “But the reality is that he happened to take the leadership role of a project that involved the entire nation.”
The University’s involvement in the Manhattan Project began earlier and was far more extensive than just through a connection to Oppenheimer. The August 1945 edition of the Princeton Herald covers this complex history. This record begins in February 1941, when Princeton researchers experimented with the first steps towards harnessing the nuclear chain reaction for atomic weaponry.
Many experiments were conducted in Palmer Physical Laboratory, the home of Princeton’s Physics Department (located in what is now Frist Campus Center) and Frick Chemical Laboratory.
Gordin, who specializes in early nuclear history, commented on Princeton’s involvement in the Manhattan Project.
“Physics was a reasonably small field in the U.S., up until the 1920s. It really started to grow in the 1930s, and Princeton is one of [its] centers. It makes sense that when you’re going to recruit people to work on a physics-based project, you would [recruit] from Princeton,” Gordin said.
One of these figures was Professor Henry DeWolf Smyth GS Class of 1921, a leading faculty member in the Princeton Physics Department from 1924–1966. During the war, Smyth taught practical physics principles like mortar round trajectories and anti-aircraft targeting to US officers. Additionally, he consulted for the Manhattan Project and held membership in the National Defense Research Committee’s uranium section.
Notably, Smyth wrote a 60,000-word technical report on the Manhattan Project’s military research and use of atomic energy, with the subtitle “The Official Report on the Development of the Atomic Bomb under the Auspices of the United States Government.” This account was released by the United States War Department on August 12, 1945, days after the U.S. bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The public weight of the Smyth report “tells you the kind of trust that the Manhattan Project leadership had in Smyth and the Princeton Physics Department,” said Mian.
“[But] part of what that official history did was to tell the world the kind of science and technology the public had the right to know about. Princeton, through Smyth, played this fundamental role in establishing the barrier of the great wall of secrecy that has surrounded nuclear weapons.”
Unsung contributions
Smyth recognized eight notable Princeton researchers in his public report, including prominent physicists Richard Feynman ’42, John Wheeler, Eugune Wigner, and Robert Wilson. Many of these scholars hold renowned legacies at Princeton today for their groundbreaking achievements.
However, the men credited by Smyth are far from the comprehensive list of Princeton involvement in the Manhattan Project. According to Gordin, Princeton faculty contributed to Manhattan Project work in many ways, from particle accelerator experiments on campus to on-site work at Los Alamos and other secretive bases. Over two dozen faculty members were employed at Los Alamos alone.
“It wasn’t just famous physicists [who] went … they took their graduate students with them,” said Mian.
A few women held official research status on the Manhattan Project during the time. Two of these groundbreaking physicists were Chien-Shiung Wu and Elda Anderson. Wu was the first woman to join Princeton’s physics department faculty and made important contributions to uranium enrichment. Anderson, meanwhile, developed the first test sample of uranium-235 on Princeton’s campus.
Professors’ work at design and operation sites also often became a family affair. The wives of faculty members did not just move with them, but they were regularly employed at the sites doing calculations on key experiments.
“The word ‘computer’ used to be a job description, not a device,” said Gordin. “Almost always, it was a woman. There [was] a lot of that at Los Alamos—because of secrecy, the labor pool they [had were] the families.”
Despite their essential work, these women did not receive much credit for their part.
To this day, many other historically marginalized groups have also been written out of the Manhattan Project narrative. No African Americans worked at Los Alamos, but the facility at Oak Ridge, Tenn. was a segregated community for scientists, engineers, and construction workers alike.
“There was no effort to try and address this discrimination,” commented Mian. “All the existing social relations were just distilled down to their purest essence and put to work on a military project.”
Morimoto said that there is a record of Native people working in facilities, but only a few — like Herbert York at the Oak Ridge site — are credited in the records. Native people, like the Navajo in the American Southwest and the Deline in Northwest Canada, were even coerced into mining uranium for the project as one of the only job opportunities available to them.
“I think the challenge is to tell the alternative narratives that exist as a way to try and change the present and the future,” added Morimoto.
Concerns about nuclear weapons
In decades to follow WWII, Princeton administrators would justify the secrecy and consequences of Princeton’s involvement in the Manhattan Project as “in the nation’s service.” But the atomic bomb’s impact on society was highly contested by scientists and policy-makers, even prior to the first nuclear test at Trinity.
Oppenheimer was one of many physicists who came to fear the global implications of atomic weapons — especially elevated to the level of the hydrogen bomb — after Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated their potential for destruction.
“In Princeton proper, there were several gatherings of those that feared [the bomb’s] development,” wrote Rizzo.
Soon, the Emergency Committee of the Atomic Scientists — the world’s first anti-nuclear organization — was born with headquarters at 90 Nassau Street. The group was founded by Einstein and fellow physicist Leó Szilárd. The Emergency Committee fundraised, wrote articles, gave lectures, and created the first documentary films about the dangers of nuclear weapons, according to Mian.
But some who contributed to the development pushed back, even denying the impact of the bomb.
Smyth and others on the project denied the lasting damage of nuclear radiation and questioned the accuracy of Japanese reporting on the catastrophe months after the war. Such damages were, of course, proven true — radiation poisoning was directly tied to massive spikes in diagnoses of leukemia and other cancers.
According to Morimoto, “there were [also] people like John Wheeler who continued [their research] thinking it was in service of nation and humanity.” Wheeler directed Project Matterhorn B at Princeton, developing hydrogen bombs for the US government during the Cold War.
Oppenheimer’s own credibility took a hit during the second Red Scare, the rampant American anti-Communist era in the early 1950s, when he was publicly humiliated in an AEC hearing led by Strauss over his security clearance. The story was covered by the ‘Prince’, with prominent Princeton scholars like physics professor Wigner taking up his public defense.
Oppenheimer died in 1967 — with a memorial held at Alexander Hall — but Oppenheimer’s legacy in atomic policymaking and nonproliferation lived on at the University. Since its inception by a group of physicists in 1974, Princeton’s Program on Science and Global Security has made global policy efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons and gather together science graduate students with a future in security policy.
Commemorating that history today
“It’s a very interesting, complicated, difficult story to tell,” says Mian. In the years since, that challenge has only fueled leaders on campus.
SGS’s current work, for instance, is focused on eliminating the culture of nuclear secrecy that began with the Smyth Report by bolstering public knowledge through seminars and research journals.
“It’s about accountability,” said Mian. “[We believe] everybody needs to know about how nuclear weapons work [and should] have a right to decide.”
Meanwhile, Morimoto facilitates Nuclear Princeton, a Native American and undergraduate-led project started in 2020, and teaches an affiliated course by the same name. According to the project’s mission statement, Nuclear Princeton works to “[focus] attention on Princeton’s involvement in nuclear projects and explore the ways underrepresented, particularly Indigenous, communities have been impacted by [science, technology, and engineering] projects.”
One major accomplishment of the project, Morimoto explained, is its online archival work that has taken strides to make science history more accessible and promote “long-term thinking about [its] impacts.”
As part of Morimoto’s Nuclear Princeton course, for instance, he takes students to the Mudd Manuscript Library to look at declassified documents from 1945. But he says one of the most interesting relics there is an irradiated roof tile from Hiroshima University. The tile was gifted to Princeton in 2012 as a thank-you and historic memento, after the University donated “one book and just enough money to plant one tree on [Hiroshima’s] campus” in 1951.
“Hiroshima basically said, ‘Oh, please use this material to disseminate the idea of peace to your students,’” Morimoto explained. “The problem has been that it’s just been kept in the archive [and] hasn’t been utilized in a way that the Hiroshima group asked for.”
Nevertheless, Morimoto recognized that Princeton actively employs faculty members like him who are teaching students about the history and environmental impacts of nuclear weapons.
Mian shared a similar sentiment, noting that Princeton physicists were both involved in making the weapon and actively campaigning against them.
“There are a lot of interesting contradictions that coexist in this [story],” said Morimoto.

2023-07-21 19:59:14+00:00,The Day Oppenheimer Feared He Might Blow Up the World,,"In July 1943, Robert Oppenheimer called Arthur Compton to say he was coming to Michigan, where Compton was on a brief vacation with his wife and son in a lakeside house. He had to talk about a matter so important that it was worth taking the train all the way from Los Alamos, New Mexico.
Compton, a Nobel laureate in physics for his research on the interactions of light and matter, was one of the key scientific architects of the Manhattan Project, the secret operation at Los Alamos during World War II to construct an atomic bomb before the Nazis did. The project was led by Oppenheimer, an enigmatic, chain-smoking American theoretical physicist who had contributed important work in fields ranging from quantum mechanics to nuclear and molecular physics, astronomy to general relativity.
That kind of life-or-death gamble makes for a dramatic movie scene.
When Oppenheimer arrived, Compton drove him to the lake where they could talk in secrecy. In Compton’s later account, Oppenheimer explained that the Los Alamos scientists had discovered that, as well as liberating atomic energy by nuclear fission, very light atoms like hydrogen could release energy by fusing together into heavier nuclei. Such a process would only be initiated at tremendous temperatures—but that is precisely what the fission bombs would produce. If the Manhattan Project succeeded, might the bomb ignite an uncontrollable fusion chain reaction in the hydrogen of the ocean water or in the nitrogen atoms of the atmosphere? Might the bomb transform the planet’s air itself into an ever-expanding fireball?
Faced with the possibility of “ultimate catastrophe,” Compton later told writer and Nobel laureate for literature, Pearl Buck, it would be “better to accept the slavery of the Nazis than to run the chance of drawing the final curtain on mankind!”
Given the worry that German scientists working for Hitler would be pursuing their own atomic bomb, Compton and Oppenheimer decided they had no option but to press ahead with their efforts to build theirs first. At the same time, they would try to quantify the risk of igniting the air and sea.
TOO LATE: In 1965, Oppenheimer was asked whether the U.S. should initiate talks with the Soviet Union to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In American Prometheus, on which the film Oppenheimer is based, authors Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin write, “Oppenheimer puffed hard on his pipe and said, ‘It’s twenty years too late … It should have been done the day after Trinity.’ ”Credit: HauptmannSchlaf / Wikimedia Commons.
According to Buck’s article, “The bomb—the end of the world?” which appeared in The American Weekly in 1959, Compton decided the project should only proceed if calculations gave a less-than three-in-1-million chance that an atomic bomb would vaporize the world. The scientists’ estimate allegedly satisfied that threshold—but there was no way of knowing for sure if the figures were right until the first bomb was detonated at the Trinity Site in the New Mexico desert in July 1945. That kind of life-or-death gamble makes for a dramatic magazine article—and movie scene.
The reality was more mundane. Oppenheimer seems to have been rather quickly disabused of the apocalyptic fear. In the end, his concern about nuclear fusion was not that it would be sparked accidentally by the fission bombs his team at Los Alamos had begun developing—and which would three years later obliterate at least 150,000 lives in Hiroshima and Nagasaki—but that it too would be used to create weapons of even more terrible destructive power.
The Second World War merely accelerated the inevitability of the nuclear bomb. It had been known since the end of the 19th century that certain heavy elements, especially uranium, emit energy in the form of radioactivity. In his 1914 book, The World Set Free, H. G. Wells speculated about this enormous reservoir of energy locked inside the atomic nucleus being harnessed for city-leveling weapons he called “atomic bombs.” But only shortly before the outbreak of the war did it become clear how this might be done. In 1938, the German scientists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, working in Berlin, discovered that the uranium nucleus can undergo fission, splitting into two smaller fragments with a tremendous release of energy. Hahn and Strassmann were initially perplexed by their findings; it was their former colleague Lise Meitner, recently exiled from Nazi Germany to Sweden as a person with Jewish heritage, who interpreted them as a fission process.
It was apparent almost at once to scientists studying the physics of the atomic nucleus that this process might give rise to a self-sustaining, runaway chain reaction that liberated all the energy in an instant, if it unfolded in a large enough (“critical”) mass of the fissile isotope uranium-235. With that in prospect, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was persuaded in 1941 to initiate the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, with Oppenheimer at the helm.
Compton’s telling of the anguished lakeside meeting with Oppenheimer is a little odd because he initially suggests that it was prompted by the discovery by the Los Alamos team of nuclear fusion itself. What he seems to mean is the realization that fusion could be used for a bomb, for the possibility that light atomic nuclei could fuse to release energy was appreciated decades earlier.
“I didn’t believe it from the first minute,” physicist Hans Bethe said.
During the 1920s, the British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington had advocated hydrogen fusion as the likely source of the energy of stars like the sun. And nuclear fusion was demonstrated in a particle accelerator in 1932 by Mark Oliphant, working under the New Zealander Ernest Rutherford in Cambridge. In 1939, physicist Hans Bethe—a Nobel laureate and the leader of the theory team at Los Alamos—elucidated the main fusion reactions in the sun, and the Russian-American physicist George Gamow developed the idea with the Hungarian emigré Edward Teller, popularizing it in his 1940 book, The Birth and Death of the Sun.
It was Teller, another member of the Los Alamos team, who first raised the possibility of a “super-bomb” powered by thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen (more specifically, of the heavy-hydrogen isotope deuterium). The enormous temperatures needed to ignite fusion in the deuterium fuel would be created by a fission bomb—which then conjured up the specter of such a uranium bomb igniting the atmosphere. Teller proposed that it was possible for two nuclei of the isotope nitrogen-14 (nitrogen being the principal component of air) to fuse into various other elements, with a massive energy release.
But how likely was it really? “I didn’t believe it from the first minute,” Bethe said in a 1982 interview. If it had been him in Oppenheimer’s place, he attested, he would not have bothered to go to Michigan to discuss it with Compton. Bethe said that he found some unjustified assumptions in Teller’s calculations that made a runaway fusion process extremely unlikely.
Teller, along with physicists Emil Konopinski and Cloyd Marvin, went on to further calculate the chances, concluding that there was, after all, no danger, even with very generous estimates of the highest temperatures a fission bomb would generate. They circulated their report, designated “LA-602,” at Los Alamos, although it remained classified until 1973.
The scientists’ fears about the bomb triggering a global conflagration were little known before Buck’s 1959 article. (The American Weekly, a Sunday newspaper supplement, was founded by William Randolph Hearst, the titan of ill-researched journalism who provided the inspiration for Orson Welles’ Citizen Kane.) Bethe felt that Buck, who had no scientific background, had completely misunderstood Compton. When her story was recounted in an alarmist article by the radiation physicist H. C. Dudley in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 1975, Bethe wrote in to say that “this claim is nonsense.” In truth, you have to wonder how much of Buck’s interview really took place, given that many of her quotes repeat essentially verbatim what Compton wrote in his 1956 autobiographical account of the Manhattan Project, Atomic Quest.
Despite what Buck claimed about Compton’s three-in-1-million danger threshold for igniting the air, there was never even that, Bethe said. “Ignition is not a matter of probabilities; it is simply impossible.” As a 1947 technical history by philosopher of science and the Manhattan Project’s official historian David Hawkins attested, the calculations showed that “no matter how high the temperature, energy loss would exceed energy production [by fusion] by a reasonable factor.” The process would very quickly run out of steam, so that “the impossibility of igniting the atmosphere was thus assured by science and common sense.” What was true for the air, Bethe added, was even more true for hydrogen fusion in the oceans.
This was his fear: weapons of even more destructive power.
The possibility of global atmospheric fusion seemed potentially more of an issue—although again it was found to be not at all likely—for Teller’s much more explosive super-bomb. Teller pushed the hydrogen-bomb concept energetically even while to Bethe it seemed “a terrible thing.” Yet because Bethe assumed the German scientists would have come to the same conclusion, he decided to work on it nonetheless, in parallel with the fission bomb. That effort proceeded in earnest only after the war had ended—and the Cold War had begun. In 1952, the first hydrogen bomb, codenamed “Mike,” blasted apart the island of Elugelab in the Pacific atoll of Enewetak, creating a fireball three miles across.
The fear of an atom bomb causing a runaway conflagration was also raised—with barely the slightest understanding of the scientific issues—in discussions between Albert Speer, the German minister for armaments and war production, and Adolf Hitler, after the German physicists led by Werner Heisenberg had presented the possibility of a uranium bomb to the German High Command in 1942. Speer had asked Heisenberg if he was sure that a fission chain reaction would not continue indefinitely and had not received a clear answer. “Hitler was plainly not delighted with the possibility that the earth under his rule might be transformed into a glowing star,” Speer wrote in his 1970 book, Inside the Third Reich. “Occasionally, however, he joked that the scientists in their unworldly urge to lay bare all the secrets under heaven might some day set the globe on fire.” It was not for this reason that the German bomb project was never pursued with any real conviction, however, but because the German scientists doubted their ability to deliver a bomb in time to affect the outcome of the war. Instead the energy and funding went into the V-2 rocket project.
To anyone who has read Kurt Vonnegut’s 1963 novel, Cat’s Cradle, the tale of physicists inadvertently destroying the world has a familiar ring to it. The novel’s narrator is compiling a book called The Day the World Ended from first-hand accounts of “what important Americans had done on the day when the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.” He goes to meet one of the Manhattan Project scientists, the fictional Felix Hoenikker, who is now researching how to make a new form of ice called ice-nine that remains frozen at room temperature. The book ends with a shard of ice-nine falling into the sea and triggering the conversion of all the oceans to this solid form. The world ends not in fire, but in ice.
Hoenikker was modeled on the American chemist and Nobel laureate Irving Langmuir, who suggested the idea of a form of ice stable at room temperature to H. G. Wells during a visit to Langmuir’s lab at the General Electric research company in the 1930s. Langmuir, said Vonnegut (whose brother worked at General Electric), “was absolutely indifferent to the uses that might be made of the truths he dug out of the rock and handed out to whoever was around, but any truth he found was beautiful in its own right, and he didn’t give a damn who got it next.”
This apocalypse is triggered not so much by amorality as by sheer carelessness. In that much, at least, it seems the Manhattan Project scientists were more careful to check out the dangers. If their bombs ended up destroying us all, it would not be because they burned up the atmosphere by mistake, but because we brought it deliberately upon ourselves.
This was Oppenheimer’s real fear. While initially he supported the H-bomb project (the “Super”), by 1949 he had turned against the idea. He considered that, if the United States pressed on with that project, it would only precipitate an arms race with the Russians. That reluctance was cited against him in the 1954 hearing by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, which revoked Oppenheimer’s security clearance because of his alleged left-wing sympathies. When Oppenheimer was asked when he developed moral convictions against the H-bomb, he responded, “When it became clear to me that we would use any weapon we had.”

Every installment asks the same five questions. This week’s subject is Cillian Murphy, who stars as the title character in Oppenheimer, the Christopher Nolan-directed biopic of Robert J. Oppenheimer and the American physicist’s pivotal role in developing the atomic bomb that would twice be used on Japan to end WWII. Eagerly awaited since Deadline first revealed that the picture was going to be Nolan’s next film and a rare one not at his longtime home at Warner Bros, Oppenheimer will be released by Universal Pictures July 21.
While Murphy has been a regular in Nolan films from The Dark Knight series to Inception and Dunkirk, this is Murphy’s first major lead role. Nolan has said that once he saw Murphy’s haunting ice blue eyes when the actor auditioned for the role of Batman but instead played the villainous Scarecrow. His work includes playing Tommy Shelby in the BBC TV series Peaky Blinders and films from 28 Days Later to The Wind That Shakes The Barley, Intermission, A Quiet Place Part II and many others. Discover the inspirations that led Murphy to set aside his hopes for a career in music for stage success, with his biggest star turn coming shortly.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tL3ZpZGVvL2NpbGxpYW4tbXVycGh5LWludGVydmlldy1mYXZvcml0ZS1tb3ZpZXMtdGhlLWZpbG0tdGhhdC1saXQtbXktZnVzZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Emily Blunt Trolled 'Oppenheimer' Director Christopher Nolan by Gifting Him Uggs After He Criticized Hers,Christopher Nolan explained during an appearance on 'The View' on Friday why he was gifted a pair of Uggs boots by Emily Blunt after production wrapped on 'Oppenheimer',"Emily Blunt knows how to make a statement.
After production wrapped on the highly anticipated film Oppenheimer, the actress, 40, gave director Christopher Nolan a gift with a hilarious meaning behind it.
""Well, she gave me a pair of Uggs boots — Ugg slippers, actually — as a wrap gift,"" he explained during his appearance on The View on Friday. The filmmaker, 52, shared that the shoes were a favorite of Blunt's but would often cause issues during production.
""For people who have been on a set, people know how it works — we’re there, losing the light, ‘Okay, we need the actors to come in,’ and sometimes they’ll come straight from wardrobe and they’ll have these big coats on them and they’ll be wearing these big Ugg boots, because the shoes of the character aren’t comfortable. You know, 1940s shoes,"" he continued. While he understood the need for Ugg boots, he admitted that it was something that would drive him crazy.
""I’d immediately say to her, ‘Can you please just get rid of the boots, put the shoes on, and get ready to go.’ And she got so sick of me saying that time after time,"" he said. Nolan did admit, though, that the Uggs are, in fact, comfortable.
Blunt previously joked during an interview with USA Today that Nolan ""hates Uggs more than anyone.""

""It’s a testament to how he wants everything on set to look as it would (in the period),"" she said. ""If there’s a plastic bottle in the shot, he’s like, ‘Ugh!’ He hates to even look at it."" The actress shared that she would often get a ""withering look"" from Nolan when she was caught wearing them that would remind her of when she filmed 2006's The Devil Wears Prada.
""Just the look down to the shoes,"" she continued. ""And I'd go, 'I know, I know. But I'm just sitting on an apple box in the background today!'""

,‘Oppenheimer’ star Matt Damon used his first big paycheck to pay for his mom’s Ph.D. program. Here’s what the film’s other stars spent theirs on,"Matt Damon’s first big check came in 1990 for a film called ""Rising Son."" He made $25,000.","Cillian Murphy, the leading man in Oppenheimer who portrays the title character—a.k.a. “death, destroyer of worlds”—thinks he bought a sound system with his first big check.
“I think I bought like a record player—or a sound system, cause record players weren’t as cool as they are now, were they?” Murphy told the Hollywood Reporter.
Meanwhile, costar Matt Damon paid for his mother’s Ph.D. and bought his brother a car.
Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer—a historical drama based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus—has been a record-breaking box office success. The film has brought in over $188 million in domestic ticket sales and $231 million worldwide since its opening on July 21. Oppenheimer leads Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Matt Damon shared what they spent their first paychecks on in a recent interview with the THR.
Damon, who portrays Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project, recalled that his first big check came in 1990 for a film called Rising Son. He made $25,000.
“I bought my brother a car and put my mom through her Ph.D. program,” Damon said in the interview. “And that was a really cool feeling.”
In the late 1980s, Damon actually shared a bank account with his childhood friend Ben Affleck, when the two were starting their careers. The two met as kids in their hometown of Cambridge, Mass., and later teamed up on numerous projects, including Good Will Hunting, Field of Dreams, and Air.
“It was unusual, but…we needed the money for auditions, for trips to New York, so that’s what the money was for,” Damon said in March on the Bill Simmons Podcast, hosted by The Ringer sports writer Simmons.
When either of them booked a role, they funneled their earnings into the joint account for future audition costs. It was a kind of mentality of when one wins, so does the other, Affleck said in the same podcast interview.
The actors closed the account when they both began earning steady incomes. Damon’s estimated net worth was $55 million as of 2016, according to Forbes.
Blunt, who portrayed Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer, the wife of the title character, used her first paycheck to move out of her parents’ home and rent an apartment. Blunt was listed as the sixth-highest-paid actress in 2020, earning $22.5 million, according to Forbes.
Whereas the A-list leads of Oppenheimer could have demanded $10 million to $20 million on the open market, they reportedly elected to earn only $4 million apiece for the “privilege of working with Nolan,” Variety reported. Still, they will all receive back-end compensation, meaning they will profit from the film’s box-office success.
‘Barbenheimer’ and the strike
Oppenheimer’s release was simultaneous with that of Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, and the Barbie-Oppenheimer social media craze (a.k.a. “Barbenheimer”) helped fuel $311 million in combined ticket sales. This made their joint opening weekend the fourth-highest-grossing domestic box office weekend in history, behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame, according to the New York Times, citing Box Office Mojo.
Similar to Damon, Barbie star Margot Robbie used the money from her Hollywood success to pay off her mother’s mortgage, who supported her financially while she was getting her start.
“She’d take money out of the house mortgage and lend me money, so I always knew, ‘Oh, I’ve got to pay that back,’” Robbie told CBS Sunday Morning. “I have that piece of paper still. I kept it. Everything I owed my mom, I had it written down.”
“One day, when I made enough money, I just paid that whole mortgage off completely,” she said.
But in the wake of Barbenheimer’s continued success, the Hollywood writers’ strike entered its third month and actors have been on strike for nearly three weeks. Release dates for movies like Dune 2 and Challengers (a tennis drama starring Zendaya) have been delayed, as well as new seasons of television series like White Lotus, The Last of Us, and Euphoria.
The Writers Guild union leaders said on Tuesday they were meeting with studio representatives to discuss restarting negotiations.
The New York Times recently reported that some of Hollywood’s megastars raised over $15 million for the strike fund, led by actors Meryl Streep and George Clooney. Other celebrities including Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Hugh Jackman, Dwayne Johnson, Nicole Kidman, Julia Roberts, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Oprah Winfrey each gave $1 million or more.
“I remember my days as a waiter, cleaner, typist, even my time on the unemployment line,” Streep said in a statement. “In this strike action, I am lucky to be able to support those who will struggle in a long action to sustain against Goliath.”
“We’ve stood on the shoulders of the likes of Bette Davis and Jimmy Cagney, and it’s time for our generation to give something back,” Clooney added.

2023-08-09 12:31:00-04:00,Christopher Nolan’s movies all explore what scares him most,"Oppenheimer isn’t the first Christopher Nolan movie to explore dread and control: Memento, The Dark Knight, Tenet, and Interstellar have the same theme.","In 2018, an interview with Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan went viral — possibly because it was the first time he’d ever appeared relatable. In that conversation, he said his children sometimes jokingly call him Reynolds Woodcock, after the aloof, reserved protagonist of Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread. Though Nolan’s scripts often feature signature, repeated (and often mocked) tropes, including time manipulation, dead spouses, and protagonists who face complex moral decisions, he injects very little of his own personality into his movies. Characters like Leonardo DiCaprio’s troubled team leader in Inception and Robert Pattinson’s equally troubled handler in Tenet are clearly styled after Nolan himself. But viewers rarely come away from Nolan movies with a greater understanding of his worldview, at least compared to the way directors like Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino put their personalities on screen in every movie they make.
One underappreciated idea does recur over and over in Nolan’s work, though, and it surfaces again in Oppenheimer. The protagonists of many Nolan films become obsessed with a specific fear and go to great lengths to better understand or control their terror. In Nolan’s first blockbuster, Batman Begins, gangster Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) tells Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), “You always fear what you don’t understand.” The quote acts as something of a guiding light not just for Bruce, but for Nolan’s back shelf of protagonists who seek a deeper knowledge of their phobias for the sake of control. In Oppenheimer, Nolan imprints this narrative device on a historical figure for the first time, and it feels like he’s being more open than ever about revealing what keeps him up at night.
There is no evidence that J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, struggled with frightening visions of high-energy subatomic particles. This doesn’t come through in any documents about Oppenheimer the man, and Nolan seems to have added the idea to dramatize the film, as Oppenheimer periodically pauses to register and recoil from flashes of light, particles, and fire, all representing wordless fears he can’t explain. Though the movie’s dialogue never explicitly references these mysterious events, Nolan’s evocative imagery asks the audience to fill in the gaps themselves — are we seeing what’s in his mind, his future, or something else entirely?
Nolan’s Oppenheimer presents as an awkward, unsociable student with something off about him. It isn’t hard to imagine that he’s troubled by something. And what does this frightful student do? He dives deep into particle physics, devoting his life to understanding and attempting to control his fear — until it reaches critical mass.
The origin story in Batman Begins is the clearest example of this phenomenon: Batman’s vigilante persona was inspired by a traumatic childhood experience with bats. That plot point hews closely to Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli’s classic 1987 comic arc Batman: Year One, but the film dives far deeper into Bruce’s fervent need to understand and control his terror. In a number of sequences featuring fear gas used by the movie’s villain, Scarecrow (played by Cillian Murphy, who also plays Nolan’s Oppenheimer), the filmmaker dips his toes into horror-inflected imagery. The Gothic architecture of Gotham combines with nightmarish sequences where villains see the superhero as a demonic monster, literalizing the metaphor of Bruce becoming his fear.
Following Batman Begins, Nolan’s Batman movies continue to dwell on this theme. Nolan assaults his protagonist with a series of villains who take on the shape of new nightmares. It’s as if he’s trying to teach Batman how to overcome the things he most dreads.
In addition to Bruce Wayne, the two protagonists Oppenheimer most resembles in this way are Leonardo DiCaprio’s Dom Cobb in Inception and Guy Pearce’s Leonard Shelby in Memento. The latter, Nolan’s mainstream breakthrough, focuses on a man with short-term memory loss who is so afraid of forgetting his purpose that he has it tattooed on his body. A significant portion of Inception takes place within Cobb’s dreams, which, through a very thinly veiled metaphor, are haunted by his wife Mal, played by Marion Cotillard. Guilt-ridden by the circumstances of her death, he subconsciously creates a murderous avatar in the shape of the shame he’s too afraid to face. He wrestles for control within his memory, attempting to hide her in a symbolic (and literal) basement in his mind. It doesn’t exactly work out.
Throughout Oppenheimer’s three-hour run time, Cillian Murphy’s protagonist struggles with existential horrors that are much larger than his personal regrets. In addition to the frightening visual bursts of atomic space, the film focuses most of its second-act tensions on the threat that the first atomic bomb test might ignite the hydrogen in Earth’s atmosphere. In real life, that threat was discussed and dismissed by the physicists at Los Alamos. But Nolan lingers on it, sending Oppenheimer to get the opinion of Albert Einstein, who acts as a sort of patron saint of science in the film. But Einstein provides no comforting answers, which ratchets up the tension and fear felt by characters and audience alike.
The threat of humans bringing about their own extinction is no new ground for Nolan’s films. And that may answer why, exactly, he’s so obsessed with fear and the war for control. In Interstellar, climate change devastates crops with a futuristic, dystopian blight. In his 2020 movie Tenet, an unseen society in the future attempts to reverse the flow of time to stop climate change before it gets out of hand. Between those two movies lies the World War II film Dunkirk, about the struggle for survival against a faceless threat. Though the Nazi presence implicitly hangs over the movie, Dunkirk doesn’t linger on a potential apocalypse in quite the same way as other Nolan movies. But the pervasive dread remains.
The fearsome final minutes of Oppenheimer drive this point home, as Nolan gives his protagonist a vision of a future devastated by nuclear apocalypse. His visions of dancing particles and flames give way to a clear, unambiguous doomsday — an uncountable number of rockets fire from an unknown country, streaking across the globe and detonating. Fire consumes everything.
Nolan’s devotion to the theme of people wrestling with their fears ties him to his protagonists, and his more recent focus specifically on humanity causing its own doom ramps that fear up to a universal level. It’s a heavy, existential worry, but it’s an illuminating glimpse into the mind of an artist who rarely lets the audience in. In his films, when a character obsesses about a topic, it typically means that’s the fear that keeps them up at night and drives them toward obsession as a means of control. Both Nolan and his iteration of J. Robert Oppenheimer are exposing their fears that humanity has the power to devastate life on Earth. And as climate change and political tensions simultaneously rise across the planet, it’s hard to blame him.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIzODI0OTE5L29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWV4cGxhaW5lZC1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1tb3ZpZXMtbGlua2VkLXRlbmV0LWludGVyc3RlbGxhci1tZW1lbnRv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucG9seWdvbi5jb20vcGxhdGZvcm0vYW1wLzIzODI0OTE5L29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWV4cGxhaW5lZC1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1tb3ZpZXMtbGlua2VkLXRlbmV0LWludGVyc3RlbGxhci1tZW1lbnRv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Emily Blunt takes a dig at Matt Damon during Oppenheimer interview,Emily Blunt and Matt Damon were interviewed ahead of the release of Oppenheimer,"Emily Blunt delivered a great put-down to her Oppenheimer co-star Matt Damon during an interview about the film.
The interview must have taken place before the SAG-AFTRA strike took pretty much all of the world’s actors – and many other film and TV professionals – out of action.
Loading…
The pair were talking about Christopher Nolan’s big budget historical epic Oppenheimer, which stars Cillian Murphy as the scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who is regarded as the father of the atomic bomb.

As well as the Irishman, it also features turns from Florence Pugh, and Robert Downey Jr. amongst others.
However, the attention was on Damon and Blunt in this interview with The Hook.
During that chat, the questioning turned to whether there might be a third collaboration between Blunt and Murphy.
The pair had previously starred together in A Quiet Place Part II as well as Oppenheimer, and – you never know – they might work together again.

The interviewer asked: “If we were to pitch the third instalment of the Blunt/Murphy trilogy, what would you want it to be?”
Blunt then chose to take a dig at her co-star, who was just sitting patiently next to her, by saying: “[It would be] a sort of tepid thing, quite tepid, sort of in the middle…
“Something with Matt Damon.”
Advert 10
Luckily, everyone saw the joke for what it was, and the pair both laughed it out.
They even shared a small hug as well, proving that they do have a good deal of affection for each other, despite that burn.
He got his own back a little bit straight away, though.
Blunt added: “You see, I love a Western…”
Advert 10
To which Damon responded: “Yeah, chuck a couple of Europeans in a Western, that makes sense.”
He’s got you there Emily, to be fair.
Oppenheimer has received many positive reviews from both critics and film fans since it was released on Friday (21 July).
It was released on the exact same day as Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and – to be honest – it’s hard to imagine two more different films.
Advert 10
Still, they’ll both be incredibly successful you’d have to imagine.
In another interview, both Blunt and Damon admitted that they struggled during filming because they kept getting lost in Murphy’s ‘ocean eyes’.
Everyone saw the funny side, though. Credit: Twitter/The Hook
That’s a reference to a Billie Eilish song, in case you’re unaware.
During a group interview with People, Damon said: “It’s a real problem when you’re doing scene work with Cillian,
“Sometimes you find yourself just swimming in his eyes.”
On the Eilish song, Blunt added: “We just hum it all day,”
“They’re not even that blue!” said Murphy.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhZGJpYmxlLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2NlbGVicml0eS9jZWxlYnJpdHktbmV3cy9lbWlseS1ibHVudC1tYXR0LWRhbW9uLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLTUyNDk5Ny0yMDIzMDcyM9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-27 11:00:51+00:00,Inside the Barbie Movie: How the Massive Movie Came to Be,"Interviews with Mattel execs, Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie about how they tried to find art in commerce to create summer's biggest movie.","There’s plenty to consider about Barbie, but let’s start with her feet. Perfectly arched, but not quite demi-pointe—the ideal position to fit into any pump. They’re instantly recognizable to anyone who has ever played with the iconic doll. So when the trailer for the upcoming live-action Barbie movie opened with a shot of star Margot Robbie stepping out of Barbie’s marabou stilettos, still on tiptoes, the internet exploded. On TikTok, people attempted to mimic the viral shot with their highest heels. The Wall Street Journal interviewed a podiatrist about the physical impossibility of the moment. “I need to know everything,” tweeted Chrissy Teigen.
Robbie has answers: The shot took eight takes. She had to hold onto a bar to keep her feet flexed. And, yes, those are her feet. “I really don’t like it when someone else does my hands or feet in an insert shot,” she says.
Playing Barbie is complicated, and not just because it requires immense calf strength. I’ve reported on Barbie’s parent company Mattel for the better part of a decade and sat in on test groups with moms and their kids. Some parents say Barbie inspires their children to imagine themselves as astronauts and politicians. But others refuse to buy the doll—with her tiny waist and large breasts— because she has set an impossible beauty standard for their daughters, a problem that precipitated major changes to the doll’s look in 2016. A Barbie movie was always going to be fraught, and the studio marketing the film knows it. As the trailer posits, “If you love Barbie, this movie is for you. If you hate Barbie, this movie is for you.”

Robbie adds, “If you feel indifferent about Barbie or haven’t thought about Barbie in years, this movie is also for you.”

When it was announced in 2021 that Greta Gerwig, who directed the Oscar-nominated coming-of-age stories Lady Bird and Little Women, would helm Barbie, fans were confused, surprised, and delighted. Maybe the movie would be an idiosyncratic, subversive, even feminist take on the doll, not just a commercial for Mattel. But like Barbie, the movie’s existence is an exercise in contradictions.
If you are wondering whether Barbie is a satire of a toy company’s capitalist ambitions, a searing indictment of the current fraught state of gender relations, a heartwarming if occasionally clichéd tribute to girl power, or a musical spectacle filled with earworms from Nicki Minaj and Dua Lipa, the answer is yes. All of the above. And then some.
It’s also the most anticipated movie of the summer—if not the year—which means a lot is riding on Barbie. Not just for Robbie and Gerwig, neither of whom has ever produced a movie on this scale, but also for Mattel. After a period of declining sales, a recently reinvigorated Barbie is ready for her big-screen debut. Barbie’s move to Hollywood is the brainchild of Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz, who came into the job five years ago with a vision to leverage the company’s intellectual property into a cinematic universe based on Mattel toys.
More from TIME
Barbie will be the proof of concept when it hits theaters on July 21, but first it has to go up against Tom Cruise (Mission: Impossible) and Christopher Nolan (Oppenheimer) in the busiest summer movie season in years. If projections of a $55 million opening weekend prove out, it will be thanks to Barbie mania. Anything associated with the film—a rare blockbuster catering directly to women—has been breathlessly received, from paparazzi photos of Robbie and co-star Ryan Gosling (as Ken) skating down Venice Beach in fluorescent spandex last summer to a teaser that cleverly parodies 2001: A Space Odyssey. Mattel has engineered some of the hype by launching Malibu Barbie cafés and announcing partnerships with Bloomingdale’s, Crocs, and Hot Topic. Other moments suggest a snowball effect: Kim Kardashian recently threw her daughter a Barbie-themed birthday party, and celebs are stepping out in hot pink designer minidresses. (Though, as a Mattel executive reminds me, Barbiecore “didn’t just happen.”)
Whatever audiences ultimately think of Barbie, Gerwig still can’t seem to believe she got away with making this version. “This movie is a goddamn miracle,” she says. She calls it a “surprising spicy margarita.” By the time you realize the salted rim has cayenne mixed in, it’s too late. “You can already taste the sweetness and you sort of go with the spice.”
How did a filmmaker who is best known for thoughtful movies about women’s inner lives come to write and direct a movie about a toy who has no inner life, and is (mostly) defined by her looks? It’s simple: Gerwig loves dolls.
“I played with dolls too long,” says the 39-year-old director. “I was still doing it in junior high. Kids were drinking, and I was playing with dolls.” Gerwig’s mom wasn’t a fan of Barbie for feminist reasons: “She went through the ’60s and was like, ‘What did we do all this for?’” But playing with Barbies proved to be a training ground for Gerwig’s job as a professional storyteller.
Gerwig and her partner, the filmmaker Noah Baumbach, wrote the script under unusual circumstances. After they participated in a Barbie boot camp put on by Mattel, which began with a history lesson on Barbie inventor Ruth Handler and involved a tour of Barbie’s most fabulous (and regrettable) fashions, the pandemic struck. Cloistered in their home in New York, the duo didn’t receive the typical studio notes as they drafted. “We worked hard to give them their space and let them come up with what the movie was going to be, uninterrupted, without people pushing an agenda on them—not Mattel, not Warner Bros., not us,” says Robbie, 32, whose company LuckyChap produced the film. “And then when I saw the script, I was like, ‘They’re never going to let us do this. This is really pushing it.’”

So, what exactly is this movie? Even with the onslaught of pink-tinged marketing, Warner Bros. has managed to keep the plot under wraps. I’m not here to spoil the film, which I watched in Gerwig’s temporary office, a gray space in Chelsea accessorized with a magenta Barbie doormat. But I can share that it’s a fun yet self-aware romp with shades of Clueless and Legally Blonde. It’s also stuffed full of ideas, and occasionally overwhelmed by them.

The movie is set in Barbie Land, a utopia where each Barbie has an impressive job. As Helen Mirren’s narrator wryly tells us, “all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved.” The Barbies have sleepovers every night during which they declare how beautiful and confident they feel. The Kens (played by Gosling and Simu Liu, among others) exist as convenient dance partners. But then Robbie’s Barbie begins to think about mortality. Those arched feet go flat. Cellulite appears on her thigh. To combat these changes, she must venture into the real world with Ken, who has been feeling like a mere accessory in Barbie’s dream life. The real world is, well, real. Men in suits at Mattel—led by Will Ferrell’s CEO—make disingenuous speeches about female empowerment; preteens dress Barbie down for wreaking havoc on their self-esteem. Both Barbie and Ken go on quests of self-discovery, and that’s when things get really interesting. (I won’t give away Ken’s story, but Gosling nearly steals the show.)
There’s also a surprisingly balletic musical number that appears to be inspired by Grease and Singin’ in the Rain; a car-chase sequence; a mysterious woman in a kitchen; and a running gag about Sylvester Stallone’s penchant for mink coats. And that’s all before things turn philosophical.
Every single actor I spoke to cited Gerwig and the sharp script as the reason they joined the film. “I knew this was not going to shy away from the parts of Barbie that are more interesting but potentially a little bit more fraught,” says Hari Nef, who plays a doctor Barbie. “The contemporary history of feminism and body positivity—there are questions of how Barbie can fit into all of that.”
Those points proved more controversial with the corporate entities involved. Robbie Brenner, the first-ever executive producer of Mattel Films and the architect of its cinematic universe, told the company’s top brass, “You’re just gonna white-knuckle it the whole time.”
Gerwig earned the toymaker’s trust with the help of Robbie. At one point Richard Dickson, COO and president of Mattel, says he took a flight to the London set to argue with Gerwig and Robbie over a particular scene, which he felt was off-brand. Dickson dials up his natural boyish exuberance, imitating himself righteously marching off the plane to meet them. But Gerwig and Robbie performed the scene for him and changed his mind. “When you look on the page, the nuance isn’t there, the delivery isn’t there,” explains Robbie.

Robbie had laid the groundwork for this with Mattel’s CEO when she met with him in 2018 in the hopes that LuckyChap could take on the Barbie project. “In that very first meeting, we impressed upon Ynon we are going to honor the legacy of your brand, but if we don’t acknowledge certain things—if we don’t say it, someone else is going to say it,” she says. “So you might as well be a part of that conversation.”
Kreiz has hosted several pivotal meetings about Barbie at the Polo Lounge, a see-and-be-seen spot in the Beverly Hills Hotel. It’s where he met Robbie for the first time, and where he invited Brenner to discuss running Mattel’s film division. And so, too, Kreiz invites me, without a hint of irony, to the Polo Lounge to talk about all the other Barbie conversations that took place there. Kreiz was the fourth Mattel CEO in four years when he took over in 2018. He orchestrated a turnaround that included courting Hollywood’s biggest talent with an exacting pitch that has proven to be persuasive. “It’s not about making movies so that we can go and sell more toys,” he says. “We’ve been doing well selling toys without movies.” (The movie does help: the day a Margot Robbie Barbie went on sale, it became the No. 1 doll on Amazon.)
“The most important transition was from being a toy-manufacturing company that was making items to becoming an IP company that is managing franchises,” he says. It’s a particularly prescient strategy at a moment when superhero fatigue has set in and studios are desperate to find new intellectual property with a built-in fan base—from Super Mario Bros. to Dungeons & Dragons. Mattel has announced 14 more movies based on its toys, including a J.J. Abrams–produced Hot Wheels movie and (intriguingly) a Barney film with Daniel Kaluuya. The expansion also includes more streaming shows, video games, and a Mattel theme park currently under construction in Arizona.
From an outdoor table covered in leaves, Kreiz points out the spot where he and Robbie met. The CEO had been as eager to talk with Robbie as she had been to pursue a Barbie film. Before he hired Brenner as executive producer of Mattel Films, he asked who she thought should play the iconic doll. She too said Robbie. “She’s very funny, she’s deep, she’s a fantastic actress, and she does look like …” Brenner pauses. “She’s beautiful.”
It’s obvious why both executives zeroed in on Robbie. She looks like Barbie. Or, as the film says, she looks like “Stereotypical Barbie.” The distinction is important. Just eight years back, in 2015, Barbie’s sales had sunk to $900 million, the lowest in 25 years. So in 2016, Mattel made the biggest change to the doll since she debuted in 1959. In a TIME cover story, I reported on how, after rolling out a wider array of skin tones and hair types for the dolls, Mattel launched three new body types, including Curvy Barbie. It (eventually) worked. Barbie sales rose and hit a record $1.7 billion in 2021 before a small industry-wide slump last year.
Mattel had been toying with the idea of a Barbie movie since 2009. Big stars (Amy Schumer, Anne Hathaway) and prominent directors like Patty Jenkins were rumored to be attached before Robbie met with the company in 2018. One of the reasons Mattel resisted bringing Barbie to the big screen for so long is because the company worked hard to modernize the brand and establish that Barbie is not one body, one personality, one woman. There are currently 175 different Barbies, with different combinations of body shapes, skin tones, and hair types. And yet, here is Margot Robbie on the poster as the manifestation of Barbie. There’s a moment in the film where Mirren makes a tongue-in-cheek joke about Robbie being too beautiful to feel insecure.
Dickson argues that Barbie has to look like Robbie to get audiences who haven’t followed Mattel’s latest updates into theaters. “Of course she looks like Barbie,” he says. “But they’re all Barbie. It’s the perfect cast to express what Barbie is today. And Margot is the bridge.”

Robbie is flattered that the Mattel execs thought of her, but she would never have wanted to play the only Barbie. “If [Mattel] hadn’t made that change to have a multiplicity of Barbies, I don’t think I would have wanted to attempt to make a Barbie film,” she says. “I don’t think you should say, ‘This is the one version of what Barbie is, and that’s what women should aspire to be and look like and act like.’”
Issa Rae, 38, who plays President Barbie, argues that the entire point of the film is to portray a world in which there isn’t a singular ideal. “My worry was that it was going to feel too white feminist-y, but I think that it’s self-aware,” she says. “Barbie Land is perfect, right? It represents perfection. So if perfection is just a bunch of white Barbies, I don’t know that anybody can get on board with that.”

But it seems Mattel was resistant to appearing too modern. In a recent interview, Amy Schumer revealed that she left her Barbie movie because it wasn’t “feminist and cool,” as she assumes Gerwig’s will be. Dickson, who was in the C-suite at Mattel for other movie discussions, doesn’t comment on Schumer but reflects on past experiences: “It was a matter of finding the right talent that can appreciate the brand’s authenticity and bring that controversy to life in a way that, yes, pokes fun at us but ultimately is purposeful and has heart.”
Still, in an interview for this story, Brenner called Gerwig’s film “not a feminist movie,” a sentiment echoed by other Mattel executives I spoke with. It was a striking contrast to my interpretation of the film and conversations with many of the actors, who used that term unprompted to describe the script. When I relay Mattel’s words to Robbie, she raises an eyebrow. “Who said that?” she asks then sighs. “It’s not that it is or it isn’t. It’s a movie. It’s a movie that’s got so much in it.” The bigger point, Robbie impresses upon me, is “we’re in on the joke. This isn’t a Barbie puff piece.”
Barbie’s Corvette isn’t any old convertible with a slick of pink paint. If you place the doll in her car, it’s too small—the windshield ends at her chest. And so Gerwig insisted the life-size version must be a little small for Robbie. Barbie’s vehicle was carefully created as a model, and scaled up using a mathematical formula to ensure everything in Barbie Land looked “toyetic.”

Gerwig’s team built an entire neighborhood made up of Dream Houses that were missing walls. The actors had to be secured by wires so they wouldn’t topple off the second floors. The skies and clouds in the background were hand-painted to render a playroom-like quality, as was much of the rest of the set.
“From a production perspective, it’s bigger than anything we’ve done before,” says Tom Ackerley, 33, Robbie’s producing partner and husband. “We wanted it to feel like you could reach into the screen and touch it.” LuckyChap enlisted David Heyman, who produced the Harry Potter films, to help create this fantastical world. “I don’t think we have seen or will ever see a film with more pink in it,” says Heyman. Gerwig jokingly nicknamed the duo Ken David and Ken Tom.
Not everyone in the film had as robust a relationship with Barbie growing up as Gerwig did. Kate McKinnon preferred to play with shells she found on the beach or small plastic zoo animals. “I didn’t see myself in Barbie when I was younger,” she says. “I saw myself in an inflatable lobster.”
Nef, Rae, Shipp, Robbie and McKinnon photographed in Los Angeles on June 8 Carlota Guerrero for TIME
But McKinnon, 39, watched her sister and friends play with the dolls: they cut Barbie’s hair, drew on her face, and even set her on fire. She theorizes, “They were externalizing how they felt, and they felt different.” So when Gerwig offered McKinnon the role of Weird Barbie, a doll that’s been played with a little too aggressively in the real world, she jumped at the chance. McKinnon was impressed by the way the script dealt with girls’ complicated attachments to the doll. “It comments honestly about the positive and negative feelings,” she says. “It’s an incisive cultural critique.”
Alexandra Shipp, who plays an author Barbie, also projected onto the dolls as a child. Shipp, 31, rode on Warner Bros.’ Barbie float in the West Hollywood Pride Parade this year and reflects that Barbie helped her explore aspects of her identity. “When you’re a kid, your toys are an extension of who you are and how you can exist in the world as an adult,” says Shipp. “Sure, I had Kens, but when I played house, I had two Barbies raising a Skipper.”
On social media, Nef, 30, published a letter she wrote to Gerwig and Robbie asking to play one of the Barbies in the film. She says that as a trans woman, she feels ambivalent about the word doll, a slang term in queer culture for trans women, particularly those who celebrate the high femme. The word can feel at once aspirational and oppressive. “It’s a tricky word that holds, for me anyway, such a strict standard created by the patriarchy that deserves to be scrutinized but also a promise of liberation and safety and belonging,” she says. “At the very least, there’s a juicy performance as a doll somewhere in there.”
The world may be obsessed with Barbie’s feet, but Gerwig would like to draw my attention to Barbie’s hands. The director is holed up in New York City putting the final touches on the movie, and she’s eager to dig into its minutiae. The PR team reminds me that our Zoom call is long over, but Gerwig needs a few more minutes to point out that there is a specific image in the film that bears a striking resemblance to Michelangelo’s The Creation of Adam. She starts to point a finger downward, excitedly mimicking the moment in which God bestows life on the first man. Except, in Gerwig’s filmed fresco, Barbie creator Ruth Handler’s hand touches Barbie’s hand.
“It’s on the same trajectory and angle as the Sistine Chapel,” she says. “Nobody is going to notice that so I have to say it.” There’s a lot to unpack in the notion of Handler as God, creating the perfect woman, to be placed in an idyllic matriarchy—and the inevitable chaos that will ensue when Barbie leaves this paradise. But anytime I get too deep into references or the politics of this film with Gerwig or the actors, I’m quickly reminded by an executive or a producer that it’s a fun summer romp.
Mattel has engineered tie-ins that range from clothes to beauty to home decor Shoes: Aldo; Float: Funboy; Clip: Kitsch; Jacket: Gap; rug: Ruggable; Skates: Impala Skate
And it is, in part. It’s a mashup of corporate ambition and personal quirk. Perhaps that’s a triumph in an era when movies about products are en vogue. In the past several months alone we’ve gotten films based on a Nike shoe (Air), an obsolete smartphone (BlackBerry), and a snack (Flamin’ Hot). For Mattel, Barbie is just the beginning. Kreiz enthuses about the possibility of “more Barbie movies.”
Robbie hedges. She’s been involved in conversations, but nothing is set. “It could go a million different directions from this point,” she says. “But I think you fall into a bit of a trap if you try and set up a first movie whilst also planning for sequels.”
It’s hard to imagine a sequel, or any other toy movie for that matter, making the splash that Barbie already has. “We’re looking to create movies that become cultural events,” Kreiz says, and to do that Mattel needs visionaries to produce something more intriguing than a toy ad. “If you can excite filmmakers like Greta and Noah to embrace the opportunity and have creative freedom, you can have a real impact.”
Gerwig herself admits “sometimes these movies can have a quality of hegemonic capitalism” and she had to find ways to make the movie her own. She wove in footage of the cast and crew’s friends and family, including images Robbie has filmed herself on a Super 8 over the years, to give the film a personal touch. It’s a home movie smack-dab in the heart of a summer blockbuster, and Gerwig cries every time she watches that part. “It’s like sneaking in humanity to something that everybody thinks is a hunk of plastic.”

,The new Napoleon film stirring debate,"Ahead of his new epic, Scott has caused anger with his comments about his lead character, comparing him to Hitler and Stalin. What's the truth of the matter, asks Neil Armstrong.","Ridley Scott’s Napoleon: Was the French leader really a monster?
By Neil Armstrong Features correspondent

Ahead of his new epic, with Joaquin Phoenix as Napoleon, Scott has caused anger with his comments about his lead character, comparing him to Hitler and Stalin. What's the truth of the matter, asks Neil Armstrong.
It was the opening of his campaign, and the British veteran unleashed a salvo of shots at the French lines. That is to say, director Ridley Scott was promoting his latest film, due to be released in November.
Napoleon promises to be an epic account of the rise of the emperor, played by Joaquin Phoenix, focusing on his volatile relationship with his first wife Joséphine (Vanessa Kirby).
And while there are months to go before we see the end result, conversation has started swirling around the biopic in earnest, thanks to comments Scott has made in an interview with film magazine Empire. ""I compare [Napoleon] with Alexander the Great, Adolf Hitler, Stalin. Listen, he's got a lot of bad shit under his belt,"" he declared, explaining his take on the character.

Quoi? Arrête! The French wasted no time in returning fire and correcting the impudent Brit. ""Hitler and Stalin built nothing and only wrought destruction,"" Pierre Branda, academic director of the Fondation Napoléon, told The Telegraph. ""Napoleon built things that are still in place today."" Thierry Lentz of the Fondation Napoléon said in the same piece: ""Napoleon did not destroy either France or Europe. His legacy was subsequently celebrated, embraced and expanded on."" So what is the truth of the matter – and does Scott have a leg to stand on?
Napoleon, a brilliant military commander, seized power in 1799 during a period of political instability in France following the French Revolution. Admirers say he made France a more meritocratic country than it had been under the pre-revolutionary ancien régime. He centralised the government, reorganised banking, overhauled education and instituted the Napoleonic code, which transformed the legal system and served as a model for many other countries.
If I was going to compare Napoleon to anyone, then I would go back in history to Louis XIV, an absolute monarch who waged unnecessary wars
But he also waged a series of bloody wars across Europe, establishing an empire that, at its height, stretched from the Iberian Peninsula to Moscow. By 1812, the only areas of Europe free from his control, by direct rule or puppet rule or through alliance, were Britain, Portugal, Sweden and the Ottoman Empire. He was finally defeated in 1815 by an alliance of nations led by Britain in the Battle of Waterloo.
Napoleon and the Napoleonic Wars loomed large in the minds of British people of the period and beyond. Cartoonists were obsessed with him. He is in the background of Jane Austen's novels. Pride and Prejudice, which was published in 1813, for example, features the militia that was to repel the expected invasion by Napoleon. Charlotte Brontë owned a fragment of Napoleon's original coffin, given to her by her tutor in Brussels. Arthur Conan Doyle's great detective Sherlock Holmes dubs villain Professor Moriarty ""the Napoleon of crime"". In George Orwell's Animal Farm, published in 1945, the pig who becomes a dictator is called Napoleon. But is calling Napoleon a dictator – and equating him with other infamous dictators – really fair?
The differing views of him
Philip Dwyer, professor of history at the University of Newcastle, Australia, and the author of a three-volume biography of Napoleon, doesn't think so. ""You can have a debate about whether Napoleon was a tyrant or not – I'd be leaning towards the tyrant – but he was certainly no Hitler or Stalin, two authoritarian dictators who brutally repressed their own people, resulting in millions of deaths.""
Jacques Luis David

Some have even argued that the Empire was a 'police state' because there was a complex system of secret informers keeping tabs on public opinion,"" he continues. ""But very few people – a number of aristocrats more or less involved in plots to overthrow the regime, a couple of journalists – were actually executed by Napoleon for their opposition. If I was going to compare Napoleon to anyone, then I would go back in history to Louis XIV, an absolute monarch who waged unnecessary wars costing thousands of lives.
""So too Napoleon waged wars – again debatable whether they were necessary or not – costing the lives of millions of people, although we don’t know how many civilians were killed directly or indirectly as a result of the wars.""
French journalist and Telegraph columnist Anne-Elisabeth Moutet agrees that Napoleon is not comparable to Hitler or Stalin. ""He [Napoleon] did not have concentration camps,"" she tells BBC Culture. ""He did not single out minorities for massacre. Yes, there were intrusive political police but ordinary people could live as they liked and say what they wanted.""
Moutet says that the French view Napoleon principally as a reformer.
I see Napoleon as a warlord – a man who was driven by personal ambition, and who was absolutely ruthless – Charles Esdaile
""He had a remarkable mind and was the instigator of a body of laws and institutions that we still live by today.
""We like to think – and it’s not entirely false – that lots of people were much happier being ruled by the French than living under whatever feudal laws they had had.""
However Charles Esdaile, Professor Emeritus of History at the University of Liverpool and the author of several books on Napoleon including Napoleon’s Wars: An International History 1803-15, has a different view.
""I see Napoleon as a warlord,"" he says. ""A man who was driven by personal ambition and who was absolutely ruthless. A man who had a very clear vision of the sort of France he needed to construct and, indeed, the sort of Europe he needed to construct, to support his war machine. Any idea that he was some sort of liberator, some sort of a man of the future – essentially this is all part of the Napoleonic legend.

The Napoleonic propaganda machine was a very, very powerful tool in the course of the Empire and churned out a version of his wars in which much of the fault was down to perfidious Albion,"" he adds. ""It wasn't France at all – it was everybody making war against France. This powerful Napoleonic legend continues to operate to this day. Napoleon is a living presence. He continues to operate from beyond the grave. He continues to mould the way in which we see him.""
But Esdaile also rejects the Hitler and Stalin comparisons.
""Napoleon had many faults and was a loathsome individual but the racial ideology that underpinned the Nazi regime simply wasn’t there,"" he says. ""Napoleon is not guilty of genocide. Napoleon doesn’t engage in wholesale purges. In fairness to Napoleon, the number of political prisoners in the course of his reign is relatively limited. To compare him with Hitler and Stalin is a historical nonsense.""
Of course, Ridley Scott, a titan of the film industry, director of Blade Runner, Gladiator, Thelma and Louise, Alien and many others, has been in the business long enough to know how to promote a movie. (Napoleon is a return to the milieu of his first feature, The Duellists, released more than four decades ago.) It's entirely possible he knew the Hitler and Stalin remarks would generate publicity and that is why he made them.
So will Esdaile be going to see Napoleon when it is released?
""I suppose I'm going to have to but I know it can't be any good because Rod Steiger is not playing Napoleon,” he jokes. “There is so much wrong with the 1970 film Waterloo but Steiger's performance as Napoleon is just outstanding.”

,Will There Be a 'Barbie' Sequel?,"""It could go a million different directions,"" star Margot Robbie said of a possible second Barbie movie.","Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures
Will Barbie come back for a second movie?
Writer and director Greta Gerwig and star Margot Robbie haven't ruled it out, but Robbie doesn't seem to think there's a possibility. ""We put everything into this one. We didn’t build it to be a trilogy,"" she told the Associated Press. ""Greta put everything into this movie, so I can’t imagine what would be next.""
Months ago, at the Los Angeles premiere, Gerwig replied to a question about a sequel, or a Ken-focused spin-off, saying, ""Honestly, I'm just focused on getting this one out and crossing all my fingers and toes. And then we'll see what happens after that.""
In another interview with the New York Times, Gerwig said, ""At this moment, it's all I've got. I feel like that at the end of every movie, like I'll never have another idea and everything I've ever wanted to do, I did. I wouldn't want to squash anybody else's dream but for me, at this moment, I'm at totally zero."" Ryan Gosling, who played Ken, would be open to returning. ""I would work with Greta and Margot on anything,"" he said at the premiere.
As the Barbenheimer (Barbie plus Oppenheimer) phenomenon occured this summer, Oppenheimer star Cillian Murphy said he would play a Ken in a Barbie sequel. ""Would I play a Ken in Barbie 2? Sure,"" Murphy told Cinéfilos. ""Let's read the script and let's have a conversation."" Emily Blunt, another Oppenheimer star, also said she'd love to do it (if it exists). ""Yes, PLEASE! I'd do anything with Greta Gerwig!"" she said during an interview.
While Murphy was never slated to appear in Barbie, there were other actors who almost appeared in the film, like Bowen Yang, Dan Levy, and Ben Platt. ""They were, I'm not kidding, really bummed they couldn't do it,"" one of Barbie's casting directors, Allison Jones, told Vanity Fair. Perhaps a Barbie sequel could feature all these Kens?

2023-07-11 20:13:17+00:00,Inside the White-Hot Center of A.I. Doomerism,"Anthropic, a safety-focused A.I. start-up, is trying to compete with ChatGPT while preventing an A.I. apocalypse. It’s been a little stressful.","The movement’s adherents were among the first people to become worried about existential risk from artificial intelligence, back when rogue robots were still considered a science fiction cliché. They beat the drum so loudly that a number of young E.A.s decided to become artificial intelligence safety experts, and get jobs working on making the technology less risky. As a result, all of the major A.I. labs and safety research organizations contain some trace of effective altruism’s influence, and many count believers among their staff members.
No major A.I. lab embodies the E.A. ethos as fully as Anthropic. Many of the company’s early hires were effective altruists, and much of its start-up funding came from wealthy E.A.-affiliated tech executives, including Dustin Moskovitz, a co-founder of Facebook, and Jaan Tallinn, a co-founder of Skype. Last year, Anthropic got a check from the most famous E.A. of all — Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the failed crypto exchange FTX, who invested more than $500 million into Anthropic before his empire collapsed. (Mr. Bankman-Fried is awaiting trial on fraud charges. Anthropic declined to comment on his stake in the company, which is reportedly tied up in FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings.)
Effective altruism’s reputation took a hit after Mr. Bankman-Fried’s fall, and Anthropic has distanced itself from the movement, as have many of its employees. (Both Mr. and Ms. Amodei rejected the movement’s label, although they said they were sympathetic to some of its ideas.)
But the ideas are there, if you know what to look for.
Some Anthropic staff members use E.A.-inflected jargon — talking about concepts like “x-risk” and memes like the A.I. Shoggoth — or wear E.A. conference swag to the office. And there are so many social and professional ties between Anthropic and prominent E.A. organizations that it’s hard to keep track of them all. (Just one example: Ms. Amodei is married to Holden Karnofsky, a co-chief executive of Open Philanthropy, an E.A. grant-making organization whose senior program officer, Luke Muehlhauser, sits on Anthropic’s board. Open Philanthropy, in turn, gets most of its funding from Mr. Moskovitz, who also invested personally in Anthropic.)
For years, no one questioned whether Anthropic’s commitment to A.I. safety was genuine, in part because its leaders had sounded the alarm about the technology for so long.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTEvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9hbnRocm9waWMtYWktY2xhdWRlLWNoYXRib3QuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-28 14:00:00+00:00,"Lily Gladstone, with a Waiver in Hand, Says Studios Wouldn’t Have Touched ‘The Unknown Country’","""This story only happened because people gave so much to make it happen,"" Gladstone said after production signed SAG-AFTRA's interim agreement.","Just two miles outside of their destination, the Cadillac that star Lily Gladstone was driving for director Morrisa Maltz‘s “The Unknown Country” ran out of gas amid a 2,200-mile road trip, the pair recently told IndieWire. And just days before their film was set to be released, SAG-AFTRA went on strike, leaving Gladstone unable to promote the passion project in its homestretch.
“The Unknown Country,” an independent road trip movie that blends documentary and narrative elements to gorgeous and profound effect, is Maltz’s debut feature and is finally hitting theaters Friday after premiering at SXSW 2022. It’s also the type of movie that might struggle to find any sort of wider audience, if not for Gladstone’s involvement.
For months, Gladstone had this week circled on her calendar for promotion. But, per the strike rules laid out by SAG-AFTRA, actors are unable to promote past, present, or future projects produced by struck companies. That most notably includes Gladstone’s upcoming turn in Martin Scorsese’s much-anticipated “Killers of the Flower Moon,” which she is currently unable to discuss in interviews.
But there are exceptions available if a film’s producers are truly independent (i.e. not aligned with any AMPTP-affiliated company) and have agreed to sign an interim agreement (colloquially known as a “waiver”). The guild has prioritized films that were in the midst of production when the strike began, with dozens of films getting the green light to resume.
Just this week, “The Unknown Country” became the first project to be approved for promotion specifically, something that a number of movies set to premiere at the fall festivals are hoping to receive as well. The waiver allowed Gladstone and Maltz not just a last-minute chance to sit down with IndieWire, but also to host a local screening in South Dakota, where part of the movie was filmed.
The event was miles away from Hollywood, had no professional photography, and saw Gladstone and Maltz doing their own hair and makeup. Suddenly, they are able to promote the movie in the same grassroots way they shot it.
“It’s a real moment of equity when our union that is so concerned with our quality of life as a worker is also concerned with these films that highlight these marginalized circles, these quiet small corners, the small independent lens that is really community-grown and very grassroots,” Gladstone said. “There’s no way that the studios would have touched this story. This story only happened because people gave so much to make it happen.”
“The Unknown Country” is exactly the type of movie SAG-AFTRA would love to prove is still possible outside of the studio system, the kind that should be elevated during this complicated time. It had a five-person crew. When he wasn’t shooting, cinematographer Andrew Hajek was also the one washing dishes, while one producer was the one tasked with cooking everyone scrambled eggs.
“The Unknown Country”
Maltz filmed the project largely without a formal script and over the span of three years, with Gladstone committing to keep her hair the same length that entire time to help ease any continuity issues. Upon applying for the interim agreement, Maltz had to share her production company to prove she was not with the AMPTP. Its name is just “Morrisa Maltz LLC.”
“The Unknown Country” promotional waiver is not even the only waiver Maltz has received. The filmmaker double-dipped and also received a production waiver for a spiritual sequel to the film, currently known as “The Untitled Jazzy Project,” that likewise features Gladstone and some of the figures from the first film. The film wrapped production last week.
On both that project and “The Unknown Country,” Maltz is working with non-actors and filming their stories as a seamless mix of documentary and narrative storytelling. Gladstone is the conduit for a variety of vignettes, landscapes, and experiences from a lesser-known region of the country. Gladstone even got a story credit for her contribution as a performer shaping what the narrative would become.
In “The Unknown Country,” Gladstone plays Tana, a young woman on a trip from her home in Minnesota to Texas. The purpose of her journey isn’t clear until the end, except it’s clear from that start that she’s grappling with the loss of a grandmother. Maltz went into filming with merely that premise: beginning and end, everything in-between was up for grabs and pieced together as she followed Gladstone exploring the Midwest, with Maltz evoking feelings and emotions rather than plot points.
“[Lily’s] an incredible human being, and she’s an incredible actor, and when you put those two things together, you get someone who’s walking into these situations, who is incredibly warm, incredibly kind, and they don’t come off as ‘An actor just suddenly came to Spearfish, South Dakota,'” Maltz said. “When you put that with these first-time actors, real people, it created a very comfortable environment. Lily was able to guide them within the scene as to what we needed to get to see the story very naturally.”

Gladstone added, “It’s kind of like improv. There’s the rules of the scene, and then you flesh it out and together find a way to resolve it and get to the end. It’s an incredibly fun way to work that almost only happens in like black box theater or when groups of friends get together. I really love nuance, I really love minimalism, so having a chance to bring that exciting factor of finding the story as you go and creating and driving the story, capture it while you’re doing that in a film way, it was terrifying, but it’s the kind of thing that I really believe and really love doing, especially when you’re working with a lens that Morrisa has.”
The story is populated with encounters along the road with real people, filmed in a verité doc-style, including a handful of interviews done through voiceover. One of the women, Lainey Bearkiller, is a producer on the film and a friend of Maltz’s, and the film shows her real-life wedding on screen, even though the fictional Tana is a guest. Bearkiller’s young daughter Jasmine (or “Jazzy”) is also featured in this movie and the follow-up feature and has one small line that was fed to her, though you might not know which while watching the film.
Maltz even took the major risk of not obtaining releases from her film’s subjects until she could show them the finished product, something that she says reflected the truly collaborative process of the film. Maltz said it’s about “making it with the community and having them in control of their stories,” which she admits would never be possible to risk if it was a larger film.
“That’s something anybody who’s working within native communities needs to know about and think about,” Gladstone added of getting the subject’s informed consent. “This was something that happened after the fact, but it also was something that happened when people were able to look at the footage and then say, ‘Yeah, I like that. I’ll sign it now.'”

Before joining the film, Gladstone was wary of yet another filmmaker attempting to turn an (air quotes) “real lens” into what reservation life is like. She’s seen too many examples of “poverty porn” or “glorified personal artist’s statements” that pressure indigenous communities to reveal moments they’d rather not have a broad audience see. But she ultimately was moved by test footage Maltz shot, and she related to the universal story of loss, love, and a respect for elders, something that she says is a marginalized story and highly important to native culture.
The concern Gladstone is weighing right now though are the optics of promoting a film while everyone else is on strike. She acknowledges she’s in a “strange position,” but is excited to see how other grassroots films like hers will shape future union agreements and the stories that people seek out.
“The hope is that [this] will this be a good resurgence for independent film, and I’m so grateful that SAG sees it that way, too. It gives us a lot more leverage as a union to say that there are people that believe in the work that actors do, that believe in the work that writers do, that will meet the demands that our union wants,” Gladstone said. “That’s part of what this whole strike is about, is the storyteller is the heart of it. There’s a lot of ways to be a storyteller in the kind of work that we do, and they’re all vital, they’re all important, and they’re all worth having a good quality of life.”

,'Barbenheimer' opens to 4th-biggest box office weekend in history,"The ""Barbenheimer"" box office results are in for ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" opening weekend.","It was a giant blowout party in cinemas for ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" this weekend.
The movie event of the summer, dubbed ""Barbenheimer,"" officially kicked off and moviegoers flocked to theaters to watch at least one of the films -- with thousands pulling a double feature.
During its opening weekend, ""Barbie"" took in $155 million domestically, according to The Numbers, a film industry data website that tracks box office revenue. ""Oppenheimer"" took in $80.5 million domestically.

Both films were expected to continue to have great opening numbers, but their combined $235.5 million domestic total made for the biggest opening weekend since before the pandemic.
Not only that, but it is the fourth-biggest box office weekend in history, and the success of ""Barbie"" in particular is notable as Greta Gerwig now holds the record for having the biggest opening for a film directed by a woman.
Heading into opening weekend, there were more than 200,000 tickets sold for same-day screenings of ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer,"" a representative for the National Association of Theatre Owners told ""Good Morning America.""
“This was a phenomenal experience for people who love movies on the big screen,” Michael O’Leary, the President & CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners, said. “It was a truly historic weekend and continues the positive box office momentum of 2023. More importantly, it proves once again that America loves going to the movies to see great films. People recognized that something special was happening and they wanted to be a part of it.""
""This weekend is a shining example of how there is simply no substitute for seeing a motion picture in the cinema,"" O'Leary added.
On Friday, AMC CEO Adam Arons shared an update that more than 60,000 AMC Stubs Members had purchased same-day double feature tickets from the entertainment company.
""Barbenheimer"" went viral for the two starkly different movie experiences sharing the same release date.
While Gerwig's ""Barbie"" taps into the world of the iconic Barbie doll that many know and love, ""Oppenheimer,"" which is directed by Christopher Nolan, tells the darker, more intense story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic bomb.

In the weeks leading up to the release of the films, prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike that began on July 13, actors and filmmakers from both movies encouraged their followers to go see both movies on July 21.
Earlier this month, Gerwig and ""Barbie"" star Margot Robbie posed for a photo in front of an ""Oppenheimer"" film poster.
Actor Cillian Murphy, who plays the titular role in ""Oppenheimer,"" also told IGN in an interview earlier this month that he ""can't wait to see"" the ""Barbie"" film.
""I'll be going to see 'Barbie,'"" he said. ""I think it's just great for the industry and for audiences that we have two amazing films by amazing filmmakers coming out the same day. Could spend a whole day in the cinema, what's better than that?""
The full run time for both films, back-to-back, is around five hours -- not including trailers.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vR01BL0N1bHR1cmUvYmFyYmVuaGVpbWVyLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyL3N0b3J5P2lkPTEwMTM1NzMyM9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vYW1wL0dNQS9DdWx0dXJlL2JhcmJlbmhlaW1lci1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWJhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci9zdG9yeT9pZD0xMDEzNTczMjM?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Barbenheimer is Blowing Up — TVREV,"How the films are dominating theatrical movie TV advertising in July, plus 
a look at the resurgence of iconic Barbie songs.","Digging in a bit deeper, Universal Pictures has put an estimated $24.7 million in media value promoting Oppenheimer on national TV since the trailer first aired, resulting in 1.9 billion household TV ad impressions.
By comparison, Warner Bros. put a total of $8.7 million in national TV ad media value advertising Barbie, generating 1.2 billion household TV ad impressions — but that’s just for the trailer, and doesn’t take into account the myriad cross-promotions going on.
Chevrolet, Progressive and Candy Crush are three brands that have run TV ads with some sort of Barbie movie tie-in. Chevrolet’s ad for the ’24 Blazer EV even features quick cameos by cast members including Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling and America Ferrera.
When you add in the above cross-promotion impressions and estimated TV ad media value, Barbie lands at 3.3 million TV ad impressions with $20.4 million in estimated media value.
Barbie’s premiere has also sparked a resurgence in streams of related iconic songs. According to Songtradr, Nicki Minaj’s “Barbie World” (with Ice Spice & Aqua) has seen Spotify streams soar over the last month, from 12.2 million to 65.2 million.
The original “Barbie Girl” Aqua song has also benefited from the popularity of the movie and marketing around it. Despite originally coming out in 1996, the song has been streamed well over 10 million times on Spotify since the beginning of July already. It’s also been featured in nearly 60K TikTok videos over the last week alone.
Barbie trailers are also driving shopping behaviors, as data from Tubular Labs points out.
Pulling from Tubular’s consumer insights, we can see how Warner Bros. Pictures social video audiences increased their shopping affinity for Barbie products on Amazon following the release of the Barbie movie trailer. Affinity increased from 1.8x more likely than the norm in March 2023, to 4.8x more likely in April, and it’s remained at a similarly increased affinity in the months since.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR2cmV2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2JhcmJlbmhlaW1lci1pcy1ibG93aW5nLXVwbmJzcNIBRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR2cmV2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2JhcmJlbmhlaW1lci1pcy1ibG93aW5nLXVwbmJzcD9mb3JtYXQ9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" and Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" brought moviegoers back to the theaters in record numbers this weekend.","“Barbenheimer” didn’t just work – it spun box office gold. The social media-fueled fusion of Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” brought moviegoers back to the theaters in record numbers this weekend, vastly outperforming projections and giving a glimmer of hope to the lagging exhibition business, amid the sobering backdrop of strikes.
Warner Bros.' ""Barbie"" claimed the top spot with a massive $155 million in ticket sales from North American theaters from 4,243 locations, surpassing ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" (as well as every Marvel movie this year) as the biggest opening of the year and breaking the first weekend record for a film directed by a woman. Universal’s ""Oppenheimer"" also soared past expectations, taking in $80.5 million from 3,610 theaters in the U.S. and Canada, marking Nolan’s biggest non-Batman debut and one of the best-ever starts for an R-rated biographical drama.
It’s also the first time that one movie opened to more than $100 million and another movie opened to more than $80 million in the same weekend. When all is settled, it will likely turn out to be the fourth biggest box office weekend of all time with over $300 million industrywide. And all this in a marketplace that increasingly curved towards intellectual property-driven winner takes all.
The ""Barbenheimer"" phenomenon may have started out as good-natured competition between two aesthetic opposites, but, as many hoped, both movies benefitted in the end.
The only real casualty was ""Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part I,"" which despite strong reviews and a healthy opening weekend fell 64% in weekend two. Overshadowed by the ""Barbenheimer"" glow as well as the blow of losing its IMAX screens to ""Oppenheimer,"" the Tom Cruise vehicle added $19.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $118.8 million.

""Barbenheimer"" is not merely counterprogramming either. But while a certain section of enthusiastic moviegoers overlapped, in aggregate the audiences were distinct.
Women drove the historic ""Barbie"" opening, making up 65% of the audience, according to PostTrak, and 40% of ticket buyers were under the age of 25 for the PG-13 rated movie.
""It’s just a joyous time in the world. This is history in so many ways"" said Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros.’ president of domestic distribution. ""I think this marketing campaign is one for the ages that people will be talking about forever.""
""Oppenheimer"" audiences meanwhile were 62% male and 63% over the age of 25, with a somewhat surprising 32% that were between the ages of 18 and 24.
""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" scored well with critics with 90% and 94% on Rotten Tomatoes, respectively, and audiences who gave both films an A CinemaScore. And social media has been awash with reactions and ""takes"" all weekend – good, bad, problematic and everywhere in between – the kind of organic, event cinema, watercooler debate that no marketing budget can buy.
""The 'Barbenheimer' thing was a real boost for both movies,” Goldstein said. “It is a crowning achievement for all of us.""
Chris Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' trailer has doomsday clock, sad Einstein
""Oppenheimer"" had the vast majority (80%) of premium large format screens at its disposal. Some 25 theaters in North America boasted IMAX 70mm screenings (Nolan’s preferred format ), most of which were completely sold out all weekend — accounting for 2% of the total gross. Theaters even scrambled to add more to accommodate the demand including 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. screenings, which also sold out.
""Nolan’s films are truly cinematic events,"" said Jim Orr, Universal's president of domestic distribution.
IMAX showings alone made up 26% of the domestic gross (or $21.1 million) from only 411 screens and 20% of the global gross, and ""Oppenheimer"" will have at least a three-week run on those high-demand screens.
""This is a phenomenon beyond compare,"" said Rich Gelfond, the CEO of IMAX, in a statement. ""Around the world, we’ve seen sellouts at 4:00 a.m. shows and people traveling hours across borders to see 'Oppenheimer' in IMAX 70mm.""
This is the comeback weekend Hollywood has been dreaming of since the pandemic. There have been big openings and successes – ""Spider-Man: No Way Home,"" ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" among them, but the fact that two movies are succeeding at the same time is notable.
""It was a truly historic weekend and continues the positive box office momentum of 2023,"" said Michael O'Leary, president & CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. ""People recognized that something special was happening and they wanted to be a part of it.""
And yet in the background looms disaster as Hollywood studios continue to squabble with striking actors and writers over a fair contract.
""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" were the last films on the 2023 calendar to get a massive, global press tour. Both went right up to the 11th hour, squeezing in every last moment with their movie stars. ""Oppenheimer"" even pushed up its London premiere by an hour, knowing that Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy would have to leave to symbolically join the picket lines by the time the movie began.
Without movie stars to promote their films, studios have started pushing some fall releases, including the high-profile Zendaya tennis drama ""Challengers.""
But for now, it's simply a positive story that could even continue for weeks to come.
""There could be a sequel next weekend,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. ""The FOMO factor will rachet up because of this monumental box office event centered around the movie theater experience.""

his brilliant, bruising take on the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the dark knight of the atomic age. Murphy's pale blue eyes become a path into a tortured soul as Nolan—a true film artist in works as diverse as ""Memento"" and ""Dunkirk,"" creates a new film classic.
Based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherman's 2005 biography, ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,"" Nolan's three-hour-plus masterpiece fills up our senses with the details of quantum mechanics to ignite the story of an American theoretical physicist who helped invent the ultimate weapon of mass destruction and lived to regret it.
Murphy's performance, flawless in every detail, encompasses how Oppenheimer's Manhattan Project team relocated to Los Alamos, New Mexico, to accelerate development of the weapon that would help end WW2 through the cataclysmic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, and usher in the threat of nuclear annihilation that's only escalated over time.

Nolan uses radio reports to detail the effects of those bombs, saving the eye-searing visuals for the 1945 Trinity test in the New Mexico desert to bring home the destruction being unleashed. The superb sound design in which silence alternates with waves of reverberation to bring the unthinkable to devastating life is unmissable, unforgettable and scary as hell.
Shot with Imax cameras by the great Hoyte van Hoytema, ""Oppenheimer"" deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with a state-of-the-art sound system. This despite the fact that the film is often a series of debates among scientists arguing in close-ups that find endless fascination in the geography of the human face.
The actors in ""Oppenheimer could not be better. They include Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves, the blustering military supervisor at Los Alamos, Benny Safdie as Edward Teller, who pushed to develop the even more dangerous hydrogen bomb, and Gary Oldman in a sensational cameo as Harry Truman, the president who ordered the use of the bomb on Japan and dismissed Oppenheimer as a ""crybaby"" for objecting.
Oppy, as intimates called him, had a personal life that mirrored his professional turbulence. Though he mingled with such greats as Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), and Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), Oppy's sexual entanglements, notably with psychologist Jean Tatlock (a mesmerizing Florence Pugh) made the wrong kind of headlines.

His marriage to biologist Katherine ""Kitty"" Puening (Emily Blunt), an alcoholic suffering from postpartum depression, added to the chaos. Kudos to Blunt for building the role with a fierce independence as Kitty defended Oppy from the political gamesmanship that plagued him.
In the riveting last section of the film, Nolan shows us Oppenheimer fighting against those eager to discredit him, first in the Sen. Joseph McCarthy commie witch-hunts of 1954 and five years later during the Senate confirmation hearings for the nomination of former Atomic Energy Commission chair Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) as secretary of commerce.
Nolan shoots both these sections in a vivid black-and-white to underscore the resentment Strauss feels for Oppenheimer for hiding his Jewish roots, communist proclivities and fears about government backed nuclear energy.
In a film of standout performances, Downey delivers a tour de force of festering animosity that blows the doors off. All his time in the Marvel universe might lead you to forget that Downey is one of the best actors on the planet. Here's a reminder. Prepare to be wowed.
""Oppenheimer,"" set to Ludwig Göransson's thundering orchestral score, is one of the best movies you'll see anywhere. With Nolan's extraordinary talent shining on its highest beams, the film emerges as a monumental achievement on the march into screen history.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vR01BL0N1bHR1cmUvcmV2aWV3LW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWVtZXJnZXMtbW9udW1lbnRhbC1hY2hpZXZlbWVudC1tYXJjaC1zY3JlZW4taGlzdG9yeS9zdG9yeT9pZD0xMDE1MjQyNjjSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvR01BL0N1bHR1cmUvcmV2aWV3LW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWVtZXJnZXMtbW9udW1lbnRhbC1hY2hpZXZlbWVudC1tYXJjaC1zY3JlZW4taGlzdG9yeS9zdG9yeT9pZD0xMDE1MjQyNjg?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 02:41:00+00:00,Who Was J. Robert Oppenheimer? True Story Behind Christopher Nolan's Film,Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the creation of the Atomic Bomb. Here's the true story of his life and death.,"J. ROBERT Oppenheimer’s public persona is as murky as his legacy is massive—quite literally world-shifting. Oppenheimer, at the center of Christopher Nolan’s new biopic of the same name (now in theaters), is primarily known as a leading physicist and leader of the Manhattan Project, which created the atomic bomb (he’s also been referred to as the “father” of the atomic bomb), consequentially deployed by the United States in World War II.
The scientist is played by Irish actor Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later, Batman Begins) in Oppenheimer, which, in typical Nolan fashion, is a visually and sonically expansive (and expensive) undertaking of its own, with a reported $100 million production budget and “gold standard” IMAX filming.
Which is to say, a whole lot more people are about to learn about the controversial geek who happened to be key in unleashing nuclear weapons upon the world. But Oppenheimer’s personal life and politics, more complicated than they might first seem, are worth teasing out. Whether you’re grabbing tickets to Nolan’s latest, skipping it, or combining it with Barbie for the oddest viral double bill of the year, here’s what you need to know about the film’s elusive subject, why he matters, and how he’s often misunderstood.
Who was J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man behind the atomic bomb, really?
Hulton Archive // Getty Images
He was born Julius Robert Oppenheimer on April 22, 1904 in New York City. His father, a German immigrant, helped make his family’s considerable fortune working in textile importing, while his mother was a painter. Oppenheimer grew up in a Manhattan apartment reportedly decorated with artwork by Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, and Paul Gauguin (casual!).
Oppenheimer became an ace student, and while an undergrad at Harvard University, excelled in (of course) physics, but also chemistry, Latin, Greek, poetry, and Eastern philosophy. He followed up Harvard by doing research at the University of Cambridge in England, but uninspired by rote lab work, moved to the University of Göttingen in Germany, to study then-revolutionary quantum physics with pioneers in the field. He got his PhD, and, quickly, a sterling reputation. He accepted dual offers to teach at both Caltech in Los Angeles and the University of California at Berkeley, splitting his time and influencing a generation of top physicists.

“His lectures were a great experience, for experimental as well as theoretical physicists,” the late physicist Hans Bethe said of Oppenheimer. “In addition to a superb literary style, he brought to them a degree of sophistication in physics previously unknown in the United States. Here was a man who obviously understood all the deep secrets of quantum mechanics, and yet made it clear that the most important questions were unanswered. His earnestness and deep involvement gave his research students the same sense of challenge. He never gave his students the easy and superficial answers but trained them to appreciate and work on the deep problems.”
While Oppenheimer dabbled with Communism in the 1930s, meeting Communist students and supporting the left-leaning Republican side in the Spanish Civil War, he never actually joined the Communist Party. Yet this dalliance would come back to bite him (more on that below). It should be noted that Communism was widely seen as a viable alternative to fascism at the time, and Oppenheimer was reportedly enraged at the suffering of Jewish relatives in Nazi Germany.
But the start of World War II would put Oppenheimer’s political interests on the back burner, and upend the trajectories of physicists in ways no could have imagined.
How did the Manhattan Project come about?
Historical // Getty Images
Following the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939, renowned scientists including Albert Einstein (yes, that Einstein) warned U.S. officials of the grave danger should the Nazis be the first to create a then-theoretical nuclear bomb.
Enter Oppenheimer: The U.S. Army marshaled American and British physicists to figure out how nuclear energy could be distilled into unparalleled military force. The code name for the effort was the Manhattan Project, and Oppenheimer was chosen as administrator. He oversaw several covert labs, and famously constructed one in the middle-of-nowhere desert plateau of Los Alamos, New Mexico.
When did the atomic bombs actually go off?
Indeed, the Manhattan Project was a success on its own terms: Work in Los Alamos (as depicted in Oppenheimer) led to the initial test nuclear explosion, on July 16, 1945, in a remote area of New Mexico near Alamogordo. (For what it’s worth, according to the Los Alamos National Laboratory , the “atomic” or “atom” bomb refers to a bomb “that relies on fission, or the splitting of heavy nuclei into smaller units, releasing energy.” Hence why they’re also called nuclear bombs.)
Historical // Getty Images
The unleashing of the atom bomb actually came after Germany had surrendered in WWII. Still, the U.S. dropped two nuclear bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Japan, in August 1945, with Japan being an active Axis power against the American and British Allies. Those nukes were the first, and to this day only, nuclear bombs used in warfare.
What happened to Oppenheimer and his career after the atom bomb?
Only a couple months following the bomb drop in Japan, Oppenheimer resigned from his Manhattan Project post. In 1947, he became the head of the Institute for Advanced Study , a community of scholars, and also served as chairman of the government agency known as the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) until 1952. He openly opposed development of the hydrogen bomb, another far more powerful nuclear weapon that came to fruition but has never been deployed in battle.

By 1953, Oppenheimer’s favorable view in the eyes of U.S. officials began to crumble. Amid the Cold War-era Red Scare, he was alerted to a critical military security report that brought up his past associations with Communists, along with his opposition to the H-bomb.
Oppenheimer faced further scrutiny in a headline-making security investigation. In 1953, though cleared from accusations of treason, he lost his access to military secrets and his AEC position. He subsequently got the cold shoulder from certain corners, and reportedly never quite recovered his spirit.
Was Oppenheimer a good guy, or a freaky “destroyer of worlds”?
Oppenheimer’s thoughts on harnessing science for destruction, a mission with which he is inextricably bound, are more nuanced that they might appear on the surface.
“We knew the world would not be the same,” he recalled of the first detonation of the atomic bomb under his stewardship. “A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent.”
And okay, yes, he did say the ominous words widely attributed to him: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” But it is a quotation.
Long interested in Eastern philosophy, Oppenheimer had turned to Hinduism to help make sense of what he had wrought upon the globe. The famous, or infamous, “destroyer of worlds” line comes from Hindu scripture and is poorly understood. As Wired writes, in Hindu thinking, “the great god is not only involved in the creation, but also the dissolution.” The line Oppenheimer quoted in light of the atomic bomb refers to a kind of “world-destroying” event that is ultimately left in the hands of the divine. That might not provide any easy answers, but it’s pretty clear that Oppenheimer’s interest in this spiritual perspective was sincere.
How did Oppenheimer die?

Oppenheimer died rather early in life, from throat cancer, at the age of 62. He passed on February 18, 1967, in Princeton, New Jersey. But he had been, at least, vindicated in some ways by the U.S. government following his Cold War persecution. In 1963, President Johnson awarded the physicist the highest honor of the AEC, called the Fermi Award, honoring the most formidable scientists for lifetime achievement in utilization of energy. And no one will seriously talk about nuclear bombs, or watch Oppenheimer, without at least briefly flashing to his momentous life and career.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNoZWFsdGguY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYTQ0NTY1MTIzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXRydWUtc3RvcnktZXhwbGFpbmVkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-07-25 22:00:00+00:00,Fans Call Out Christopher Nolan Over 'Oppenheimer' Historical Error,Eagle-eyed fans noticed a historical error in 'Oppenheimer' involving the American flag -- and are calling out director Christopher Nolan for the mistake.,"As one half of Barbenheimer, along with Greta Gerwig's Barbie, Oppenheimer is already one of the summer's biggest movies (and there are box office receipts to prove it). The historical biopic stars Cillian Murphy as the eponymous theoretical physicist, known first and foremost for leading the creation of the atomic bomb. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt also star in the movie, as Oppenheimer's mistress and wife, respectively, in a cast that also includes the likes of Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Gary Oldman, and Josh Hartnett, among others playing real-life figures.
The film, directed by Christopher Nolan, follows Oppenheimer through his research during World War II, and also covers his personal life and internal struggle over his creation of the deadly weapon. Despite the dark subject matter, audiences and critics both love the film. Rotten Tomatoes lists the film's critic score as 94%. And the ""Barbenheimer"" trend is only increasing the number of filmgoers interested in seeing the film, sometimes on the exact same day as Barbie.
But while some fans may be focused on the film's controversial sex scenes (yes, somehow Oppenheimer had time to have multiple affairs), others have pointed out another moment in the movie worth talking about. In the movie, there's a scene set in 1945—which has led to some viewers catching a major historical inaccuracy. While most moviegoers won't notice, those who are fans of World War II history, or just have a good eye, may realize historical detail. History buffs who have yet to see the film, beware.
So what exactly is this historical mistake made in Oppenheimer? Is it that Starbucks cup in Game of Thrones? Or is it something that messes with the plot of the film? Here's what we know about Oppenheimer and its historical issue.
What Historical Error Did Oppenheimer Make?
In a 1945 scene, we see Oppenheimer standing among a crowd. People have noticed within the scene an American flag is waving–but not the correct American flag.
Back in 1945, there were only 48 states in the United States, as Alaska and Hawaii had yet to become part of the country. According to CNN, the first flag to be flown with 50 stars was in 1960. Twitter users are pointing out the inaccuracy, and sharing that it's a widespread complaint among those who've seen the film. That being said, many still agree the film is a masterpiece despite the flaw.
But other fans argue the inclusion of the flag was intentional, as Oppenheimer actually has two timelines–one during the creation of the bomb in 1945, and the other in 1954 as the scientist is stripped of security clearance when appearing in front of the US Atomic Energy Commission due to his suspected Communist leanings.
It's possible Nolan and crew made the decision to have the 50-star flag to show the world from Oppenheimer's perspective in the far future. The scientist passed away in 1967, so he did live through the U.S. gaining those additional two states.
Whether intentional or not, we can all agree Oppenheimer is worth the watch.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNoZWFsdGguY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYTQ0NjQxNTYwL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWhpc3RvcmljYWwtZXJyb3ItYW1lcmljYW4tZmxhZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,5-Minute Oppenheimer Trailer Gives Best Look Yet At Nolan's Atomic Bomb Drama,"""I don't know if we can be trusted with such a weapon, but I know the Nazis can't.""","Christopher Nolan's next movie, Oppenheimer, releases in theaters later this month, but you don't have to wait a minute longer to see some new footage from the World War II drama.
Universal has released what it's calling an ""opening look"" at the movie. The video includes five minutes of footage from various parts of the film. As such, if you're planning to watch the movie and want to see it with fresh eyes, it might be best to avoid this particular video.
The trailer was edited by Oppenheimer editor Jennifer Lame, and it offers the best look yet at the film and its story and scope. It begins in the 1950s with a black-and-white scene where J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is interrogated by Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) on behalf of the US government in the aftermath of World War II and the dropping of the atomic bomb he helped create.
The rest of the movie takes place in the 1940s when Oppenheimer put together a team to help create the world's first atomic bomb as part of the super-secretive Manhattan Project. The team built a small town where scientists and engineers worked in secret at the Los Alamos Laboratory.
The trailer also shines a ligh on what Oppenheimer might have been thinking throughout the process of developing the bomb. He and the US government wanted a weapon to help end the war, and it seems Oppenheimer knew he was wading into dark waters.
""I don't know if we can be trusted with such a weapon, but I know the Nazis can't,"" Murphy's Oppenheimer says in the video.
Oppenheimer will feature a recreation of the Trinity Test, which marked the world's first atomic bomb explosion in July 1945, and Nolan pulled it off without CG. The next month, the US would drop atomic bombs, Fat Man and Little Boy, on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing hundreds of thousands of people, many civilians, and contributing to the end of World War II.
In addition to Murphy as Oppenheimer and Downey Jr. as Strauss, the movie stars Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, Matt Damon as Leslie Groves Jr., and Gary Oldman as Harry Truman. Florence Pugh, Jack Quaid, Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek, Alden Ehrenreich, David Dastmalchian, and Casey Affleck also appear in the movie.
Oppenheimer comes to theaters on July 21, 2023, which is the same day that Greta Gerwig's Barbie arrives.

2023-07-24 17:35:00+00:00,The Barbenheimer Double Feature Changed My Life,We love cinema so much that we went to see Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig's Barbie in one day. Here's a recap of the Barbenheimer experience.,"WHEN I WALKED up to the movie theater at 10:00 in the morning, the first thing I saw was a man in a fedora. Mind you, this is New York City, where the weather for weeks has been sitting in the mid-80s with humidity at levels that don't feel too far off from a fancy gym's sauna. This man wasn't just wearing a fedora, either: he also had on a tightly-fit button-down shirt, pinstripe slacks, and generally seemed to have a bit of world-weary demeanor on his face. It was clear what was happening here—this man was neither a glutton for sweat-based punishment nor someone going through life thinking they're a 1920s detective. No, this person was dressed up as J. Robert Oppenheimer (a strange choice, for sure) and taking part in (at least the first half of) what has become the grand cinematic endeavor known as ""Barbenheimer."" And it's the reason I was there too.
As soon as it became clear that both Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig's Barbie would both be releasing on July 21, 2023, the narrative, really, wrote itself. Here we have a pair of movies that couldn't possibly be more diametrically opposed: one a three-hour epic biopic about the brilliant scientist who brought the hellish curse of nuclear weapons to the world, the other a bright, bubbly, feel-good comedy led by a pair of our most charismatic stars. If there were only two personalities in the world, these two films would represent the dividing line.
But, luckily, there are more than two personalities in the world. And many of us out there have a personality that includes the trait ""likes movies."" As a fan of both Christopher Nolan's 20+ years of ambitious mind-warping mastery and Greta Gerwig's trajectory from independent film star to Oscar-nominated screenwriter to major studio talent... I wanted to see both. Add a cast full of top-notch stars to both movies... and you can understand why ""Barbenheimer"" became such a sensation. Not everyone is just darkness or just pink. Most of us have shades of both, and, guess what, by proxy, want to see both of these movies.

July 21 wasn't the first time ever that two movies were released on the same day. Hell, for some reason when I think ""Double Feature,"" I remember 2006, when at age 13 I snuck into Kevin Smith's Clerks II before shuffling across the hall to watch the world-class comedy You, Me, and Dupree. But despite what must be countless others having memories and experiences like that, the world basically reacted like this was the first time—the films combined to make the first bow for ""Barbenheimer"" into the fourth-biggest box office weekend of all-time, with Barbie making $162 million in its opening weekend and Oppenheimer making $82 million. These are both exceptionally successful figures. With this weekend making so much money—and the SAG and WGA strikes ongoing—it should come as a great inflection point for change.
First of all, it's imperative that the people responsible for making this weekend what it became (the writers and performers) get what they seek and what they deserve. But it's also imperative to note that if we, the people, get what we want—interesting movies made by filmmakers with vision and a voice—that we're going to go out to see it, possibly even in multiples.
Mr. Fake Oppenheimer was the first costumed person I saw, but far, far, far from the last. Walking around the streets of the Upper West Side, it became very obvious what each group of friends' plans were for the day. All wearing pink and saying ""Hi Barbie!"" to each other was one easy tell. A shirt split down the middle, black and explosive on one side and pink and bright on the other—labeled ""Barbenheimer"" was another. Personally, I was rocking a pink short-sleeve button down, and had absolutely no regrets.

By the time my first movie started—Oppenheimer in 70 MM IMAX—at 10:30, I already had two coffees. I knew it was going to be a long day, and needed all the energy juices flowing in me that I could get. I also knew this was a risky proposition, given that I was about to step into a 3-hour, detail-oriented movie. I tried using the restroom before the movie began, but my efforts were futile; about halfway through the movie, I had to miss the majority of a scene featuring Casey Affleck's character because I just could not hold it anymore. No one ever claimed that a ""Barbenheimer"" day would be without a few road bumps.
Despite missing most of a brief scene featuring an Oscar-winning actor due to a bladder-related matter, I still found Oppenheimer to be an utterly brilliant movie (the ending absolutely floored me), and one that I otherwise would've spent the rest of my day thinking about. But there was more to be done. There would be a two-hour reprieve in my day, meant for lunch but also for walking around. At this point, though, the two coffees, hours of staring at a screen, and not nearly enough hydration had given me the true enemy of enjoying a day at the cinema: a big headache.
My hope was that lunch, some waters, and even a Gatorade purchased at a stand on the street would make the pressure forming inside my skull subside, but sometimes things just don't turn out the way you hope. My time to watch Barbie had arrived, and so that meant back to the theater.
Warner Bros.
The theater felt crowded at 10:00 in the morning, but that was nothing compared to the charged energy filling the space at 3:30 (my showing was at 4:00). My theater was filled with a sea of pink, and when the movie began to roll, you could tell that this was a fired-up theater. There were cheers for a trailer featuring Timothée Chalamet as Willy Wonka—a weird thing, considering the movie looks... well, it looks OK. But I made perfect sense of it when I remembered that a pair of Timmy's formative roles—in Lady Bird and Little Women—came in the movies of Greta Gerwig. This was a theater that knew exactly whose movie they were coming to see.
Before we get into Barbie the movie, we should also talk a bit about some of the conversation around Barbie the movie. There's been a scattershot conservative campaign attempting to paint the film as ""anti-male,"" and that simply couldn't be any further from the truth. What Gerwig has always done in her work is paint no characters, nor groups of characters, with a broad brush, instead looking individually at specific circumstances. In Barbie—very much a satire, and a funny one at that—Gerwig manages to make legitimate points about both women and men. These are points to be made, yes, but they're also jokes. Don't take yourself so seriously.
It's also a movie, we should add, that did exactly what it needed to do. It was a bright, fun, enjoyable 2 hours, led by an unbelievable cast; anyone who's seen The Wolf of Wall Street or Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood knows exactly what Margot Robbie can do, and she was predictably perfect, able to balance a laugh and a cry with the best of them. Ryan Gosling, as ""Stereotypical Ken,"" should genuinely get an Oscar nomination. And Gerwig's script (written with her creative and personal partner Noah Baumbach) lives up to her reputation, far smarter and with greater attention-to-detail than a story based on a toy has any business being.

The theater was laughing. The theater, at a certain point, may have been crying. When the final credits started to roll, it was hard to imagine that anyone was having anything less than a great time.
Which is to say: for a couple hours, I managed to numb out the headache that was rapidly taking over my head. It was a little after 6:00, and I had seen both movies. To reference another cinematic series that hit theaters earlier this month, my mission was accomplished.
""Barbenheimer"" could ultimately turn out to be a one-of-a-kind occurrence, and a memory that will live forever in amber. In 30 years, we may talk about both of these movies the same way that we talk about movies that are 30 years old now, like Jurassic Park or Groundhog Day. But does anyone remember what days those movies came out? Ultimately, ""Barbenheimer"" will probably prove to be something that we—the generation of people who are consciously able to do it, or, at least, remember it—hold onto forever. And something that others will just have to hear us, like right now, talk about.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNoZWFsdGguY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYTQ0NjI3NDA2L2JhcmJlbmhlaW1lci1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbW92aWUtZXhwZXJpZW5jZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The only screenings affected will be IMAX 70MM showings, which are only playing at 19 theaters across the United States. Most IMAX theaters will not be showing the 70MM version, so make sure to check before buying your tickets.
“The sharpness and the clarity and the depth of the image is unparalleled,” director Christopher Nolan told AP about screening the movie on 70MM. “The headline, for me, is by shooting on IMAX 70mm film, you’re really letting the screen disappear. You’re getting a feeling of 3D without the glasses. You’ve got a huge screen and you’re filling the peripheral vision of the audience. You’re immersing them in the world of the film.”
So, why won’t the screenings have trailers?

2023-08-07 22:00:00+00:00,The Ending of Oppenheimer Is the Start of a Horror Story,Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer ends with a pivotal conversation between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein. Here's what to know about the film's chilling final scene.,"The following story contains spoilers for Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer (2023).
SURE, CHRISTOPHER NOLAN'S Oppenheimer is, ostensibly, about the creation of the atomic bomb—the most powerful and scientifically-advanced weapon ever used in modern warfare. But Nolan's film, a three-hour epic that features career-best work from Cillian Murphy as the titular scientist and probably about a dozen others, is more than just that. It's a story that follows a path of evolution; how can something go from an idea, to a plan, to a nightmare?
Nolan's movies tend to cross all sorts of genres—his Batman trilogy is somewhere between action and adventure, Interstellar brings a sci-fi entrée with a side dish of melodrama, The Prestige is a period mystery, and Dunkirk is a heart-pounding war film unlike any other you've seen. Oppenheimer appears on its face to be a fairly traditional biographical drama, and, for most of its lengthy runtime, it is one. But the film's final act, just like the characters in Nolan's The Prestige, pulls one hell of a trick: Oppenheimer turns out to be, at least the beginnings of what could be considered Nolan's first—and forever most relevant— horror movie.
The first two hours of Oppenheimer generally focus on establishing both J. Robert Oppenheimer's genius as a physicist and his abilities as a leader; people believe in what he knows and has to say, and tend to come on board when he expresses ideas and plans. As he is recruited by the U.S. Government (led by a high-ranking official played by Matt Damon) to create what would ultimately become the atomic bomb, he brings numerous other incredibly-accomplished scientific minds along with him. The movie refers, at one point, to the ""cult"" of Oppenheimer; that's the degree to which the people around him believed in him, and should be credited as a major part as to how the bomb's development was ultimately successful.
Things starkly shift when the Trinity test is successful and the characters learn that the bomb is successful. From there, Oppenheimer goes from having all the power in a world of his own making to having none in someone else's. We learn through an off-screen voice that a pair of atomic bombs have been dropped on enemy territories in Japan: Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Oppenheimer is left to grapple with an immense pain and destruction that he can only begin to imagine based on second-hand tellings and reports.
""The whole film is about consequences,"" Nolan told Vulture. ""The delayed onset of consequences that people often forget—the film is full of different representations of that. Some visceral, some more narrative.""
Oppenheimer's final hour, particularly as Oppenheimer deals with the fallout of Trinity and realizes the consequence and aftermath of contributed to and helped create, is the key to understanding the movie's heart-stopping conclusion.
How did Lewis Strauss figure into Oppenheimer's ending?
Universal
The movie is told throughout from different vantage points, and so there are a few recurring moments, storylines, and happenings that Nolan dives into and occasionally pulls away from. Two of the most important of these are the recurring appearances of a pair of characters who are introduced in the same early, 1947-set, black and white scene: Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), and Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). Early on, the 1947 scene finds Strauss offering Oppenheimer a cushy post-Trinity job at Princeton, where he offers to introduce the scientist to Einstein, who's on site. Oppenheimer says he already knows him, and heads out for a quick chat. We don't find out the contents of this conversation until the very end of the movie, but we immediately see Einstein appear to shun Strauss; he won't even look at him.
It's the first of several minor slights that Strauss attributes to Oppenheimer that eventually leads him to orchestrating the revoking of his security clearance and destruction of his reputation. Strauss is shown throughout the film to be a careerist, a career bureaucrat who, while he does seem to have the best interests of the nation in mind, has absolutely zero idea or understanding of moderation. And when Oppenheimer won't give him or his ideas the time of day, he decides the only way to deal with this is to find a way to take him down.
Strauss' story, throughout the film, is framed in black and white testimony scenes as a senate hearing works to confirm him as President Eisenhower's Secretary of Commerce. Throughout these scenes, he's paired with an unnamed Senate aide (Alden Ehrenreich) who eventually tells this man (one Nolan clearly sees as significant, yes, but figuratively small) what his massive ego never did about the conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein that so peeved him: perhaps they were talking about something more important than you.
What were Einstein and Oppenheimer really talking about?
Universal
Here's where the horror of it all comes in. The aide was right: what Oppenheimer and Einstein were talking about had absolutely nothing at all to do with Strauss, and rather with the way their ideas had evolved into things far beyond their control. “You all thought that I’d lost the ability to understand what I’d started,” Einstein tells his friend, referring to the fact that his own research on quantum mechanics—which he later pushed back on applying to scientific advancement—was the building block upon which everything Oppenheimer and his contemporaries started their broad research. “Now it’s your turn to deal with the consequences of your achievement.”
The entire third hour of Oppenheimer—everything that comes after the Trinity test—is about Oppenheimer's guilt and desperate need to amend for the horror that he can only even begin to comprehend that he's unleashed upon the world. Every way he turns, he's faced with something that doesn't comfort his mind, and, in fact, makes it feel worse; the horrible encounter with President Harry Truman (Gary Oldman) perhaps the best example.
Universal
Oppenheimer asks Einstein to remember a conversation they had in the past—one we saw discussed earlier in the movie—where calculations indicated a possibility that a chain reaction from detonating the atomic bomb could wind up destroying the entire world. ""I remember it well,"" Einstein tells him. ""What of it?""
And in one of the most jarring, heart-stopping final lines of the last 20 years, Oppenheimer responds: ""I believe we did.""
Murphy absolutely crushes the dread and utter hopelessness of Oppenheimer's delivery, and as we watch, we feel the same way—because we know it's true.
Suddenly, Nolan flashes forward to what's either meant as our present, or the future that Oppenheimer was imagining. We see an arsenal of nuclear missiles. We see water droplets, perhaps meant to stand for the even-more powerful hydrogen bomb that Oppenheimer strongly opposed. And we see a zoomed out view of Earth, one country at a time, being enveloped in the flames of a nuclear fires.
It's rarely at the forefront of our minds, but the world lives its life in constant fear of the weapons that do exist that could end our lives, along with millions others, at a moment's notice.
J. Robert Oppenheimer couldn't see 80 years into the future; this isn't Inception or Interstellar. This isn't a sci-fi movie. But he could see far enough.

,Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” Trailer Teases Something Explosive this Summer,,"Christopher Nolan’s upcoming movie “Oppenheimer” is scheduled to release on July 21. Its first trailer was unveiled on May 8. While the audience can anticipate what is yet to come, the trailer successfully tells the personal, human story of the vast array of scientists and military personnel who worked on the Manhattan Project with Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) by illustrating their sacrifices and commitment to their nation.
The trailer for the movie opens with the crackling of dosimeters detecting radiation and sets the stage for the World War II landscape with Oppenheimer and a military officer Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) as they lead the Manhattan Project. As a part of this project, the top scientists and engineers around the United States were recruited and located in a new town set in an isolated location that would be home to these scientists and their families as they developed nuclear weapons. With high stakes, governmental pressure and everything to lose, Oppenheimer tries to keep a steady mindset while his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) is shown in the trailer as his guide and pillar of strength and support.
There are also glimpses of the movie’s star-studded cast. Lewis Strauss is played by Robert Downey Jr., Jean Tatlock by Florence Pugh, Richard Feynman by Jack Quaid, Kenneth Bainbridge by Josh Peck and Albert Einstein by Tom Conti. This, however, is only a sliver of the movie’s amazing cast that includes Rami Malek, Gary Oldman, Dane DeHaan, Kenneth Branagh, and more. While not explicitly showcased in the trailer, these actors are believed to be playing major, pivotal characters in the movie.
Excellent shot composition and cinematography with Nolan’s writer-director signature style are immediately apparent in the trailer. The sound effects, such as the opening with the crackling of dosimeters detecting radiation and periodic drum beats increasing in intensity, creates an environment of tension and high stakes as Oppenheimer claims that he cannot completely guarantee that the bomb will not wipe out the entire world based only on theory.
Nolan is known for incorporating a unique blend of live-action footage and stunning visuals and CGI in his movies, and “Oppenheimer” seems to be no different based on the trailer. However, what sets it apart from other Nolan movies such as “Tenet,” “Interstellar” and “Inception” is the amount of extraordinary talent from the legendary actors who are part of the movie.
There are few movies that can boast a cast as strong and massive as “Oppenheimer,” with many A-list actors being affiliated with the project. While it still remains to be seen if this cast is used strategically and if the script gives each actor their moment to shine, the trailer does set up high hopes and anticipation of great performances by the actors. The trailer also does well to not reveal too much about the movie but show enough to provide the audience with relevant context and build up hype for the movie.
Based on its engaging narrative, stunning visuals and strong cast, “Oppenheimer” has the potential to be the summer’s biggest movie as it seems set to outperform other movies that are releasing around a similar time such as “Barbie,” “Gran Turismo,” “Blue Beetle” and “Meg 2: The Trench.”

2023-07-24 13:36:00+00:00,Cillian Murphy Defends “Perfect” Sex Scenes in ‘Oppenheimer’,"Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh's Oppenheimer sex scenes got the movie a R rating, but Cillian says they were deliberate and ""perfect.""","Oppenheimer features some brief-but-very-naked sex scenes between Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh’s characters—which earned the movie its R rating. And Cillian believes they’re essential to the film, not to mention “perfect.”
Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald ahead of the SAG-AFTRA strike, Cillian explained, “Those scenes were written deliberately. He knew that those scenes would get the movie the rating that it got. And I think when you see it, it’s so fucking powerful. And they’re not gratuitous. They’re perfect. And Florence is just amazing.”
He went on to praise Florence (who plays Jean Tatlock), saying, “I have loved Florence’s work since Lady Macbeth and I think she’s fucking phenomenal.

Christopher Nolan previously told Insider, “When you look at Oppenheimer’s life and you look at his story, that aspect of his life, the aspect of his sexuality, his way with women, the charm that he exuded, it’s an essential part of his story.”

But some fans are planning a double feature for their release on July 21.,"Hunter Hudson, 23, a filmmaker in San Antonio, said he originally designed and created the shirts for him and his friends to “roll up to the Barbenheimer double feature” on July 21. But when he posted pictures of the shirt on his Twitter feed, he said, it took off beyond his expectations.
“I normally get about three or four likes on anything I post,” Hudson said. But after sharing a few mock-ups of the shirt, he woke up one morning to hundreds of messages from people asking him if they could buy it.
Hudson makes the shirts himself, with a friend, and charges $40. So far he said he had made about 150 shirts, with a second batch of about 70 more on the way. It takes him about 45 minutes to an hour to make one T-shirt, which he does by cutting two shirts in half, pinning them together and sewing and pressing them.
“I had a couple of movie theaters reach out to me privately to do bulk orders for employees,” he said. “It’s been overwhelmingly positive.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvMjgvbW92aWVzL2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1yZWxlYXNlLWRheS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Christopher Nolan's dark drama Oppenheimer collides with Greta Gerwig's fun and frothy Barbie movie on the fateful day, with new hybrid term 'Barbenheimer' being coined to signify the occasion.
It's not just fans and reporters jumping on the trend though, with stars of the movies themselves weighing in on the cinema competition.

""I think it's great. I mean, I'll be going to see Barbie. I can't wait to see it,” Oppenheimer star Cillian Murphy told IGN in an interview.
""I think it's just great for the industry and for audiences that we have two amazing films by amazing filmmakers coming out the same day. Could spend a whole day in the cinema, what's better than that?""
Barbie's leading lady Margot Robbie also seemed delighted with the movie mash-up, with the actress sharing her own Barbenheimer mission.
""I saw an amazing mock-up of a poster today online and I want to get it made into a T-shirt and somehow get Cillian Murphy to sign it,"" she told Virgin Radio UK. ""That's my new goal. I'm going to see what I can do.""
Warner Bros. Pictures
As for what film fans should prioritise seeing first, there was only one order that Robbie approves of.
""I think actually start the day with Barbie, then go straight to Oppenheimer and then Barbie chaser,"" she told Associated Press on the pink carpet of Barbie's European premiere, which took place in London's Leicester Square yesterday (July 13).
Co-star Ryan Gosling gave the same verdict, while actor Will Ferrell's response was a little less diplomatic.
""I think the world maybe wants to see Barbie a little bit more right now,"" he told the camera. ""I'm just saying.""

Barbie director Greta Gerwig was thrilled to learn that Oppenheimer's leading star was planning a trip to the cinema to see her film.
""Somebody showed me a video of Cillian Murphy saying he'd see Barbie and I was like, 'Aghhh',"" she said, doing an impression of her overjoyed response.
Meanwhile, Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan felt there was an inevitability that the two films would have a similar release date. ""Summer, in a healthy marketplace, is always crowded, and we've been doing this a long time,” the filmmaker told IGN.
""I think for those of us who care about movies, we've been really waiting to have a crowded marketplace again, and now it's here and that's terrific.""

It's no surprise that the Oppenheimer cast, had an alternative order to see the films come release day.
""Maybe Oppenheimer on the Saturday? Friday night? I don't know,"" said Emily Blunt, who plays Murphy's on-screen wife in the Nolan film.
Fellow Oppenheimer star Matt Damon gave a more assertive response. ""I'd knock out Oppenheimer,"" he said to IGN.
For those still agonising which film to see first, Cillian Murphy shared a fair approach. ""Just flip a coin,"" he said.
Barbie is released in cinemas on July 21.
Oppenheimer, which is based on the book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer, is set for release on July 21, 2023.

Truly coolest Dad ever?
Matt and his wife Luciana Barroso have raised four daughters together—Gia and Stella, as well as 17-year-old Isabella and 24-year-old Alexia. Luciana shares Alexia with her ex Arbello Barroso and actually opened up to Vogue about how Matt appreciated her being a mom when they met. “By the end of the night, he invited me to go out with his friends. But I was like, ‘I can’t. I have a 4-year-old daughter, I’m not going anywhere,’ and that was one of the things he loved, that I had a daughter. He said, ‘I love that you’re a mum and that’s your priority.’ Some guys might have been different; they might think it’s complicated, but for him, it wasn’t.”
Kay, because you immediately need the rest of that story, it goes like this:
“I was working as a bartender in South Beach (Miami) and he was shooting a movie there and the crew ended up in the bar one Saturday night. Matt’s story is that he saw me across the room and there was a light on me. And I’m like, ‘Yeah, it was a nightclub— there were lights everywhere!’ But he had started getting recognized and asked for pictures and autographs, and then it got kind of aggressive because people are drinking and stuff, and so he came and hid behind my bar…[wanting to] just hang out back there and have a drink. He says, ‘Oh, I saw you and I really wanted to talk to you.’”
FYI, Matt has all four of his kids’ names tattooed on his arm (as well as “Lucy” for ""Luciana""). He’s fully that dad!

That would be the first question on my mind if I directed a movie about J. Robert Oppenheimer—the father of the atomic bomb. That was a decision left up to Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan, of course, and he chose not to show the dangerous invention killing countless innocent lives in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.""He learned about the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the radio,"" Nolan told a New York City audience after an Oppenheimer screening.
Naturally, one might imagine that Oppenheimer—which places the focus squarely on its namesake—wouldn't play well in Japan. In fact, the film has yet to even open in Japan, especially considering the anniversary of the bombings on August 6 and August 9 are right around the corner. If Oppenheimer ever hit the Japanese box office, it will be interesting to see how viewers react to Nolan's decision not to show the victims. if. Until then, it seems as if Oppenheimer's opening day buddy, Barbie, is getting all the heat in its place.
Recently, Barbie Japan's official X (formerly known as Twitter) account was not happy with what they've seen so far. In a statement to Warner Bros. issued on July 31, the account criticized its American counterpart at Warner Bros. for the American marketing campaign for ""Barbenheimer."" The combination of Barbie images and depictions of mushroom clouds in memes were posted to the Barbie Japan account worldwide, with Japan stating that it felt ""extremely regrettable"" to participate ""without consideration"" to their country's history. As a result, #NoBarbenheimer began trending on Twitter in Japan.
""The Barbie movie is doomed [in Japan] because the official creators have fully embraced the memeification of the atomic bomb,"" one user with over 10,000 retweets wrote. ""I have complete disdain for the official Barbie movie team that seems to have no understanding of this reality,"" another responded.
In a short statement, Warner Bros. wrote that the film studio ""regrets its recent insensitive social media engagement."" After deleting several tweets and references to fan-made posters and insensitive Barbenheimer memes, they offered their ""sincere apology."" Barbie opens in Japan on August 11.

,Why Cillian Murphy avoided 'Oppenheimer' cast dinners,Matt Damon and Emily Blunt say 'Oppenheimer' star Cillian Murphy skipped cast dinners because he had too much on his mind playing the 'father of the atomic bomb.',"Cillian Murphy may have avoided attending cast dinners while shooting Christopher Nolan's new drama Oppenheimer in New Mexico, but the Irish actor's decision indicated no lack of friendliness on his part. According to costars Emily Blunt and Matt Damon, Murphy simply had too much on his mind portraying physicist and ""father of the atomic bomb"" J. Robert Oppenheimer to socialize with his castmates.
""The sheer volume of what he had to take on and shoulder is so monumental,"" Blunt said in a new interview with PEOPLE. ""Of course he didn't want to come and have dinner with us.""
According to Damon, Murphy ""couldn't"" join them for meals: ""His brain was just too full.""
Based on the 2005 book American Prometheus and set for release July 21, Oppenheimer is billed as an ""epic thriller that thrusts audiences into the pulse-pounding paradox of the enigmatic man who must risk destroying the world in order to save it.""

Murphy himself previously spoke to EW about the excitement he felt being offered the lead role by Nolan. The actor has taken supporting roles in five of the director's films: 2005's Batman Begins, 2008's The Dark Knight, 2010's Inception, 2012's The Dark Knight Rises, and 2017's Dunkirk.
""It was one of the best days of my life, I'll tell you that,"" Murphy said. ""I'll always turn up for Chris, no matter what the part is, but, secretly, it's a dream to play a lead part. The thing was, I had no idea. There was no preamble or anything, I just got the call. So it was incredibly exciting, and daunting, and terrifying, all at the same time.""
The actor also spoke about being part of the film's starry cast, which includes Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett, and Kenneth Branagh.
""Every day, you had these phenomenal actors, who are heroes of mine, coming in,"" he said. ""Every day, you were having to raise your game to work with these legends.

Every single actor, no matter what size their role or the significance of their character in history, each one of them had this massive depth of knowledge that they could draw on.""

As well as attaining box office success, Oppenheimer also received critical acclaim for its production values and performances, with Murphy and Robert Downey Jr drawing particular praise.
The latter, who played the treacherous Lewis Strauss, commended his co-star for the lead performance, claiming he had never seen a bigger “sacrifice” from an actor.
“I have never witnessed a greater sacrifice by a lead actor in my career,” he revealed. “He knew it was going to be a behemoth ask when [director] Chris [Nolan] called him. But I think he also had the humility that is required to survive playing a role like this.
“We'd be like, 'Hey, we got a three-day weekend. Maybe we'll go antiquing in Santa Fe. What are you going to do?' 'Oh, I have to learn 30,000 words of Dutch. Have a nice time.' But that's the nature of the task,” he added.

Speaking to the Los Angeles Times in January, director Domont detailed her thoughts on crafting the film’s central clash of egos and the gender crisis that unfolds.
“#MeToo never hit the finance world,” Dumont said. “Those guys were never held accountable for anything because money and power, at that level, you can’t touch those people. And women are forced to play ugly to survive in that kind of world and with those kinds of men. What they have to sacrifice of themselves to make their way up in that world, that was important for the story that I wanted to tell.”
Dumont added, “No matter how much progress we’ve made, we still can’t figure each other out. I don’t think men and women can. There’s a lot getting in the way of that.”

2023-07-21 17:53:00+00:00,Jean Tatlock Had a Profound Effect on J. Robert Oppenheimer’s Life,"Portrayed by Florence Pugh onscreen, psychiatrist Jean Tatlock was more than just a paramour of the “father of the atomic bomb.” Get to know her real-life story.","Before creating a weapon of mass destruction, and before leading the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer’s focus was on a woman named Jean Tatlock. The psychologist met Oppenheimer during their time overlapping at UC Berkeley, and they eventually fell in love and dated for years. Their relationship technically came to an end when he married his wife, Kitty, but Tatlock continued to have an impact on his life long after their split. Her associations with the Communist Party especially would cause him trouble later in his career.
Tatlock’s name is far lesser known than Oppenheimer’s, but she plays an integral part in his story, especially as it’s depicted in Christopher Nolan’s new biopic. Oscar nominee Florence Pugh portrays Tatlock through her romance with the physicist (played by Cillian Murphy), her private mental health struggles, and ultimate demise. Here’s what to know.
Vintage American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer Vintage American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer Now 39% Off $15 at Amazon
She was a trained psychiatrist.
Tatlock’s life and relationship with Oppenheimer are detailed extensively in Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the source material for Nolan’s film.
She was the daughter of a UC Berkeley Chaucer scholar, Professor John S. P. Tatlock. She grew up in Cambridge (her father taught at Harvard) and then Berkeley. Bird and Sherwin describe her as “free-spirited woman with a hungry, poetic mind”—she used to drive her car with the top down and sing—but she also suffered from depression.
Before going to Vassar College in 1931, Tatlock traveled to Europe and stayed with a family friend in Switzerland who introduced her to psychoanalysis and the work of psychologist Carl Jung, according to Bird and Sherwin. Tatlock left the trip with a deep interest in psychology. She was intelligent, with “a depth that most girls don’t get until after graduation,” a friend said in American Prometheus. She took pre-med courses at Berkeley from 1933-1934 before graduating from Vassar College in 1935.
Bird and Sherwin note the boldness of Tatlock’s medical pursuit, as it was rare for women to become doctors at the time. They wrote:
“Her determination to pursue a career as a psychiatrist surprised some of her friends, who explained it as characteristic of a sometimes bold and impetuous woman. And yet they knew it also made sense. From her politics to her interest in the psychological, Tatlock had always been motivated by the desire to help others in a practical, hard-headed manner.”
By 1943, she was Dr. Jean Tatlock, a psychiatrist working at the Mount Zion Hospital and treating children.
She was Oppenheimer’s “truest love.”
Tatlock met Oppenheimer in the spring of 1936, at a party hosted by his landlady, Mary Ellen Washburn. At the time, she was taking classes at Stanford Medical School (then located in San Francisco) while he was a professor at UC Berkeley. She was 22 years old, a decade younger than him.
Tatlock and Oppenheimer started dating that fall and were together for over three years. “Jean was Robert’s truest love,” a friend recalled in American Prometheus. “He loved her the most. He was devoted to her.” According to Biography, he proposed to her twice , but she turned him down.
Like in Nolan’s Oppenheimer, she wasn’t fond of Oppenheimer’s frequent gift-giving and flowers, according to Bird and Sherwin. It’s less clear if Tatlock made him translate Sanskrit in the bedroom, as depicted in a provocative sex scene in the film. However, it is known that the physicist did study Sanskrit and a number of other languages, as well as the Bhagavad Gita, the Hindu scripture.
Oppenheimer had a reputation as a womanizer, but he was consumed with Tatlock. His collaborator Robert Serber said he’d be “depressed some days” if he was “having trouble with Jean,” according to American Prometheus. Indeed, Tatlock’s impact on Oppenheimer was more than emotional. Patricia Klaus, co-author of An Atomic Love Story: The Extraordinary Women in Robert Oppenheimer’s Life, told Mercury News in 2013 that women like Tatlock, Kitty Oppenheimer, and Oppenheimer’s close friend Ruth Sherman Tolman (also believed to be a lover) “helped create him as a human being of feeling and character.”
Klaus explained, “Robert is often described as brilliant and arrogant, without friends. But in these relationships—especially with Jean and Ruth—there was a depth of affection that helped make him the person he was. They humanized him, in a way that power politics never did.”

She was a member of the Communist Party.
Tatlock paid dues and, in her college years, even reported for the Western Worker, an outlet for the party. She’s said to have opened up Oppenheimer to communism, social causes, left-wing politics, and her friends who shared similar views, according to Bird and Sherwin. Oppenheimer even said in a later interrogation that his “interests began to change” in 1936, alluding to the year he and Tatlock started seeing each other.
She encouraged Oppenheimer to donate to Spanish refugees during the Civil War, an issue she cared about. Per Bird and Sherwin, he intended to donate to medical care rather than weapons. He initially donated through relief groups, but associates he met through Tatlock, convinced him to donate through the Communist Party instead. In the end, he had donated about $1,000—a lot in the ’30s—but stopped in 1942, according to American Prometheus.
She and Oppenheimer continued to see each other after they broke up.
Oppenheimer married Katherine “Kitty” Puening in 1940. But he confirmed in later interrogations that he still saw Tatlock about twice a year from 1939 to 1943, despite his marriage.
During a visit he made to Berkeley in 1943, Oppenheimer was stalked by intelligence agents, who reported their findings to the FBI. They noted that Oppenheimer took Tatlock out to dinner and drinks, she drove him to her apartment, he stayed the night, and he left with her the next morning. After he flew back to New Mexico, he never saw her again. Eleven years later, Oppenheimer would be interrogated by this rendezvous and why Tatlock needed to see him. Like actor Cillian Murphy does in the film, Oppenheimer says it was “because she was still in love with me.”
The government, however, was convinced that it was because of communism, Bird and Sherwin report. They suspected Tatlock of being a spy, and that she knew sensitive information about the Manhattan Project. Or worse, that she was spreading intel to other contacts and ultimately to the Soviet Union. Colonel Boris Pash sought to wiretap her phone, but they didn’t find any firm evidence connecting her to the Soviets.

She questioned her sexuality.
After Tatlock’s death in 1944, letters and accounts from friends were unearthed, revealing that she had relationships with women. During her psychoanalysis she revealed “homosexual tendencies,” according to American Prometheus.
Her friend Mason Roberson said Tatlock confided in him that she was a lesbian, and that she tried to suppress her interest in women by sleeping “with every ‘bull’ she could find,” Bird and Sherwin write. Her longtime friend Edith Arnstein Jenkins also remembered once seeing Tatlock and Mary Ellen Washburn in bed together, smoking and reading newspapers, one morning, perhaps hinting at a romance. Bird and Sherwin report that Jean asked Washburn to come over the night she died, saying she needed her and was feeling very depressed, Washburn she wasn’t able to make it. She felt guilty about it afterwards.
The book Atomic Love also touches on Tatlock’s relationship with writer and poet May Sarton, a friend since childhood. Per Today , Tatlock once wrote to Sarton, “Last year there was a period where I thought I was a homosexual,” but she later clarified, “I don’t love you that way.”
She died in 1944 by suicide.
A coroner ruled that Tatlock died on January 4, 1944, by suicide. Her motive was unknown at the time. Her childhood friend didn’t believe that it was a “personal heartbreak” (Oppenheimer’s rejection) that led to her death. Historians remain conflicted on the true cause of her death.
Her father found in her apartment, her body on a pile of pillows next to the tub and her head submerged in the partially filled tub. She had left a suicide note that began, “I am disgusted with everything…” The news came as a surprise to her colleagues at the hospital, who believed she was an “outstanding success,” according to American Prometheus. In the book, Serber recalled that Oppenheimer “was deeply grieved” when he learned of Tatlock’s passing.
Bird and Sherwin wrote:
“The taking of one’s own life invariably becomes an imponderable mystery to the living. For Oppenheimer, Jean Tatlock’s suicide was a profound loss. He had invested much of himself in this young woman. He had wanted to marry her, and even after his marriage to Kitty, he had remained a loyal friend to her in need—and an occasional lover. He had spent many hours walking and talking her out of her depressions. And now she was gone. He had failed.”
There are conspiracy theories that Col. Boris Pash was responsible or involved with Tatlock’s death—given the wiretapping and his history of orchestrating other kidnappings—but American Prometheus notes he was already transferred to London by the time of her death.
Oppenheimer was interrogated about her.
In 1954, during security hearings with the United States Atomic Energy Commission, Oppenheimer was scrutinized for his Communist associations, and was ultimately denied his security clearance.
The examination pried into his relationship with Jean Tatlock. During questioning, Oppenheimer estimated that he had seen her 10 times in the five years between 1939 and 1944. “We had been very much involved with one another and there was still very deep feeling when we saw each other,” he said of their meetings, per American Prometheus. Such meetings took place at her home, at the hospital where she worked, drinks at the Top of the Mark, and at his home in Berkeley, which is near her father’s house.
Oppenheimer added that Tatlock had wanted to see him because he didn’t say goodbye before leaving for Los Alamos, the secret bomb testing site where he worked. “I felt she had to see me. She was undergoing psychiatric treatment,” he said in the interrogation, according to Bird and Sherwin. “She was extremely unhappy.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvbW92aWVzLXR2L2E0NDYxMTY3OC9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1qZWFuLXRhdGxvY2stdHJ1ZS1zdG9yeS1leHBsYWluZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-11 20:40:14+00:00,"Godzilla Minus One Takes Place In Postwar Japan, Technically Making Oppenheimer A Godzilla Prequel",This looks like it could be something special.,"Godzilla Minus One Takes Place In Postwar Japan, Technically Making Oppenheimer A Godzilla Prequel
It's a good day to be a fan of gigantic kaiju monsters that double as metaphors for the dangers of atomic power because we've finally gotten our first look at ""Godzilla Minus One,"" the latest film in the sprawling franchise of Godzilla movies. Written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki (""Lupin III: The First,"" ""The Eternal Zero""), ""Godzilla Minus One"" is the 37th film in the ""Godzilla"" franchise and the 33rd ""Godzilla"" film produced by Toho. This is the first Japanese-produced Godzilla film since 2016's ""Shin Godzilla,"" a movie that rules unquestionably hard. Oh, and here's your reminder that this Godzilla film will have no connection to the current American MonsterVerse featuring the likes of Godzilla, King Kong, and other assorted kaiju from Legendary.
Instead, ""Godzilla Minus One"" is set in post-war Japan following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II. Godzilla has always served as a metaphor for those horrific tragedies, so this feels like a full-circle bit of storytelling. It also, in the wildest bit of cinematic coincidences imaginable, means that Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" can now be viewed as a technical prequel to ""Godzilla Minus One."" After all, it was J. Robert Oppenheimer's bomb that was dropped in Japan, thereby also making him responsible for causing the nuclear waste that would birth Godzilla.
All jokes aside, ""Godzilla Minus One"" looks and sounds like an absolute killer of a Godzilla movie and one that reclaims the vital, real-life Japanese history that is often whitewashed by the American-made films. The new trailer is just a short teaser, but even in under a minute, there's already plenty to be excited about.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTMzNjgzNC9nb2R6aWxsYS1taW51cy1vbmUtdHJhaWxlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-17 14:52:43-04:00,"Oppenheimer Star Emily Blunt’s Greatest Genre Roles, from A Quiet Place to Looper","From Oppenheimer to A Quiet Place to Looper, here are Emily Blunt’s best roles in science fiction and fantasy movies.","Whether it's stealing scenes or commanding the frame, actress Emily Blunt proves time and time again that she can do it all. Drama, comedy, singing, dancing, or even narrating the heck out of a documentary, she makes it look easy. By all accounts, Blunt positively shines alongside a ridiculously talented ensemble of actors in Christopher Nolan's upcoming historical biography, Oppenheimer, playing biologist and botanist Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer, wife of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), aka the ""father of the atomic bomb.""
In Blunt's 20 years of making films, large swaths of her resume include some very choice sci-fi, fantasy, and genre films. Obviously, SYFY WIRE lives in that genre lane, so we've long admired her taste and commitment to participating in some truly memorable genre projects. And we love that Blunt consistently returns to genre projects amongst her meaty dramatic roles and more light-hearted comedies. As such, with Oppenheimer opening wide this weekend, SYFY WIRE presents our favorite Blunt genre films.
RELATED: Could Oppenheimer's Atomic Bomb Really Have Destroyed The World?
Emily Blunt's Best Roles in Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and Other Genre Films
The Huntsman: Winter's War (2016)
The sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman (2012) pits Blunt's Princess Freya against Charlize Theron's Queen Ravenna, and that match-up is gold in our eyes. Essentially, the sisters aren't great at coping when dire things go down, so these messed up sisters wreak a lot of havoc in the kingdom. Per usual, Theron and Blunt pull out all the stops playing broken queens of magic, and the movie works best when they're in the frame, together or apart.
The Adjustment Bureau (2011)
Blunt and her Oppenheimer castmate Matt Damon worked together before in this under-the-radar, sci-fi gem. Blunt plays the mysterious Elise Sellas, who keeps popping up in the life of Brooklyn Congressman David Norris. The story has a lot of fun twists, turns, and themes explored regarding destiny. But their flirty chemistry is another big reason to watch.
Jungle Cruise (2021)
On the other hand, the chemistry between Blunt's Dr. Lily Houghton and The Rock's Frank Wolff in Jungle Cruise is barely tepid at best. However, Blunt returning to action-heroine mode is always a good time. Houghton's extremely competent character (and Blunt, the actress) look like their having the most fun throughout the movie.
Into the Woods (2014)
Not a lot of folks were aware that Blunt has a top-notch voice until she got to show it off beautifully playing the Baker's Wife in this adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's stage musical. She's paired with James Corden's Baker, and together they play out one of the best arcs in this cautionary tale about dreams coming true in a haunting way.
Mary Poppins Returns (2018)
Who could imagine anyone filling the spit-spot shoes of Julia Andrews as Mary Poppins? Most audiences couldn't contemplate someone being a worthy recast of Mary Poppins in Mary Poppins Returns, but then Blunt's name was announced, and everyone shut up because she just nailed it. Equal parts austere and loving, Blunt is maybe the only actress today who could so ably run with the baton given by the legendary Andrews.
A Quiet Place Part II (2020)
Blunt returns to play ultra protective, post-apocalyptic mom, Evelyn Abbott, in A Quiet Place Part II. She's just as great in this sequel, but there's less for her to play outside of the major action beats. However, if you want to get a taste of her on-screen chemistry with her Oppenheimer hubby, Cillian Murphy, there's plenty to appreciate here as Evelyn and Emmett thrown down.

Edge of Tomorrow (2014)
Much like Linda Hamilton became a bad-ass, sci-fi legend after playing Sarah Connor in Terminator 2, so too did Blunt after playing Rita Vrataski in Edge of Tomorrow. The sci-fi, time travel twister features Blunt stealing scene after scene from blockbuster poster boy, Tom Cruise. She's intense, mercurial, frightening, and heroic, and she kicks the action star's butt for half of the movie. You have to have some chops to sell that, and she does.
Looper (2012)
Poker Face creator Rian Johnson's complex time travel film, Looper, stars a trio of fantastic performances from Bruce Willis, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Blunt. It's a high-concept story that remains incredibly grounded because of those performances. And Blunt still manages to standout, especially for her shattering performance as the very protective mother, Sara.
A Quiet Place (2018)
In the fantastic sci-fi, horror thriller, A Quiet Place, Blunt plays matriarch and feral mom, Evelyn Abbott. Married to Lee (John Krasinski), the couple have two kids, with another one on the way. A lovely life, except they now exist in the nightmare reality of trying to survive aliens who have landed and wiped out huge swaths of the population. Sonically-tuned to even the most subtle of noises, the aliens force the Abbotts to exist in silence. Blunt is amazing as the terrified mom, and executes the harrowing scenario of giving birth in utter silence with chilling perfection.

,‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ Still Dominating the Box Office,The “Barbenheimer” Effect is still in full force as new releases fail to overcome the joint power of the two pop cultural behemoths.,"We’re used to celebrity name combos –– your “Bennifer” etc. But movies of such different styles being treated as a duo? That really doesn’t happen very often. And yet here we are with “Barbenheimer”.
The pop cultural sensation of moviegoers choosing a double bill of ‘Barbie’ and the ‘Oppenheimer’ (trust us when we say, it’s best to start with Christopher Nolan’s weighty, thoughtful exploration of the father of the Atomic Bomb before moving on to Greta Gerwig’s fun, colorful comedy, which despite appearances has some satire and real intelligence of its own) has also been igniting the box office to successful effect.
Both of the movies opened big, and both have held on to huge swathes of their audiences as film fans kept turning out to experience them.
What’s Happening With ‘Barbie’?
Greta Gerwig’s subtle satire of gender relations and product placement is the biggest film of the moment and could well end up as the most successful of the year, on track to become one of –– if not the only –– billion-dollar movie in 2023.
‘Barbie’ opened with $150 million, and continued to play well through the following week, crowds turning out consistently. It doesn’t hurt that many kids are on summer vacation and the movie has family appeal.
Second weekends can increasingly be tough for movies that open wide and successfully, but Gerwig’s movie rose to the latest challenge, adding an impressive $93 million in its sophomore three-day segment, a 43% drop from its debut and representing the seventh biggest second weekend in history. It’s up there with the giant likes of the more successful modern ‘Star Wars’ films and some of Marvel’s ‘Avengers’ titles.
As it stands right now, ‘Barbie’ has more than $750 million in the bank globally and is the third biggest movie of the year so far.
’Oppenheimer’s No Bomb
Nolan’s film, meanwhile, is also doing spectacularly for the director and for studio Universal, which took the chance to snag his services after he was displeased with the treatment of fellow filmmakers by former Hollywood home Warner Bros. during the pandemic.
‘Oppenheimer’ opened to $80.5 million, a feat for a three-hour movie with a darker, mature subject matter and complex tone. And, like ‘Barbie’, it has continued to perform, becoming the first R-rated film to gross more than $10 million for seven days in a row on Friday.
Its own second weekend was similarly impressive, the Cillian Murphy-starring movie dropping just 44% for $46.6 million this past weekend. All in all, the movie has earned more than $400 million at the worldwide box office.
Here’s what senior Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian told Variety:
“Weekend two proves the outpouring of interest in ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ a week ago was not a fluke. Both films put up second weekend numbers that would have been considered solid as debuts and reflect two of the best sophomore session holds in box office history.”
Such was the impact of that one-two punch that new releases had trouble making it into the charts. Disney’s ‘Haunted Mansion’ (the latest adaptation of the classic theme park ride) could only muster $24.6 million in third, which isn’t that great for a movie costing $150 million to make and millions more to promote. Yet while horror movie ‘Talk To Me’ opened sixth, its far smaller $4.5 million budget means a $10 million opening is counted as more of a success.

I’m calling for a boycott of the movie Oppenheimer. I just learned there is a highly offensive scene involving the Bhagavad Gita in it. I will not repeat it here, but it involves something explicit.

However, amidst all the acclaim, a particular scene in the movie has stirred up controversy. In this scene, Pugh's character makes Murphy's character read from the Bhagavad Gita during an intimate moment. The depiction has sparked heated discussions, making headlines and leading some netizens to express concerns about the potential offence to religious sentiments. Criticism has been directed at the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for permitting the release of the film without cutting this scene.

2023-08-06 15:00:00+00:00,Oppenheimer Cast Compared to Real-Life Counterparts in Photos,The Albert Einstein casting is honestly spot-on.,"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is stuffed with A-List stars who portray a bevy of real historical figures.
""We've never stacked a film with that many known actors and famous people. That was a different process,"" casting director John Papsidera explained.
He continued, ""Chris had a feeling and an instinct to drive people to this movie with a star-studded cast. We usually don’t think like that for his films. Chris’ films typically have two or three, or five main characters at the most. And yes, you end up with well-known actors in them because he’s a brilliant director and actors want to work with him. Star power is not the driving force in Chris’ films. With Oppenheimer, it was more about utilizing actors’ fame to make the movie feel bigger."" So, the difficulty became ""dealing with actors who usually star in films. Now you’re trying to cast them for less money and juggling the billing.""

,"The omission of women's contributions in 'Oppenheimer' is part of a harmful trend, Pitt experts say","Lack of representation can reinforce stereotypes about who belongs in the sciences, write Carl Kurlander and Chandralekha Singh.","Lise Meitner: A pioneering role model in physics
The Manhattan Project would not have been possible without the work of physicist Lise Meitner, pictured above, who discovered nuclear fission. Meitner used Einstein’s E=MC² to calculate how much energy would be released by splitting uranium atoms, and it was that development that would prompt Einstein to sign a letter urging President Franklin Roosevelt to begin the United States’ atomic research program.
Einstein called Meitner the “Madame Curie of Germany” and was one of a pantheon of physicists, from Max Planck to Niels Bohr, who nominated Meitner for a Nobel Prize 48 times during her lifetime.
Meitner never won. Instead, the prize for fission went to Otto Hahn, her male lab partner of 30 years in Berlin. Hahn received the news of his nomination under house arrest in England, where he and other German scientists were being held to determine how far the Third Reich had advanced with its atomic program.
Of Jewish descent, Meitner had been forced to flee the Nazis in 1938 and refused to use this scientific discovery to develop a bomb. Rather, she spent the rest of her life working to promote nuclear disarmament and advocating for the responsible use of nuclear energy.
Meitner was not the only woman who made a significant contribution during this time. But the lack of physics role models like Meitner in popular media leads to real-life consequences. Meitner doesn’t appear as a character in the film, as she was not part of the Manhattan Project, but we hope the script alludes to her groundbreaking work.
A lack of representation
Only around 20% of the undergraduate majors and PhD students in physics are women. The societal stereotypes and biases, expectation of brilliance, lack of role models and chilly culture of physics discourage many talented students from historically marginalized backgrounds, like women, from pursuing physics and related disciplines.
Societal stereotypes and biases influence students even before they enter the classroom. One common stereotype is the idea that genius and brilliance are important factors to succeed in physics. However, genius is often associated with boys, and girls from a young age tend to shy away from fields associated with innate brilliance.
Studies have found that by the age of 6, girls are less likely than boys to believe they are “really, really smart.” As these students get older, often the norms in science classes and curricula tend not to represent the interests and values of girls. All of these stereotypes and factors can influence women’s perception of their ability to do physics.
Research shows that at the end of a yearlong college physics course sequence, women with an “A” have the same physics self-efficacy as men with a “C”. A person’s physics self-efficacy is their belief about how good they are at solving physics problems — and one’s self-efficacy can shape their career trajectory.
Women drop out of college science and engineering majors with significantly higher grade-point averages than men who drop out. In some cases, women who drop out have the same GPA as men who complete those majors. Compared to men, women in physics courses feel significantly less recognized for their accomplishments. Recognition from others as a person who can excel in physics is the strongest predictor of a student’s physics identity, or whether they see themselves as someone who can excel in physics.
More frequent media recognition of female scientists, such as Meitner, could vicariously influence young women, who may see them as role models. This recognition alone can boost young women’s physics self-efficacy and identity.
When Meitner started her career at the beginning of the 20th century, male physicists made excuses about why women had no place in a lab – their long hair might catch fire on Bunsen burners, for instance. We like to believe we have made progress in the past century, but the underrepresentation of women in physics is still concerning.
Diversity as an asset to science
If diverse groups of scientists are involved in brainstorming challenging problems, not only can they devise better, future-oriented solutions, but those solutions will also benefit a wider range of people.
Individuals’ lived experiences affect their perspectives – for example, over two centuries ago, mathematician Ada Lovelace imagined applications far beyond what the original inventors of the computer intended. Similarly, women today are more likely to focus on applications of quantum computers that will benefit their communities. Additionally, physicists from Global South countries are more likely to develop improved stoves, solar cells, water purification systems or solar-powered lamps. The perspectives that diverse groups bring to science problems can lead to new innovations.
Our intention is not to disparage the “Oppenheimer” movie, but to point out that by not centering media attention on diverse voices – including those of women in physics like Meitner – filmmakers perpetuate the status quo and stereotypes about who belongs in physics. Additionally, young women continue to be deprived of exposure to role models who could inspire their academic and professional journeys .

Fans of The Exorcist have been left feeling wary over the future of the film franchise.
Over the weekend, the trailer of a new sequel, titled The Exorcist: Believer, was shown ahead of Oppenheimer screenings, and on Tuesday (25 July), that trailer was made available online.
The film follows two young girls who are found three days after going missing, and then start to display evidence that they have been possessed.
But what starts out looking like it could be any other horror film focused on possession then introduces a familiar face: Ellen Burstyn, who has returned to play Chris MacNeil, the mother of Linda Blair’s Regan, who was possessed in William Friedkin’s 1973 original.
Burstyn’s character is located by the father of one of the girls after discovering she went through a similar experience five decades ago. At one stage in the trailer, Chris comes face-to-face with his possessed daughter, and says: “We’ve met before.”
Her role in the film has convinced many to see The Exorcist: Believer despite thinking that the trailer makes the film look bad.
“This has to be the most desperate a studio has been for a legacy sequel,” one fan wrote, with another adding: “Nice to see Ellen Burstyn but I’m keeping my expectations incredibly low.”
The nostalgic factor worked for many people, though – especially because of the usage of The Exorcist’s theme “Tubular Bells”.
“Ellen Burstyn being back and the theme music gave me goosebumps, hyped!” one fan wrote.
The Exorcist: Believer stars Leslie Odom Jr, Ann Dowd, Lidya Jewett, and Olivia Marcum. The film, written by Peter Sattler and David Gordon Green will arrive on 13 October, which is The Exorcist’s 50th anniversary.

2023-07-27 12:44:00+00:00,Oppenheimer made me realize we can’t stop ChatGPT AI from becoming sentient,Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer can make you realize the dangers of ChatGPT AI with one simple parallel - what you need to know.,"I was watching Oppenheimer in a packed theater on Tuesday, when a scene from Christopher Nolan’s biopic made me draw a somber parallel with ChatGPT. I realized that we might not have the luxury of knowing when generative AI software becomes sentient. When a future ChatGPT variant, or a competitor, awakens, we might be completely unaware.
That’s one of the worries across the world right now, that AI will lead to some sort of world-ending future. Or that it’ll somehow lead to the extinction of the human race.
Before I go any further, I’ll warn you that some Oppenheimer spoilers follow below. Stop reading here if you haven’t yet seen the movie.
I said recently that most of these worries about ChatGPT AI development are overblown and probably unwarranted. Some of the voices who warn about the dangers of AI are brilliant minds that developed it. We can’t stop AI development even if we want to. Unlike nuclear weapons, anyone can make groundbreaking AI advancements from the comfort of their own home.

In a way, these AI warnings are just like J. Robert Oppenheimer’s worries about nuclear weapons. You know, after he created and successfully used those weapons of mass destruction. He spearheaded the US atomic bomb efforts, and only then did he advocate for the need to regulate nuclear weapon development.
Oppenheimer had reasons to worry after he saw the devastation from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. AI hasn’t killed more than 200,000 people like those atomic bombs did. There’s seemingly no reason to compare AI with the threat of nuclear war.
After seeing Nolan’s biopic, there’s no reason to sympathize with the renowned physicist. Yes, he tried to repent, and there were bigger powers at play that really controlled the fate of atomic bomb research. Had he stepped away before August 6th, 1945, someone else would have taken his place. It was all inevitable at that point. And it was a race between the US and the Nazis to make the bomb.

How does Oppenheimer relate to AI such as ChatGPT? Well, at some point in the movie, Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is shocked to learn that the bomb might lead to an uncontrolled chemical reaction that would light up the atmosphere.
The first nuclear detonation could destroy the entire world. If the calculations are correct, the US would have to disclose its discovery to the Nazis and make it clear to them that anyone using a single atomic bomb might kill all life on Earth.
That was a climactic scene, but since the movie is based on real-life events, everyone in the audience knew those calculations would turn out to be wrong. The world didn’t end when the US ran the Trinity nuclear test. The fallout from the explosion covered almost the entire US, but it didn’t kill the world.
A different scientist then checked the calculations and found that the chance of an atomic bomb destroying the entire world was near zero, though not absolute zero. But until that Trinity test, Oppenheimer and Co. knew there was a theoretical risk the world would burn.
That becomes clear a few years later, right before the Trinity test. Just before the explosion, Oppenheimer informs Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) there’s a non-zero chance they’ll blow up the entire world. That’s when I made the ChatGPT connection.
The Oppenheimer team knew there was a theoretical chance the chain reaction would ignite the atmosphere and destroy life on this planet. The only way to prove the world would survive was to actually detonate the first nuclear weapon.
The Murphy-Damon scene was part of one of the film’s recent trailers (see above), but it makes an impact only when you see the movie, as you have the context for those remarks.
With ChatGPT-like products, AI scientists will get us closer to sentient AI. The Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) we keep hearing of will be indistinguishable from humans. Only once AGI arrives the risk of AI destroying humanity will become real. Well, it’ll be non-zero.
But there’s a chance we might never know the exact moment AGI surfaces. It might sound like a Matrix/Terminator-style scenario, but what if AGI is so smart that it’ll hide its intelligence from humans? We’ll miss the chance to shut it down before it can spread and become unstoppable.
I’m not saying that we should stop or reduce AI development or that I’ll stop using ChatGPT-like products. I want better, more personal AI to be available in the near future of computing. Just like the Oppenheimer team wouldn’t have stopped the Trinity test, I don’t think any AI researchers will or should stop making better AI software.
Scientists might be cautious. But they’re also curious and want to see whether their theories can come true. Whether it’s an atomic bomb that can kill hundreds of thousands of people in a few minutes or advanced AI that can manipulate and mislead.
All I’m saying is that after seeing Oppenheimer, I realized that AI could actually be much more dangerous than the nuclear bomb. But we might never have that moment of clarity when one person tells another that turning on an AI switch for AGI could lead to humankind’s extinction. Even if we do, they’ll still turn AGI on.
Sadly, if AGI does destroy the world, we’ll never get a Nolan biopic that tells the story.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vYmdyLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLW1hZGUtbWUtcmVhbGl6ZS13ZS1jYW50LXN0b3AtY2hhdGdwdC1haS1mcm9tLWJlY29taW5nLXNlbnRpZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-07-20 09:49:02+00:00,Sterling Heights senior sheds some insight into Detroit’s role in the Manhattan Project,Her job as a secretary was to write up information from the meetings Chrysler had with Oppenheimer,"Olga LaCharite of Sterling Heights has seen the trailer for “Oppenheimer.”
Christopher Nolan’s historical thriller about the Manhattan Project and the mastermind behind the development of the atomic bomb during World War II opens in theaters nationwide on Friday, and while her family is interested in seeing it, she’s not likely to go.
“I want to forget about it, not be reminded of it,” said Olga, who worked on the Manhattan Project as a young woman determined to contribute to the family’s income and the war effort going on in Detroit.
She was not alone in her endeavors.
Some women were riveters.
Some drove trucks or even flew planes.
Others like Olga performed clerical work for companies building parts for airplanes, bombers or in this case, the bomb.
“There isn’t really much I can say about it. It was all a secret,” said the 102-year-old great grandmother. “Nobody sat you down and told you what you would be doing.
“It was just everybody doing what they could to pitch in and help,” added the centenarian, who was recently honored by Macomb County for her longevity and contributions to her community.
The result was an enormous collaborative effort between the U.S. government and the industrial and scientific sectors that actually began in 1938. According to the historical account of the Manhattan Project by the Atomic Heritage Foundation it was then German scientists discovered nuclear fission. Upon hearing the news among scientists at the time, Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard sent a letter to President Roosevelt warning him the discovery might lead Germany to build an atomic bomb. In response to the threat, FDR formed the Uranium Committee, a group of top military and scientific experts tasked with determining if a nuclear chain reaction was feasible. Their early research moved slowly and once they progressed from research to development it became apparent they needed more resources and turned to the U.S. Army for support.
Four-years later, the Manhattan Project was officially created.
Olga was 21 years old.
“The name itself, “Manhattan Project,” is commonly thought to be a misnomer, but its first offices were actually in Manhattan, at 270 Broadway,” according to the AHF report. “General Leslie R. Groves, who was appointed to head the project, decided to follow the custom of naming Corps of Engineers districts for the city in which they are located. The atomic bomb project thus became known as the Manhattan Engineer District (MED), or Manhattan Project for short.
Its first major funding came in December, when President Roosevelt ordered an initial allotment of $500 million.
As audiences will see in Nolan’s gripping biopic the bulk of the research done on the Manhattan Project and the construction of the bomb was located at Los Alamos, New Mexico under the direction of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who is played in the film by Cillian Murphy. Emily Blunt plays his wife, biologist and botanist Kitty Oppenheimer. The film also stars Matt Damon as General Groves and Robert Downey, Jr. as Lewis Strauss, founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.
However, work on the Manhattan Project was done at sites all across the U.S., and even Canada’s province of Ontario, which was the site for one of the world’s first heavy water nuclear reactors.
It is estimated more than 600,000 people worked on the project.
Olga was one of them, working as an executive secretary for the group at the Chrysler Corporation site in Detroit. In order to get the job she had to promise not to reveal any information about their work outside of the plant.
“It was all top secret,” Olga said.
According to AHF report, Chrysler was awarded a $75 million contract in 1943 to build diffusers for the Manhattan Project or “Project X-100” as it was known at Chrysler’s Lynch Road Plant.
By the end of the war the company had produced a thousand carloads, and more than 3,500 of the needed diffusers. In a letter of thanks to Chrysler’s president at the time, General Groves said: “No one outside the K-25 portion of the project can ever know how much we depended on you and how well you performed. Those of us who do know will never forget how important your work was and how well you did it.”
During her work at the plant Olga saw Oppenheimer many times.
“He was very business-like,” she said, remembering the enigmatic man who had to risk destroying the world in order to save it. “They would come in for meetings when there was a problem.”
Then she would keep track of the information exchanged in the meetings so it could be shared with other project sites. How that was dispersed Olga cannot remember. Maybe by courier or teletype, both of which were used frequently during WWII.
Olga’s work on the project came to a close on the morning of Aug. 6, 1945. That’s when an American B-29 bomber “Enola Gay” dropped the atomic bomb on the Japanese City of Hiroshima. Less than a month later, Japan formally surrendered.
“We were happy — and we were sad,” Olga said, recalling that fateful time in the world’s history. “We felt fortunate because it could have been us but sad that it was all of them. No one wins in a war.”
Olga worked for Chrysler for nine years, one year shy of collecting a pension before leaving the company.
She and her husband, George, shared nearly 65 years of marriage before he died at the age of 101. The raised two children and have six grandchildren and two great grandchildren.
FYI
Olga, as with many people who lived through WWII, never told her children much about her work on the Manhattan Project, because as she said it was not something she wanted to remember.
What they never knew is likely to be revealed in Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” and his portrayal of American scientists, industrial engineers, manufacturers and the military coming together for what was — at that time – and as the film shows as one of the most important events in world history.
The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin.
Nolan’s films, including “Tenet, Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception” and “The Dark Knight” trilogy, have earned more than $5 billion at the global box office and have been awarded 11 Oscars and 36 nominations, including two Best Picture nominations.
Oppenheimer is filmed in a combination of IMAX® 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography including, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX® black and white analogue photography.
It opens in theaters everywhere Friday including The Michigan Science Center (Mi-Sci), which is showing the film in its IMAX® Dome Theatre.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hY29tYmRhaWx5LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3LzIwL3N0ZXJsaW5nLWhlaWdodHMtc2VuaW9yLXNoZWRzLXNvbWUtaW5zaWdodC1pbnRvLWRldHJvaXRzLXJvbGUtaW4tdGhlLW1hbmhhdHRhbi1wcm9qZWN0L9IBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYWNvbWJkYWlseS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8yMC9zdGVybGluZy1oZWlnaHRzLXNlbmlvci1zaGVkcy1zb21lLWluc2lnaHQtaW50by1kZXRyb2l0cy1yb2xlLWluLXRoZS1tYW5oYXR0YW4tcHJvamVjdC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The film has not been announced to be skipping a Japanese release, but it is true that a release hasn't been confirmed there yet. Given that the film is releasing worldwide next week (July 21), it's likely that if the film comes to Japanese cinemas at all, it will be later than that.

Magnolia Pictures documentary “A Compassionate Spy,” directed by two-time Oscar nominee Steve James (“Hoop Dreams,” “Life Itself”), captures the controversial true story of Manhattan Project physicist Ted Hall. Part of the team behind J. Robert Oppenheimer’s atomic bomb, Hall shared nuclear secrets with the Soviet Union. The documentary is told through the perspective of Ted’s wife Joan Hall, who protected his secret across their 50-year marriage.
The official “Compassionate Spy” synopsis reads: Recruited in 1944 as an 18-year-old Harvard undergraduate to help J. Robert Oppenheimer and his team create a bomb, Ted Hall was the youngest physicist on the Manhattan Project, and didn’t share his colleagues’ elation after the successful detonation of the world’s first atomic bomb. Concerned that a U.S. post-war monopoly on such a powerful weapon could lead to nuclear catastrophe, Hall began passing key information about the bomb’s construction to the Soviet Union. After the war, he met, fell in love with, and married Joan, a fellow student with whom he shared a passion for classical music and socialist causes — and the explosive secret of his espionage. The pair raised a family while living under a cloud of suspicion and years of FBI surveillance and intimidation.
“A Compassionate Spy” premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival ahead of its North American launch at Telluride. The film is distributed by Magnolia Pictures and will be released on the heels of Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” which fictionalizes the creation of the bomb itself. “Oppenheimer” will be released in theaters July 21 and used real scientists in Los Alamos as extras.
“We have to be really on our game, we have to be faithful to the history here, and really know what we’re up to,” director Christopher Nolan explained, citing that the first explosion of the atomic bomb in the Trinity test will be shown onscreen in the upcoming film sans CGI.
IndieWire’s David Ehrlich wrote in the review for “A Compassionate Spy” that the harrowing true story is completely separate from “Oppenheimer.”
“[Director] James doesn’t have access to the same toolkit on a low-budget documentary that someone like Christopher Nolan might have at his disposal while making an $100 million biopic about Robert Oppenheimer,” Ehrlich penned.
He added that “A Compassionate Spy” is “extremely sympathetic toward Hall’s choice,” with director James classifying Ted Hall’s as the “lesser of two evils” when it comes to the international nuclear arms race today. Ehrlich wrote, “The rabid nationalism that might convince some modern viewers to see Hall as a villain is exactly what scared him into contacting the Soviets.”
“A Compassionate Spy” is presented by Participant and is a Mitten Media and Kartemquin Films production produced by Mark Mitten p.g.a., Dave Lindorff, and Steve James. Executive producers are Jeff Skoll, Diane Weyermann, Tim Horsburgh and Gordon Quinn.

2023-07-16 20:38:54+00:00,Christopher Nolan Cast His Daughter in ‘Oppenheimer’ as a Girl Who Gets Blown Up in Nuclear Explosion,Christopher Nolan cast his eldest daughter in a gruesome role in “Oppenheimer.”,"Christopher Nolan cast his eldest daughter in a gruesome role for his forthcoming feature “Oppenheimer.”
Speaking with the Telegraph, Nolan revealed that his daughter, Flora, visited the “Oppenheimer” set, alongside his wife and producer Emma Thomas, while the film was still in production. Nolan then had the idea to cast Flora in a then-open role: a nameless young woman who has her face damaged by a nuclear explosion in a sequence within the main character’s mind.
“We needed someone to do that small part of a somewhat experimental and spontaneous sequence,” Nolan said. “So it was wonderful to just have her sort of roll with it.”
Nolan recognized the peculiarity of the casting, revealing that it was a decision that came quickly and one that was not premeditated: “Truthfully, I try not to analyze my own intentions.”
He explained that the casting further illustrates the theme of “Oppenheimer” at large: “But the point is that if you create the ultimate destructive power it will also destroy those who are near and dear to you. I suppose this was my way of expressing that in what, to me, were the strongest possible terms.”
Nolan also joked that the casting somewhat resembled a role in Michael Powell’s 1960 horror classic “Peeping Tom,” in which the English director cast his young son as the childhood version of a serial killer.

Amy Schumer has joked that she should’ve played Emily Blunt’s role in Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer.
Blunt was cast as Kitty, the wife of nuclear scientist J Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) in the film.
In an Instagram post on Monday (24 July), Schumer wrote that she “enjoyed [watching] Barbie and Oppenheimer but I think I should have played Emily Blunt’s role”.
“Do better Hollywood,” the 42-year-old comedian wrote, alongside a photo of herself wearing sunglasses and a large sun hat.
Many people commented on Schumer’s post by carrying on the joke.
“They are translucent haters for not giving you Emily’s role!” one person wrote.
Another added: “I think you were better suited for Margot Robbie’s role [in Barbie].”
Someone else remarked: “They should have let Margot Robbie morph into you.”
Last month, Schumer opened up about her reasons for exiting the Barbie movie after originally being cast to play the doll.
The Trainwreck star was considered for the film when it was first announced in 2016 but ultimately departed from the project in 2017. Director Greta Gerwig and writer Noah Baumbach (who co-wrote the final film with Gerwig) were not involved with the project at this point.
During an appearance on the Bravo chat show Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, Schumer shared more insight into her leaving the project.
Asked by Andy Cohen about her exit, Schumer joked that she was told she was “too thin” for the role, before adding: “I can’t wait to see the movie. I think it looks awesome.
“I think we said it was scheduling conflicts. That’s what we said. But it really was just like, creative differences. But there’s a new team behind it and it looks like it’s very feminist and cool, so I will be seeing this movie.”
In response, Cohen asked: “Was it that it didn’t seem feminist and cool when you were involved in it?”
“Yeah,” Schumer replied.
Barbie and Oppenheimer were released in cinemas on 21 July.
Both films have exceeded box office expectations, with Barbie earning $182m from 69 international territories, as part of a record-breaking $337m global weekend.
Oppenheimer on the other hand made $93.7m from 78 international territories. The film surpassed Barbie in India, for a $174.2m global total over the opening weekend.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL2FydHMtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9maWxtcy9uZXdzL2FteS1zY2h1bWVyLWVtaWx5LWJsdW50LW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJhcmJpZS1iMjM4MTI1OC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Even Tom Cruise is planning a Barbie and Oppenheimer double feature,"Tom Cruise, ex-husband of AMC ad sensation Nicole Kidman, is encouraging moviegoers to flock to theaters for a 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' double feature.","Tom Cruise, ex-husband of AMC ad sensation Nicole Kidman, is emboldening moviegoers to flock to the theaters this summer.
The movie star encouraged a double feature of Greta Gerwig's Barbie and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, both in theaters July 21, in a Twitter post celebrating the riches of the summer movie season. That also includes James Mangold's Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which marks Harrison Ford's last outing as the famed archaeologist.
""This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,"" Cruise wrote. ""Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indy and one of the most iconic characters in history. I love a double feature, and it doesn't get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Oppenheimer and Barbie.""
Cruise will also be fronting a blockbuster this summer with Mission Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, in theaters July 12. The pressure's on, as Cruise's last summer outing, Top Gun: Maverick, grossed a staggering $1.5 billion worldwide. In the aftermath of its success, filmmaker Steven Spielberg was overheard telling Cruise that he was ""saving Hollywood's ass"" as the industry attempts to rebound from the pandemic.
As for the Barbie vs. Oppenheimer discourse, Matt Damon, who stars opposite Cillian Murphy in the war drama, previously encouraged a double feature, telling Vanity Fair last month, ""People are allowed to go see two movies in a weekend. Oppenheimer is one of them!"" As for which title his family would prefer to hit first (Damon shares four daughters with wife Luciana Barroso), he said, ""I'll have to ask them that. If that's the case, they'll see two movies that weekend!""

2023-07-20 21:58:44+00:00,Is Oppenheimer Banned in Japan Explained,"Here is the full answer as to whether Oppenheimer is banned in Japan, owing to its subject matter with creating nuclear bombs.","The Christopher Nolan movie Oppenheimer has been widely praised by critics across the globe. But there’s one country where that’s unlikely to be the case — Japan. So what’s happening? Given its subject matter, is the Japanese government preventing movie theaters from showing the film? If you’re wondering if Oppenheimer is banned in Japan, here is the full answer explained.
Explaining Whether Oppenheimer Is Banned in Japan
Oppenheimer is not officially banned in Japan. However, Universal Pictures has yet to confirm whether the film will be shown over there. Back in June, a spokesman for Universal told Variety that “plans have not been finalized in all markets.”
Since then, there’s been no further word as to whether the movie will or won’t be getting a Japanese release. My money is on won’t, and it’s all to do with the film’s subject matter, the inventor and the invention of the atomic bomb.
In 1945, the bombs that Oppenheimer was instrumental in creating were dropped on two Japanese cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. No one knows the exact number of deaths, but estimates put it at up to 200,000 people, with many more injured.
It has been argued that the bombs ended World War II. Germany had surrendered, leaving only Japan fighting. Six days after the second bomb was dropped, Japan expressed its intent to surrender. But it’s understandable why a movie about the father of the atomic bomb might not go down well.
So, the answer to whether Oppenheimer is banned in Japan is no, but don’t count on it getting a cinematic release in that country.

2023-07-07 16:45:02-04:00,Why Robert Downey Jr. Chose Oppenheimer for His Post-MCU Debut,What Attracted Robert Downey Jr. to appear in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer for his first film following his exit from the MCU.,"The Iron Man alum says it was a nice change of pace not being the face of a massive summer blockbuster for once.
In Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer (hitting the big screen July 21), Robert Downey Jr. plays the role of Lewis Strauss, who could almost be described as the anti-Iron Man.
A leading member of the Atomic Energy Commission, Strauss was among those responsible for stripping J. Robert Oppenheimer of his top-level government security clearance once the Manhattan Project physicist began publicly voicing serious doubts over the newly-created atomic bomb and its even more destructive progeny: the thermonuclear hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer was, in essence, blacklisted for spouting anti-American rhetoric and wasn't officially cleared of those charges until late last year.
""There’s themes in this film about being held up in this rarified air for something that you’re so conflicted about,"" Downey noted in a recent conversation with Extra TV (see below).

Sitting down for the interview alongside co-star Cillian Murphy, the Marvel Studios veteran explained that while Nolan's World War II thriller initially ""scared"" him from an acting standpoint, he simply couldn't pass up the opportunity to play a supporting role for once.
""It was ... nice to have the pressure off because I let this guy [Murphy] do the heavy lifting,"" he said. ""I’d come in and [go] ‘I had four days off. I was just antiquing around Santa Fe. What have you been up to?’ And he’d be like, ‘Uhhh…you wanna run the lines?’ He was also at all the locations where there were like 60-mile-an-hour winds and all that stuff. I hung out for the pleasant fair, weather-wise.""

When asked about Strauss's dynamic with Oppenheimer, Downey recalled how Nolan cited the famous rivalry between two musical legends: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. ""It is a story of how small, imagined sleights between important people can have big impacts,"" the actor said, while also praising Murphy's take on Oppenheimer as ""a generation-defining performance.""
As for what audiences can expect from the Obadiah Stane-y Strauss, Downey stated that he was asked to tone down his usual snarky and motor-mouthed swagger approach that made him so lovable as the MCU's founding Avenger for 10 years.

2023-07-14 21:47:36.483000+00:00,"The story behind Barbenheimer, this winter's movie showdown","Two blockbusters opening on the same day: is this an unintentional marketing dream, or a calculated campaign?","The very online showdown between Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer all started with a date: July 21.
It’s not uncommon for studios to counterprogram films in different genres on a big weekend, but the stark differences between an intense, serious-minded picture about the man who oversaw the development of the atomic bomb and a lighthearted, candy-colored anthropomorphising of a childhood doll quickly became the stuff of viral fodder.
There’s even some disagreement over whether it’s “Barbieheimer” or “Barbenheimer” or “Boppenheimer” or yet another tortured portmanteau – a phenomenon on which the AP Stylebook has yet to offer guidance, but for the purposes of this article will be “Barbenheimer.”
It didn’t hurt that both Nolan and Gerwig have very passionate and very online fandoms eager to join in. Never mind that many of those fans overlap – the memes, allegiances, and T-shirts were just too fun.
Both movies often trend on social media when the other releases a new asset – a trailer, a picture, an interview. On one level, it’s a marketing department’s dream. Awareness could not be higher, the conversation couldn’t be louder, and neither film even has official reviews out yet.

“’Barbenheimer’ is a marketing gift borne out of social media and I think it’s benefiting both films,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for analytics firm Comscore. “You’re certainly aware of both movies in a more profound and compelling way than I think might have otherwise happened had they been released on different weekends.”
AMC Theaters reported that 20,000 of its AMC Stubs members had purchased tickets for a double feature. If you’re counting, that’s 294 minutes of moviewatching. Even Margot Robbie – Barbie herself – and Tom Cruise, the star of another US summer blockbuster, have started plotting the ideal “Barbenheimer” day.
“It’s a perfect double bill,” said Robbie at her movie’s London premiere Wednesday. “I think actually start your day with Barbie, then go straight into Oppenheimer and then a Barbie chaser.”
Cruise – whose Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One opened a little over a week before the “Barbenheimer” showdown – said at his premiere he’d plan to see both on their opening day, likely starting with Oppenheimer, which seems to be the internet’s preferred viewing order as well.
Vianney Le Caer/AP Margot Robbie poses for photographers upon arrival at the premiere of the film 'Barbie' on Wednesday, July 12, 2023, in London.
Barbie actor Issa Rae thinks there’s a reason for that.
“I think that there’s a very specific order that if you see them in. If you see Oppenheimer last then you might be a bit of a psychopath,” she diagnosed at the London premiere.
The showdown has made armchair marketing experts out of everyone, quick to scrutinise every move by Warner Bros. and Universal – as though it’s possible to compare two extraordinarily different campaigns.
One has infinite opportunities for very pink, sparkly photo opportunities, whimsical brand partnerships for seemingly everything from underwear to pool floats, large-scale fan events with autograph signings and pop stars like Billie Eilish posting about the soundtrack. In other words, the Barbie campaign can go nuclear.
Oppenheimer has the bomb, the alluring mystery and the big screen hook, but it’s not the kind of movie that lends itself to, say, a frozen yogurt collaboration.
Is the competition real, though, or just a meme? Some in Hollywood wondered if Warner Bros. plopped Barbie on the weekend as a slight to Nolan, who had opened many films for the studio in that corridor including Inception and Dunkirk. He left Warner Bros. amid its controversial decision to send a year’s worth of movies to streaming and made Oppenheimer with Universal instead. But a pointed box office war doesn’t exactly make sense for a studio that has talked recently about wanting to lure Nolan back.
Gareth Cattermole The cast and crew of Oppenheimer at the London premiere.
There is an unspoken code of conduct: Never badmouth another studio’s film, publicly at least. This is partly decorum, especially when it comes to “box office showdowns” which all will say are a creation of the press and sideline spectators. But it’s also rooted in some truth: The conventional thinking is that having eyes on one movie is good for other movies – you see their posters and trailers and on some level everyone benefits.
And social media has allowed movie stars to get in on the game, too. Following reports that Cruise was irked the latest Mission: Impossible was going to lose its IMAX screens to Oppenheimer after only a week, Cruise posted photos of himself and director Christopher McQuarrie standing in front of posters for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Barbie and Oppenheimer, holding tickets for each.
“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theatres. These are just a few that we can’t wait to see on the big screen,” Cruise’s Instagram caption read.
The official accounts for Indiana Jones, Barbie and Oppenheimer responded with supportive notes. Gerwig and Robbie even followed with a similar photo series a few days later, which the official “Oppenheimer” Instagram account reposted in its stories. Charged with playing Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy told the AP at his movie’s London premiere that “of course” he’d be seeing Barbie. The sporting cross-promotion between four studios – Universal, Warner Bros., Disney and Paramount – is something the film business has not quite seen before.
“Not only is Tom Cruise the biggest box office star in the world, but he’s also an incredible ambassador for the movie theatre, for the movie theatre experience and boosting other movies,” Dergarabedian said. “And that collegial atmosphere within the framework of what is seen as the very competitive box office derby is kind of a nice thing.”

Still, everyone likes a No. 1 debut, and both Barbie and Oppenheimer reportedly carry $100 million [NZ $157m] production price tags (not including the millions spent on marketing). As far as box office tracking goes, Barbie has it in the bag with forecasts showing that it could open above US$90 million [NZ $141m] in North America. Oppenheimer meanwhile is tracking in the $40 million [NZ $62m] range. Then there’s the wild card of Mission: Impossible 7’s second weekend, which could snag second place.
Still even with a second- or third-place start, Oppenheimer could be destined for a long, steady, profitable run into awards season. Adult audiences for R-rated movies are not often the ones who pack theatres the first weekend.
Back in 2008, in the midst of the recession, Warner Bros. and Universal faced off on the same July weekend with another Nolan film that went up against a lighthearted confection: The Dark Knight and Mamma Mia! – both of which went on to be enormously profitable (though Nolan did win the first weekend).
The bigger worry is that what’s been heralded as Hollywood’s post-pandemic comeback summer has had more ups and downs than anyone might have hoped. That’s putting quite a bit of pressure on “Barbenheimer” to overperform and boost the lagging summer box office, which pales in comparison to the bigger issues facing the industry as actors join the writers on strike.
But with just over a week to go, it’s still a source of amusement. Even “Barbie” co-star Will Ferrell threw the gauntlet in his winking way at the London premiere.
“I think the world maybe wants to see Barbie a little bit more right now,” Ferrell said. “Just saying!”

2023-07-28 20:00:00+00:00,The True Story of Jean Tatlock in Oppenheimer,Florence Pugh portrays the tragic figure of Jean in Christopher Nolan's film.,"In Christopher Nolan's new epic Oppenheimer, Florence Pugh portrays Jean Tatlock, J. Robert Oppenheimer's lover who meets a tragic end when she dies by suicide. Though Pugh is barely in the three hour plus film, her performance is impactful, and leaves the viewer wanting more.
If you got out of the movie theaters and immediately thought to Google Jean Tatlock, you're in the right place. Here's the true story of the woman depicted on screen:
She was a psychiatrist.
Jean Frances Tatlock was the daughter of John Strong Perry Tatlock, a professor of English, and Marjorie Tatlock (née Fenton). Born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Tatlock went to Cambridge Rindge and Latin School in Cambridge, Massachusetts before enrolling in Vassar. She graduated in 1935 and then went to Berkeley to complete prerequisites for medical school. Later, she attended Stanford Medical School, where she graduated in 1941 as a psychiatrist.
She was a member of the Communist Party.
While at Stanford, Tatlock wrote for the Western Worker, the Communist Party's west coast periodical.
Tatlock met J. Robert Oppenheimer in Berkley in 1936.
At the time, she was a graduate student and Oppenheimer was a physics professor. Oppenheimer described their relationship during his 1954 security hearing as follows:
In the spring of 1936, I had been introduced by friends to Jean Tatlock, the daughter of a noted professor of English at the university; and in the autumn, I began to court her, and we grew close to each other. We were at least twice close enough to marriage to think of ourselves as engaged. Between 1939 and her death in 1944 I saw her very rarely. She told me about her Communist Party memberships; they were on again, off again affairs, and never seemed to provide for her what she was seeking. I do not believe that her interests were really political. She loved this country and its people and its life. She was, as it turned out, a friend of many fellow travelers and Communists, with a number of whom I was later to become acquainted.
Oppenheimer reportedly proposed to Tatlock twice. After he wed Kitty Harrison, the scientist still saw Tatlock a few times, and some historians believe he had an affair with Tatlock while working on the Manhattan Project.
Furthermore, Tatlock introduced Oppenheimer to John Donne's poetry. It's possible that Oppenheimer named the ""Trinity"" test as a tribute to her and the verse.
She questioned her sexuality.
Tatlock reportedly wondered whether or not she was gay. According to by Shirley Streshinsky and Patricia Klaus, she wrote to a friend, ""there was a period when I thought I was homosexual. I still am, in a way, forced to believe it, but really, logically, I am sure that I can't be because of my un-masculinity.""
There's some mystery around her 1944 death.
While Jean was being treated at Mount Zion hospital in San Francisco for depression, her father found her dead in her apartment. There was an unsigned suicide note, which read, ""I am disgusted with everything... To those who loved me and helped me, all love and courage. I wanted to live and to give and I got paralyzed somehow. I tried like hell to understand and couldn't... I think I would have been a liability all my life—at least I could take away the burden of a paralyzed soul from a fighting world."" Most agree Tatlock died by suicide.

But some historians—including Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin, authors of American Prometheus, which forms the basis for Nolan's Oppenheimer—question her death.
""According to the coroner, Tatlock had eaten a full meal shortly before her death,"" Bird and Sherwin write. ""If it was her intention to drug and then drown herself, as a doctor she had to have known that undigested food slows the metabolizing of drugs into the system. The autopsy report contains no evidence that the barbiturates had reached her liver or other vital organs. Neither does the report indicate whether she had taken a sufficiently large dose of barbiturates to cause death. To the contrary, as previously noted, the autopsy determined that the cause of death was asphyxiation by drowning.""
The authors continue, ""These curious circumstances are suspicious enough—but the disturbing information contained in the autopsy report is the assertion that the coroner found 'a faint trace of chloral hydrate' in her system. If administered with alcohol, chloral hydrate is the active ingredient of what was then commonly called a 'Mickey Finn'—knockout drops. In short, several investigators have speculated, Jean may have been 'slipped a Mickey,' and then forcibly drowned in her bathtub.""
Of course, this is all speculation; Bird and Sherwin agree there's not enough evidence to definitively say one way or another.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvd25hbmRjb3VudHJ5bWFnLmNvbS9sZWlzdXJlL2FydHMtYW5kLWN1bHR1cmUvYTQ0NjQyMDA3L2plYW4tdGF0bG9jay1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci10cnVlLXN0b3J5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Following its $2.56M takings in the US on Wednesday (August 16), the film has accrued a total of $272.59M, meaning it is now the highest grossing film to have never reached the top spot at the box office (via BoxOfficeMojo).

The previous incumbent of the dubious honour was Sing, with other entries in the historical top 10 including My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Alvin and the Chipmunks, A Star is Born and Sherlock Holmes.
The latter film starred Robert Downey Jr, who played the cunning Lewis Strauss in Oppenheimer, and the actor praised lead star Cillian Murphy for his “sacrifice” when assuming the titular role.
“I have never witnessed a greater sacrifice by a lead actor in my career,” said Downey Jr of Murphy. “He knew it was going to be a behemoth ask when [director] Chris [Nolan] called him. But I think he also had the humility that is required to survive playing a role like this
“We'd be like, 'Hey, we got a three-day weekend. Maybe we'll go antiquing in Santa Fe. What are you going to do?' 'Oh, I have to learn 30,000 words of Dutch. Have a nice time.' But that's the nature of the ask,” he added.

2023-07-26 14:54:00+00:00,Oppenheimer Reconsiders Lewis Strauss's Role In History,"Reportedly, Robert Downey Jr. wanted to challenge the historical figure's status as a villain—playing him like the Salieri to Oppenheimer's Mozart.","Actor Robert Downey Jr. may have declared ""I am Iron Man,"" but J. Robert Oppenheimer might have him beat by uttering the famous Bhagavad Gita text: ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" Very metal. As Lewis Strauss, the former Marvel actor plays opposite Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, as one of the original members of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in 1946.
The character's main arc begins late in Oppenheimer, after the creation of the nuclear bomb and the end of WWII. Oppenheimer grows remorseful over his part in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of lives in Hiroshima and Nagasaki—and he urges President Henry S. Truman (Gary Oldman) to cease any further nuclear testing. In the film, Truman views these thoughts as a sign of weakness, stating that he alone bears the responsibility for ordering the attacks. Meanwhile, the Truman-appointed Strauss (Downey Jr.) begins to advocate for the development of the hydrogen bomb—an even more powerful thermonuclear weapon.
Tensions rise as the Cold War arms race ramps up. Oppenheimer meets with Albert Einstein, who warns him about the potential for nuclear holocaust. This meeting ""wasn't historical,"" according to Oppenheimer's grandson, Charles Oppenheimer. Still, he told Time, ""Einstein's conversation with Oppenheimer at the end was really effective."" Strauss believes that Oppenheimer may badmouthed have badmouthed him during this conversation, however. This partially leads him to become a major player in Oppenheimer's controversial security hearings in 1954.

Taking up most of the third act of Oppenheimer, Strauss levies attack after attack at the hearings—aiming directly at Oppenheimer. He was reportedly offended by Oppenheimer's relationship with former communist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), and even harbored resentment that Oppenheimer never joined him as a prominent figure of major Jewish organizations in Washington (though this aspect of Strauss's character was largely left out of the latest Nolan film). Strauss also had then-FBI director J. Edgar Hoover put Oppenheimer under surveillance, including illegal wiretappings.
""I had a previous fair understanding of Strauss because I was fascinated with the mechanics of warfare, particularly in the Pacific theater in World War II,"" Downey Jr. told Vulture. ""I challenged a little bit the Mozart-Salieri of it all. I said, I’m not sure in some ways that Strauss isn’t a bit the hero here, which kind of raised an eyebrow on Chris [Nolan]. I half-jokingly challenged him on whether Admiral Strauss hadn’t done everything that any patriotic American would’ve done. And he said, Well, this will be a wonderful ongoing dialogue. So, will you do the film? And he’s Chris Nolan, so he’s not asking your fricking agent.""
In the end, Strauss had Oppenheimer's security clearances revoked simply to embarrass him. The hearing ended just a day before the clearances were set to expire anyway, and his status in the public eye as a ""hero"" or a ""villain"" in the hearings varied. A little full of himself, Strauss eventually overstates that he was actually the one who convinced Truman to pursue the H-bomb—which frustrated Truman. The former President leaks a letter to the press outlining his anger at Strauss, which leads to the failure of the AEC chairman's Senate confirmation hearing to become the Secretary of Commerce. The defeat effectively ended Strauss's political career.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcXVpcmUuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbW92aWVzL2E0NDY0ODk5MC9sZXdpcy1zdHJhdXNzLXRydWUtc3Rvcnktb3BwZW5oZWltZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

There were two highly-anticipated blockbusters being released the same weekend with two celebrated directors. These movies were complete opposites as far as premise, visual style and tone. The choice became too much for many movie-lovers to bare until a viral push to double-feature both films was born.
This trend exploded as Barbie would go onto gross over $1 billion and Oppenheimer would rake in $600 million. The social anomaly also created a fashion craze that encouraged audience members to dress in pink or 1940s attire. Sometimes there was a mash-up of both looks. This cinematic sensation had blown up to the point where indie filmmakers decided to use AI to reimagine Barbenheimer as an actual movie.
Curious Refuge is a company that blended dialogue from Barbie and Oppenheimer to create a blueprint for the trailer. Then, they used a movie generator AI called Runway Gen2 and an image generator known as AI Midjourney to design the trailer’s creation. The project took four days to render. While the dialogue is the most robotic aspect of the movie trailer, its merger of both movie’s iconographies was captivating for many viewers. Here is the final result:
These AI systems masterfully and hilariously combined imagery from these two movies. The most striking aspect was the 1940s styled pink clothes, as well as the massive pink nuclear explosion. Next, Ken stole the show again with scenes depicting him glowing after consuming weaponized uranium, then later responding to Oppenheimer’s somber “destroyer of worlds” quote with it being “so awesome.”
“Barbenheimer” assembled such an unexpectedly epic, fan-driven viral marketing campaign, that it not only benefited the consumers and the studios, but inspired content creators to craft even more eye-catching achievements. The Barbenheimer trailer alone has been viewed nearly 350,000 times and continues to grow. Many cinematic classics have warned humanity about the evolution of AI, such as The Terminator, Avengers: Age of Ultron, I, Robot, The Matrix and WALL-E.
However, AI’s growing development in modern society is becoming more commonplace. So much that it allows for a genuine contemplation of how it should be used, especially for entertainment. Some speculate that AI is capable of revolutionizing cinema and saving companies, like Disney, through innovation, sustainability, and adaptability. Time will tell if it will be utilized this proficiently in the entertainment industry. Until then, AI will continue to be an incendiary topic that will delight many and equally terrify others.
What do you think of the trailer? Should an entire Barbenheimer movie be made next?",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbWFnaWMubmV0LzIwMjMvMDgvYWktY3JlYXRlcy1iYXJiZW5oZWltZXItdHJhaWxlci1mYW5zLWRlbWFuZC1tb3ZpZS1uZXh0LWp0YzEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Oppenheimer was heavily involved in The Manhattan Project, a research and development undertaking during World War II.
From 1942 to 1946, he was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the bombs under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
At its peak, nearly 130,000 people were involved in the project, which at the time cost nearly $2billion, the equivalent of $24billion in 2021.
As a result of his work, Oppenheimer is a key figure within the narrative of atomic bomb ethics and political nuclear power.
Oppenheimer, who was a chain smoker, was diagnosed with throat cancer in late 1965.
On February 15, 1967, he fell into a coma and died at his home in Princeton, New Jersey on three days later at the age of 62.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Grand Rapids will be one of a few places in the world where movie buffs can view Christopher Nolan's movie Oppenheimer the way he intended it.
Celebration Cinema North has received Oppenheimer in IMAX 70mm film. It's one of only 31 theaters in the world showing the film in this format.
When laid out, the reel is more than 11 miles long and weighs more than 600 pounds.
John Foley is one of the IMAX projectionists setting up the reel to show the movie in Grand Rapids.
""They’re pulling a lot of guys who haven’t done it in a few years to make it,"" said Foley of setting up the format, ""It’s an entertaining trip down nostalgia lane. The muscle memory comes back so fast. It feels so good.""
The film will appear different on screen than a digital movie you typically see in theaters. The 70mm film will have a resolution of about 18k. That is compared to either 2k or 4k that most movies are screened in.
""A lot of people who love film love the film grain, the warmth of it, seeing the chatter, seeing the frame rate,"" said Foley, ""Lasers are great and perfect every time, but there’s a little analog magic that’s missing.""
Oppenheimer comes out July 21. Tickets are on sale now, and going fast.
All 70mm IMAX showings do not have trailers prior to the movie, and the feature starts promptly at showtime.

Oppenheimer's early reactions are mostly positive, and it looks like Nolan has another hit on his hands. Nolan has a major battle ahead of him with the release of Oppenheimer, as it's set to go toe to toe with Warner Bros. upcoming live-action Barbie movie based on the doll from Mattel. From everything we've seen in the trailers, Oppenheimer is pretty close to what actually happened, and it looks great. Matt Damon has a lot of semi-inspirational lines in the trailers, and one of his Oppenheimer costars is making fun of him for it. While speaking with ComicBook.com's Brandon Davis, Emily Blunt lightly roasts Damon for his trailer lines.
""I remember Chris [Nolan] going, 'I mean, [Matt] Damon's gonna be thrilled,"" Blunt said in our exclusive interview for Oppenheimer's release. ""He's got so many trailer lines.""
""I don't. I'm just playing the scene like, you know, a line like this is the most important thing to happen in the history of the world. Like it's just true, right? It's like, so you just play the authenticity of that line. And the script did a really good job of kind of teasing out that tension that was there just because the military had this kind of need to kind of compartmentalize everything and need for secrecy, that desperate need for secrecy because it was life and death, you know, a species level, you know, annihilation potentially. Like there's nothing more consequential than that. And yet the scientists are like to get to the truth, we have to share information and it's like how can those two philosophies coexist, right? So, there was a lot to play and groves was also a very unpopular guy among the scientists, which is fun. So you can kind of mine that for laughs here and there because he didn't care obviously."" Damon added about his lines in Oppenheimer.

2023-07-21 10:00:53+00:00,"Was Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, also the father of black holes?","The name Oppenheimer will always be synonymous with the power and destruction of the atomic bomb, but he also played a key role in the study of black holes.","An illustration of a black hole next to the ""father of the atomic bomb,"" Robert Oppenheimer.
Before becoming ""the father of the atom bomb,"" J. Robert Oppenheimer made a significant contribution to the science of black holes.
Oppenheimer will forever, for better or for worse, be associated with the incredible destructive power of the atomic bomb and the image of the mushroom cloud, a near-Biblical symbol of destruction. That association will only strengthen in the public eye with today's (July 21) release of ""Oppenheimer,"" Christopher Nolan's highly anticipated biopic about the physicist.
But before journeying to Los Alamos, New Mexico, in 1942 to contribute to the development of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer was a theoretical physicist focusing on quantum physics.
In 1939, he and his University of California, Berkeley colleague Hartland S. Snyder published a pioneering paper entitled ""On Continued Gravitational Contraction,"" which used the equations of Albert Einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity, to show how black holes could be born.
""Oppenheimer proposed the very first collapse model to describe how a star could collapse into a black hole,"" Xavier Calmet, a professor of physics at the University of Sussex in England, told Space.com. ""This model explains the formation of black holes as a dynamical astrophysical process, the final stage of the evolution of heavy-enough stars. This model is still being used today.""
Related: 'Oppenheimer' trailer reveals Cillian Murphy as Manhattan Project's genius bomb maker
Calmet said that he recently used the model himself, in a paper describing the collapse of black holes when considering quantum gravity.
""This model is very significant because it is analytically solvable — solving the equations can be done with pen and paper and does not require numerical work. All the physics is thus easily trackable,"" he said. ""Yet, despite its simplicity and maybe even crudeness, it is complex enough to describe many of the features of a collapsing star.""
Ironically, as Oppenheimer and Snyder worked on the paper, which so heavily depended on the 1915 theory of general relativity, the father of that theory, Einsten, was himself completing research aimed at showing that black holes could not exist.
History would show Oppenheimer to be right about black holes, of course.

Oppenheimer pushes the limit
Eight years before Oppenheimer's theory of star collapse and black hole birth, another theoretical physicist was thinking about what happens when stars run out of fuel for nuclear fusion.
When this fuel is exhausted, a star can no longer support itself against gravitational collapse. While the star's outer layers are shed, its core rapidly contracts, leaving an exotic stellar remnant. The nature of the remnant depends on the mass of the stellar core.
Indian-American physicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar realized that, for stellar cores with a mass less than 1.4 times that of the sun, gravitational collapse would halt due to quantum effects that prevent particles from ""squashing"" too close together.
This would come to be known as the Chandrasekhar limit, and any star below it — unless it has a stellar companion feeding it material — is doomed to end its existence as a smoldering stellar remnant called a white dwarf. That will be the fate of our star, the sun, after it exhausts the hydrogen at its core in around 5 billion years.
Related: When will the sun die?
For stellar cores at least 1.4 times more massive than the sun, there is enough pressure, and thus heat, generated during gravitational collapse that further bouts of nuclear fusion can be triggered, with the helium created by the fusion of hydrogen itself forging heavier elements like nitrogen, oxygen and carbon.
The most massive stars undergo a series of these collapses and bouts of nuclear fusion. But Oppenheimer and his students wanted to know where this gravitational collapse path leads and, thus, what is the final state of the universe's biggest stars.
This answer had already been delivered by a German physicist in 1916. Oppenheimer just had to find out how to get there.
The two births of black holes
In 1915, while serving on the front with the German army during the First World War, astronomer Karl Schwarzschild got his hands on a copy of Einstein's theory of general relativity. Astoundingly, and to the shock of Einstein, under these incredibly harsh conditions, Schwarzschild managed to calculate an exact mathematical solution to the field equations of general relativity.
In these solutions lurked two disturbing things — places known as ""singularities"" where physics as we know it completely breaks down. These singularities indicated the existence of objects with gravity so intense that they could ""swallow"" light.
One of the singularities was deemed a coordinate singularity, which could be removed with a little clever mathematical manipulation. This coordinate singularity would come to be known as the Schwarzschild radius — the point at which the gravity of a body becomes so great that the velocity needed to escape its clutches is greater than the speed of light.
This one-way light-trapping surface is called the ""event horizon,"" and it represents the outer boundary of the black hole.

The other singularity, the true or gravitational singularity, could not be dealt with mathematically. Nothing could remove it, so it was, and still is, the point at which physics completely breaks down — the heart of the black hole.
That was the theoretical birth of the black hole concept, but it didn't say anything about the creation of these cosmic titans — just that they can exist.
While Einstein toiled in 1939 to destroy this gravitational singularity, and thus the concept of the black hole, Oppenheimer was delving into how such objects could come to exist.
Working with simple assumptions that neglect quantum effects and don't consider rotation, Oppenheimer set Snyder to work. And this paid off when the latter researcher discovered that what appears to happen to a collapsing star is dependent on an observer's point of view.
Snyder theorized that, at some distance from the collapsing star, light from a source close to the event horizon would have its wavelength stretched by gravity, a process called redshift, with it becoming ever more red.
At the same time, the frequency of this light is being reduced from the observer's perspective. This frequency reduction continues until, for the distant observer, the light is effectively ""frozen.""
Oppenheimer and collaborators realized the story is quite different for an observer unfortunate enough to be falling with the surface of the collapsing star. An observer in this position would fall beyond the event horizon without noticing anything significant about it.
Of course, in reality, an observer would be ""spaghettified"" by intense tidal forces caused by the difference in the gravitational pull on their upper and lower body. This would kill them before they hit the event horizon, at least for smaller black holes, in which the Schwarzschild radius is close to the gravitational singularity.
This concept was initially referred to as a ""frozen star"" due to the apparent freezing of light at the event horizon. It wouldn't receive its more familiar and snappier name until 1967, when Princeton University physicist John Wheeler coined the term ""black hole"" during a lecture.
Oppenheimer and colleagues may have taken a different path than Schwarzschild, but still, the two teams of physicists arrived at the same destination: the concept of a stellar body so massive that its gravity traps light and causes infinite redshift. Schwarzschild had the theory, but Oppenheimer and colleagues were the first scientists who truly understood the physical birth of a black hole.
Three years later, Oppenheimer would travel to Los Alamos, cementing his place in history and in the perception of the public. But many, scientists especially, remember him as the father of black holes.
""Oppenheimer made very significant contributions to black hole physics and physics as a whole,"" Calmet concluded. ""While the general public may associate his name with the bomb and the Manhattan Project, his contributions to physics and astrophysics are well appreciated by the scientific community.
""He was one of the leading physicists during his lifetime and was extremely influential, and his seminal work is still relevant today.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1hdG9taWMtYm9tYi1ibGFjay1ob2xlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-01 06:00:00+00:00,Oppenheimer box office,"Oppenheimer might be playing second-fiddle to Barbie, but Christopher Nolan's movie is set to become one of his biggest ever at the box office.","Oppenheimer might have had to settle for second place behind Barbie's epic box-office run, but don't let that make you think Christopher Nolan's new movie has been a disappointment.
The movie couldn't avoid being compared to Barbie given the fervent Barbenheimer hype, yet it was never going to operate on the same level. It's a dense, adult-skewing biopic rather than the more family-friendly charms of Barbie, while its three-hour runtime limited showtimes (although it has dominated IMAX screens at Mission: Impossible 7's expense).
But while an objective view of the numbers might see Oppenheimer pale in comparison to Barbie, it's been quietly pulling in its own impressive box-office returns and records over its two weekends of release.
So let's delve into the numbers to show how much of a hit Oppenheimer has been.
Universal
We'll start with the current numbers as of August 3. After its second week, Oppenheimer has taken $199.9 million at the US box office and $278.9 million overseas.
That gives Oppenheimer a current worldwide global total of $478.8 million, already more than Tenet ($365.3 million) and Batman Begins ($373.7 million) took in their entire runs, and it will cross $500 million this weekend.
Before we look at how it compares to other Nolan movies, it's worth noting the records that Oppenheimer has set already. The most impressive of all is that it was the first R-rated movie at the US box office to gross more than $10 million a day for more than seven days in a row and achieved a consecutive run of 10 days over $10 million.
That's far from the only record though as its second weekend in the US was the biggest-ever for an R-rated summer release, ahead of Deadpool 2's $43.5 million. Overseas, it's already Nolan's highest-grossing movie in 30 markets, including India, Turkey and the UAE, and his biggest non-Batman movie in 45 markets, including Brazil and Mexico.
Universal
In terms of Nolan movies worldwide, Oppenheimer currently ranks as his sixth-biggest movie behind Dunkirk ($527 million), Interstellar ($773.4 million), Inception ($870.8 million), The Dark Knight ($1.01 billion) and The Dark Knight Rises ($1.08 billion).
Given that it has already been performing above expectations, it's tricky to predict where Oppenheimer will end up. It'll definitely overtake Dunkirk and could challenge Interstellar if it holds well, but Inception's crown as the biggest non-Batman movie is probably out of reach.
Even with a more restrictive rating (an R rating in the US, 15 in the UK), the movie is outperforming other notable 2023 releases. It's already overtaken Indiana Jones 5 ($356 million) and The Flash ($268.1 million), and it'll surpass the likes of Mission: Impossible 7 ($448.5 million) and Ant-Man 3 ($476 million).
Like with Barbie, Oppenheimer has achieved such strong box-office returns as, first and foremost, it's an excellent movie. It's currently got a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes (tied with The Dark Knight for Nolan's best) and an A CinemaScore, meaning it's impressing cinemagoers as much as it did critics.
But it is worth addressing the Barbenheimer of it all as it's played a part in the success of the movie too.
Warner Bros/Universal
Ever since Barbie was confirmed to release on the same day (July 21, if you need reminding), the unique dual release of the two movies has been a talking point on social media – and that only increased as the release date drew nearer.
Barbie certainly benefitted from a different audience viewing it as part of a double-bill, and Oppenheimer arguably benefitted even more from this. Nolan movies are always a big draw for cinephiles, but it's not a stretch to say a three-hour biopic about the ""father of the atomic bomb"" wouldn't have had a wide appeal on its own.
It's possible that Oppenheimer would have done decent numbers released on any other day. However, its box-office ceiling was raised by being paired with Barbie, bringing it to an audience that typically wouldn't have seen it and also boosting its social media presence with the Barbenheimer campaign.
This isn't the only reason that Oppenheimer has done well (the draw of a Nolan movie 'needing' to be seen on the big screen is another), yet it's definitely a key factor that has increased the level of success possible.
And if Barbie keeps the party going, then there's every chance Oppenheimer continues to prosper in the weeks ahead.

Christopher Nolan has likened the ending of his forthcoming biopic Oppenheimer to that of his 2010 film Inception.
Released next month, Oppenheimer follows the story of scientist J Robert Oppenheimer, the inventor of the atomic bomb. Cillian Murphy (Peaky Blinders) plays the title character while Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon front an all-star supporting cast.
Inception starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Dom Cobb, an American fugitive who has made a career out of infiltrating people’s dreams. The film famously ended on a note of ambiguity, with the audience left uncertain as to whether or not Cobb was still in a dream or not.
In an interview with Wired ahead of Oppenheimer’s release, Nolan was asked whether his films tended to have an optimistic or “anti-nihilistic” viewpoint.
“I mean, the end of Inception, it’s exactly that,” Nolan replied. “There is a nihilistic view of that ending, right? But also, [Cobb had] moved on and is with his kids. The ambiguity is not an emotional ambiguity. It’s an intellectual one for the audience.
“It’s funny, I think there is an interesting relationship between the endings of Inception and Oppenheimer to be explored,” he continued. “Oppenheimer’s got a complicated ending. Complicated feelings.”
Among the other actors to feature in Oppenheimer are Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Jack Quaid, Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Gary Oldman, Kenneth Branagh, Alden Ehrenreich, Dane DeHaan, and David Dastmalchian.
Nolan also ramped up the anticipation for Oppenheimer by claiming that cinemagoers have been walking away from test screenings of the film “devastated”.

“Some people leave the movie absolutely devastated,” the director claimed. “They can’t speak. I mean, there’s an element of fear that’s there in the history and there in the underpinnings. But the love of the characters, the love of the relationships, is as strong as I’ve ever done.”

Nolan, 52, added: “It is an intense experience because it’s an intense story. I showed it to a filmmaker recently who said it’s kind of a horror movie. I don’t disagree.”
The film clocks in at three hours long, making it Nolan’s longest release to date.
Kai Bird, the historian who wrote the 2005 biography that inspired Nolan’s film, also recently shared his thoughts on the movie.
“I am, at the moment, stunned and emotionally recovering from having seen [Oppenheimer],” he said.

,Josh Hartnett and Wife Tamsin Egerton Make for a Cool Pair at ‘Oppenheimer’ London Premiere,"Josh Hartnett and Wife Tamsin Egerton, who are known for keeping their lives private, stepped out at the London premiere of 'Oppenheimer' in teal and gray ensembles","Josh Hartnett and his wife Tamsin Egerton stunned in cool colors on the Oppenheimer red carpet.
The couple was photographed arm-in-arm at the film’s premiere in London with Harnett wearing gray and Egerton opting for teal, as they posed against the fiery red backdrop of the event.
The Oppenheimer actor, 44, wore a sleek gray suit — with the suit jacket left open to reveal a silver shirt buttoned down halfway. He accessorized the look with a matching silver watch on his left arm, which was visible in one shot where he posed while holding his jacket lapel.
Meanwhile, Egerton, 34, wore a teal long sleeved collared dress with pink and white flower motifs, along with metallic strappy heels and silver jewelry as she smiled at the camera while posing for several shots with her husband.

The film follows J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), the scientist who famously led the Manhattan Project — the effort to create an atomic bomb during World War II. In the movie, Hartnett stars as Earnest Lawrence, a coworker of Oppenheimer’s during the project.
Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin, the film also stars Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt and Matt Damon.
Hartnett and Egerton — who is known for her appearances on Driving Lessons, St. Trinian's and Camelot — are extremely private when it comes to their personal lives; they even managed to keep the birth of their third child out of the press for over a year.

After meeting on the set of The Lovers, the pair began dating in 2012. Nearly 10 years later, Hartnett and Egerton secretly wed in November of 2021.
The couple welcomed their first child, a daughter, in late 2015. They then welcomed two more children in 2017 and 2019, respectively, though the names of their children have never been revealed.

2023-07-23 21:41:52+00:00,5 Fascinating Lessons from ‘Barbenheimer’s’ Box Office Romp,Two new Hollywood releases. Two stunning success stories. What's the secret behind Barbenheimer? It all starts here...,"Share Email Reddit 0 Shares
Hollywood just rocked the culture like it hadn’t done in ages.
Two new movies brought audiences rushing back to theaters as if the pandemic and dueling union strikes never happened.
Both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” over-performed expectations, with the former putting up numbers worthy of the MCU’s golden years. Social media quickly dubbed the duo “Barbenheimer,” a plucky term for the zeitgeist-grabbing films.
Oppenheimer | New Trailer

“ Barbie ” – $155 million stateside (final figure: $162 million)
” – $155 million stateside (final figure: $162 million) “ Oppenheimer ” – $80 million stateside (final figure: $82 million)
” – $80 million stateside (final figure: $82 million) (For good measure …)”Sound of Freedom” – $20 million stateside
That contribute to the year’s largest box office weekend and the fourth largest … ever.
Hollywood can be slow to learn from its mistakes and glean insight from hits that don’t fit the industry groupthink. Have we seen any “Top Gun: Maverick” clones greenlit in the last year? Are studio executives scrambling to make their own “Sound of Freedom” given that film’s shocking box office numbers?
Likely not.
The industry can still take solace from the “Barbenheimer” one-two punch, assuming it understands the reasons behind the numbers.
If You Build It, They Will (Still) Come
It’s hard not to recall the 1989 baseball classic “Field of Dreams” and its iconic line this weekend. That film featured an unlikely diamond in the cornfield rough, one that turned a modest film into a piece of Hollywood lore.
The message is simple. If Hollywood builds movies that appeal to the American public they will still scramble to see them come opening weekend, streaming be darned.
The trick? Dissecting why these movies mattered so much to audiences.
It’s Not a Movie, It’s an Event
The marketing mavens get some of the credit here. The “Barbie” advertising campaigns proved wildly effective, delivering a slow but steady drip of clips, stills and social media memes that whetted our appetite for the actual movie.
Did anyone know what “Barbie” was actually about? Not really. They saw beautiful stars, colorful sets and knew it all tied into an iconic toy brand.
Voila! A massive opening-weekend haul.
“Oppenheimer” had a different path to success. His name is Christopher Nolan. Once upon a time, a new Steven Spielberg movie made us woozy with anticipation. The Spielberg of today can’t deliver like he once did. “The Fabelmans” was … fine, nothing more. “West Side Story” retold a tale that didn’t need a makeover.
Does anyone even remember “Bridge of Spies” eight years later?
Nolan movies are an event. He makes a new film every two or three years, so each project feels like an event, something that requires marking your calendar so you won’t miss it. The “Oppenheimer” marketers shrewdly played up his name in the marketing material, and rightly so.
Nolan is one of a kind, a serious storyteller whose films draw blockbuster bucks. An “Oppenheimer” biopic directed by almost anyone else would be lucky to snag a $10 million opening weekend. Maybe less.
We have too many leisure options these days. YouTube. TikTok. Streaming platforms galore. Movies need to be “events” whenever possible, not just titles on a theater marquee.
Bait and Switch Still Works
Marketers may study the “Barbie” effect for years.
Warner Bros. knew Greta Gerwig’s film delivered two hours of clumsy, woke sermons. Studio executives also knew that wouldn’t sell as many tickets as a fun, frilly “Barbie” tribute.
So … they lied. They played up the beauty, laughter and candy-colored sets and buried the film’s anti-men messaging.

The co-stars did their best to spoil the marketing machine, but audiences absorbed the visuals and clips far more than any one promotional interview.
It’s the perfect bait and switch, and it’s likely the film’s box office momentum will override any sizable objections from ticket holders expecting something very different from the film.
Glamour Gal: Margot Robbie Is Back
The Australian star appeared in not one but two mega-bombs last year. Both “Amsterdam” and “Babylon” arrives with plenty of Oscar buzz and quickly disappeared thanks to middling reviews and audience disinterest.
She’s back in a huge way with “Barbie,” a movie that leans into her natural beauty. Audiences still crave movie-star glamour, and it helps that Ryan Gosling is both her co-star and someone who frequently exposes his physique.
Margot Robbie says she bribed Ryan Gosling to play Ken in #Barbie by promising to buy him a gift every day of shooting: “Everyday there was this pink wrapped present from Barbie to Ken in order to encourage Ken-ergy.” 🔗: https://t.co/VrBlvzldcs pic.twitter.com/Gl5nYr1bm0 — Pop Crave (@PopCrave) July 23, 2023
Robbie’s last big film was “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,” which also embraced her beauty along with her Oscar-winning co-star, Brad Pitt.
Audiences don’t mind seeing actors get gritty and flex their artistic muscles, but they sometimes crave escapism via glamorous stars. “Barbie” delivered just that.
Mystery Matters
The modern film trailer reveals way too much. Watch any given teaser and you’ll know the heroes, the villains and the movie’s biggest laughs. Some trailers all but explain the story’s arc from start to finish.
It’s maddening. It also makes audiences less eager to see the movie in question. They may feel they already have.
The “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” trailers take a smarter approach. The “Barbie” teasers shared little about the plot in question. They hid the movie’s hard-Left lectures, of course, but also the story’s basic beats.
Mystery. Intrigue. Curiosity. Who wouldn’t want to see what the real “Barbie” was all about?

The “Oppenheimer” trailer leaned on the sense that Nolan wouldn’t tackle this subject in a traditional fashion. The film’s trailer hinted at the powerful spectacle, the sense of dread behind the scenes and the inscrutable Cillian Murphy in the title role.
We know Oppenheimer cracked the code and created the first atomic bomb. But how, and what were the decisions that led to that historic discovery?
“Oppenheimer” would share it all in a way no history text could match.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZGludG90by5jb20vYmFyYmVuaGVpbWVyLWJveC1vZmZpY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-18 15:36:50-04:00,"Ranking Christopher Nolan's Best Movies Before Oppenheimer: Inception, The Dark Knight & More","With Oppenheimer coming to theaters everywhere, we thought it was a good time to rank Christopher Nolan's best films, from Following to The Dark Knight.","When you look at the track records of modern directors, Christopher Nolan possesses one of the strongest bodies of work out there. From his first film, Following (1998), to his latest, Oppenheimer (in theaters this Friday), there's literally not a dog in the bunch. There might be a sliding scale, which many have debated in terms of specific titles and their impact and overall cohesiveness, but no one goes to a Nolan film who isn't wowed by something original and visually stunning.
If early critical reactions to Oppenheimer are any indication when it comes to the opinions of mainstream audiences, all signs point to another winner on his C.V., with some critics saying this might actually be Nolan's best film yet.
As it's always a good time for a Nolan-movie marathon, SYFY WIRE is revisiting his entire theatrical catalog and assessing our preferences for his very best. So without further adieu, let's get to the rankings!
RELATED: Watch This 5-Minute First Look at Christopher Nolan’s Epic Oppenheimer
Ranking Christopher Nolan's Films
11. Following (1998)
Nolan's very first theatrical film that he wrote and directed, Following is a very low budget project that Nolan shot in black and white, very economically, so he wouldn't run out of 16mm film stock. His hands are over all parts of it, from the writing to the camera and the editing. It's an effective neo-noir thriller that certainly shows shades of what he would mature into later in his career.
10. Tenet (2020)
One of Nolan's more divisive efforts, with some hailing it as an ambitious experiment, while others labeled it a confusing, aurally muddy misfire. There's certainly some interesting visuals and performances to eke out in Tenet, but on the whole, the film's just not as cohesive as many of his best.
9. Interstellar (2014)
The success of Interstellar is mostly determined by how moved you are by the father/daughter relationship that resides at its emotional core. Matthew McConaughey plays Joseph Cooper, with Jessica Chastain playing the adult iteration of his daughter, Murphy ""Murph"" Cooper. They do a fine job independently, but there's something a bit missing in the actual connections in the film. But there's lots of twisty real science laid into its structure that challenges the brain and is augmented by some incredible sequences that portray deep space travel in ways never seen before.
8. Dunkirk (2017)
An admirable depiction of the grisly realities of World War II, Dunkirk puts audiences in the thick of battle almost as an immersion exercise. Harrowing and gripping, Nolan really succeeds in shattering that distance between audience and warfare. Not the easiest of watches, but a potent historical and visual representation of a war that changed the course of history.
7. Insomnia (2002)
A very underrated gem on Nolan's resume, Insomnia features two incredible performances by Al Pacino and Robin Williams. Set in Alaska during summer when there's a perpetual sun, Pacino plays an L.A. detective plagued by a terrible bout of insomnia as he tries to help the local police track down a killer. It's got an effective true crime vibe about it, but it's the exploration of the psyches of two men on opposite sides, playing a game of cat and mouse, that really leaves an impression. Williams is stellar playing against type.
6. Batman Begins (2005)
In Batman Begins, Nolan revitalized the beloved character by casting Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman and playing everything as gritty and real. There wasn't a drop of kitsch or camp as far as the eye could see, and that made all the difference in putting some wind in the sails of the venerable comic book franchise. Nolan also staged one of the best car chases captured on cinema.

5. Inception (2010)
A story about thieves stealing from the subconscious part of people's brains is one hell of a heady concept, but Inception goes there. And Nolan underpinned that highest of concepts with some truly mind-boggling visuals that bent reality and left jaws-dropping. He assembled a fantastic cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, and together they managed to make a very emotional story about the most existential of concepts. There's also something to be said about how much the visuals of Inception went on to influence a bevy of sci-fi films that have since followed.
4. Memento (2000)
Only Nolan's second film, but Memento remains the gold standard of non-linear storytelling. It's also a fantastic mystery. Guy Pearce knocked it out of the park as Leonard Shelby, a man suffering from a short-term memory problem that is tied to a mystery he's trying to piece together. Visually inventive, wholly original, and shockingly mature for a second film, it's a modern classic that holds up fantastically.
3. The Prestige (2006)
Nolan brought Bale with him to make this period piece about rival magicians and a seemingly impossible ""trick"" called ""The Transported Man."" Usually films that hinge on a reveal end up feeling lesser once the trick has been exposed, but The Prestige is the rare effort that is so richly told that it only gets better with repeat viewings. Bale and Hugh Jackman are exceptional foes, who give equally devastating performances.
2. The Dark Knight Rises (2012)
The third film in Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, Bruce Wayne's world gets a lot bigger with the introduction of Bane (Tom Hardy), Catwoman (Anne Hathaway), and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the man who would be Robin, amongst others. More epic in scale, The Dark Knight Rises closes the story in a very satisfying way as Gotham is saved and Bruce chooses life. Nolan proves that comic book material treated seriously can be worthy cinema.
1. The Dark Knight (2008)
In The Dark Knight, Nolan did the impossible and presented a fresh cinematic version of the Joker (Heath Ledger) that almost made us forget about Jack Nicholson's iconic rendition of the character. This sequel markedly improves upon what Nolan started in Batman Begins with a more engaging and emotional story that amps up the stakes for Bruce Wayne and his small circle. And then Ledger's Joker embodies the chaos and anarchy of the character that feels all-together unique and frightening. Shot partially in IMAX, Nolan immerses us into his Gotham with sweeping aerial shots and noir action capturing one of the best Batman stories ever.

The Oppenheimer actor, 52, is the newest guest on the upcoming installment of Sunday TODAY with Willie Geist, which marks the television journalist's 300th original Sunday sit-down interview.
PEOPLE has an exclusive first look at the chat between Willie Geist and Damon, the latter of whom opens up about how the dynamic between him and Affleck, 50, has evolved over the decades they've worked together.
Asked by Geist, 48, specifically what it was like being directed by Affleck for their recently released sports drama Air, Damon said it was ""great"" and even compared it to being directed by Oppenheimer's Christopher Nolan.
""Great directors really give you the freedom ... it's a collaboration, it's a partnership,"" he explained. ""You're kind of attacking a problem together and you're bringing your ideas, and if [a director is] good, they're receptive to [those ideas].""

As for the ""shorthand"" he and Affleck — with whom he won a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for Good Will Hunting 25 years ago — have on set, Damon said, ""What's really great is there's no diplomacy.""
""You can waste so much time by trying to be polite,"" he continued. ""In the movie business and in theater, they've developed a whole vocabulary for how to talk to somebody — basically, how to tell somebody they're sucking.""
But in Affleck and Damon's case, ""We can just say, 'You suck,' "" Damon joked, laughing. ""Which is really a gift because you get through the bulls--- faster and you go, 'How do we fix it?' ""
""Just tell me I've overacting, you know what I mean?"" he added later.

While Air marked the first time Affleck has directed Damon on a feature film, it wasn't the first time in general — in fact, Affleck's coaching of his best friend goes way back.
During a Q&A following a screening of the film in New York City in March, Affleck joked of Damon, ""It's not the first time I've carried him!"", according to IndieWire.
""It might seem like the first time he's directed me,"" said Damon with a laugh, adding, ""I mean, we did high-school plays where he was like, 'Dude, I think you should do it like this.' ""
""He's been directing me for like 40-something years,"" Damon noted.

In the new Christopher Nolan film, the actor portrays physicist Kenneth Bainbridge, a member of the Manhattan Project team that develops the world's first nuclear weapon. Though his role was technically known to the public beforehand and he briefly pops up in the movie's various trailers, Peck didn't participate in the press tour with other cast members like Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt, leaving many moviegoers surprised by his appearance on screen.
Peck's screen time in ""Oppenheimer"" is short but impactful: His character is present for the Trinity test, a code name used for the first atomic bomb detonation in history. Not only that, but Bainbridge is the one who presses the large red button triggering the weapon's fiery explosion — a task that would ultimately change the course of history. Peck convincingly heightens the suspense of the pivotal moment.
Despite the intensity of Peck's role and the movie as a whole, viewers can't help but crack jokes hearkening back to his past, more lighthearted projects, namely ""Drake & Josh."" Old clips from the sitcom have been circulating on Twitter since ""Oppenheimer"" hit theaters as fans reminisce on Peck's Nickelodeon days. ""Every time i saw josh peck in #Oppenheimer, i expected him to yell 'it's gonna be nuclear. NUCLEAR!'"" one user tweeted after watching.
Several viewers even noted that, at one point in ""Oppenheimer,"" Peck makes a similar squinting facial expression to the one Josh Nichols always makes while angrily muttering, ""Megan,"" in response to his stepsister's various pranks.

Pictures; Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures
One of the most hotly debated head-to-head box office match-ups of the year is just four weeks away. While much could change over the next month, here’s how Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer are shaping up in preliminary tracking.
Barbie
Warner Bros. Pictures
July 21, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $55M-$85M
Domestic Total Range: $120M-$226M
PROS:
Barbie has been a remarkable performer across the social media spectrum thanks to a vocal fan base and meme-driven activity across TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and other platforms.
As a generational brand, Barbie has strong appeal to women of various ages and should benefit from the voice of director and co-writer Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women) and the presence of A-Listers Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the leads.
Outside of The Little Mermaid, very few of this summer’s tentpole films are catering so directly to women, leaving Barbie positioned for a strong performance courting an under-served audience. Early sales reflect this with, with Barbie’s day-one pre-sales coming in 46 percent higher than Mermaid‘s comparable period.
CONS:
It’s challenging at this stage to determine to what extent online and fandom buzz will translate to real world interest. That’s especially true given the film’s seemingly more mature focus; its satirical comedy bent could put a ceiling on family turnout relative to the broader multi-generational appeal of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.
Premium screen footprints will be very low for Barbie, with other films dominating that space throughout July. That not only lowers Barbie‘s potential average ticket prices, but—as audiences increasingly favor a premium viewing experience—could have a negative impact on attendance.
While early pre-sales are strong for previews on Wednesday and Thursday, it remains to be seen whether or not the film will be able to gain traction outside the die-hard fan base in the weeks ahead.
Oppenheimer
Universal Pictures
July 21, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $40M-$55M
Domestic Total Range: $137M-$187M
PROS:
Director Christopher Nolan himself is a reliable box office draw, as shown in the post-Dark Knight era of his career with the success of Dunkirk, Interstellar, and Inception.
Counter-programming potential is strong, with Oppenheimer being one of the few thrillers aimed squarely at adults to receiving a massive marketing push in this day and age.
There’s minimal direct competition moving into the late summer, with most of the wide releases coming to theaters in Oppenheimer‘s first few holdover frames being family-friendly movies.
Pre-sales are popping at this stage, with initial models pointing to preview results ahead of last summer’s Nope and Nolan’s own Dunkirk. General moviegoer interest prompted by strong word of mouth from preview audiences could create long-term backloading weeks into the film’s theatrical run—particularly as many seek out IMAX and other PLFs for this particular film.
CONS:
Oppenheimer‘s three-hour runtime puts even more emphasis on word of mouth—especially given the fact that, while containing a spectacle component, it looks to be Nolan’s most strictly narrative-driven film since The Prestige in 2006.
Men over the age of 25 will be the primary crowd here, and that’s a source of crossover competition with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, opening one week earlier.
Nolan’s Tenet, released under abnormal pandemic-era circumstances, was one of the more divisive films of his career, earning a 76 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.

,Christopher Nolan Says He Won’t Direct Another Superhero Movie After 'Dark Knight' Trilogy,Christopher Nolan has no plans to make another superhero movie after directing the 'Dark Knight' trilogy starring Christian Bale as Batman.,"​Christopher Nolan isn't planning to ask another actor to wear a cape in his movies. The Oppenheimer director, 52, said he has no interest in directing another superhero movie after making The Dark Knight trilogy.
During a speed round of questions in YouTuber HugoDécrypte's interview, Nolan was asked if he would ever make another superhero movie after his Batman films. ""No,"" Nolan replied.
Nolan also said he would never make a television series and passed when asked about wanting to make a Star Wars movie. However, he did say he plans to continue making movies in 10 years.

The Dark Knight trilogy began in 2005 with Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale as the caped crusader. The franchise was followed by The Dark Knight in 2008, and The Dark Knight Rises in 2012. In the past, Bale, 49, has said he would not play Batman again unless Nolan was directing.
""I had a pact with Chris Nolan,"" Bale told ScreenRant last year. ""We said, 'Hey, look. Let's make three films, if we're lucky enough to get to do that. And then let's walk away. Let's not linger too long.' In my mind, it would be something if Chris Nolan ever said to himself, 'You know what, I've got another story to tell.' And if he wished to tell that story with me, I'd be in.""

Since moving on from superheroes, Nolan has moved between historical dramas like Dunkirk to original science fiction epics like Interstellar. His latest is Oppenheimer, which stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who played a key role in developing the first nuclear weapons used in World War II.
The all-star cast features Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife Katherine, Matt Damon as Lieutenant General Leslie Groves, Robert Downey Jr. as U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Lewis Strauss and Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock.
“Just going to flat out say it: This is the best film I’ve ever been in,” Downey, 58, said at the Oppenheimer premiere in London. “I cannot wait for you all to experience it.” The Iron Man actor later said that the three-hour epic ""transcends"" all expectations.
""This is what a summer blockbuster, when I was growing up, used to be,” he continued. “It just kind of, like, changed your life. But again, you know, it’s why Chris Nolan is who he is.""

Murphy, 47, previously worked with Nolan on The Dark Knight movies, playing the Batman villain Scarecrow. He also starred in Inception and Dunkirk. The actor told Entertainment Weekly that the day Nolan asked him to play Oppenheimer was ""one of the best days of my life.""
""I'll always turn up for Chris, no matter what the part is, but, secretly, it's a dream to play a lead part. The thing was, I had no idea,"" he said in a roundtable conversation with Nolan. ""There was no preamble or anything, I just got the call. So it was incredibly exciting, and daunting, and terrifying, all at the same time.""

2023-07-07 19:55:06+00:00,Barbie-Oppenheimer rivalry sparks 'Barbieheimer' mashups,The Barbie-Oppenheimer rivalry/double-feature has sparked a brand new wave of 'Barbieheimer' mashups from posters to trailers.,"The Barbie-Oppenheimer rivalry/double-feature has sparked a brand new wave of 'Barbieheimer' mashups from posters to trailers.
The Barbie-Oppenheimer rivalry has become a fixture in pop culture — even my region's press screenings are on the same day! — and it's ready to come to a head as both films are two weeks out from release. This rivalry has sparked some creative and fun mashups of the two vastly different films dubbed “Barbieheimer.”
First up is a stellar mashup poster created by artist Sean Longmore. 24 x 40 prints are available to purchase for $40. The poster has a retro look that has Cillian Murphy from Oppenheimer in the left corner of the poster as Margot Robbie's Barbie poses next to him. The left further contrasts the right as an explosion can be seen around Murphy's head as the bright and vibrant Barbie Land can be seen bleeding through in the background of the right side. Various side characters from both films fill out the bottom with Ryan Gosling's Ken placed smack in the middle.
YouTuber Jason Gallagher created a mashup trailer titled “Barbieheimer Trailer” that combines the teaser trailers for both films. It begins with the opening shots of Barbie's teaser trailer that paid homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey. We then see Murphy peering through the glass as title cards pop up. “The world is hard enough,” it begins. “Why must we make a choice?” the trailer poses. ”
“When can we have both?” it then asks in reference to having to pick a side in the Barbie-Oppenheimer double-feature. That's when contrasting shots of driving scenes from one film and then the other are shown as the dramatic Oppenheimer score is drowned out by Cass Elliot's “Make Your Own Kind of Music” — which is featured in the Barbie trailer. It ends with a shot that splits the faces of Cillian Murphy and Margot Robbie — the leads of their respective films — straight down the middle.
While you don't necessarily have to choose a side in the Barbie-Oppenheimer rivalry, or “Barbieheimer,” you can see both as Matt Damon and Tom Cruise are.
Barbie and Oppenheimer will be released on July 21.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vY2x1dGNocG9pbnRzLmNvbS9iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItcml2YWxyeS1zcGFya3MtaGlsYXJpb3VzLWJhcmJpZWhlaW1lci1tYXNodXBz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Cillian Murphy has spoken about the brutal effects of playing J. Robert Oppenheimer in the upcoming biopic about the infamous scientist.
The Irish actor, 47, will lead the cast of director Christopher Nolan’s upcoming film which focuses on the American physicist and his role in the Manhattan Project.
The Project, which ran from 1942 to 1946, produced the first nuclear weapons – they were then used in the bombings of Japanese cities Nagasaki and Hiroshima.
Oppenheimer, who was head of the Project’s development, became notable for his chain smoking, often alternating between cigarettes and a pipe.
Now Cillian, who famously played heavy smoker Thomas Shelby in Peaky Blinders, has said preparing for this latest role has turned him off ‘fake cigarettes’ entirely.
‘Cigarettes and pipes. He would alternate between the two. That’s what [killed] him in the end,’ the 28 Days Later actor said. Oppenheimer died of cancer in 1967.

‘I’ve smoked so many fake cigarettes for Peaky and this. My next character won’t be a smoker. They can’t be good for you,’ he told The Guardian.
In addition to (fake) smoking like a chimney to prepare for the role, Cillian also admitted to losing a considerable amount of weight to get into character.
‘You become competitive with yourself a little bit which is not healthy. I don’t advise it,’ he said, keeping the specific details about his weight loss private.

It was also revealed on Saturday that Cillian and his Oppenheimer co-star Florence Pugh have ‘prolonged’ full nude scenes together in the film.
In order to get the best out of him and Florence during nude scenes, the pair were put in a room together to see if there was any ‘chemistry’ between them.
Cillian, however, remarked that he was unsure of the metrics used by the film’s producers to determine whether they were suitable screen partners.
The film will have a 15 certificate for ‘strong language and sex’ for its UK release, making it Nolan’s first film since Insomnia in 2002 to be given such a rating.
Oppenheimer releases on July 21, the same day as Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, which stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken.

,Robert Downey Jr. Reflects on Badly-Reviewed ‘Dolittle’ Movie: ‘I Had Some Reservations’,"Robert Downey Jr. starred in and produced the 2020 film 'Dolittle,' which follows the famous titular doctor who can talk to animals. The movie performed poorly in the box office, grossing $251 million against a $175 million budget and received mostly negative reviews from critics","Robert Downey Jr. “had some reservations” about moving forward with Dolittle way before it flopped with audiences.
In a new interview with The New York Times Magazine published Monday, the actor reflected on his decision to star in and produce the 2020 film — which received harsh reviews from critics.
“I finished the Marvel contract and then hastily went into what had all the promise of being another big, fun, well-executed potential franchise in Dolittle,” Downey Jr., 52, explained to the outlet.
“I had some reservations,” he revealed. “Me and my team seemed a little too excited about the deal and not quite excited enough about the merits of the execution. But at that point I was bulletproof. I was the guru of all genre movies.”

Starring Downey Jr. as the eponymous famous doctor who can talk to animals, the 2020 movie is set in 19th century England and follows Dr. John Dolittle as he is forced out of his recluse to save a young Queen Victoria after she falls ill.
The Iron Man star told NYT that Dolittle was one of the “two most important films I’ve done in the last 25 years” because the film “was a two-and-a-half-year wound of squandered opportunity” in terms of its lost franchise potential.
“The stress it put on my missus as she rolled her sleeves up to her armpits to make it even serviceable enough to bring to market was shocking,” Downey Jr. said of the work the family film created for his wife Susan Downey, who also served as a producer.
“After that point — what’s that phrase? Never let a good crisis go to waste? — we had this reset of priorities and made some changes in who our closest business advisers were,” he shared.

The Marvel actor and his wife then turned their efforts into producing the Netflix documentary Sr., which centers around Downey Jr.’s relationship with his father Robert Downey Sr. during the elder Downey's decline with Parkinson's Disease.
“It’s a way for me to let myself know that just because this may be the most important thing that I ever commit to a data card on a camera, it doesn’t mean it isn’t [expletive] content to everyone else,” Downey Jr. told NYT of producing Sr.
The Avengers star is now following up the 2022 documentary with a starring role in Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, which debuts in theaters July 21.
The highly-anticipated drama is based on the Pulitzer Prize–winning biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer. It follows J. Robert Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy, who famously led the Manhattan Project — the effort to create an atomic bomb during World War II.
Downey portrays Lewis Strauss, a former United States Atomic Energy Commission chairman and the main antagonist of the titular physicist.
Oppenheimer’s A-list cast also boasts Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, David Krumholtz and Josh Peck.

He points out the movie does a great job depicting scientific discoveries leading to the creation of the atomic bomb.
He also appreciates the precision and details of the first atomic test called the “Trinity Test.”
“Nolan really went for a biographical film and some of the reviews and things I have read are kind f complaining that he didn’t do enough about the bomb project,” Pitts said. “That kind of thing, but it really was about Oppenheimer and the kind of longer arc of his life and I really appreciated that.”
Pitts said there are a handful of dramatizations or details left out, but they don’t hurt the story telling of Robert Oppenheimer’s life.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndzbHMuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMy8wNy8yNi92aXJnaW5pYS10ZWNoLXByb2Zlc3Nvci1kaXNjdXNzZXMtaGlzdG9yaWNhbC1hY2N1cmFjeS1vZi1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Like millions of other people last weekend, I made my way to a movie theater to watch one of the two highly anticipated films of the summer: ""Oppenheimer."" The other big movie, released on the same day, was, of course, ""Barbie,"" which I hope to also see sometime soon. The simultaneous debut of two blockbusters on the same day led to the internet meme ""Barbenheimer,"" juxtaposing two very different genres and subjects, but also providing a possible double feature for those willing to watch both movies in one sitting and able to get tickets to both. I have long been a fan of the work by director and screenwriter Christopher Nolan, which includes the Dark Knight trilogy (2005-2012), ""Memento"" (2000), ""Inception"" (2010), ""Interstellar"" (2014) and ""Dunkirk"" (2017), among others. In my opinion, Nolan has never made a bad movie. I absolutely love ""Inception"" (it remains one of my all-time favorite movies), but even those Nolan films that are not in my top list are still arguably excellent. So, when I first learned that he was working on a massive biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer, I was already sold and looked forward to its eventual release. But it was also the subject matter that captured my interest. I have been somewhat obsessed with the history of nuclear weapons and energy since I was a kid. Not only have I been fascinated with the atrocities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki perpetuated by the United States at the dusk of World War II, but I have also been enthralled by nuclear accidents and disasters such as the 1979 incident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and the 1986 horrors of the meltdown at the Chernobyl power plant in Ukraine, which was then part of the Soviet Union. I have watched documentaries about these incidents, read books like Midnight in Chernobyl: The Untold Story of the World’s Greatest Nuclear Disaster by Adam Higginbotham, and was so captivated by the HBO limited television series ""Chernobyl"" that I watched the whole thing twice.
'Oppenheimer' forces viewers to remember this is real, this is now, the threat is not to be taken lightly, minimized or dismissed. Tweet this
The Venn diagram of overlapping appeal between director and subject matter was a perfectly aligned circle in my case. And the film lived up to, if not exceeded, my expectations. There is so much to appreciate about the movie. Obviously, the director, cast (especially Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr., among others), Nolan's adaptation of the Pulitzer-Prize-winning biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, cinematography, sound engineering and nearly everything about the production of the movie are extraordinary. I expect many award nominations and wins for ""Oppenheimer"" ahead. But the biggest star and most important character of the film was none of these people. From my perspective, it wasn't even the namesake of the movie (with all due respect to Dr. Oppenheimer). The most important star was the atomic bomb itself. In an interview with The New York Times, Nolan described Oppenheimer as ""the most important person who ever lived."" His reasoning was that it was under Oppenheimer's direction at the Los Alamos laboratories in New Mexico that the first nuclear weapon was created and successfully tested. It was under Oppenheimer's supervision that the ability for humanity to destroy not just itself, but perhaps also the entire world, was created. Oppenheimer is indeed a fascinating historical figure and what he helped create with the assistance of thousands of other scientists and engineers is nothing short of awesome (in the literal sense). But Oppenheimer the man is nowhere near as interesting, frightening and cosmically significant as the original weapon of mass destruction he is credited with unleashing on the world. What I believe this film does so well is tell two intersecting origin stories.
A scene from ""Oppenheimer,"" which opened July 21. (Courtesy of Universal Pictures)
The first is about the ostensible protagonist, an American theoretical physicist who was recruited by the government to oversee a gamble of a research project to harness nuclear energy to destroy whole cities at a time of world war. The second is an origin story about the real protagonist, the nuclear bomb, which continues to live on and haunt the entirety of creation even at this very moment. Even as I marveled at the sheer beauty of the acting, writing and cinematography, I never forgot about the horrors that were to follow and the counterfactual thought that such horrors might never have occurred if this bomb had not been made. While impossible to fully convey the magnitude of what was unfolding in the laboratories of Berkeley and Chicago or in the conference rooms and research facilities in New Mexico — because even those involved in inventing nuclear weapons weren't sure themselves of what would happen when someone eventually pushed the trigger — Nolan does a good job reminding the viewers with the power of hindsight that something terrifying did happen and it continues to threaten us today. It is easy to be merely entertained by this cinematic accomplishment, but the true star of the film beckons us to remember that this is more an etiological narrative, an origin story about great fear and destruction wrought by this horrific invention. There were discomfiting times throughout the film when I found myself realizing once again that this was not some scary work of fiction, but a dramatization of an even more frightening reality. By compellingly recounting the beginnings of the nuclear era, Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" forces viewers to remember this is real, this is now, the threat is not to be taken lightly, minimized or dismissed.

2023-07-18 15:54:52+00:00,"In ‘Barbie’ vs. ‘Oppenheimer,’ the Real Winner May Be the Box Office","The toy-based comedy is expected to draw $100 million; the biopic half that. But in an uneven year for movies, the duel seems to be engaging audiences.","It’s a matchup for the ages, up there with Ali vs. Frazier, the Hatfields vs. the McCoys and Athens vs. Sparta.
Well, let’s not get carried away.
But it is fair to say that with “Barbie” vs. “Oppenheimer,” Hollywood has not captured the popular imagination in this way for quite some time. On Thursday night, the two wildly incongruous Hollywood megamovies arrive in theaters after weeks of internet meme-ification and questionable marketing tie-ins. (We’re looking at you, Barbie-inspired Burger King sandwich topped with what looks like chewed bubble gum.) Together, the movies could generate the biggest crowds at North American multiplexes in four years, numbers not seen since before the pandemic, box office prognosticators said.
“‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ are basically the perfect frenemies at the box office this weekend,” said Dave Karger, the Turner Classic Movies host. “Yes, they’re technically competitors, but they’re largely going after different audiences, and the Barbenheimer hype seems only to be helping both films.”
Greta Gerwig’s candy-coated “Barbie,” which cost an estimated $145 million to make, not including marketing costs, has the potential to earn $100 million in the United States and Canada through Sunday, according to analysts who track audience interest and use complex formulas to forecast box office performance. Christopher Nolan’s weighty “Oppenheimer,” which cost at least $100 million before marketing, is looking at around $50 million in domestic ticket sales over the same period.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTgvbW92aWVzL2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-19 14:33:19.672000+00:00,‘Barbenheimer’: How to watch the ‘Oppenheimer’ and ‘Barbie’ double feature,"Here’s the quintessential way to do a “Barbenheimer” double feature, from getting enough popcorn to last through all of “Oppenheimer” to saving “Barbie” for last.","CNN —
This weekend, the movies belong to dolls and doom.
It’s the cinematic event of the summer: Greta Gerwig’s splashy pink romp “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “emotionally devastating” three-hour epic “Oppenheimer” rolled out in theaters this week. Aside from their prestige-y creative teams, the films have little in common, but dedicated cinephiles are devoting a full day of their lives to both. (“Barbie” is being released by Warner Bros., which shares parent company Warner Bros. Discovery with CNN.)
It’s the “Barbenheimer” double feature, and it started its life, as most phenomena do, as a meme. But as more people tweeted fan-made posters of Margot Robbie’s Barbie smiling in front of a mushroom cloud, the idea of a day spent at the movies started to sound like a good idea. (AMC said this week that 40,000 moviegoers already bought tickets to see both films on the same day — double the number it reported last week.)
It’s a gambit that some industry pundits hope could give the movie business a much-needed boost after earlier summer releases saw less-than-stellar box office returns. It’s also, perhaps, a necessity, as the Earth warms to historic highs and people grow restless in the dangerous heat. But leave the musings on death and destruction to the eponymous stars of both films.
Here’s the quintessential way to do a “Barbenheimer” double feature, from selecting showtimes to filling the space between the two films to navigating the wide range of emotions both films will elicit. A hint — definitely leave “Barbie” for last.

Ready to spend six-ish hours at the movies? Know what you’re in for first.
“Oppenheimer” is by all accounts a searing portrayal of a man whose brilliance wrought destruction the likes of which the world had never seen. It’s also over three hours long, so it’ll require some mental and physical endurance on the part of the viewer. It’s rated R, though for nudity and language, not violence.
“Barbie,” ostensibly a comedy, is somewhat more mysterious — the trailers are careful not to give away plot particulars, like how Barbie winds up in the real world and how Ken gets his groove back — but Gerwig and her cast have encouraged a range of reactions, including crying, laughing and crying laughing. It’s also under two hours and PG-13, so expect innuendo!
Bring the goods
Whether this means you bring a pillow and blanket for maximal comfort or order the largest popcorn tub sold by your local theater, arrive at the theater with all you’ll need to enjoy your double feature to the fullest.
Start by choosing the perfect theater. Do you prefer the cineplexes with seats that recline so far back you’re practically horizontal? Or if there’s a local independent theater near you, consider spending your day there to support it.
Snacks are, clearly, a must. Some movie theaters check your bags upon entry to make sure you aren’t sneaking in foods they don’t sell. Others do not. Pack accordingly, and if you’re buying on-site, get there early enough so you don’t miss the previews (and, at AMC, Nicole Kidman’s monologue).
Many theaters are okay with guests bringing blankets or other comfy accessories — this CNN writer has seen several moviegoers take their seats with pillows and Squishmallows in tow. (One shouldn’t worry about falling asleep mid-film — “Oppenheimer’s” sound design certainly won’t permit it, especially if viewers watch it in IMAX as Nolan intended.)
As for clothing — breathable sweatpants are often the way to go when you’ll be sitting for hours at a time. They also conveniently catch loose popcorn and M&Ms throughout your film.
See ‘Oppenheimer’ first

Do yourself a favor and get the more intense experience out of the way first so you don’t go home with the weight of mankind’s fate on your mind. “Barbie” should be lighter viewing, so think of it as saving dessert for after dinner. (Not that “Barbie” can’t also be a satisfying cinematic experience!)
Take it from Tom Cruise, last summer’s box office savior and post-pandemic theatergoing advocate. He says he’s seeing “Oppenheimer” first, on its opening Friday, and then “Barbie” “right after” so he gets to experience both with packed houses.
Time it out

If you prefer to arrive to a movie in the daytime and exit in darkness, schedule a late afternoon viewing of “Oppenheimer” to end with “Barbie” at night. It’s possible, though, if you see an “Oppenheimer” matinee (for which tickets are typically cheaper!), that you can walk out of “Barbie” and into some sunshine if you see Gerwig’s comedy that afternoon, too.
And be sure you give yourself enough space between films to stew on what you’ve seen, eat something and walk a few steps so your body remembers it’s not asleep. (Some Twitter users joked that they’d scheduled a stiff drink between “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie” to shake off the existential dread of the former before the existential exploration of the latter.)
Perhaps your local theater has an arcade or a bar — like AMC’s MacGuffins Bar, which usually curates its menu with drinks based on the season’s biggest hits. If you’ve got plenty of time between the two, dissect the first film with friends over a meal or, if you’re alone, read up on all the blink-and-you’ll-miss-it appearances from celebs who signed up for a one-line role in Nolan’s epic.
Beware of the bathroom break

Hydration is key — except when you’re sitting through a three-hour epic. Neither “Barbie” nor “Oppenheimer” seem like they’ll be boring, so ahead of both films, use the restroom. This is particularly important ahead of “Oppenheimer,” lest Nolan finds out that you left his film to pee. The man takes movies seriously.
Use it again between “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie.” Gerwig’s film is also the more ICEE-friendly film, so re-up on snacks and such in between.
Make it a double-feature summer
Your double feature doesn’t have to be “Barbenheimer,” either. There are plenty of films to pair this summer: If you’re into cliffhangers, “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” ends on a juicy one, so it might go nicely with “Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One.” Women-led, R-rated sex comedies “No Hard Feelings” and “Joy Ride” would make for a raunchy duo. You could probably even make an argument to pair Disney’s “The Haunted Mansion” remake with Wes Anderson’s meditative “Asteroid City,” somehow. Nothing goes better with prestige than pure popcorn fare.
Sample ‘Barbenheimer’ itinerary
Wake up and ready your double-feature supplies (recommended: chocolate, roomy sweatshirt, your fuzziest socks).
10:50 a.m.: Arrive 10 minutes early for “Oppenheimer,” get an extra-large popcorn and prepare for cinematic annihilation.
2:30 p.m.: Stew on “Oppenheimer,” swoon over Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh, look into trips to New Mexico. Grab lunch and consider the fate of the world.
4 p.m.: See “Barbie,” preferably wearing something pink. Take the Ken in your life.
6:15 p.m.: Exit the theater embracing your newfound Kenergy. Maybe go dancing!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8xOS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJhcmJpZS1kb3VibGUtZmVhdHVyZS1iYXJiZW5oZWltZXItY2VjL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 18:37:19+00:00,The True Story of J. Robert Oppenheimer's Life,What to know about how the true story of Oppenheimer's life compares to writer-director Christopher Nolan's new movie.,"After months of building anticipation, writer-director Christopher Nolan’s new movie Oppenheimer arrived in theaters Friday, kickstarting an opening weekend where it’s expected to collect around $50 million at the domestic box office.
The three-hour (and nine second) biopic centers, as its title suggests, on J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), the theoretical physicist widely known as the “father of the atomic bomb” who infamously summed up his life’s work in a 1965 NBC News documentary by reciting a line from the sacred Hindu text the Bhagavad Gita: “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.”

Based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2006 biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer—currently no. 1 on Amazon’s bestseller chart, thanks to the film—the movie jumps back and forth through time as it explores the life and legacy of its subject. “What I wanted to do was take the audience into the mind and the experience of a person who sat at the absolute center of the largest shift in history,” Nolan said in the film’s production notes. “Like it or not, J. Robert Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. He made the world we live in, for better or for worse.”
Here’s what to know about how the true story of Oppenheimer’s life compares to the movie.

Oppenheimer’s early life
Oppenheimer’s childhood doesn’t play out on screen in the movie, but his upbringing contributed to views he espouses throughout the film. He was born in 1904 into a wealthy secular Jewish family in New York City and educated at Manhattan’s Ethical Culture School, graduating in 1921. Although his parents were first- and second-generation Americans of German-Jewish descent, Oppenheimer refrained from embracing his heritage for much of his life.
“To the outside world, he was always known as a German Jew, and he always insisted that he was neither German nor Jewish,” Ray Monk, the author of Robert Oppenheimer: A Life Inside the Center, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. “But it affected his relationship with the world that that is how he was perceived.”
Antisemitism impacted him throughout his time studying at Harvard, and later, amid the Nazis’ rise to power in Germany, changed the way he engaged with his Jewishness.
“I had a continuing, smoldering fury about the treatment of Jews in Germany,” he said at his 1954 hearing before the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which is part of the movie’s central framing device. “I had relatives there, and was later to help in extricating them and bringing them to this country.”
Years in Europe
After graduating summa cum laude from Harvard in 1925, Oppenheimer traveled to England, as the film depicts, to conduct research at the University of Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory under British physicist and 1906 Nobel Prize winner J. J. Thomson. There, he struggled with mental health issues and ended up on probation.
American Prometheus reports that, during this time, Oppenheimer relayed a story to friends about lacing an apple with chemicals and leaving it on the desk of his tutor, Patrick Blackett (played by James D’Arcy). The book cites Oppenheimer’s friend Jeffries Wyman as suggesting that Oppenheimer might have exaggerated the incident somehow: “Whether or not this was an imaginary apple, or a real apple, whatever it was, it was an act of jealousy.”
The way the film depicts this alleged event, Oppenheimer snatches the apple out of the hand of his idol Niels Bohr (played by Kenneth Branagh) before the legendary physicist can take a bite.

Oppenheimer ultimately transferred to the University of Göttingen in Germany, where he earned his Ph.D in quantum physics. During his time in Germany, he studied with a number of prominent physicists, including Max Born and Bohr. Oppenheimer attended Göttingen alongside Werner Heisenberg (played by Matthias Schweighöfer), who would go on to lead the German effort to develop an atomic bomb.
Ties to the Communist Party
In 1929, after returning to America, Oppenheimer accepted an assistant professorship at the University of California, Berkeley, in a special arrangement that also saw him teaching at the California Institute of Technology. Over the next 14 years, he established Berkeley as one of the greatest schools of theoretical physics in the U.S. and garnered a loyal following of up-and-coming physicists. The film depicts the program’s growth by having just one student show up to his first class, then showing the classroom bursting at the seams within a short time as word of his class spreads among students. He also worked alongside, and became good friends with, leading experimental physicist Ernest O. Lawrence (played by Josh Hartnett), who would later help involve him in the Manhattan Project.

After entering into a tumultuous relationship with Stanford Medical School student and Communist Party member Jean Tatlock (played by Florence Pugh) in 1936—when she was 22 and he was 32—Oppenheimer began taking an interest in left-wing political causes, from supporting anti-fascists during the Spanish Civil War to unionizing academics. While Oppenheimer never officially joined the Communist Party, many of his closest friends and family members, including his brother Frank Oppenheimer (Dylan Arnold), friend Haakon Chevalier (Jefferson Hall), and future wife Katharine “Kitty” Puening (Emily Blunt), were members at various points in time.
The movie shows how the U.S. government was aware and skeptical of Oppenheimer’s communist affiliations early on, but chose to overlook them during the Manhattan Project when it became clear he was the right man for the job. However, these associations would ultimately come back to haunt him and lead to the destruction of his career at the height of American anti-Communist hysteria in the 1950s.
Romantic relationships
As the movie notes, over the years, Oppenheimer developed a reputation as a womanizer.
While Tatlock broke off their official relationship in 1939, Oppenheimer remained in contact with her and visited her in San Francisco, where she was working as a pediatric psychiatrist at Mount Zion Hospital, as late as 1943. That was several years into his marriage to biologist Kitty Puening.
Nearly seven months after Tatlock and Oppenheimer’s final June 1943 meeting, Tatlock’s father found his 29-year-old daughter dead in her apartment on Jan. 4, 1944. Tatlock had suffered from clinical depression and her death was ruled a suicide. However, some suspected there was foul play involved as Tatlock had been placed under surveillance by the FBI due to her relationship with Oppenheimer and past involvement with communist politics.

Oppenheimer wed the already-pregnant Puening on Nov. 1, 1940, shortly after she divorced her third husband, Richard Stewart Harrison. The Oppenheimers’ first child, Peter, was born in May 1941. Kitty later gave birth to a daughter, Katherine Toni, in December 1944, while living at Los Alamos. The couple remained married until Oppenheimer’s death in 1967—despite his relationship with Tatlock and rumored romantic entanglements with other women, including psychologist Ruth Sherman Tolman (played by Louise Lombard), the wife of his close friend, chemist Richard Tolman (Tom Jenkins).
The movie portrays Kitty as struggling with alcoholism and displaying an ambivalent attitude toward motherhood, having largely given up her scientific career, though she did serve briefly as a lab technician at Los Alamos. But she loyally supports her husband through thick and thin. She remained by his side throughout the 1954 AEC hearing and was one of his steadfast defenders.
The Manhattan Project
In early 1942, Oppenheimer was recruited for the Manhattan Project, the United States government’s secret World War II undertaking to build an atomic bomb. Later that year, General Leslie Groves (played by Matt Damon) appointed Oppenheimer as the scientific director of the program and, in early 1943, construction began on Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico—one of a number of laboratories in secret locations across the country, including Chicago and Oak Ridge, Tenn., involved in the operation. Oppenheimer convinced Groves that Los Alamos should be turned into town where scientists could live with their families, since many might refuse to relocate otherwise.

Oppenheimer assembled a group of the top scientists of the time to live and work at Los Alamos until the bomb had been completed. Less than three years after the laboratory’s founding, the world’s first nuclear weapons test, dubbed the Trinity test, took place in the nearby Jornada del Muerto desert on July 16, 1945. The test was successful in proving that the bomb worked, but it caused decades of immense harm to Indigenous people living in the surrounding area.
Three weeks later, on Aug. 6 and 9, respectively, the United States detonated two atomic bombs over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ending the war. The bombings together killed between an estimated 110,000 to 210,000 people, most of whom were civilians.
Oppenheimer’s post-war life
Following the war, public opinion about the use of the atomic bomb wavered. While visiting the White House in October 1945, as shown in the movie, Oppenheimer told President Harry S. Truman (played by Gary Oldman), “Mr. President, I feel I have blood on my hands.”
However, Oppenheimer was hailed as a national hero by many and, in 1946, was awarded a Medal for Merit. When the Manhattan Project came under the jurisdiction of the newly-formed AEC, the agency charged with overseeing all atomic research and development in the U.S., Oppenheimer was named chairman of the General Advisory Committee. As chairman, he staunchly opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb—a “Super Bomb” conceived by fellow Los Alamos scientist Edward Teller (played by Benny Safdie) that was a thousand times more powerful than the atomic bomb—when Cold War tensions began to rise between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.
In 1947, Oppenheimer had also been appointed director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. by Lewis Strauss (played by Robert Downey Jr.), who would go on to become chairman of the AEC.
The AEC hearing
During his tenure as chairman of the General Advisory Committee, Oppenheimer’s controversial stance on the hydrogen bomb made him a number of political enemies. Strauss, whom Oppenheimer had humiliated at a Congressional hearing about whether or not to ban the sale of radioisotopes, took a particular dislike to the physicist.

In November 1953, William Liscum Borden (played by David Dastmalchian), a close confidant of Strauss and former executive director of Congress’s Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, sent a letter to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover suggesting that “more probably than not J. Robert Oppenheimer is an agent of the Soviet Union.”
The letter was passed on to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Oppenheimer was informed his security clearance had been revoked in a December 1953 meeting with Strauss. Oppenheimer appealed the decision and, on April 12, 1954, a monthlong security hearing began during which Oppenheimer’s previous communist leanings and associations, views on U.S. nuclear policy, and other personal transgressions were used to discredit him in a kangaroo court-style proceeding led by AEC lawyer Roger Robb (played by Jason Clarke).
Later life
The result of the security hearing came to define Oppenheimer for the rest of his life, with Oppenheimer’s close friend and fellow physicist Isidor Isaac Rabi (played by David Krumholtz) later saying that, “[Oppenheimer] was a man of peace and they destroyed him. He was a man of science and they destroyed this man. A small, mean group.”
Oppenheimer stayed on as director of the Institute for Advanced Study until 1966, shortly before dying of throat cancer at his Princeton home on Feb. 18, 1967. Prior to his death he was presented in 1966 with the AEC’s highest honor, the Enrico Fermi Award—the award we see him receiving in a flash forward while talking to Albert Einstein (played by Tom Conti) in the movie’s final scene—by President Lyndon B. Johnson.
In his acceptance speech, Oppenheimer referenced former President Thomas Jefferson’s odes to “the brotherly spirit of science.”
“We have not, I know, always given evidence of that brotherly spirit,” he said. “This is not because we lack vital common or intersecting scientific interests. It is in part because, with countless other men and women, we are engaged in this great enterprise of our time, testing whether men can both preserve and enlarge life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and live without war as the great arbiter of history.”
Correction, Aug. 4
The original version of this story misstated the name of the institute Oppenheimer directed. It is the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., not the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton.

The movie will still be screened, however. The premiere is set to take place on Monday, July 17 at 7pm ET in New York City at the AMC Loews Lincoln Square theater. SAG-AFTRA called a union strike on July 13, with the first day of picketing beginning July 14.
“In support of the ongoing SAG strike, the filmmakers of ‘Oppenheimer’ will not be proceeding with the NY premiere as originally planned, and will instead screen the movie to celebrate the crew and craftspeople who contributed to making this landmark film,” a statement from Universal Pictures read.
The decision to cancel the U.S. premiere’s red carpet comes on the heels of the “Oppenheimer” cast leaving the film’s U.K. premiere early in solidarity with the strike, which at that point had not yet been officially called. The U.K. premiere took place July 13 just hours before SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher officially called for the strike to begin the following day.
“Oppenheimer” cast members such as Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt walked the U.K. red carpet but did not attend the screening of the film. Nolan informed the audience that his actors left the premiere to start making picket signs for the strike. The premiere’s red carpet even got bumped up an hour early so that cast members could walk it and promote the film without interfering with a potential strike.
“We talked about it,” Damon told Variety on the U.K. carpet about leaving the premiere early if need be. “Look, if it’s called now, everyone’s going to walk obviously in solidarity … Once the strike is officially called, [we’re walking]. That’s why we moved this [red carpet] up because we know the second it’s called, we’re going home.”
Damon added: “We gave the strike authorization. We voted 98% to 2% to do that because we know our leadership has our best interest at heart.”
Emily Blunt told Variety: “Obviously we stand with all of the actors and at whatever point it’s called, we’re going to be going home and standing together through it because I want everyone to get a fair deal.”
Although it had not yet been confirmed which cast members were to attend the film’s upcoming U.S. premiere in New York, it was expected Murphy, Blunt and a majority of the ensemble would show up if a strike was not going on. “Oppenheimer” opens in theaters nationwide July 21.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItdXMtcHJlbWllcmUtY2FuY2Vscy1yZWQtY2FycGV0LXNhZy1zdHJpa2UtMTIzNTY3MDcwNy_SAWhodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9uZXdzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXVzLXByZW1pZXJlLWNhbmNlbHMtcmVkLWNhcnBldC1zYWctc3RyaWtlLTEyMzU2NzA3MDcvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Seven days after Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” conspired to set box office records, the two films held unusually strongly in theaters. “Barbie” took in a massive $93 million in its second weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.
“Barbie,” the pink-infused pop sensation, has seen remarkably sustained business following its year-best $162 million opening. Its ticket sales dipped only 43%.
“Barbie” has also outpaced Nolan’s “The Dark Knight” to notch the best first two weeks in theaters of any Warner Bros. release. It has rapidly accumulated $351.4 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters, a rate that will soon make it the biggest box office hit of the summer. Every day it’s played, “Barbie” has made at least $20 million.
“Oppenheimer,” from Universal Pictures, again landed in second place with an estimated $46.2 million. It, too, held especially strong in its second weekend, with sales decreasing just 44%. Nolan’s three-hour drama starring Cillian Murphy as atomic bomb physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer has accrued $174.1 million thus far.

With an additional $72.4 million in international cinemas, “Oppenheimer” has already surpassed $400 million globally.
The week’s top new release, Walt Disney Co.’s “Haunted Mansion,” an adaptation of the Disney theme park attraction, was easily overshadowed by the “Barbenheimer” blitz. The film, which cost about $150 million, debuted with $24 million domestically and $9 million in overseas sales.
“Haunted Mansion,” directed by Justin Simien (“Dear White People,” “Bad Hair”) and starring an ensemble of LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito and Rosario Dawson, struggled to overcome mediocre reviews.
“Talk to Me,” the A24 supernatural horror film, fared better. It debuted with $10 million. The film, directed by Australian filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou and starring Sophie Wilde, was a midnight premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January and received terrific reviews from critics (95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). It was made for a modest $4.5 million.
While theaters being flush with moviegoers has been a huge boon to a film industry still recovering ground it lost during the pandemic, it’s been tougher sledding for Tom Cruise, the so-called savior of the movies last summer with “Top Gun: Maverick.” “Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part I,” starring Cruise and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, grossed $10.7 million in its third weekend. Its domestic total stands at $139.2 million.
Instead, the sleeper hit “Sound of Freedom” has been the best performing non-“Barbenheimer” release in theaters.

UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif., July 5, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Pictures and Syncopy today announced The Trinity Anniversary Screening event for the new epic thriller from writer-director Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer, on Saturday, July 15, 2023, at The Whitby Hotel in New York City. The screening will begin at 2 p.m. EDT followed by the panel discussion at 5 p.m. EDT, and a post-panel reception.
The event marks the upcoming release of Oppenheimer on July 21, the historic scientific achievements of The Manhattan Project and the anniversary of the Manhattan Project's Trinity Test, which detonated the first atomic bomb on July 16, 1945.
The panel following the screening of the film will be moderated by Emmy winner Chuck Todd, anchor of NBC's Meet the Press, and will feature Oppenheimer writer-director Christopher Nolan, Pulitzer Prize winner Kai Bird, the author of American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, Dr. Thom Mason, Director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the event's honorary chairmen: Nobel Prize winning theoretical physicist Dr. Kip Thorne, who served as a consultant on the film, and world-renowned theoretical physicist Dr. Carlo Rovelli, the New York Times best-selling author of The Order of Time, Seven Brief Lessons on Physics and Anaximander and the Birth of Science. The panel discussion will be followed by a private reception.
In 1943, 80 years ago this year, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer assembled the greatest scientific minds of his era in Los Alamos, New Mexico, to launch the Manhattan Project, a top-secret mission to create the world's first atomic bomb.
On July 16, 1945, 78 years ago, at 5:29 a.m. MDT, the Manhattan Project achieved that goal with the successful detonation of the atomic bomb, known as the Trinity Test, 210 miles south of Los Alamos, New Mexico, on the plains of the Alamogordo Bombing Range.
When Universal Pictures released the first teaser trailer for Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer in July 2022, it also launched the official Oppenheimer film site, which features a countdown clock, set to reach zero on the anniversary of the Trinity Test.
Now, just as J. Robert Oppenheimer assembled the greatest scientific minds of his time, this screening event will assemble some of the greatest scientific minds of our time. Among the screening's invited guests will be some of the most acclaimed and revered scientific minds of the 21st century, including those from some of American's most prestigious universities.
Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, Golden Globe winner Emily Blunt, Oscar® winner Matt Damon, Oscar® nominee Robert Downey, Jr., Academy Award® nominee Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Oscar® winner Casey Affleck, Oscar® winner Rami Malek and Oscar® winning filmmaker and actor Kenneth Branagh.
Christopher Nolan's films, including Tenet, Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception and The Dark Knight trilogy, have earned more than $5 billion at the global box office and have been awarded 11 Oscars and 36 nominations, including two Best Picture nominations.

In anticipation of its release, the main cast spoke to ABC Audio ahead of the SAG-AFTRA strike about the three-hour epic.
Cillian Murphy is no stranger to working with Nolan -- though this was his first time taking on a leading role in one of his films.
That role is J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb.

""Chris calls me up, and whatever he asks me to do, I’m there for him. That’s how much I love his work and that’s how much respect I have for him,"" Murphy said.
""We’ve done six movies now, but I did not expect this one to be the lead. So, it was a great — a very pleasant shock,"" he continued.
And while the film follows true events, Murphy says Oppenheimer is ""not your conventional biopic.""

""It does make you think,"" he said. ""And people can choose to think about the nuclear age that we live in, or they could choose not to. And I think this film might affect that choice.""
His co-stars Matt Damon and Emily Blunt wholeheartedly agree on the film’s importance.
""It is the biggest story, I think, of the last hundred years, if not in the history of humanity, right?"" said Damon, who plays Leslie Groves, a lieutenant general who served as director of the Manhattan Project, in the film.

2023-08-01 13:33:09+00:00,Warner Bros. Apologizes For ‘Insensitive’ Barbenheimer Memes After Criticism From Japanese Studio Sector,Warner Bros. has apologized to its Japan sector for insensitively engaging with Barbenheimer memes.,"The cultural phenomenon of Barbenheimer, the double-viewing fiasco of Warner Bros.‘ Barbie and Universal’s Oppenheimer, has lined the pockets of both studios while movie-goers dress up to head to their theaters and make the ultimate commitment to the bit. Many brands have also played into the popular social marketing, but the core of the trend is beginning to unravel now that the studios are leaning further into it. Warner Bros. U.S. issued an apology to its Japanese distribution arm for sharing social media content through the official Barbie account that Warner Bros. Japan deemed inconsiderate.
“Warner Brothers regrets its recent insensitive social media engagement. The studio offers a sincere apology,” the company shared in a statement, according to Variety.
In a since-deleted tweet, the Barbie account shared a fan-made poster that showed Barbie (Margot Robbie) sitting on J. Robert Oppenheimer‘s (Cillian Murphy) shoulders while he walked away from a mushroom cloud created by an atomic blast. “It’s going to be a summer to remember,” the caption read. In another, in which Robbie’s hair was styled in the shape of the cloud, the account wrote: “This Ken is a stylist.”
Both films were released on the same day, but while Barbie is a bright, slightly existential film about self-worth, Oppenheimer follows its titular character through a moral dilemma surrounding his creation of two atomic bombs that killed nearly a quarter of a million people when the U.S. dropped them on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. It was the first time in human history that a weapon of that kind was used. Trending Hunter Biden Offers to Testify Publicly. House Republicans ...

“We consider it extremely regrettable that the official account of the American headquarters for the movie ‘Barbie’ reacted to the social media postings of ‘Barbenheimer’ fans,” Warner Bros. Japan shared in a statement published on the Barbie Japan Twitter account, which prompted the apology. “We take this situation very seriously. We are asking the U.S. headquarters to take appropriate action. We apologize to those who were offended by this series of inconsiderate reactions. Warner Bros Japan.”

,Hindu verse in Oppenheimer sex scene angers India right-wing,A sex scene from the film in which the protagonist quotes from the Bhagavad Gita has sparked an uproar online.,"A sex scene in the Hollywood movie Oppenheimer featuring a line from a Hindu holy scripture has sparked online outrage in India, with one official calling it a “scathing attack”.
The biographical drama about US physicist Robert Oppenheimer, played by actor Cillian Murphy, opened in India on Friday to positive reviews, reportedly raking in more than $3m at the box office there in two days.
The film tells the story of Oppenheimer, who is often credited as the “father of the atomic bomb” for his role in producing the first nuclear weapons.
Religious text quoted in sex scene
One scene showing Oppenheimer with his lover Jean Tatlock, played by Florence Pugh, has sparked outrage online.
The scene features the protagonist reciting a verse from the Bhagavad Gita, considered the holiest of Hindu scripture, just before sexual intercourse.
Murphy reads the line, “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”, the quote which Oppenheimer reportedly recalled when the first nuclear bomb was detonated.
In various interviews, Oppenheimer, who died in 1967, spoke of his interest in the religion. He had also learned Sanskrit, the sacred language of Hinduism.
‘Assault on religious beliefs’: Official
“This is a direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus,” Uday Mahurkar, a senior official at the government’s Central Information Commission, wrote to the film’s director, Christopher Nolan, on Monday.
“It amounts to waging a war on the Hindu community,” Mahurkar said in the letter, a copy of which he posted on Twitter, and urged Nolan to cut the scene.
Hashtags such as #BoycottOppenheimer and #RespectHinduCulture have been trending on Twitter.
Harris Sultan, an author, said Hindus were “left angry and perplexed at the blatant disrespect”.
Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a prominent right-wing Hindu organisation, said the movie was an attempt to “launch an attack” on Hindu society and demanded the scene be cut.
“The makers should apologise to the Hindu community all over the world whose sentiments have been badly hurt,” spokesman Vinod Bansal told the news agency AFP.
Hindus are the majority in India but minorities, including Muslims, form a significant part of the population.
Critics say religious intolerance has been growing in the world’s most populous country since the Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzcvMjQvaGluZHUtdmVyc2UtaW4tb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc2V4LXNjZW5lLXNwYXJrcy1vdXRyYWdlLWluLWluZGlh0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWxqYXplZXJhLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzcvMjQvaGluZHUtdmVyc2UtaW4tb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc2V4LXNjZW5lLXNwYXJrcy1vdXRyYWdlLWluLWluZGlh?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-24 14:28:33+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’: Robert Downey Jr. Says Cillian Murphy Made the Greatest ‘Sacrifice by a Lead Actor’ He’s Ever Seen in His 53-Year Career,"Robert Downey Jr. has raves for his ""Oppenheimer"" co-star.","Cillian Murphy is earning some of the best reviews of his career for leading Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer, but no praise might be higher than this rave from co-star Robert Downey Jr.: “I have never witnessed a greater sacrifice by a lead actor in my career,” the “Iron Man” star told People magazine about Murphy’s performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer.
“He knew it was going to be a behemoth ask when Chris called him,” Downey Jr. added. “But I think he also had the humility that is required to survive playing a role like this. We’d be like, ‘Hey, we got a three-day weekend. Maybe we’ll go antiquing in Santa Fe. What are you going to do?’ ‘Oh, I have to learn 30,000 words of Dutch. Have a nice time.’ But that’s the nature of the ask.”
“Oppenheimer” shot for 57 days, one of Nolan’s quickest film shoots, and Murphy is front and center in nearly every scene. The cast and crew lived together in the same hotel during the film’s production, but Murphy never joined his fellow ensemble for dinner due to the intensity of playing the lead role.
“Of course he didn’t want to come and have dinner with us,” Matt Damon previously told People magazine. “He couldn’t. His brain was just too full.”
Emily Blunt reasoned that Murphy did not attend cast dinners because “the sheer volume of what he had to take on and shoulder is so monumental.”
For Murphy, “Oppenheimer” marks the biggest leading role of his film career thus far. That kind of pressure isolated the actor. “You know that when you have those big roles, that responsibility, you feel it’s kind of overwhelming,” he told People.
Murphy also lost weight for the role, although he has not disclosed how much. The actor stars in the film as theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who was tasked with leading the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico in the effort to create the atomic bomb. Downey Jr. stars as Lewis Strauss, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission who later persecuted Oppenheimer for being a Soviet spy.
“Chris had one of the most incredible leads in Cillian,” Florence Pugh added to People. “He is an actor that I have been watching for quite some time and have been desperate to work with for ages. You’d have to be mad to say no. It was truly one of the best experiences that I’ve had.”
“Working with him was hugely impressive,” she added. “Every single day he shows up knowing every single possible way, intonation, inflection of how to bring this character to life. That was hugely impressive to me. There’s a reason why he is one of the greats.”
“Oppenheimer” is now playing in theaters nationwide from Universal Pictures.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3Mvcm9iZXJ0LWRvd25leS1qci1wcmFpc2VzLWNpbGxpYW4tbXVycGh5LW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWdyZWF0ZXN0LXNhY3JpZmljZS0xMjM1Njc4MzA2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

IMAX Corporation had an explosive weekend, one of their biggest ever at the global box office. On the strength of Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, which delivered a $35M debut on 740 IMAX screens worldwide. The figure represented IMAX’s biggest share ever of a film’s global opening weekend box office, with 20% of total receipts.
Shot with IMAX film cameras, Universal Pictures’ Oppenheimer set several IMAX records at launch, including the biggest July opening IMAX weekend ever, the biggest domestic and global IMAX opening weekend of 2023, and the biggest domestic and global IMAX opening weekend ever for a Christopher Nolan film.
In North America, Oppenheimer opened to $21.1M— an IMAX-record 26.2% of the domestic box office from 411 screens. The figure marked a $51,000 per screen average for the film at IMAX locations in the United States and Canada. Internationally, Oppenheimer opened to $13.9M— 14.8% of the box office on 329 screens. Several markets have yet to open the film, including China, South Korea, Italy, and Greece. Oppenheimer scored the biggest IMAX opening weekend ever in a diverse collection of markets including Mexico, India, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Czech Republic. Thirty-four international markets overall posted a top-five all-time IMAX opening weekend with the film.
Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer was shot in IMAX 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography including, for the first time, portions in IMAX black and white analogue photography. Oppenheimer will continue its three-week window run across the global IMAX network, both domestically and internationally.
“Oppenheimer is an undeniable demonstration of a paradigm shift in moviegoing, with IMAX taking a commanding share of global box office as audiences show a clear preference for experiences that transcend the ordinary in cinema,” said Rich Gelfond, the chief executive officer of IMAX. “As he has done throughout his career, Christopher Nolan pushed the boundaries of IMAX technology to deliver unforgettable storytelling with Oppenheimer and audiences are responding in numbers we’ve not seen in our 50-year history. Given the strength of our pre-sales, the ‘A’ CinemaScore, and the historical multiples of Christopher Nolan’s films, we believe this is just the beginning of what Oppenheimer can accomplish at the global box office. Around the world, we’ve seen sellouts at 4:00 a.m. shows and people traveling hours across borders to see Oppenheimer in IMAX 70mm — this is a phenomenon beyond compare in IMAX and we’re just getting started.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJveG9mZmljZXByby5jb20vb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc2V0cy1tdWx0aXBsZS1pbWF4LXJlY29yZHMtd2l0aC0zNW0tZGVidXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-15 00:10:00+02:00,"The story behind Barbenheimer, the summer’s most online movie showdown","The consensus is “Barbenheimer” is good for everyone — the movies, the theaters and the business","The very online showdown between Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer all started with a date: July 21.
It’s not uncommon for studios to counterprogram films in different genres on a big weekend, but the stark differences between an intense, serious-minded picture about the man who oversaw the development of the atomic bomb and a lighthearted, candy-colored anthropomorphizing of a childhood doll quickly became the stuff of viral fodder.
There’s even some disagreement over whether it’s “Barbieheimer” or “Barbenheimer” or “Boppenheimer” or yet another tortured portmanteau — a phenomenon on which the AP Stylebook has yet to offer guidance, but for the purposes of this article will be “Barbenheimer.”
It didn’t hurt that both Nolan and Gerwig have very passionate and very online fandoms eager to join in. Never mind that many of those fans overlap — the memes, allegiances, and T-shirts were just too fun.
Both movies often trend on social media when the other releases a new asset — a trailer, a picture, an interview. On one level, it’s a marketing department’s dream. Awareness could not be higher, the conversation couldn’t be louder, and neither film even has official reviews out yet.
“‘Barbenheimer’ is a marketing gift borne out of social media and I think it’s benefiting both films,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for analytics firm Comscore. “You’re certainly aware of both movies in a more profound and compelling way than I think might have otherwise happened had they been released on different weekends.”
AMC Theaters reported that 20,000 of its AMC Stubs members had purchased tickets for a double feature. If you’re counting, that’s 294 minutes of moviewatching. Even Margot Robbie — Barbie herself — and Tom Cruise, the star of another summer blockbuster, have started plotting the ideal Barbenheimer day.
“It’s a perfect double bill,” said Robbie at her movie’s London premiere Wednesday. “I think actually start your day with Barbie, then go straight into Oppenheimer and then a Barbie chaser.”
Cruise — whose Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One opened a little over a week before the Barbenheimer showdown — said at his premiere he’d plan to see both on their opening day, likely starting with Oppenheimer, which seems to be the internet’s preferred viewing order as well.
Barbie actor Issa Rae thinks there’s a reason for that.
“I think that there’s a very specific order that if you see them in. If you see Oppenheimer last then you might be a bit of a psychopath,” she diagnosed at the London premiere.
The showdown has made armchair marketing experts out of everyone, quick to scrutinize every move by Warner Bros. and Universal — as though it’s possible to compare two extraordinarily different campaigns.
One has infinite opportunities for very pink, sparkly photo opportunities, whimsical brand partnerships for seemingly everything from underwear to pool floats, large-scale fan events with autograph signings and pop stars like Billie Eilish posting about the soundtrack. In other words, the Barbie campaign can go nuclear.
Oppenheimer has the bomb, the alluring mystery and the big screen hook, but it’s not the kind of movie that lends itself to, say, a frozen yogurt collaboration.
Is the competition real, though, or just a meme? Some in Hollywood wondered if Warner Bros. plopped Barbie on the weekend as a slight to Nolan, who had opened many films for the studio in that corridor including Inception and Dunkirk. He left Warner Bros. amid its controversial decision to send a year’s worth of movies to streaming and made Oppenheimer with Universal instead. But a pointed box office war doesn’t exactly make sense for a studio that has talked recently about wanting to lure Nolan back.
There is an unspoken code of conduct: Never badmouth another studio’s film, publicly at least. This is partly decorum, especially when it comes to “box office showdowns” which all will say are a creation of the press and sideline spectators. But it’s also rooted in some truth: The conventional thinking is that having eyes on one movie is good for other movies — you see their posters and trailers and on some level everyone benefits.
And social media has allowed movie stars to get in on the game, too. Following reports that Cruise was irked the latest Mission: Impossible was going to lose its IMAX screens to Oppenheimer after only a week, Cruise posted photos of himself and director Christopher McQuarrie standing in front of posters for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Barbie and Oppenheimer, holding tickets for each.
“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters. These are just a few that we can’t wait to see on the big screen,” Cruise’s Instagram caption read.
The official accounts for Indiana Jones, Barbie and Oppenheimer responded with supportive notes. Gerwig and Robbie even followed with a similar photo series a few days later, which the official Oppenheimer Instagram account reposted in its stories. Charged with playing Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy told the AP at his movie’s London premiere that “of course” he’d be seeing Barbie. The sporting cross-promotion between four studios — Universal, Warner Bros., Disney and Paramount — is something the film business has not quite seen before.
“Not only is Tom Cruise the biggest box office star in the world, but he’s also an incredible ambassador for the movie theater, for the movie theater experience and boosting other movies,” Dergarabedian said. “And that collegial atmosphere within the framework of what is seen as the very competitive box office derby is kind of a nice thing.”
Still, everyone likes a No. 1 debut, and both Barbie and Oppenheimer reportedly carry $100 million production price tags (not including the millions spent on marketing). As far as box office tracking goes, Barbie has it in the bag with forecasts showing that it could open above $90 million in North America. Oppenheimer meanwhile is tracking in the $40 million range. Then there’s the wild card of Mission: Impossible 7′s second weekend, which could snag second place.
Still even with a second- or third-place start, Oppenheimer could be destined for a long, steady, profitable run into awards season. Adult audiences for R-rated movies are not often the ones who pack theaters the first weekend.
Back in 2008, in the midst of the recession, Warner Bros. and Universal faced off on the same July weekend with another Nolan film that went up against a lighthearted confection: The Dark Knight and Mamma Mia! — both of which went on to be enormously profitable (though Nolan did win the first weekend).
The bigger worry is that what’s been heralded as Hollywood’s post-pandemic comeback summer has had more ups and downs than anyone might have hoped. That’s putting quite a bit of pressure on Barbenheimer to overperform and boost the lagging summer box office, which pales in comparison to the bigger issues facing the industry as actors join the writers on strike.
But with just over a week to go, it’s still a source of amusement. Even Barbie co-star Will Ferrell threw the gauntlet in his winking way at the London premiere.
“I think the world maybe wants to see Barbie a little bit more right now,” Ferrell said. “Just saying!”

You’ll obviously be able to see it at a regular movie theater, and the experience will still be amazing, but if you’re a true movie fan, seeing it in its intended IMAX form is a real treat.
Director Christopher Nolan is showing the movie in IMAX 70-millimeter, and if you consider yourself a movie snob, you already know IMAX 70-millimeter is the crème de la crème. Nothing can beat that experience.
If you still want to see the film in IMAX 70-millimeter, you still have a chance. The films run has been extended due to popular demand.
The problem is that theaters that show IMAX 70-millimeter films are few and far between. There are only 30 movie theaters in the entire world that show films this way, and 19 of those are in the United States. So if you live in a city with one, consider yourself lucky.
For those of us who live in Orlando, we’re going to have to do a little bit of traveling.
One movie theater in Florida is showing Oppenheimer in IMAX 70-millimeter. The AutoNation IMAX, Museum of Discovery & Science in Fort Lauderdale is showing the movie. That means you’ll have to drive over three hours (that’s without traffic) in order to see the movie.
For most, seeing the film in a regular old movie theater, or even in IMAX digital, will totally suffice. I’m right there with them. Seeing the film the way the director intended it to be seen, and on actual film, can be very special for people who really love movies.
Just to give some perspective on how cool it is to see a movie like this in actual film, the IMAX film prints are 11 miles long and weigh 600 pounds! That’s like going down to the site of the Titanic wreckage and back two times!
Given just how epic Nolan’s past movies are, it could be an experience of a lifetime. Plus, it’s only a little bit over three hours. You can make a fun weekend out of it!
In case you don’t know, “Oppenheimer” is a historical thriller about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist who created the first atomic bomb. He’s often known as “the father of the atomic bomb.”
Will you be traveling to Fort Lauderdale to see “Oppenheimer” in IMAX 70-millimeter?

,Christopher Nolan says people are walking out of Oppenheimer ‘devastated’: ‘They can’t speak’,"‘I showed it to a filmmaker recently who said it’s kind of a horror movie,’ director says of his new movie","Christopher Nolan has described the visceral reactions of some people who have seen his latest film, Oppenheimer.
The biographical movie stars Cillian Murphy as the eponymous J Robert Oppenheimer, known as the “father of the atomic bomb”, and is due to be released on 21 July.
“Some people leave the movie absolutely devastated,” Nolan said about early screenings in a new interview with Wired magazine.
“They can’t speak. I mean, there’s an element of fear that’s there in the history and there in the underpinnings. But the love of the characters, the love of the relationships, is as strong as I’ve ever done.”
The 52-year-old British-American director added: “It is an intense experience because it’s an intense story. I showed it to a filmmaker recently who said it’s kind of a horror movie. I don’t disagree.”
Nolan even admitted that he was “relieved to be finished” with the project due to the emotional toll it took.
“As I started to finish the film, I started to feel this colour that’s not in my other films, just darkness. It’s there. The film fights against that,” he said.

Earlier this week, the historian who wrote the 2005 biography on which Oppenheimer is based said he was still “emotionally recovering” from watching the film.
The biographer, Kai Bird, who co-authored American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, said: “I think it is going to be a stunning artistic achievement, and I have hopes it will actually stimulate a national, even global conversation about the issues that Oppenheimer was desperate to speak out about – about how to live in the atomic age, how to live with the bomb and about McCarthyism – what it means to be a patriot, and what is the role for a scientist in a society drenched with technology and science, to speak out about public issues.”
Oppenheimer will be led by Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robery Downey Jr and Florence Pugh.
The film’s cast also includes Matthew Modine, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, Dane DeHaan, Benny Safdie, David Krumholtz, Jack Quaid, and Alden Ehrenreich.
Its release date on 21 July marks the same day as Greta Gerwig’s Barbie release, which stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYXUubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tc2F5cy1wZW9wbGUtd2Fsa2luZy0wMDI3NDQ1NTAuaHRtbNIBVmh0dHBzOi8vYXUubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC9jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1zYXlzLXBlb3BsZS13YWxraW5nLTAwMjc0NDU1MC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-09 21:01:29+05:30,Book to film: On Oppenheimer and American Prometheus,A look at how Christopher Nolan’s film builds on Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s scholarly biography of the famed physicist,"A mysterious rumble grows insistently rhythmic every now and again in Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer. Mysterious because we can hear the sound, but we don’t know where it is coming from. Is it a steam locomotive starting up and shaking the earth violently beneath? Or soldiers marching off to war perhaps? Neither, as it turns out. The source of the auditory motif is revealed two hours into the three-hour film about the eponymous theoretical physicist who was given the undesirable but not undeserving moniker, “the father of the atomic bomb.”

If we don’t see the carnage in Hiroshima, it’s because obviously Oppenheimer wasn’t there. All he can do is imagine the aftermath based on what he knows and what he has seen. Guilt distorts his perception as he recasts the Trinity experience with the crowd, picturing them being blinded by the light and stunned into silence. Cheers turn into screams. A young woman’s face peels off. A charred body is crushed underfoot. The entire crowd vaporises, leaving behind a cloud of radioactive dust. As Oppenheimer is overcome with these visions of horror, the oppressive rumble starts to prick his conscience. Smiling on the surface while dreading inwardly, he is a man at war with himself. Positioning him in the centre of the frame gives the scene a heightened sense of urgency, as the catastrophic capacity of his creation becomes forbiddingly clear for the first time. The nightmare sequence is heavy with regret of a man opening his eyes to what his triumph means for mankind.

Quantum mechanics suggests matter can behave like a wave at one moment, and like a particle at another. In the same schizophrenic spirit, Oppenheimer emerges with all his paradoxes intact: A scientist who developed a weapon of mass destruction to save lives and then campaigned against using it; a patriot heralded as an American hero and a traitor accused of being a Soviet spy; a physicist well-versed in theories but practically inept in the lab; a man whose politics too were chiefly theoretical yet found himself investigated for strong Communist sympathies; a student of science at Harvard, Cambridge and Göttingen who enjoyed reading the Bhagavad Gita, The Brothers Karamazov and The Waste Land.
In American Prometheus, Bird and Sherwin recount an instance of fellow theoretical physicist Paul Dirac being amazed by Oppenheimer’s ability to write poetry as well as study physics. “In physics, we try to tell people in such a way that they understand something that nobody knew before. In the case of poetry, it’s the exact opposite,” Dirac said. “How can you do both?” Nolan attempts to do no less. Oppenheimer, like Interstellar, is a work of intellectual curiosity aspiring for poetic transcendence. Throughout his career, the British director has been fascinated by temporal shifts and quantum mechanics while remaining a firm believer in the transportive power of old-fashioned film stock.
“Bird and Sherwin do offer further insight into how an understanding of Hindu scripture informed the physicist’s dharmic sense of morality and duty. As they put it, “The Gita seemed to provide precisely the right philosophy for an intellectual keenly attuned to the affairs of men and the pleasures of the senses.” (Westock Productions/Shutterstock)

The threat of Nazi Germany developing the A-bomb first was sufficient moral justification for Oppenheimer to spearhead the Manhattan project. The threat of Japan, which was “essentially defeated”, did not warrant the use of an A-bomb, much less two. The book reveals the bomb was dropped on Japan to force unconditional surrender and not share the victory with the Soviet Union, thereby establishing American supremacy. Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) says something to the same effect in the film, “We intend to demonstrate it in the most unambiguous terms. Twice. Once to show the weapon’s power, and a second to show that we can keep doing this until they surrender.” In a subsequent discussion on which Japanese city the US should drop the bomb, the Secretary of War Henry Stimson (James Remar) orders Kyoto be stricken off the list due to its cultural importance. Then, he makes an off-hand comment about spending his honeymoon there. This scene doesn’t appear in the book, but Nolan builds on a historical detail (Kyoto was in fact Stimson’s honeymoon destination even if that may not have been a reason for crossing the city off the list) to illustrate the arbitrary nature of the reasons and decisions that ushered in the nuclear age.
Where the book fares better than the film is in showing how subatomic physics evolved from theoretical conjecture to practical application, from a weapon to save the world to a weapon of apocalyptic one-upmanship. At the same time, it also traces the evolution of communism from an idea associated with the labour movement to America’s mortal enemy crystallising dogmatic hatred and nothing less. As the Red Scare created a climate of fear and panic across the US, the loyalty of scientists were called into question, oaths were imposed, and the sharing of scientific information blocked.
Oppenheimer, however, wished to share atomic knowledge with the world to neutralise the threat it posed. At the same time, he opposed the development of the much more lethal hydrogen bomb in response to the Soviet Union’s first A-bomb test in 1949. This put him in the crosshairs of Strauss, a businessman appointed by Truman to chair the AEC, and Teller, an unwavering nuclear apologist in favour of developing the H-bomb. Not to mention Truman, who had no desire to allow the Soviet Union to catch up in the arms race. When Oppenheimer called for nuclear non-proliferation because he felt he had blood on his hands, the then-US president dismissed him as “a cry-baby scientist.”

Oppenheimer opens with a bite-sized summary of the Greek myth of Prometheus before it dives into the life of his atomic-age analogue. Prometheus stole fire from the Olympian gods to empower mankind. Zeus, furious, chained him to a rock and sent an eagle to feast on his liver. Since Prometheus was immortal, his flesh would grow back every night, only for the eagle to tear at it again the next day in an endless cycle. Oppenheimer endured a not too different fate: His fiery gift to mankind brought him endless suffering. As a character in the film tells the physicist, “You see beyond the world we live in. There is a price to be paid for that.”

The news broke this week that Greta Gerwig’s Barbie just surpassed Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight as the highest-grossing film at the domestic box office in Warner Bros. history. You likely also know that Gerwig and Nolan have been sharing the spotlight this entire summer, thanks to the simultaneous July 21 release of Barbie and Nolan’s Oppenheimer, his three-hour epic about J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) that has wowed audiences across the globe. While Gerwig’s phenomenal Barbie has been breaking records left-and-right (it took a mere 17 days to reach the billion-dollar benchmark, the fastest of any Warner Bros. film ever, to name just one), Nolan’s Oppenheimer has had a remarkable run in its own right, and now, it’s poised to reach an unusual, yet somehow wonderful, milestone. Oppenheimer is about to become the highest-grossing U.S. movie never to hit the top spot at the box office.
Previously, this unusual achievement belonged to the animated 2016 hit Sing, which was a critical and commercial success that still never managed to be number one at the box office due to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Hidden Figures. Oppenheimer has pulled in more than $270 million in four weeks, with some folks driving across state lines to see it in 70mm IMAX. Sing ultimately ended up with $634.2 million worldwide, a figure that Oppenheimer will pass.
And what about becoming the highest-grossing film worldwide never to hit the top spot? To claim that title, Oppenheimer would have to make more than $902 million to surpass the Chinese hit The Battle at Lake Changjin.
It should probably go without saying that these records are not the reason why Nolan makes his films, but what he does want, what he’s always strived for, is to create the kind of viewing experience that audiences can only get in the theater. What’s more, he’s been the most ardent user and supporter of the IMAX format, and his passion for filmmaking on the grandest possible scale has resonated with audiences all across the United States and the globe. The odd records like “highest-grossing domestic film to never hit the top spot” are surely not Nolan’s bag, but giving as many people as possible the best moviegoing experience he can, is Nolan’s bag.
Oppenheimer is in theaters now.

2023-08-17 10:01:45+00:00,Widening the field of view on ‘Oppenheimer’,A Princeton physicist argues viewers of Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' must broaden their field of view to understand the issues that J. Robert Oppenheimer confronted for the first time in human history.,"J. Robert Oppenheimer (as portrayed by actor Cillian Murphy) climbs the tower to inspect the ""Gadget"" ahead of the Trinity test in a scene from Christopher Nolan's film 'Oppenheimer'. (Image courtesy of Universal Pictures)
Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is a masterly vision of Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s American Prometheus, the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer. However, it is a biopic, not a broad perspective on the technical, strategic, and moral issues that Oppenheimer and other scientists in the Manhattan Project confronted for the first time in human history. It is important for modern observers to widen their field of view beyond Oppenheimer and Los Alamos.
For one, crucial parts of the Manhattan Project took place outside of Los Alamos. Enrico Fermi’s Chicago Pile 1 was the prototype for the plutonium-producing reactors that were located at Hanford, Washington. The uranium enrichment project at Oak Ridge, Tennessee used “Calutrons” that were prototyped by Ernest Lawrence at the University of California, Berkeley. In the film, viewers only saw the progress of these key fissile material production activities through marbles being dropped into glass bowls. They did not get to see the quality of the science and the scale of the effort involved at these facilities. Nor did they see much about the deep concerns expressed by scientists outside of Los Alamos, particularly at the University of Chicago’s Metallurgical Laboratory, about dropping the bomb on Japanese cities.
Opening the field of view a step wider, “downwinders” from the Trinity test were contaminated by fallout. This issue was revisited in a new analysis and compensation for these first victims of the atomic age is included in the version of the National Defense Authorization Act that the US Senate recently passed. There were also radiation exposures at the plutonium production facilities at Hanford, during the mining of the uranium needed for nuclear weapons, and due to the hundreds of subsequent atmospheric weapons tests.
Viewers of Oppenheimer also need to consider a wider view, now flashing forward in time, of the tension between arms racing and arms control—embodied in the movie by the conflict between J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) and Edward Teller (Benny Safdie). This tension continues unresolved to the present day.
It is deeply disturbing that advances in arms control have been spurred not so much by rational thought, but by near catastrophe. If not for sheer luck, the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 could have resulted in thermonuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. After the crisis was over, steps toward arms control followed, starting with the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT) of 1963, then the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty and Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty I (SALT I) of 1973.
A second brink was approached in the early 1980s, when President Reagan’s military build-up and his characterization of the Soviet Union as an “evil empire” deeply frightened the Soviets. At this time of high fear and tension, misperception of the NATO Able Archer military exercise or the incorrect operation of new Soviet surveillance satellites indicating a nuclear attack from the United States—both events happening in 1983—could have resulted in Armageddon on a scale much, much larger than during the Cuban Missile Crisis. This period of war scare was followed by the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) of 1987, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) of 1994, and the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT) of 2003.
And the world is once again standing at the brink.
Beyond the well-known nuclear risks associated with the war in Ukraine, recent nuclear saber-rattling by Russia and Belarus against Poland suggests the possibility of a direct conflict between Russia/Belarus and NATO, both armed with nuclear weapons. Overall, there is no telling whether Russian aggression against territories coveted by Putin will lead, at one extreme, to a calamitous nuclear exchange or, at the other, to an agreement with Russia on steps toward strategic stability, beneficial to both sides.
Oppenheimer also invites widening the field of view backward in time. After the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, starting with Copernicus and Galileo, it seems inevitable that application of the scientific method would eventually lead to the discovery of energy-releasing nuclear interactions capable of supporting a chain reaction. And once discovered, their potential for use in weapons of massive destructive power would very quickly become apparent. Without scientists and leaders of the caliber of J. Robert Oppenheimer, Enrico Fermi, and Ernest Lawrence, it may have taken longer to turn the understanding of the physics of the nucleus into weaponry. But it is hard to see how this would not have happened quickly, given the long and wide history of war between human tribes and, more recently, between so-called “civilized nations.”
Finally, a very broad widening of the field of view. In the summer of 1950 Enrico Fermi was having lunch at Los Alamos with Emil Konopinski, Edward Teller, and Herbert York, all veterans of the Manhattan Project. He asked, “Where is everybody?” By this, Fermi meant that since our galaxy has lasted for billions of years, there were likely many civilizations born many millions of years before ours. So, Fermi was asking, why they had not colonized the whole galaxy and why we have not seen them. There have been differing answers proposed to this question over the years. One possibility, however, is that a civilization that discovers how to release the energy bound up in the nucleus does not have time to master interstellar travel before it destroys itself.
This could well become the fate of our civilization. One time when we reach the brink we may not step back. The human species needs to overcome its tribal nature and find common purpose—if it is to survive.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYnVsbGV0aW4ub3JnLzIwMjMvMDgvd2lkZW5pbmctdGhlLWZpZWxkLW9mLXZpZXctb24tb3BwZW5oZWltZXIv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVidWxsZXRpbi5vcmcvMjAyMy8wOC93aWRlbmluZy10aGUtZmllbGQtb2Ytdmlldy1vbi1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"Oppenheimer effect gifts IMAX best July ever: 'No greater experience,' says CEO Richard Gelfond",IMAX CEO Richard Gelfond reacts to Oppenheimer's success and the impact blockbusters have on the movie industry on 'Barron's Roundtable.',"IMAX CEO Richard Gelfond celebrated the success of Christopher Nolan's biographical thriller ""Oppenheimer"" after delivering the company's best July to date.
""Oppenheimer"" chronicles the U.S. government's top secret creation of the atomic bomb during World War II. Actor Cillian Murphy plays American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer – known as the ""father of the atomic bomb.""
""There was no greater experience than Oppenheimer in IMAX. It's kind of like a cult craziness. So there are people who have flown across countries, 6 a.m. shows sold out. I mean, people really know that the way to see Oppenheimer is an IMAX,"" Gelfond told ""Barron's Roundtable"" on Friday.
""We had budgeted a certain number for IMAX and will probably do somewhere between around three times what our original budget was. People who want to see Oppenheimer know that it's different in IMAX,"" he said.

IMAX is a motion picture film format that comprises high-resolution film cameras, formats, projectors and theaters to offer an immersive film experience for moviegoers.
Gelfond shared with ""FOX Business"" how the IMAX experience is leveraging a cinema revival that Hollywood desperately needs post COVID-19 pandemic and the recent actors and writers strike.
He touted that 2023 has been a ""terrific year"" for IMAX thanks to the back-to-back to-back blockbusters and its network expansion with 84 new theater signings this year. The CEO disclosed that it was almost double what they had for 2022.

Gelfond also noted how the IMAX model is much more flexible and not dependent on new releases.
""Last year we released Top Gun [Maverick] and we did about 45 million, and then we had to play other films and we re-released Top Gun, and we did another 65 million,"" he said.
The IMAX CEO dissected the nuts and bolts of the company's business structure and how they make a profit.
""There are 1,700 IMAX theaters in 90 countries around the world. We license our technology, which includes screen projector, sound system and the whole backend. So we monitor every theater in the world 24 hours a day. The sun never sets on IMAX.""
""What happens is the revenue comes from the studio releasing the film, so in the case of Oppenheimer, it's a certain amount from Universal. It comes from the exhibitors who are our license partners around the world. We get a royalty from them,"" says Gelfond.
""We have a recurring maintenance revenue stream, which is because we maintain the system on a regular basis. A lot of recurring cash flow will get money also from providing the cameras to make movies. We get a fee from doing that. So it's a lot of recurring revenue,"" he added.

,Oppenheimer is playing around the world in every country except Japan,"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer opened in cinemas across the globe this weekend, but the Japanese market is yet to confirm an official release date.","Japanese residents are being forced to wait a little longer to see Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer on the big screen.
An event many are describing as ‘Barbenheimer’ is currently sweeping UK cinemas — with film fanatics seeing Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Oppenheimer in one fell swoop.
The Nolan movie, starring Cillian Murphy, is estimated to open with around $50 million (£43 million) this weekend while its Mattel-based competitor is expected to draw in upwards of $100 million (£86 million).

It’s fair to say that cinephiles across the globe are enjoying their spoils this weekend. Except of course, if they live in Japan.
While Nolan’s 12th feature film hasn’t exactly been banned in the country, it is yet to be given an official release date.

According to a Universal spokesperson, “plans have not been finalised in all markets.”
So while Oppenheimer won’t have a theatrical release in cinemas this weekend, it doesn’t mean that it won’t be arriving on Japanese shores soon.
If you’re unfamiliar, then the highly-anticipated movie follows the life of theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer who helped develop the first-ever nuclear bomb.

His work on the top-secret Manhattan Project eventually led to two atomic bombs being detonated by the United States during the Pacific War in 1945.
When the invention was set off, an estimated 200,000 people in the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were killed - with the subsequent fallout being equally as devastating.
Speaking about his creation with The Independent, Nolan, 52, said that Oppenheimer is ‘an intense story’.
“I showed it to a filmmaker recently who said it’s kind of a horror movie, he continued, “I don’t disagree.”

Many film fans have already experienced Barbenheimer weekend and have taken to social media to discuss the duo of newly-released movies.
One Twitter user offered cinemagoers some advice: ""Having done #Barbenheimer, I can confirm that the order should be Barbie first, then Oppenheimer.
“But give yourself a break in between. Give both movies room to breathe. Have all the emotional fun with Barbie, let it soak in, then see Oppenheimer and sit with the weight of it.”

Another said: “As silly as it is...#Barbenheimer reminds me what I enjoy about the movie sphere again.

,Oppenheimer to feature ‘prolonged full nudity’ by Florence Pugh and Cillian Murphy,Christopher Nolan’s Second World War epic was previously given an ‘R’ rating in the US for ‘sex and nudity’,"Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer will feature “prolonged full nudity” by actors Florence Pugh and Cillian Murphy, a new report has claimed.
Murphy stars as nuclear scientist J Robert Oppenheimer in the film, which is released this month, with a significant subplot involving his relationship with psychiatrist and physician Jean Tatlock, played by Pugh.
Speaking to The Guardian, Murphy said he was under “strict instruction” not to discuss any of the film’s plot specifics, but did disclose details on the film’s chemistry tests between him, Pugh and Emily Blunt, who portrays Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty.
“They put two actors in a room to see if there’s any spark, and have all the producers and director at a table watching,” he recalled. “I don’t know what metric they use, and it seems so outrageously silly, but sometimes you get a chemistry and nobody knows why.”
The report also added that Murphy and Pugh have scenes of “prolonged full nudity” together, and that it makes Oppenheimer one of Nolan’s rare films to include a significant interest in sex and relationships.
Fans theorised that Nolan would venture into this territory in June, when it was revealed that Oppenheimer had received the filmmaker’s first “R” rating in the US since his 2002 film Insomnia.
An R rating is roughly equivalent to a “15” in the UK, although age ratings for any one film vary depending on the discretion of each country’s ratings bodies. A PG-13, meanwhile, is considered more or less equivalent to a “12A” in the UK.
Oppenheimer received its R rating for “some sexuality, nudity, and language”, while in the UK it has received a 15 certificate for “strong language and sex”.
The film remains one of the most hyped blockbusters of this summer, with Nolan last month teasing that it had left early viewers “devastated”.
“They can’t speak. I mean, there’s an element of fear that’s there in the history and there in the underpinnings,” the director said.
As well as Murphy, Pugh and Blunt, Oppenheimer features a large cast that includes Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Rami Malek, Gary Oldman, Dane DeHaan, Josh Hartnett, Kenneth Branagh, Matthew Modine, Casey Affleck, Alden Ehrenreich, and Jason Clarke.

2023-07-21 14:30:00+00:00,We Need to Talk About Those ‘Oppenheimer’ Sex Scenes,"Perhaps the most surprising element of ‘Oppenheimer’ is its sex scenes, the first ones filmed by director Christopher Nolan.","The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry, and two films explore that abiding Robert Burns proverb this week: Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s IMAX-sized three-hour biopic of the “father of the atomic bomb,” and Barbie, a Mattel-sanctioned deconstruction of the patriarchy from the fertile mind of Greta Gerwig. Only one of these summer blockbusters, however, boasts a number of sex scenes, and it isn’t the one starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.
Oppenheimer explores the life and times of renowned theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (embodied by an admirably committed Cillian Murphy) through the twin prisms of his time as de facto leader of the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico, as the U.S. and its team of scientific avengers raced to create the first atomic bomb before the Nazis; and his 1954 security clearance hearings, where Congress sought to paint their erstwhile savior as a commie governed by anti-American hostilities and wanton sexual desire (ugly stereotypes all-too-commonly foisted on American Jews like Oppenheimer). There is also a black-and-white 1959 congressional hearing on the cabinet nomination of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr., never better), chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and a supposed friend of Oppenheimer’s, though the less said about this prolonged deviation the better.
We are treated to glimpses of Oppenheimer’s years teaching in the physics department at UC Berkeley, where he and his students made a number of valuable advances in the realms of quantum chemistry and molecular physics, and nuclear reactions in particular. This is where Oppenheimer, an attractive, slender man with piercing blue eyes, met Jean Tatlock (played by Florence Pugh), a young Stanford Medical School student and Communist Party member who wrote and reported for the Western Worker, a communist newspaper. Tatlock helped fuel Oppenheimer’s — or Oppie, as she would call him — interest in the field of psychology, as well as radical left-wing politics, and their passionate romance would eventually attract the interest of the FBI. Editor’s picks
Early on in Oppenheimer, Professor Oppenheimer is introduced to Tatlock during a Communist Party get-together, and the two immediately click. Cut to a scene of a nude Pugh-as-Tatlock riding Murphy’s Oppie like the end of Dr. Strangelove, only to pause in the action when her eye catches a book on his shelf: the Bhagavad Gita, a Hindu scripture that was a favorite of Oppenheimer’s. She turns to a section and, as she is on top of him, has him read it to her: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds” — a line famously uttered by Oppenheimer about him and his terrifying creation during a 1965 TV broadcast. In lieu of capturing the intensity of Oppenheimer and Tatlock’s affair, it comes off as clumsy and unintentionally funny. Why is Tatlock making Oppenheimer read one of his most famous quotes back to her while fucking him?
Now, it is the first sex scene that Nolan has ever filmed, after all — Oppenheimer is the first Nolan flick to attract an R rating since 2002’s Insomnia due to its sex scenes — so perhaps we should cut him a bit of slack. I mean, who can forget Spielberg’s supercharged sex scene in 2006’s Munich, a baffling mélange of sweat, thrashing, terror, and climax-as-exorcism, set to a religious hymn and intercut with scenes of Israelis being gunned down during the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics by Palestinian militants. Shooting a good sex scene is a gift that can escape even some of our greatest filmmakers. Not everyone can be Nicolas Roeg. And Nolan appears well-aware of this.
“Any time you’re challenging yourself to work in areas you haven’t worked in before, you should be appropriately nervous and appropriately careful and planned and prepared,” Nolan told Insider about filming his first sex scenes.
He added, “When you look at Oppenheimer’s life and you look at his story, that aspect of his life, the aspect of his sexuality, his way with women, the charm that he exuded, it’s an essential part of his story… It felt very important to try to understand their relationship and to really see inside it and understand what made it tick without being coy or allusive about it — but to try to be intimate, to try and be in there with him and fully understand the relationship that was so important to him.” Related

Indeed, Oppenheimer was quite the ladies’ man. In addition to his romance with Tatlock, which is said to have lasted well into his marriage to Kitty (Emily Blunt), the film implies that he’d conducted an affair with Ruth Sherman Tolman (Louise Lombard), the wife of Oppenheimer’s pal Richard Tolman, a physicist who served as scientific advisor to Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) in the Manhattan Project. Their alleged affair is explored more in-depth in the 2013 book An Atomic Love Story: The Extraordinary Women in Robert Oppenheimer’s Life.
“Robert was seen dating a number of ‘mostly very attractive youngish girls,’” during his time at Berkeley, according to the Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, upon which Nolan’s film is based. “Among others, he had relationships with Haakon Chevalier’s sister-in-law, Ann Hoffman, and Estelle Caen, the sister of the San Francisco Chronicle’s columnist Herbert Caen. Bob Serber recalled a half-dozen girlfriends, including a British emigré named Sandra Dyer-Bennett. He broke several hearts. Still, whenever Tatlock phoned him in a low mood, he came to her and talked her out of her depression. They remained the closest of friends, and occasional lovers.”
After Tatlock broke things off with Oppenheimer, who’d proposed marriage to her at least twice, he met Kitty Harrison (née Peuning), who was married at the time to Stewart Harrison, a doctor. He rekindled his romance with Tatlock while married to Kitty, though refused to say goodbye to Tatlock before departing for Los Alamos.
In 1943, on a visit to Berkeley in the midst of the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer reunited with Tatlock – even though she was seeing his friend, a psychologist named Dr. Siegfried Bernfeld. He was monitored by agents of the military during their entire rendezvous, who later reported their findings to the FBI. According to American Prometheus, those findings were that: “‘On June 14, 1943, Oppenheimer traveled via Key Railway from Berkeley to San Francisco… where he was met by Jean Tatlock who kissed him.’” The two went out for dinner and drinks, and then to Tatlock’s apartment, where Oppenheimer wouldn’t emerge until 8:30 a.m. the next morning, and the FBI report noted that “the relationship of Oppenheimer and Tatlock appears to be very affectionate and intimate.”
As far as we know, he never saw her again after San Francisco.

Aside from this clandestine rendezvous, Pugh’s Tatlock disappears for much of Oppenheimer — save a scene during Oppenheimer’s 1954 security clearance hearings that has to be seen to be believed. Oppenheimer is being grilled by seedy congressmen over his allegiances, with the blowhards repeatedly claiming that Oppenheimer’s affair with the communist Tatlock during his marriage to Kitty, and his association with her communist friends, confirmed that his loyalty to America was precarious at best.
Blunt’s Kitty is in the room as Murphy’s Oppenheimer is being interrogated by these congressmen over Tatlock and we switch to her perspective, as she envisions Oppenheimer and Tatlock — naked — having sex right in front of her, in that very room, with Pugh’s nude Tatlock grinding on Oppie’s lap. Tatlock locks eyes with Kitty in this fantasy scenario, taunting her. You get what Nolan is attempting here — to convey Kitty’s jealousy over her husband’s extramarital tryst — but the scene is so wildly over-the-top that your eyes will roll back into your head.

There is much to admire in Nolan’s Oppenheimer. It is a staggering technical achievement, its score by Ludwig Göransson is dizzyingly alive, the compositions by Hoyte van Hoytema deserve to be taken in on the biggest screen possible, and its performances are stellar across the board (save Josh Hartnett and Benny Safdie’s distracting turns). The film is brimming with ambition, but its sex scenes — and the portrait of Oppenheimer and Tatlock’s relationship as a whole — could have used some work.
Tatlock, by then a doctor whose star was on the rise, took her own life in 1944. She had battled crippling bouts of depression. The name of the first nuclear test, “Trinity,” was reportedly made in tribute to her. It is a reference to a poem by the poet John Donne, whose work Tatlock had introduced to Oppie.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yb2xsaW5nc3RvbmUuY29tL3R2LW1vdmllcy90di1tb3ZpZS1mZWF0dXJlcy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1zZXgtc2NlbmVzLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLWNpbGxpYW4tbXVycGh5LWZsb3JlbmNlLXB1Z2gtamVhbi10YXRsb2NrLTEyMzQ3OTAxMTMv0gGbAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vdHYtbW92aWVzL3R2LW1vdmllLWZlYXR1cmVzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXNleC1zY2VuZXMtY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktZmxvcmVuY2UtcHVnaC1qZWFuLXRhdGxvY2stMTIzNDc5MDExMy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-07-07 02:33:35+00:00,"With New Role, NBCU Hoping Donna Langley Can Extend Her Knack For Original Movie Blockbusters To TV","Donna Langley's superpowers lie in building iconoclastic and franchise-creative content, strategizing it and making it work financially.","The news Thursday about Universal Filmed Entertainment Group chairman Donna Langley’s ascent to bring TV content under her domain doesn’t just speak to the greater NBCUniversal plan to have a more unified strategy across theatrical, TV and streaming.
It’s also a testament to NBCU realizing and relishing the risk-taking, creative-friendly asset the company has in Langley.
There was talk following NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell’s exit over sexual harassment claims that Langley would inherit the post given her billion-dollar-grossing track record at the film studio and as a level-headed balancer of scales in negotiations. Comcast CEO Brian Roberts gave those interim duties to Comcast president Mike Cavanagh, but that wasn’t a means to sideline Langley.
RELATED: Comcast President Mike Cavanagh Makes His Mark As NBCUniversal Chief With Exec Reorg, Donna Langley’s Dual Film-TV Role
While brass tacks oversee of news, sports and sundry NBCU ops are not her thing, Langley’s superpowers lie in building iconoclastic and franchise-creative content, strategizing and making it work financially. In her new role as Chairman, NBCUniversal Studio Group and Chief Content Officer, Langley will have a 30,000-foot view of content creation across the conglom as she expands her creative-team portfolio to include Universal Television, Universal Content Productions, Universal Television Alternative Studios and Universal International Studios (she already presides over the Filmed Entertainment Group which counts Universal Pictures, Focus Features and DreamWorks Animation).
Three years in, the Peacock service continues to struggle with a subscriber base of 22 million. While oversee of the streamer in its distribution and monetization falls to newly anointed NBCUniversal Media Group chairman Mark Lazarus, and original content to NBCUniversal Entertainment chairman Frances Berwick (who’ll report into Langley and Lazarus), Langley will work closely with the duo in building a strategic portfolio across theatrical, TV and streaming, which like her film slate isn’t dependent on one piece of IP.
RELATED: NBCUniversal Shake-Up: How Will Donna Langley Promotion & Susan Rovner Exit Impact Studio’s Television Business
While Langley isn’t vacating her film studio boss role with the new promotion, it’s reasonable to expect that her No. 2, Universal Pictures president Peter Cramer, a committed partner to her vision, will step into a greater leadership role in developing features.
With the departures of such brass as Shell, Jason Kilar at Warner Bros and Bob Chapek at Disney, you could say it’s been a case of “ding dong, the witch is dead” when it comes to their shared penchant for theatrical day-and-date strategies. Langley has always been a believer in the big screen — not just in being a scout and a champion for auteurs but also in the medium’s ancillary financial potency.
As she takes on her new post, Langley stands at an intriguing time for the studio. No longer in place are Universal’s black-and-white, definite theatrical gross-to-Premium VOD windows put in place with exhibition coming out of the pandemic (i.e., films opening to north of $50 million had 31 days to PVOD, while those opening under had 17 days before hitting homes). Despite getting blasted by AMC boss Adam Aron in the press over Universal’s day-and-date experimentation with Trolls: World Tour back in April 2020, Langley was never the architect of such distributor-exhibitor windows.
Nowadays, theatrical windows for Universal titles are bespoke depending on the movie, meaning an arthouse film can spend more time in theaters in order to grab the older, slower-moving moviegoers, or to mine the next Get Out. The contracts with top exhibitors like AMC and Regal were put in place as good faith to them as Universal looked to exploit the best possible financial outcome for each movie, this at a time when Peacock was being built into a movie’s financial waterfall. The decision to expire these gross-to-PVOD contracts comes as Uni has developed a greater understanding of the flexibility of PVOD and avoiding theatrical cannibalization. Interestingly enough, in the case of several Universal animated films, theatrical kept humming for months despite their simultaneous availability on PVOD.
Uni has built a solid means of capitalizing on theatrical, not only profiting off of PVOD but as the films go through a lengthy 18-month Pay One window that includes Peacock, Prime Video (for live action titles) and Netflix (for animated movies).
Despite Uni’s experiment with day-and-date theatrical on Peacock with Blumhouse titles such as Halloween Kills, Halloween Ends and the upcoming Five Nights at Freddy’s, filmmakers know that Langley is worth her word, and that her marketing and distribution corps have the acumen when it comes to turning an original movie into a theatrical event. A prime example: Sam Mendes’ World War I pic 1917, with a largely fresh-faced cast and its one-shot avant garde style, minted more than $159 million stateside and $385M worldwide before Covid shuttered theaters. Not a lot of Hollywood studios can turn what might look as counterprogramming on paper — like the femme-demo pics Girls Trip, the Mamma Mia movies and Bridesmaids– and mushroom them into blockbusters.
Such successes as well as other original titles-turned-events — i.e. Jordan Peele’s Get Out and F. Gary Gray’s Straight Outta Compton, which Langley took out of turnaround and turned into a late-summer 2015 blockbuster with $161M+ domestic and more than $201M worldwide — encouraged filmmakers like Christopher Nolan to jump studios. The Tenet filmmaker segued from his longtime Warner Bros home to Uni with his WWII-era drama Oppenheimer, which is eyeing a great box office opening of $40M-$50M U.S. in the face of Warners’ Barbie (with $80M+) during the July 21-23 frame.

Along with Nolan, Universal is the home to such filmmakers and producers as Judd Apatow, Amy Pascal, Lord & Miller, Elizabeth Banks, Everything Everywhere All at Once Oscar winners The Daniels (who made a five-year exclusive theatrical pact with Uni), Peele, Jason Blum and Illumination titan Chris Meledandri to name a few.

,Oppenheimer fans highlight ‘disturbing’ detail going unnoticed by majority of viewers,"‘I haven’t been able to get it out of my head,’ one cinemagoer stated","Oppenheimer featured a tiny detail that’s disturbing viewers who noticed it.
The film, written and directed by Christopher Nolan, was released in July, and is on track to become one of the biggest hits of his career.
It tells the story of physicist J Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), who was the man who led the creation of the atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
Near the beginning of the film, the character of Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) is introduced. Tatlock was Oppenheimer’s lover, with whom he continued his relationship while he was married to his wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt).
*Spoilers follow – you have been warned*
Oppenheimer’s involvement with Tatlock is also frowned upon because of her ties to the communist party. This concerns US government officials who employed Oppenheimer to oversee the top secret Manhattan Project.
The fate of Tatlock is hinted at throughout the film, before it’s revealed that she died by suicide. In harrowing scenes, made up of quick shots, she is shown drowning herself in her bathtub.
However, at one point in the film, when it quickly cuts to Tatlock in the bathroom, hands wearing black gloves can be see pushing her head into the tub.
The shot is so quick that many are failing to notice it the first time they watch the film – and even those who do spot it are wondering if they imagined it.
While some are theorising that Nolan is suggesting Tatlock’s suicide was faked, it’s more likely that the filmmaker intended it to be a manifestation of Oppenheimer’s guilt after he’s informed of her death.

“One thing in Oppenheimer I haven’t been able to get out of my head is that brief insert of black gloves in that one flashback with Florence Pugh,” @thejoshl wrote, adding: “Nolan was really in his horror mode.”
“I cannot get the shot of the black glove out of my head,” @NotYetSurgeon wrote, with an additional viewer saying it’s “probably the most disturbing image in the film”.

Oppenheimer is in cinemas now, and has more than quadrupled its budget of $100m in less than two weeks. Meanwhile, Barbie, which was released on the same day as Oppenheimer, will hit $1bn this week. Both films look set to be two of the biggest hits of the year.
Barbie is also reveiving acclaim from critics and audiences, although one joke in the film and directed at its lead star Margot Robbie has been branded “self-aware” and the “worst” in the film.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vY2EubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vb3BwZW5oZWltZXItZmFucy1oaWdobGlnaHQtZGlzdHVyYmluZy1kZXRhaWwtMTMzMTA2MzQ0Lmh0bWzSAV1odHRwczovL2NhLm5ld3MueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItZmFucy1oaWdobGlnaHQtZGlzdHVyYmluZy1kZXRhaWwtMTMzMTA2MzQ0Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

As summer rolls to a close, this weekend will be one of the quietest we’ve had for some time, with the market leaning mostly on the strength of holdover business while Universal debuts The Last Voyage of the Demeter.
The Last Voyage of the Demeter
Universal Pictures
August 11, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $6M-$11M
PROS and CONS:
Barbie will extend its reign to four weekends atop the domestic box office as it comes off a $53 million third frame. The $1 billion-dollar global earner will also look to cross the $500 million domestic barrier before this weekend’s end as it chases the $574.2 million earned by The Super Mario Bros. Movie, currently the top grosser of 2023.
After last weekend’s brief reprieve from the number two spot—Meg 2‘s debut pushed it down to third place—Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer should reclaim second place as it continues to display the kind of holding power typical of the filmmaker’s past releases. Even before its fourth frame is up, the pic is set to become the fourth of Nolan’s career to cross $250 million domestically after The Dark Knight, Inception, and The Dark Knight Rises.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem should begin settling into a leggy haul, with strong reviews (96 percent on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (92 percent) carrying the franchise revival to a long family-driven runway.
Meg 2: The Trench currently boasts a 72 percent audience score, which would be a concern for most films… but not so much here, as the first Meg owns a far lower 43 percent. The sequel faces minimal competition from the weekend’s new opener and should continue to benefit from double-header screenings with Barbie at various drive-in locations.
Meanwhile, The Last Voyage of the Demeter may be fighting for a debut in the top five this weekend. Pre-sale trends are comparable to last August’s Beast and The Invitation. Tracking is strongest among men under 35, while its R rating and period setting offset other benefits offered by the Dracula-inspired narrative and appeal to horror fans.
Current projection ranges call for a 30% to 35% decrease from last weekend’s $172.9 million top ten aggregate.

2023-08-16 17:05:00+00:00,"Inside the ‘Oppenheimer’ Imax 70mm Craze: Fans Crossing State Lines, the Search for New Projectors and More","With “Oppenheimer” in Imax 70mm, a “cinephile argument” has become mainstream, as 30 screens have raked in an astounding $17 million in just four weeks","Ryan Knapp woke up before sunrise one morning in July and left his home in northern New Hampshire at 5:30 a.m. to catch a movie.
It wasn’t just any day at the cinema. In fact, it was a 14-hour round-trip journey that involved crossing two state lines by car, train and bus. That’s because Knapp wanted to see Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” the way the director intended: in Imax 70mm, a rare format crafted from Nolan’s film negative, with physical reels spanning 11 miles and weighing 600 pounds. It’s a movie nerd’s dream — but it’s only available on 30 screens worldwide, 19 of them in the U.S.
So Knapp trekked to Providence, R.I., for a 2 p.m. showing. The verdict? “It was definitely worth it.”
“Oppenheimer,” an R-rated three-hour drama consisting mainly of people talking in rooms, is not the type of movie audiences typically clamor to see on premium screens. Yet Imax accounted for a whopping 20% of the film’s $180.4 million global opening. And the company’s share of the movie’s box office haul has increased each successive weekend, with the 70mm version raking in $17 million to date, an astounding figure for such a limited format.
Audiences have flocked to Imax screens because they offer an experience that cannot be replicated at home, according to box office analyst Jeff Bock, and “when a Christopher Nolan film comes out, that is an event in and of itself.” Plus, premium large formats like Imax 70mm are “a cinephile argument that has now carried over into the mainstream.”
According to Nolan, Imax 70mm is the ideal cinema experience because “the sharpness and the clarity and the depth of the image is unparalleled.” But there are serious limitations when it comes to bringing the format to a wider audience. For one, Imax has only 30 Imax film projectors in rotation worldwide, and it takes three days to create each print. Since most theaters have switched over completely to digital projection, the company worked for two years to evaluate, reinstall and fix Imax 70mm projectors, sending tech teams to every site to perfect the audiovisual components. With “Oppenheimer,” Imax oversaw the hiring of 50 film projectionists globally and helped develop the first-ever Imax 70mm black-and-white film, bringing some of Kodak’s more experienced personnel out of retirement in the process.
Due to popular demand, Imax has twice extended “Oppenheimer’s” 70mm run. But on Sept. 1, exhibitors will have to cede those screens to Denzel Washington’s “The Equalizer 3.”
“We really want to support Chris and the movie in every way we can, but we have to balance that with our other commitments,” says Richard Gelfond, CEO of Imax. “We’ll play it by ear and see where it goes.”
Mark Jafar, Imax’s global head of corporate communications, adds, “Imax 70mm film lasts, on average, 10 times longer than regular 70mm or 35mm film. Those prints are assets that we’ll be using for the next 20 years.” He’s confident that specialty theaters like BFI in London and AMC Lincoln Square in New York will bring back “Oppenheimer” in Imax 70mm for Nolan retrospectives.
But it might return even sooner. With theaters selling out more than three weeks in advance — and fans like Knapp road-tripping to their nearest Imax 70mm showing — it’s likely “Oppenheimer” will come back to premium large formats after moviegoers have checked out “The Equalizer 3.”
As Imax 70mm continues to permeate the mainstream and draw in younger auteurs like Jordan Peele and Damien Chazelle, Gelfond’s hope is to “find more projectors and refurbish them.”
“It’s an art form that’s been fading away,” he says. “Imax is all in on trying to keep film alive.”
With $134 million generated from “Oppenheimer” alone, the premium film-tech company is largely responsible for bringing multiplexes out of the pandemic slump. “If Hollywood is going to invest in one thing,” says Bock, “it should have almost everything to do with Imax.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItaW1heC03MG1tLWNyYXplLXByb2plY3RvcnMtMTIzNTY5NzA4NS_SAVlodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9uZXdzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWltYXgtNzBtbS1jcmF6ZS1wcm9qZWN0b3JzLTEyMzU2OTcwODUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Oppenheimer: Six Explosive Questions,Why did the father of the A-bomb lie about being a member of the Communist Party? Christopher Nolan film Cillian Murphy summer blockbuster,"Why did the father of the A-bomb lie about being a member of the Communist Party?
Director Christopher Nolan’s likely blockbuster film, “Oppenheimer,” is scheduled to open this week. Physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who was born in 1904 and died in 1967, was the so-called “father of the atomic bomb.”
He headed the Los Alamos lab that produced the nuclear weapons we dropped in August 1945 on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. To his dismay, he was accused in 1953 of being disloyal and even a spy. The next year, he permanently lost his security clearance.
Oppenheimer was neither disloyal nor a spy. In 1954, though, he had failed to testify truthfully when he falsely denied — to the Atomic Energy Commission — that he’d ever been a member of the Communist Party.
He had in fact been a secret party member between about 1939 and 1941. Multiple sources — including a memoir, the reports by two former Oppenheimer friends, and a handful of Soviet documents — overwhelmingly establish this.
Oppenheimer is a tantalizingly enigmatic figure, whose complexities will surely be probed in Nolan’s film. How will that film address, among others, the following six sets of concerns:
What does it suggest about Oppenheimer’s values that, in 1943, he set as a standard for pursuing the possibility of a secret weapons program — radiological warfare using fission products — that the weapon be able to kill a half million of the enemy? Did such a standard suggest a lack of concern about slaying enemy noncombatants and thus a marked departure from ethical principles?
What does it mean that, in 1945, Oppenheimer endorsed conducting an experiment on a human patient by injecting highly toxic plutonium into that individual? Was Oppenheimer concerned that such a patient could be a human guinea pig?
Before the Hiroshima bombing, why did Oppenheimer, unlike some associates, fail to express any concern to officials that America’s A-bombs would be targeted, without warning, on Japanese cities, and thereby kill and injure many noncombatants in those cities? Involved on key advisory committees, Oppenheimer, had he chosen, could have expressed concerns. Significantly, Oppenheimer, unlike the Army chief of staff, General George C. Marshall, did not.
Why after the atomic bombing of Japan, did Oppenheimer in 1945 greatly downplay A-bomb radiation problems in Japan and thus mislead the public and the press about such hazards?
How does one explain Oppenheimer’s oscillating positions on an American quest to develop an H-bomb, a weapon that would be hundreds and ultimately thousands of times more powerful than our early A-bombs? In World War II, he briefly endorsed such an H-bomb quest. In 1945 and 1946, he opposed such a quest. In the period between 1947 and late 1949, he reversed himself again, endorsing such a quest. Yet after the Soviet Union’s breakthrough in August 1949 of developing an A-bomb, when some U.S. officials, alarmed by the Soviet A-bomb, pushed for an American H-bomb as a necessary response, Oppenheimer reversed himself again, strongly opposing any American quest for the H-bomb.
How, most importantly, does Mr. Nolan’s film deal with the overwhelming evidence that Oppenheimer, between about 1939 and 1941, had been a secret Communist Party member and thus that he had repeatedly later lied to U.S. officials on this matter?
In the 1954 AEC hearing, by denying such earlier party membership, Oppenheimer had in effect committed perjury. What does that lying, and thus his perjury, mean for understanding Oppenheimer, the AEC’s conclusion that he was a “security risk,” and Mr. Nolan’s movie? Not to treat that subject appropriately could undermine much of the film, and mislead the public.
Other questions and concerns could be added, but these six, and especially the one about Oppenheimer’s repeated lying — and thus perjury — seem adequate to help focus an informed, and needed, dialogue about the complicated J. Robert Oppenheimer as Mr. Nolan’s widely touted movie comes to the big screen.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55c3VuLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXNpeC1leHBsb3NpdmUtcXVlc3Rpb25z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
8/7/2023 19:00,"Reframing that ""Oppenheimer"" sex scene as a Hindu woman who delved into my religion's sacred truths","Op-ed about ""Oppenheimer"" sex scene involving the ""Bhagavad Gita"" sacred Hindu text","Two weeks ago, on a Sunday, I literally ran out of my six-hour Patient Care Technician shift to watch ""Oppenheimer,"" Christopher Nolan's biopic starring Cilian Murphy as the Manhattan Project scientist, J. Robert Oppenheimer. In ninth grade, I had the opportunity to interview Dr. Benjamin Bederson, who was a bomb switch operator for the Manhattan project, so the inner high school history nerd in me was ready to be enthralled by the movie of the summer.
However, the iconic and controversial ""Gita"" sex scene where grad student Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) descends on Oppenheimer had me literally running out of the room faster than I ran out of my job to watch it in the first place. In this scene, the two sleep together for the first time following a communist party gathering. Midway through intercourse, Jean picks up a bound copy of the Hindu scripture ""Bhagavad Gita"" from Oppenheimer's bookshelf, and asks him to read from it – where we get the foreboding quote, ""Now I become death, the destroyer of worlds"" – before proceeding with the act as he continues to read. Although the film has received rave reviews, this scene has garnered immense criticism from Hindu nationalist group, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), for its insertion of religious scripture into sexual intercourse.
Disclaimer: I started squirming in my seat during the scene and spent a good 10 minutes afterwards in the bathroom stall, calming myself down. Then I bought a blue Icee and ran back in to watch the rest.
The scene, although uncomfortable, was mind-opening. All of a sudden my present started to articulate my past forward as I was transported out of the movie theater and into my eighth grade health classroom. Today's topic: the forms of sex. All three forms – as my teacher called it. As someone who didn't even know that sex existed until that moment, I immediately started twisting in my chair and had to leave the room as the teacher's descriptions got more and more detailed. My mind could not handle the fact that two people could crave touching each other's private parts out of choice or out of adoration. But several of my classmates were unfazed. And several of them laughed at my reaction for weeks.
At that point, I knew I had to change. I had to take initiative to learn what my parents had always avoided discussing with me. So, I started reading ""Game of Thrones"" and its fanfiction to educate myself. And lots of it. By the time I had finished high school and college, I had read so much of it that I thought I had numbed my mind to sexual thought and literary depiction. But that ""Oppenheimer"" Gita sex scene told me differently.
When I saw it on screen, I still could not handle it.
Across the whiteboard he had written in all caps these words: KAMA SUTRA.
Growing up in a conservative Indian American household in the midwestern United States, I never heard from my parents discussions about certain bodily actions seen as ""obscene"" or taboo and why society perceived them in that way. I'd never seen them even kiss each other in front of my sister and me. I never had a person who could talk candidly with me about embarrassing or scary changes in my body and make them no longer seem so mysterious and foreign. After that revelatory eighth grade sexual health education class, there were questions that I was dying to ask but knew it was not OK to ask my mom or dad. To them, there was no comedy nor beauty in discussing sex and sexuality, especially when they were starting from scratch with someone like me, who was on the brink of puberty but still had many gaps in her knowledge. I wondered why my parents always shied away from this topic – even when it is something so deeply human and important.
""You don't have to know these things. The more you know about it, the more you will want to jump in earlier,"" my mom would say. ""I don't know why they teach these things to kids so early in this country.""
Two years later, in 10th grade world history class, I was a raging ""Game of Thrones"" fan who had read almost every Sansa/Tyrion fanfic on the internet (including the rated M for mature ones). We were learning about ancient India, and my favorite teacher of all time told us something that shocked me more than the Oppenheimer scene: that early Indian civilization was a pioneer in and center of sexual desire.
Across the whiteboard he had written in all caps these words: KAMA SUTRA.
""Do you know what this is,"" he yelled across the room to the whole class. ""Anyone? How about you, Sibani?""
I was the only Indian American student in my high school class. I honestly and vigorously shook my head. I worshiped this man on many levels, but I sincerely did not know the answer to his question. I was also embarrassed that I didn't know about this supposedly very important text from my own culture.
""This is a book . . . about sex,"" he continued. ""All the different positions and the ways to enjoy them. And it originated in INDIA.""
I felt my face flush. My parents had ensured that I watch re-enacted versions of the Indian epics of Mahabharata and Ramayana on our tiny TV screen in my small Iowan midwestern town. My late grandmother had ensured that I learned how to speak my native language TamiI, and my parents pushed me to retain that. They put me through Carnatic singing lessons over the phone to help me better connect with my heritage and culture. Yet, they had conveniently chosen not to mention this uncomfortable but fascinating truth about the book of sex originating in India.

That day, I went home and scoured the internet. And what my genius of a world history teacher had told me was beyond true. It turned out that I did not have to even turn to the internet, but rather had to dig back into my own memories of visiting temples across South India during my summers and sometimes seeing their walls adorned with near-naked female idols. When visiting, I remember being a bit surprised that these sculptures were not taken down by the conservative Indian communities that surrounded them. However, history reveals that the communities that initially surrounded the sculptures may have been ones where sex and spirituality were united, not untied.
For example, the seven-foot-tall Sathyamurthi Perumal Temple in my motherland of Tamil Nadu, India features detailed and sacred architecture depicting intercourse. In fact, these structures are protected by the Archeological Survey of India. This is not a standalone example. The juxtaposition of sexuality and sanctity can be seen in Hindu temples ranging from the Sun Temple in Gujarat to the Jain temples of Rajasthan to the Virupaksha temple in Karnataka – all located in India.
Sex was a characteristic of early Hindu civilizations in a way that was arguably more explicit than any scene in ""Oppenheimer.""
Early India's fascination with sex is not limited to architecture but also spills over into literature beyond the ""Kama Sutra."" While the major Hindu epics ""Mahabharata"" and ""Ramayana"" are certainly not as pornographic as ""Game of Thrones,"" these ancient religious epics are far from devoid of the depictions of sexual pleasure. The pages contain stories of great sages committed to abstinence, who could resist everything but the temptations of sex. Draupadi, a pivotal character in ""Mahabharata"" and powerful example of polyandry, simultaneously keeps and sleeps with five husbands. Hindu scripture is not devoid of sexual exposure. In fact, the ""Gita ""that Oppenheimer invests his mind in is derived from a scene in the ""Mahabharata.""
When my mom sent me an article on the Hindu nationalists' criticism of the questionable sex scene in ""Oppenheimer,"" I immediately defended the Western approach to sex.
""The difference between the Western world and the Indian one is that the Western one can own up to human temptations and sins, versus in India, we like to hide from what makes us human anyway. Just remember that India – not USA – was the earliest erotic place in the world where a so-called 'book' originated. Read beyond headlines,"" I wrote in response.
However, I now realize that my scathing response – while it is not fully false – lacks sensitivity. The ""Gita"" is a sacred text. While it does encourage sex for procreation, it discourages sex for pleasure. I do not agree with that principle in the ""Gita"" (isn't sex called making love for a reason?), but I do think Nolan crossed the line a bit. Just a bit. But only a bit.
Even if the scene made me very uncomfortable, walking through Hindu temples trying to recite prayers and seeing naked copulation sculptures has also made me very uncomfortable. So, when the Hindu nationalist BJP calls the scene a ""disturbing attack on Hinduism"" that ""wages a war on the Hindu community,"" that is not at all accurate either. The earliest Hindus saw sex as a soul of their religion and culture. Maybe that is not how things are today, but as a Hindu woman myself, history and religion calls upon me to pursue the truth. The truth is that sex was a characteristic of early Hindu civilizations in a way that was arguably more explicit than any scene in ""Oppenheimer."" The truth is that my parents and several of my Indian American friends' parents unfortunately often avoid this reality. The truth is that Nolan saw the raw sexual stuff of life as text to be read, art to be created and conversation to be generated. If anything, this scene pays tribute to the reality that several sacred Hindu spaces – even if this excludes the ""Bhagavad Gita"" itself – do indeed sing of the sexual.
To all Hindus in this world – including the BJP – let's not be angry and offended. We've not earned the right to be given the past. Instead, let's invite a responsible dialogue about what history can teach us about our own religion. And then, we can talk about how we would like for that religion to be accurately represented.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4LzA3L29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXNjZW5lLWJoYWdhdmFkLWdpdGEtaGluZHUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Robert Downey Jr teases fans with John Krasinski ‘cameo’ in star-studded Oppenheimer photo,"Actor shared a starry picture alongside castmates Emily Blunt, Cillian Murphy, and Matt Damon","Fans are speculating whether John Krasinski could make an appearance in Christopher Nolan’s soon-to-be-released blockbuster Oppenheimer.
The film, directed by Nolan and starring Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, and Emily Blunt, is due to be released on 21 July.
Theories are flying on social media after Robert Downey Jr shared a star-studded photo with his Oppenheimer castmates on social media on Sunday (9 July).
The actor, 58, posted a photo of himself looking cheerful and smiling with his fellow actors on what appears to be a rooftop bar in New York City. A pizza box can be seen in the bottom left corner of the picture.
“Linking up with my Oppenheimer castmates,” wrote the Iron Man star in the caption.
The photo, however, also includes an unexpected cameo from Kransinski who is standing behind the four actors with his hands up.
Downey acknowledged the Office star’s presence, writing: “Wait, is that a Krasinski photobomb or might there be a surprise cameo???”
Some fans in the comments expressed their excitement at the prospect of Krasinski joining the starry cast.
However, it seems more likely that Krasinski was there to support Blunt, his wife, during the press tour for Oppenheimer.
Krasinski, 43, and Blunt, 40, met in 2008 and went on their first date the same year. They married in 2010, and became parents to two daughters – Hazel and Violet – in 2016.
The two actors are known to work together previously. The pair starred opposite one another in the 2018 horror film A Quiet Place, which Krasinski directed and co-wrote. Krasinski also wrote and directed the film’s sequel, A Quiet Place Part II, in which Blunt and Murphy both starred.

In Oppenheimer, Murphy stars as the “father of the atomic bomb”, Robert J Oppenheimer with Blunt playing his wife, biologist Kitty Oppenheimer.
Matt Damon, 52, portrays Lt Leslie Groves Jr, the director of the top-secret Manhattan Project responsible for developing the atomic bomb.

Recently, Blunt shared fond memories of shooting the movie in the New Mexico desert, an environment she compared to “summer camp”.
The Devil Wears Prada star went on to explain that Murphy chose to skip a cast dinner because of the “monumental” pressure he felt as the lead role.
“The sheer volume of what he had to take on and shoulder is so monumental,” Blunt said. “Of course he didn’t want to come and have dinner with us.”
“He couldn’t. His brain was just too full,” Damon added.
Jumping into clarify, Murphy said: “You know that when you have those big roles, that responsibility, you feel it’s kind of overwhelming.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JvYmVydC1kb3duZXktanItdGVhc2VzLWZhbnMtMDYzMDE3MzQ2Lmh0bWzSAVRodHRwczovL2NhLnNwb3J0cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC9uZXdzL3JvYmVydC1kb3duZXktanItdGVhc2VzLWZhbnMtMDYzMDE3MzQ2Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Cineplex Inc. says it saw its highest July box office of all time as ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" sent droves to theatres last month.
The Toronto-based cinema chain says the record month surpassed $86 million in net box office revenues.
July also delivered the company its second highest month on record, trailing December 2015, when ""Star Wars: Episode VII -- The Force Awakens"" was released.
Cineplex attributed much of the month's lift to ""Barbie,"" which generated the highest July attendance at its theatres, followed by ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One.""
Altogether the company says 6.8 million moviegoers visited its theatres last month and Cineplex also scored its second highest monthly premium box office revenue of all time.
The Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling-starring ""Barbie"" debuted on July 21, the same day as Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" hit theatres, with many fans treating the concurrent releases as a double bill.

Although Robert Oppenheimer’s signature porkpie hat is the most iconic piece of costume design in “Oppenheimer,” there’s another detail that shows up in many scenes: the white K-6 badge on his chest.
In the scenes set in Los Alamos, the New Mexico town selected for the Manhattan Project, characters can be seen wearing round badges with combinations of letters and numbers. These refer to the identification numbers they were assigned upon arriving at Los Alamos.
In actual ID photos taken for security purposes, you can see their number on the image. Oppenheimer’s was, in fact, K-6.

Security, in theory, was tight at Los Alamos. In practice, however, America’s foremost concentration of scientific geniuses wasn’t exactly known for playing by the rules. Richard Feynman, who was just 24 when he was recruited for the Manhattan Project, was the chief pain in the ass. His ID photo says it all: A young man, about to embark on a serious and secretive mission, sporting a cheeky grin.

Feynman (who is played by Jack Quaid in the film) instructed his wife and father to write him letters in code to see how much he could get past the censors. “As a result of all these experiences with the censor, I knew exactly what could get through and what could not get through,” he would later write in his memoir “Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!” “Nobody else knew as well as I. And so I made a little money out of all of this by making bets.”
Some of Feynman’s other activities could have easily resulted in being arrested or worse. Once, he found a hole in the security fence around Los Alamos. For fun, he decided to leave the facility through its guarded gate and then turn right back around and sneak in via the hole. Back inside, he waved goodbye through the gate and crawled in through the hole again. He made a few loops before the guard called his superior officer to ask if he could arrest Feynman.

Even more dangerously, Feynman indulged his passion for cracking codes by breaking into safes. At night, he would go into the facility and open top-secret file cabinets by guessing colleagues’ combinations. Sometimes he left notes inside the opened drawers as a joke, which had the unintended consequence of terrifying at least one co-worker that a spy was at Los Alamos.
“If this were a country like Germany … there were a dozen [scientists] we should have shot right off,” military head of the Manhattan Project Leslie Groves once said. “And another dozen we could have shot for suspicion and carelessness.”

(For those who have seen the movie, two of Feynman’s eccentricities made it into the final cut. One, he did indeed enjoy playing bongo drums, and two, he actually declined a piece of welder’s glass to look at the Trinity test. He believed the UV in his truck’s windshield would be enough to protect his eyes. He claimed to be the only person to look directly at the explosion.)

2023-07-24 14:27:54+00:00,"Massive Box Office Weekend Sets Records For AMC Entertainment, Imax","AMC had its best weeked since 2019, Imax hit an all-time market share high.","AMC Entertainment set a new post-Covid record for global admissions revenue this past weekend with Barbie and Oppenheimer leading a charge that drew 7.8 million moviegoers to theaters.
Warner Bros/Mattel’s Barbie racked up $162 million opening weekend. Universal’s Oppenheimer stands at $82.4 million for a $300 million weekend at the domestic box office.
For Imax, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer delivered a $35 million debut on 740 screens worldwide, representing the biggest share ever of a film’s global opening weekend box office with 20% of total receipts.
AMC has the biggest number of Imax auditoriums among major chains.
AMC said Saturday was its busiest day since July of 2019. In the U.S., Friday, Saturday and Sunday each set single day post-reopening attendance records. On Saturday, AMC recorded the fifth highest single-day U.S. admissions ticket revenues in its 103-year history – and its second-highest highest food and beverage revenue day ever after Avengers: Endgame in May, 2019.
The “Barbenheimer” phenomenon was in evidence with 87,000 members of the AMC Stubs loyalty program booking tickets through Sunday evening to see both films.
“AMC sends an enormous thank you and congratulations to Greta Gerwig, Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and the entire team at Warner Bros., and to Christopher Nolan and the team at Universal Pictures. They’ve demonstrated that well-made, well-marketed films that captivate audiences can open on the same weekend and both enjoy great success,” said CEO Adam Aron.
Holdovers Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 1 and Sound Of Freedom helped nudge the numbers into post-Covid attendance records.
AMC Entertainment has 950 theatres and 10,500 screens worldwide.
For Imax, Oppenheimer — shot with Imax cameras — repped its the biggest July opening weekend ever, global and domestic, the biggest opening weekend of 2023, and the biggest opening weekend ever for a Christopher Nolan film.
“Oppenheimer is an undeniable demonstration of a paradigm shift in moviegoing, with Imax taking a commanding share of global box office as audiences show a clear preference for experiences that transcend the ordinary in cinema,” said Imax CEO Rich Gelfond. “As he has done throughout his career, Christopher Nolan pushed the boundaries of IMAX technology to deliver unforgettable storytelling with ‘Oppenheimer’ and audiences are responding in numbers we’ve not seen in our 50-year history.”
In North America, the film opened to $21.1 million, an Imax-record of 26.2% of the domestic box office from 411 screens. Internationally, it opened to $13.9 million for 14.8% of the box office on 329 screens.
AMC shares were up 17% at $5.15. Its preferred APE units were down slightly at $1.78 after a court ruling Friday that wasn’t great news for the company longer term despite the current booming box office.
Imax is up 4% at $17.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXNldHMtYW1jLWltYXgtYm94LW9mZmljZS1yZWNvcmRzLTEyMzU0NDYyNTMv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy9iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc2V0cy1hbWMtaW1heC1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLXJlY29yZHMtMTIzNTQ0NjI1My9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-29 13:00:56+00:00,"As a Gen Z-er who saw ‘Oppenheimer,’ here’s where it connected","Ethan Huang, SCNG intern, did the “Barbenheimer” thing. Like with many young people, the story of Oppenheimer resonated in a polarized era.","It was an opening weekend like no other.
Some were clad in pink jumpsuits and cowboy hats, others donned fedoras and suits for the simultaneous big-screen releases of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.”
I was among them – minus the cosplay – but was nevertheless enchanted by the turnout. And it was most surprising for “Oppenheimer.”
While my local theater was a bit quieter in a morning screening, reports of sold-out IMAX screenings at the TCL Chinese Theater in Los Angeles and hundreds of posts on social media surprised me, as millennials and Gen Z-ers were hooked on the film.
The result was a hit for both films, with “Barbie” earning $162 million and “Oppenheimer” earning $82 million in their first weekend, and there’s indications this weekend will be a big one, too.
With the massive promotion and broad appeal of “Barbie,” it was no surprise that it would be a success. But “Oppenheimer” – director Christopher Nolan’s biggest opening since his “The Dark Knight” films – surpassed expectations, surprising for an R-rated, 3-hour historical biopic.
On top of this, according to reports, the first weekend of “Oppenheimer” saw massive popularity among millennials with about 27% of viewers being 30 to 39 years of age. Meanwhile, audience members from ages 13 to 29 made up nearly half of the audience, drawing 47.1% of viewers.
Being a member of the latter cohort spurred my curiosity: Was the film’s draw among younger audiences because of a mere social media sensation, or is there something deeper going on here, in which the film is finding a way to connect to contemporary audiences?
My fellow Gen Z-ers offered some perspective.
Among them were those who are familiar with Nolan’s work, such as Graham Ros, a film and television production major at Chapman University, in Orange County.
“I’m a fan of his career and I think he makes great movies,” Ros said, echoing my own interest in Nolan’s filmography. “It’s a combination of him doing something a little bit outside of his comfort zone, like a biopic doesn’t really seem like him… so him doing a nonfiction biopic was really interesting for me and the cast is absolutely insane, so I had to be there day one.”
But most general audience members may only know Nolan in passing. Rather, one reason for its appeal could come simply from its “blockbuster” status. “Oppenheimer” releases in a summer full of big movies like “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” and “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.” Like “Oppenheimer,” most of these were critically and financially successful.
It reveals that the moviegoing experience is back in full force after the pandemic put a damper on theaters.
Meanwhile, audiences sought spectacle. Although the film seemed to be a drama mostly consisting of board meetings, science jargon and court sequences, people wanted to see a glorious screen filled edge to edge, feel a theater shaking, with the cinematic might of an atomic weapon.
The A-list cast also served to bring excitement to audiences, from Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and Matt Damon and Florence Pugh to Gen Z childhood favorites, such as Josh Peck of “Drake and Josh” fame and Devon Bostick of “Diary of a Wimpy Kid.”
But outside of that, what else is there?
A film about World War II has been done time and time again (even by Nolan himself), yet something about “Oppenheimer” speaks to the modern audience – and to my generation.
To younger audiences, here’s where the film connected: While discussions of World War II and the Red Scare seem to feel like distant history in the contemporary American landscape, the film pushes them into the limelight and forces audiences to reckon with Oppenheimer’s triumph and his tragedy.
Ines Arroyo, a high school junior at the California School of the Arts – San Gabriel Valley, in Duarte, offered some insight beyond her years. She noted that while a story of scientists and politics might not land on the surface, it is the historical backdrop that relates to her generation.
“I think seeing something that was such a mess, that ruined and also set up things for now on such a massive scale, is the interesting part,” says Arroyo. “I feel like a lot going on right now in the world is, I guess you would say depressing and kind of messed up, so I think seeing that in a movie format really puts that into perspective.”
“Oppenheimer” makes the wartime American machine look ugly, both in its selfish interests during the war and efforts to silence Oppenheimer following it. One of the most effective, but subtle moments shows an official crossing Kyoto off of a list of potential bombing locations simply because it was he and his wife’s honeymoon location.
It portrays a government consumed with “bringing our boys home” coupled with an Oppenheimer hell-bent on finishing the bomb. Only by the time he completes the weapon and it is used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that Oppenheimer seems to feel a sense of guilt.
To Ros, many of these themes are relevant to modern audiences because they serve as a cautionary tale for younger generations.
“The movie itself is a deconstruction of war and Americanism and patriotism, and that is a topic that’s in our culture all the time now,” he says. “I think the younger generation likes to explore what America does wrong so that we can do it right in the future.”
Within that greater commentary also lies Oppenheimer’s personal tale. In watching the film, audiences follow the scientist’s realization that he has opened Pandora’s Box, and there is no way to close it.
This sense of dread is an immediate response, but it can be amplified for a generation of viewers in recognizing a not-so-subtle butterfly effect that essentially created the entire contemporary landscape.
It can be argued that the world exists as it is today because of Oppenheimer — that it was because of his “deadly toy,” as Sting once sang, that World War II ended when it did. The film details how the creation of a single bomb inevitably led to the Cold War, when American paranoia expedited the start of new projects such as the hydrogen bomb. The result is present-day superpowers like the United States and Russia quietly sitting on thousands of nuclear weapons.
An entire side of popular culture can be attributed to the invention of nuclear power, as the very subject is rooted in a genre of film, music and video games. Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove” remains one of the earliest, while post-apocalyptic stories like “Mad Max” attribute its end of the world landscape to nuclear warfare.
In Japan, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki inspired a generation of storytelling focusing on nuclear anxiety, with “Godzilla” being perhaps the most iconic products of that era. Even the renowned video game series “Metal Gear” is constructed around the fear of nuclear mass destruction.
That is what “Oppenheimer” ultimately imposes on its audience. A man and his ambition, the creation of a new world with nuclear power.
What the film provides audiences is the chance to imagine a world different from ours. It’s near impossible to think of it, especially for an entire generation of viewers born after the end of the Cold War.
Young viewers today never lived with the ubiquity of mutually assured destruction, and such events are discussed as part of a textbook curriculum. For those who never experienced such realities, “Oppenheimer” makes audiences aware that the bricks of modern human existence can be traced back to a single decision, for better and for worse.
From the eyes of younger viewers, the film pushes us to see the world with Oppenheimer at the center of it.
From that point of view, his slender shadow, with pipe in hand, the now iconic fedora, his triumphs and his tragedy, are imprinted on the world through a story that connects generations.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNndnRyaWJ1bmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMjkvYXMtYS1nZW4tei1lci13aG8tc2F3LW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWhlcmVzLXdoZXJlLWl0LWNvbm5lY3RlZC_SAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZ3Z0cmlidW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3LzI5L2FzLWEtZ2VuLXotZXItd2hvLXNhdy1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1oZXJlcy13aGVyZS1pdC1jb25uZWN0ZWQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Many of the screenings at the theater have been sold out since it was released on July 21.","INDIANAPOLIS — Indianapolis residents, as well as visitors to the city, will have more chances to see Christopher Nolan’s latest blockbuster in 70mm.
According to an announcement from the IMAX theater at the Indiana State Museum, more than 20 additional showings of “Oppenheimer” in 70mm have been added to the schedule from Aug. 10-17. Many of the screenings at the theater have been sold out since it was released on July 21.
According to previous reports, seeing the film in 70mm is the way Nolan intended the film to be seen. The IMAX theater in Indianapolis is one of only 19 theaters in the country, and 30 in the world, with the capability to screen all 262,000 of the frames inside the 70mm reel of “Oppenheimer.”
“Oppenheimer,” starring Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, follows the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer and how the atomic bomb was developed. The movie, which is rated “R,” is Nolan’s latest since 2020’s “Tenet.”
According to its website, the showings are scheduled at 11:30 a.m., 3:15 p.m. and 7 p.m. on Aug. 10-16. The last screening, as of this story’s publication, is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. on Aug. 17 at the theater, located at 650 W. Washington St. in downtown Indianapolis.

2023-08-13 19:53:09+00:00,Your Much-Needed Guide To Navigating the Many Men of ‘Oppenheimer’,"So many men in 'Oppenheimer,' so little time to remember their character names or where you know them from so I'm here to help.","I’ve learned something in my life that has proven very useful to me: My knowledge of celebrities is not universal. Our Kaila Hale-Stern said to me after she saw Oppenheimer that she wished I was with her simply so I could tell her who everyone is and where she knew them from. It is, as the kids say, a gift. Maybe it is just because I had very little to do in high school and college and surrounded myself with other people who loved movies and actors but I just simply always knew who these people were and what roles they’d played in the past.
That’s why when everyone was suddenly on the Cillian Murphy train, I was shocked. Did you also not have a confusing experience watching the movie Red Eye back in 2005? Just me? Well, okay then.
I realized after my third viewing of Oppenheimer that I could be using this skill to good use. Mainly because after every single time I saw the movie, I heard people wondering who was who and why they knew them. I’m here to help. Focusing on mainly the men (because there are so many of them in this movie and because we all should know who Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are), let’s unpack how you know the cast of Oppenheimer.
Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer
(Universal Pictures)
A Christopher Nolan staple if there ever was one, Murphy began working with Nolan on Batman Begins and the two would go on to work on five other movies together, Oppenheimer included. But prior to his work with Nolan, Murphy was popular in his home country of Ireland before making the leap to Hollywood audiences. Batman Begins hit theaters two months before Red Eye did and the rest is history. If you weren’t a “Nolan bro” prior to seeing Oppenheimer, you probably saw Cillian Murphy in movies like Sunshine starring opposite Chris Evans and Michelle Yeoh or maybe you thought that guy with the beard in A Quiet Place Part II was hot.
For those who really don’t know why they knew him other than Oppenheimer, it’s probably Peaky Blinder. Playing Tommy Shelby, Murphy led the series throughout its entire run and the show was very popular and still is to this day. Chances are Shelby was your introduction to Murphy. If anyone other than me saw In the Heart of the Sea or In Time, then I’d be surprised but he was also in those. Point is: Murphy has been around.
Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss
(Universal Pictures)
C’mon. Like actually. If you were confused as to who was playing Lewis Strauss, I have to assume you were living under a rock for the last fifteen years. Only because Robert Downey Jr. was leading the charge over in the world of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Tony Stark. So acting like you don’t know who he is makes no sense. Prior to the MCU though, Downey also had a huge career spanning decades. Starting with a string of teen comedies in the ’80s and an emotionally raw performance in the 1987 film Less Than Zero, he went on to be a romantic lead in the 90s before his Oscar nomination in 1993 for his film Chaplin.
Point is: He’s been around. And is arguably one of the most recognizable people on the planet. Downey is the kind of actor who can transform himself for each role he takes on so if anyone was confused by how different he looks in Oppenheimer compared to his superhero counterpart, that could be at least a little understandable. Still, this is hopefully the role that gives him that Oscar win because he is so incredibly good as Lewis Strauss.
Rami Malek as David Hill
(Universal Pictures)
Speaking of Oscars, Rami Malek has one! Remember Bohemian Rhapsody? This is your Freddie Mercury! Malek became a fan favorite for his work on Mr. Robot, starring opposite Christian Slater in the hit USA series. He has since gone on to be the latest and last Bond villain for Daniel Craig’s turn as James Bond in No Time to Die as well as working with Robert Downey Jr. in his movie Dolittle.
Malek is in a lot of things but he is a somewhat newer presence for some audiences. Seeing him rise to prominence has been exciting to watch because Malek is so captivating on screen. If you need proof of this, look no further than his final moments in Oppenheimer when he swoops in to destroy what little hope Strauss had of having a seat on Eisenhower’s cabinet.
Benny Safdie as Edward Teller
(Universal Pictures)
Talk about a year! Benny Safdie is a filmmaker himself, most known for his work in his latest film with his brother Josh Safdie titled Uncut Gems. While Josh Safdie is typically behind the camera, Benny Safdie does a bit of both. It is why he has played two great roles so far this year. First, he played Herb Simon in the long-anticipated film Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret before heading into Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer as a fan favorite.
Before that, Safdie was also in his own movie starring opposite Robert Pattinson in Good Time and he also made his Paul Thomas Anderson debut in Licorice Pizza. For the Star Wars fans, you might also recognize him as Nari in the Disney+ series Obi-Wan Kenobi. He started to really make his mark in 2017 as an actor and filmmaker but he has recently shot to stardom for a good reason.
Jack Quaid as Richard Feynman
(Universal Pictures)
Where do I even start? Do you watch The Boys? Well, it’s Huey. Are you a Star Trek fan? Well, great. It’s Boimler. Are you a fan of romantic comedies from the 90s and early 00s? You probably know his parents then because Jack Quaid is famously the son of Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan. He’s also the guy who kills Rue in The Hunger Games so you probably hate him and don’t know why. Hope that helps with the anger you feel!
Quaid has been acting for a while and while he is part of the nepo baby conversation, he’s a very good actor so we let it slide. Now, he’ll probably be known for playing bongos after the Trinity Test (which was a very real thing that Richard Feynman did) but hey, at least he’s not going to be known as the villain from The Hunger Games anymore, right?
Matt Damon as Lt. Leslie Groves
(Universal Pictures)
Again, I don’t think anyone came out of Oppenheimer and wondered who Matt Damon was. The boy wonder who wrote Good Will Hunting (along with his friend Ben Affleck) while he was in college at Harvard around the age of 24 so let that sink in for you and your achievements. After the movie was released in 1997, Damon has continued to climb in Hollywood from working with Affleck (who he won an Oscar with for Good Will Hunting) to just being a leading man.
So what have you seen him in? That depends on what kind of movies you enjoy. He was in The Great Wall with Pedro Pascal so if you went through Pascal’s filmography, you at least saw him in that. He’s very funny so he’s been in films like Dogma as well as that movie where he buys a zoo. He’s also worked with Nolan before in Interstellar and he has been in space even more with films like The Martian. Maybe you know him from my favorite Martin Scorsese film because he is the best in The Departed. I don’t know man, it’s Matt Damon.
Devon Bostick as Seth Neddermeyer
(Universal Pictures)
Now I personally was a little too old for these movies when they came out but my little cousin loved them so I watched them with him. That is, of course, the Diary of a Wimpy Kid franchise. Devon Bostick played Rodrick Heffley, Greg’s older brother. So if you were a kid going to see those movies, it probably is a little weird to suddenly see Greg’s older brother as a serious scientist helping to build the first atomic bomb.
Bostick has also been in movies like Okja and he’s around but for the most part, the “why do I know that guy?” conversation is probably definitely centered around his work as Rodrick.
Josh Peck as Kenneth Bainbridge
(Universal Pictures)
Ah, my time as a young millennial woman is here. Josh Peck was a staple of my childhood. You know those Nickelodeon shows that are aimed for younger teens instead of little kids? That’s where Drake & Josh lived and I was 12 when the show began, the perfect age to watch a blended family come together to shine. Peck, after the show, grew up and was popular on Vine for a while before he really jumped back into the acting world with shows like How I Met Your Father.
He’s been around since at least 2004 for many of us but he has gone in and out of stardom. So seeing him in a big movie like Oppenheimer was a bit shocking, just because we’ve never really seen something like this from him in the past.
Josh Hartnett as Ernest Lawrence
(Universal Pictures)
Sometimes, being a young girl of the ’90s and early ’00s comes in handy in 2023. Josh Hartnett was a major heartthrob. Many of us were in love with him back in the late ’90s/early aughts and for about ten years, Hartnett was in everything. Pearl Harbor, Hollywood Homicide, The Virgin Suicides, Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, The Black Dahlia, Sin City, and more. He continued to work but not at the same pace as during his heartthrob era, so you may have seen him in less blockbustery movies like Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre by director Guy Ritchie. Still, many of us were in love with him and it feels great to have him back.
David Dastmalchian as William Borden
(Albert L. Ortega/Getty Images)
A character who comes in and destroys whatever peace that Robert Oppenheimer has found in himself, William Borden could have been played as a villain or as a man just trying to do his job. Luckily, David Dastmalchian brought nuance to the role as he does with all of his work. A true chameleon, you’ve definitely seen him before. Even this year, he was in The Boogeyman as Lester Billings as well as starring in Boston Strangler and most recently, The Last Voyage of the Demeter.
He’s been in quite a few superhero properties. He’s one of Scott Lang’s friends in Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp while playing Veb in Quantumania and Polka-Dot Man in James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad. No stranger to Christopher Nolan’s work, he was also in The Dark Knight. Dastmalchian is pretty much everywhere.
Gary Oldman as President Truman
(Dave Benett/Getty Images for Apple TV+)
One of the things that inspired me to write this piece was how many people didn’t recognize Gary Oldman. Showing up as President Truman after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he serves an important reminder for the film as a whole: Oppenheimer felt like he had blood on his hands and men like Truman wanted credit for killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people for power.
Oldman has been in Christopher Nolan movies before as Commissioner Gordon in his Batman trilogy. More than that, Oldman is constantly working. Whether it is Léon or his work as Sirius Black in the Harry Potter series, he’s around. You might have seen him as the villain of Air Force One or maybe you’re a fan of The Fifth Element. He’s been all over the place for decades.
Dane DeHaan as Major General Kenneth Nichols
(Universal Pictures)
Remember in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, when Andrew Garfield’s friend Harry showed up and became his Green Goblin? That’s Dane DeHaan. His roles are frankly all over the place in the best way because you could know him from anything. He starred in Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets as well as Kill Your Darlings, A Cure for Wellness, and the long-awaited film Tulip Fever.
For me, he also starred in A Place Beyond the Pines as Ryan Gosling’s son Jason when the film time-jumps. It’s a beautiful movie and one that highlights just how talented its cast is and was really a star moment for DeHaan. One that makes his work in Oppenheimer that much more menacing.
Alex Wolff as Luis Walter Alvarez

Are you a fan of The Naked Brothers Band? What about My Friend Dahmer? The Nic Cage movie Pig? Maybe you’re trapped on that beach that makes you age really fast (yes he was in Old). You could have also just gone down a rabbit hole with him and his brother Nat Wolff performing together. The pop-rock duo of the Wolff boys are all over and for good reason, they’re great! The confusion might come in when someone who doesn’t know them that well has to figure out if it is Alex or Nat Wolff you’re watching.
He was a fun scientist working with Lawrence in Oppenheimer but Alex Wolff has been all over the place with his work, most recently in the film The Line which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and was a great highlight of his work as an actor.
Kenneth Branagh as Niels Bohr
(Universal Pictures)
There are actors you see for the first time and then feel compelled to watch every single thing they’ve ever done after that. With Branagh, that first for me was Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, where he played Gilderoy Lockhart and it set me on a path to greatness consuming the rest of Kenneth Branagh’s works. If you are a fan of Shakespeare, you can probably thank Branagh for bringing a lot of his plays to the big screen.
Maybe you love the first Thor movie? That’s Kenneth Branagh’s direction. He’s been in Nolan’s films in the past like Tenet and Dunkirk and is a director all himself but his roles are always fully realized, brilliant, and very Branagh. Figuring out why you know him might be a solitary adventure but you’ve seen him in something, that’s for sure.
Jason Clarke as Roger Robb
(Universal Pictures)
The new most hated man in Christopher Nolan’s world. Jason Clarke played Roger Robb in Oppenheimer but he also has been all over the map with his career. Playing John Connor in Terminator Genisys, Clarke has been in Oscar nominated films like Zero Dark Thirty to iconic roles as George Wilson in Baz Luhrmann’s The Great Gatsby. He’s rarely the star of these projects, often bringing to life a secondary character that is very important to the plot, but he is great at what he does.
The more recent installment in Clarke’s career that people may recognize Pet Sematary, a remake of the classic Stephen King story. While he might not instantly be recognizable to some, his work stands for itself and you realize that you’ve seen a lot of his roles because he’s just so good at creating characters.
Michael Angarano as Robert Serber
(Universal Pictures)
Another “remember growing up watching his movies?” entry into the cast of Oppenheimer and Michael Angarano is definitely part of that. Starring in movies like Sky High and Almost Famous, Angarano was a staple in a lot of movies that younger millennials watched as kids. Since then, he’s been in shows like Minx as well as starring in The Stanford Prison Experiment.
Recently, he has begun directing projects as well but what you probably had the “what do I know him from?” moment with is something like Sky High.
Olivia Thirlby as Lilli Hornig
(Universal Pictures)
In the 2007 comedy Juno, the titular character (played by Elliot Page) had a quippy friend named Leah. 16 years later, Olivia Thirlby showed up in Oppenheimer and I was so excited to see her take on the men of the Manhattan Project and their veiled sexism regarding her abilities as a scientist. Thirlby though has been all over the map with her work, even working with Angarano in The Standford Prison Experiment back in 2015.
Somewhat of an indie film darling, Thirlby is one of those actresses that if you know her work, you love it. If not, you probably didn’t stop and think further about her except for the fact that everyone is in Oppenheimer and they’ve all been in films we know and love. Getting to see her in a Nolan movie excited me because I really did love her as Leah in Juno and hopefully this makes her a more sought-after performer.
Alden Ehrenreich as Senate Aide
(Universal Pictures)
Welcome to the Rachel Screams About Alden Ehrenreich Power Hour. Ehrenreich’s work is always impressive. No matter the size of his role, he commits. It is probably why his performance as Lewis Strauss’ Senate Aide is some of the best work in Oppenheimer. If you wonder where you’ve seen Ehrenreich before, might I point you in the direction of Solo: A Star Wars Story? He also has worked with the Coen Brothers in Hail, Caesar as well as starring in films like Beautiful Creatures, Stoker, and starring opposite Warren Beatty in Rules Don’t Apply.
His career isn’t exactly small but he’s still staking a claim with his work and he’s proven his ability as an actor over and over again. The thing people probably recognize him for though is playing a young Han Solo in the Star Wars universe and there’s nothing wrong with that. Hopefully, though, they go and enjoy other aspects of his filmography now that they’ve seen Oppenheimer.
James D’Arcy as Patrick Blackett
(Universal Pictures)
There is only one answer to this. (There are probably others but I don’t really care about those.) It’s Jarvis! James D’Arcy appears in Oppenheimer as Robert’s tutor who gives him a hard time (who Robert then tries to kill). Why fans might have paused at seeing D’Arcy on screen is twofold. It could be because you actually watched Agent Carter and saw the brilliance of James D’Arcy as Edwin Jarvis, the butler to Howard Stark who would go on to inspire Tony to name his A.I. after him.
The other? Well, he’s briefly in Avengers: Endgame when Steve Rogers and Tony Stark go back in time to the 70s and see Howard Stark before Tony is even born and Jarvis is there to pick Tony up from work. That’s where I know him best, though he’s built a career starring in things like Master and Commander as well as Broadchurch—but it is Jarvis for me.
Matthew Modine as Vannevar Bush
(Universal Pictures)
The younger audience knows Matthew Modine as Papa. But the reason he’s in Stranger Things at all is for his body of work in the 80s, which includes movies like Full Metal Jacket as well as Birdy and more. Modine has also worked with Christopher Nolan previously and if we know one thing about Nolan it is that if he’s worked with you once, he loves to do it again and so it wouldn’t be surprising if you know him from just working with Nolan in the past.
The thing is that Matthew Modine is so good that you kind of forget how evil he is in Stranger Things. Or maybe that’s just because he’s equally so good in Oppenheimer that you let the lingering thoughts of “Papa” fade.
David Krumholtz as Isidor Isaac Rabi
(Universal Pictures)
Look. This one is the moment, the reason people yell “WHAT?” out loud. This is my great joy in life to tell you if you don’t know already. But this man? This brilliant actor who is always on the top of his game and has recently been killing it with his work? This is Bernard the hot elf from the movie The Santa Clause. Yes, that one where Tim Allen accidentally makes Santa fall off a roof and has to take over as our Christmas gem.
David Krumholtz is having a renaissance. He was in a play called Leopoldstadt on Broadway and was brilliant and prior to that, he was on the show NUMB3RS. Still, where you probably know this man is The Santa Clause and I just think that’s neat.
Tony Goldwyn as Gordon Gray
(Cindy Ord/Getty Images)
Hello, Mr. President (from Scandal). In Oppenheimer, Goldwyn (yes of the MGMs) was one of the people deciding whether or not Robert “Oppy” Oppenheimer deserved to have his security clearance. What everyone knew him from before that though was the President in Scandal who was sleeping with Kerry Washington. He’s often in smaller roles in projects, like playing a coach for Venus and Serena Williams in King Richard as well as starring in the movie Plane.
He’s been in a lot of things and if you’re not a Scandal fan then maybe you’ve seen him in the Divergent movies. I know him from seeing him while I was in a taxi and going “I think that’s that guy from Scandal?” to the driver but that’s just me.
Scott Grimes as Strauss’ Counsel
(Amy Sussman/Getty Images)
Strauss’ other counsel was played by Scott Grimes, who was a little more open to understanding where Downey’s Strauss was coming from. While he is the kind of movies like the Critters franchise, Grimes is really known for a show that means a lot (funnily enough) to Star Trek fans. I’m talking about The Orville. A show made with love by Seth MacFarlane, who loves Trek, the series is a funny take on the world that Gene Roddenberry built.
Playing Lt. Gordon Malloy, it is arguably his most famous role. And hey, maybe I was the only one who saw him and thought to myself “Wait, I know him” but I do think Scott Grimes is very charming and funny. Seeing him in a Nolan movie? That was just a personal delight for me.
James Remar as Henry Stimson
(Dominik Bindl/Getty Images for Film at Lincoln Center)
Talk about an actor (trademark). James Remar has been in some classic movies. Mainly The Warriors, which I have a deep love for. But most people know him as Dexter Morgan’s father on the series Dexter. Part of The Fast and the Furious franchise as well, Remar is constantly working and bringing us amazing work to celebrate him for, whether or not you know him by name.
If you’re trying to remember now who he was in Oppenheimer, he’s the guy who said they couldn’t possibly pick Kyoto as a target to bomb because he had his honeymoon there. One of the most horrifying lines in the film and Remar delivered it with such sincerity that it stays with you.

,Oppenheimer Star Cillian Murphy Would Play Ken In A Barbie Sequel,"Speaking after the box office success of the ""Barbenheimer"" premiere weekend, 'Oppenheimer' star Cillian Murphy revealed if he'd play Ken in a 'Barbie' sequel.","The much-anticipated release of Barbie and Oppenheimer (dubbed “Barbenheimer”) sparked the cinematic event of the year, inspiring a wave of memes and some healthy competition as moviegoers rushed to watch both releases back-to-back. Now, as many fans contemplate a Barbie X Oppenheimer crossover, one of the film’s leading stars has revealed they would be open to the idea.
Speaking to Cinefilos, Oppenheimer's leading man Cillian Murphy responded “Yeah, let’s read the script. Let’s have a conversation” when asked if he’d consider playing the role of Ken in a future Barbie sequel. The actor went on to reveal that he has not yet watched the Greta Gerwig-directed film, but is very much looking forward to it. “I can’t wait to see the movie. I think it’s great for cinema. You know, we’ve got all these great movies happening this summer,” he added.
Although fans would likely scramble to witness Murphy’s “Ken-ergy” on the big screen, a potential Barbie follow-up is yet to be confirmed. However, the film’s director Gerwig previously told Variety that the idea of a Barbie follow-up would “certainly be exciting.” Meanwhile, TIME magazine also reported that Mattel CEO, Ynon Kreiz, showed “remarkable enthusiasm” for “more Barbie movies.”
Following the film’s premiere weekend success, appetite for a Barbie 2 among audiences appears to be at a fever pitch. The movie scored an impressive $377 million at the global box office during its opening weekend, becoming the biggest debut ever for a female-directed film.
As for Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, the biographical thriller earned a total of $174 million at the global box office, marking the first time one film opened with more than $100 million and another opened with more than $80 million on the same weekend.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c3RsZS5jb20vbGlmZS9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS13b3VsZC1wbGF5LWtlbi1iYXJiaWUtc2VxdWVs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-14 12:05:06-04:00,Could Oppenheimer’s Atomic Bomb Really Have Destroyed the World?,Scientists worried the atomic bomb might ignite the atmosphere and destroy the world.,"Almost exactly 78 years ago, on July 16, 1945, a group of scientists detonated a new kind of weapon in the New Mexico desert. That first atomic bomb test ushered in a new kind of warfare and a new, more frightening world. After having witnessed the first test, J. Robert Oppenheimer, often called the “father of the atomic bomb,” famously quoted a line of Hindu scripture from the Bhagavad-Gita: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”
RELATED: Oppenheimer First Reactions: Christopher Nolan's ""Stunning"" New Film Praised as A ""Total Knockout""
With any luck, none of us will ever see what Oppenheimer saw, firsthand, but we can go see it at the movies on Friday, July 21, 2023. Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, starring Cillian Murphy as the titular physicist, is based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s 2005 biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, which chronicles Oppenheimer's life and his involvement in the development of nuclear weapons.
When you split an atom, a process known as fission, the resulting release of energy is immensely powerful. When that reaction is safely contained, you can capture the released energy and use it to power toasters, lightbulbs, and television sets for millions of people. When uncontained, you can destroy just about anything. You might even be able — it was once believed — to destroy the world itself.
The scientists at the Manhattan Project were no slouches, they obviously knew what they were doing, but they were also playing with powerful forces at the fringes of human knowledge. A little bit of caution was warranted.
Here’s what they were dealing with.
Playing with Atomic Fire and the End of the World
When a neutron hits the nucleus of a radioactive uranium or plutonium isotope, it causes deformations in the nucleus from which the atom can’t recover. The atom splits in two, releasing a whole bunch of energy and radioactivity in the process. It also releases at least a couple of neutrons which, if you recall, are what caused the first atom to split. If there’s enough fissionable material nearby — referred to as a critical mass — then those released neutrons will hit another nucleus, causing another fission event, and so on in a chain reaction.
For an atomic bomb to work, you want this chain reaction to happen, but you don’t want it to go on forever.

Three years before the Manhattan Project's first nuclear test, a small group of physicists considered the idea that a nuclear explosion set off in the air might set off a chain reaction igniting the atmosphere. The notion was first suggested by physicist Edward Teller, who spoke with colleagues including Hans Bethe and, yes, Oppenheimer.
Teller’s concern, roughly speaking, was that the energy from the blast might be sufficient to fuse nitrogen in the atmosphere into carbon and oxygen. The idea sounds silly today (those are the sorts of fusion reactions that occur inside the cores of massive late-stage stars), but at the time no one was entirely sure what would happen when the bomb went off.
Physicists crunched the numbers and were pretty certain the atmosphere wouldn’t ignite. The math just didn’t work out. In fact, before the test, Enrico Fermi casually offered a bet that a couple of scientists reportedly took. The attitude surrounding the possibility of fire in the sky was, apparently, casual.
Still, the possibility was taken seriously and investigated thoroughly. Arthur Compton, a Nobel Prize-winning physicists once said of the question, “It would be the ultimate catastrophe. Better to accept the slavery of the Nazis than to run the chance of drawing the final curtain on mankind!” He only agreed to the test after calculating the odds of a runaway reaction at less than one in 3 million, per Scientific American.
There’s more than one way to destroy the world
Of course, we got the answer in time. The first test didn’t ignite the sky, nor did the subsequent tests or the wartime detonations over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Still, the threat of nuclear detonation remains very real.
We have, so far, avoided all-out nuclear war. In fact, after the detonations at Nagasaki and Hiroshima during World War II, no nuclear weapon has ever again been deployed against human beings. However, until there is full-fledged nuclear disarmament, the threat of the end of the world will remain.
In addition to the primary effects of the explosion, there would be downstream consequences of global nuclear war that would reshape the face of the planet for the worse. Recently, a group of scientists ran simulations on a number of different nuclear conflicts to see what would happen. They simulated small regional wars with a relatively small number of detonations between neighboring nations and a global nuclear war with thousands of detonations all over the planet. In every case, explosions released enough soot and smoke into the air to block out the Sun.

In that case, temperatures would drop more than 10 degrees on average across the world. Crops would fail and populations of wild plants and animals would diminish. In short, the total available resources on our planet would plummet, and the loss of human life would be staggering. Scientists estimate losses counted in the billions.
There isn’t a nuclear bomb on Earth that could actually destroy the world, but they could destroy the world as we know it. And that’s pretty much the same thing.

2023-07-28 09:50:14+00:00,A Manhattan Project historian comments on ‘Oppenheimer’,"Although Nolan’s film is not technically accurate throughout, the adjustments in 'Oppenheimer' are made for understandable artistic reasons, writes an historian of the Manhattan Project.","J. Robert Oppenheimer (as portrayed by actor Cillian Murphy) points to buildings of the Los Alamos Laboratory in a scene from Christopher Nolan's film 'Oppenheimer' (Image courtesy of Universal Pictures)
With any film about a historical event, one can expect portions of the movie will be accurate and others modified for theatrical purposes. Those who are familiar with the story of the Manhattan Project and of the life of its chief scientist, J. Robert Oppenheimer, will have a slightly different lens to view Christopher Nolan’s adaption of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book, American Prometheus, written by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. I leave it to professional critics to discuss the merits of the film, which overall I found excellent, and will give a slightly closer look at some technical details shown in the film.
Nolan walked the fine line of providing enough technical details to tell the story of the Manhattan Project, but not as much as to require a college degree in physics to understand what was happening. Some of the film’s simplifications were done by almost completely ignoring the work performed at other Manhattan Project’s sites—namely at Hanford, Washington, and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Their only mention was in reference to their production of fissionable materials, as Oppenheimer drops representative marbles into glass bowls. From all my readings about the subject, this scene was purely fictional, but it did convey very well the challenge the project faced as it raced to produce enough materials for the weapons Oppenheimer and his fellow scientists were developing at the Los Alamos Laboratory. I think the sense of the scale of the Manhattan Project is probably not palpable from the film.
For many viewers, one of the “surprises” is probably the scene of Oppenheimer poisoning the apple for Patrick Blackett, his tutor at Cambridge. Unless you have a collection of books about Oppenheimer’s life on your bookshelf, this event is usually one that is not often told and certainly one that looked fictional. But, as surreal as it looks, this event did happen, and the only uncertainty was the exact poison that he used. Since Potassium Cyanide is a poison known to most moviegoers, Nolan made the choice to use that as a clear indicator of what was occurring. As to Oppenheimer being introduced to Niels Bohr by his mentor at Cambridge, Patrick Blackett, it is incorrect. That introduction was made via Ernest Rutherford, the head of the Cambridge Lab, in the spring of 1926. The conversation between them that follows, however, is factual.
Nolan’s film also tends to distort the Bohr-Heisenberg connection. For those unaware, there was a meeting in September 1941 in Copenhagen between the two scientists. What happened at the meeting is still debated to this day: Was Heisenberg warning Bohr that Germany believed it could make an atomic weapon? Or was he hoping that Bohr might prevent the United States from pursuing the development of an atomic bomb to be used against Germany? After Bohr’s dramatic escape (which is partially told in the film), he would have lent more insight to the key figures as to his understanding of the German program.
As for the accuracy of the film’s depiction of the Trinity test itself, Nolan decided early on that he would not use computer generated imagery (CGI) for the explosion, but rather practical effects. For too long, audiences have been conditioned to hear and see a nuclear explosion as one simultaneous event. But Nolan’s Trinity explosion is correct: A light “brighter than a thousand suns” flashes across the screen and, seconds later, the tremendous roar and blast wave reaches the observers. (To see the actual footage of the Trinity test and sound delay, I recommend watching the documentary, Trinity and Beyond.) However, I was expecting to see how the mushroom cloud form and grow, which is to experts a very familiar shape, but that did not occur in the film. For most viewers, though, this omission will go unnoticed. I did like the fact Nolan included initially moving the mattresses under the Gadget while it was first being lifted up the test tower. This was a nice factual detail for those who caught it.
A minor issue I had was with Donald Hornig and the kill switch. Hornig, a Harvard trained physicist, was the one who designed the high-voltage capacitors that were needed for the implosion to be triggered. I am not certain that this switch was actually a big red button, however perfect for the screen. I had read instead that he actually had his hand on the switch—not near it—as he was well aware of the fast reaction time he would need to stop the test.
Nolan did capture many of the events that actually occurred at Compania Hill (an observation point located about 20 miles northwest of ground zero), from Edward Teller applying sunscreen to Ernest Lawrence initially wanting to watch it from inside the car. (Richard Feynman remained in the car and was probably the only person to view the test directly.) I did find, however, the film’s over-emphasis on the atmospheric ignition debate a bit too much. I do not recall ever reading that Oppenheimer spoke with Einstein about this issue. First, that was not Einstein’s area of expertise. Second, that would have been a big security breach as well. It was Hans Bethe who first confirmed that the probabilities for an atomic bomb explosion to ignite the atmosphere and destroy the world were “near zero” (nothing is ever zero in quantum mechanics). The calculations were checked again by another physicist, Emil Konopinski, who would later suggest the use of tritium as a fuel for the hydrogen bomb.
The film skips back and forth through time as it weaves its story. This gets complicated when the film covers both Oppenheimer’s Atomic Energy Commission security hearing, which occurred in 1954, and Strauss’ congressional confirmation hearing in 1959. I suspect many viewers may have believe these events happened in parallel.
Another questionable scene was the ending of the post-war meeting between President Truman and Oppenheimer. In the film, we hear Truman telling Dean Acheson, his State Secretary, that he never wants to see this “crybaby” again. Truman actually made his comment about Oppenheimer almost a year after their meeting in a letter to Acheson. Truman’s reaction to Oppenheimer’s “blood on my hands” lament is also a bit murky, as the accounts of the meeting have changed over time. However, the intent of the response from Truman is correct.
The last comment I have on the film is more about how little was truly shown regarding the horrors of dropping the atomic bombs over Japan. Viewers only get one scene at Los Alamos, in which it looks like Robert Serber—who had gone to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to document the bombings—appears to present a slideshow of photographs to the scientists. But none of that imagery is shown to the viewers. Instead, we see Oppenheimer’s own reaction to those images—an obvious deliberate choice by the film director. The closest we get to seeing the reality of the atomic bombings is when, leaving the presentation, Oppenheimer steps into a charred corpse during a nightmarish sequence. For those familiar with the unclassified photos from Hiroshima, this corpse looked very close to one of those photos of a charred victim.
Nolan’s film cannot be considered technically accurate throughout. But for any Hollywood adaption, adjustments must be made. Overall, I think the film is close enough to the historical events, and most of the adjustments made were for understandable artistic reasons. I am sure other technical elements will pop up to my eyes—and those of other experts—after watching this immensely dense film again.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYnVsbGV0aW4ub3JnLzIwMjMvMDcvYS1tYW5oYXR0YW4tcHJvamVjdC1oaXN0b3JpYW4tY29tbWVudHMtb24tb3BwZW5oZWltZXIv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVidWxsZXRpbi5vcmcvMjAyMy8wNy9hLW1hbmhhdHRhbi1wcm9qZWN0LWhpc3Rvcmlhbi1jb21tZW50cy1vbi1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
02:34.6,'Barbie' vs. 'Oppenheimer': Who will win the box office battle?,,"It's a big week for Hollywood with the release of two blockbusters that have collectively become known as ""Barbenheimer"": “Barbie,” about the iconic Mattel doll; and “Oppenheimer,” about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man often called the father of the atomic bomb.
One makes the shiny, pink, plastic world of Barbie come to life; the other explores what led to the real-life tragedy unleashed by America’s use of the atomic bomb on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.
The two movies seem like opposites, at least on the surface. But are they?
“I think that it's exciting to have such a dissonant initial impression of the diametrically opposed theatrical experience,” Sarah G. Vincent, who writes about film for Cambridge Day, In Between Drafts and other outlets, told GBH’s Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel on Morning Edition Wednesday. “But I actually think when they go to the theaters, it's not going to feel like that.”
For the uninitiated: In April 2022, studios announced that director Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” would open the same day as director Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer.”
Some of the social media-driven excitement was about the difference in aesthetics: Barbie’s glamorous, shiny and highly-saturated magenta world juxtaposed against Oppenheimer’s darker tones.

People started getting excited about which film would find more commercial success, Vincent said. Nolan has a history of dominating summer box offices with releases like his Batman movies and “Interstellar.”
“This seems like almost a no-brainer, he's going to win. Maybe the odds are in his favor,” Vincent said. “I've been rooting for Greta Gerwig, who's the underdog in this race. But I also think — and this is going to be an unpopular hot take — [Gerwig] is the better filmmaker, because her movies are actually really empathetic and on a human level.”
It’s hard to tell which film will come out on top, she said. Both have definite draws, albeit for different audiences.
But they also may have more in common than meets the eye, Vincent said.
“The movies may deal with similar thorny human issues, and 'Barbie' might be deeper than everyone's expecting. And maybe 'Oppenheimer' will be the lighter movie,” she said. “I don't know how it's going to play out in the actual theaters, but I do think 'Barbie' might surprise. The fan base may not be expecting what they get from Greta Gerwig.”
She emphasized that “Barbie” might be a bit darker than people are expecting.
“I have a feeling it's going to be parents with their kids, in for a bit of a surprise,” she said.
There are also the die-hard film fans embarking on what’s being called ""Barbenheimer"" movie days, seeing both movies, one after the other. GBH’s Morning Edition co-host Jeremy Siegel plans to be among them.
But in the battle of Barbenheimer opening weekend, most people will opt for a third choice: Staying home.
Movie theater attendance is just not what it once was. Some audience members are more comfortable at home, on their own couches with their own reasonably-priced popcorn, and no summer blockbuster will lure them back into a movie theater.
“I don't think this is what's going to tempt them to necessarily come outside,” Vincent said. “But for the people who are reliable Christopher Nolan fans and the people who like Barbie, they're going to come out.”
Further complicating the weekend box office is the fact that the star actors are on strike with the Screen Actors Guild, meaning they cannot promote their projects until major studios reach an agreement with the union.
Still, movie theaters have not had an opening weekend with this much buzz in a long time.
“When I went to 'Barbie,' I wore different shades of pink,” Vincent said. “And I don't usually do that. I'm usually kind of incognito in, like, the grayest, darkest thing. So that was a nice contrast. Maybe I'll continue it for the 'Oppenheimer' screening.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndnYmgub3JnL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy0wNy0xOS9iYXJiaWUtdnMtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItd2hvLXdpbGwtd2luLXRoZS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWJhdHRsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Based on the novel, ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,"" the film follows the story of Julius Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy) a theoretical physicist and director of the laboratory responsible for the development of the atomic bomb.
But for those unfamiliar with atomic history (or maybe those more familiar with the characters in the upcoming ""Barbie"" movie, instead), here’s what to know about the man on which the film is based, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb.”
'Oppenheimer':Christopher Nolan made his new movie because he thought he'd die in a nuclear Armageddon
Where was Oppenheimer born?
Oppenheimer was born in New York, in 1904 to German immigrant and wealthy textile importer, Julius Oppenheimer and painter Ella Friedman Oppenheimer, according to the National Parks Service, which described him as a quiet child, studying mineralogy and writing poetry.
Where did Oppenheimer go to college?
Oppenheimer was admitted to Harvard University but postponed his enrollment due to illness, according to the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History.
After enrolling in 1922, he studied physics, chemistry, Latin, Greek and eastern philosophy at Harvard before traveling to the University of Cambridge where he studied two terms, per the school. He then transferred to the University of Göttingen where he earned a doctorate in physics, according to the nuclear museum.

He then returned to the United States to teach physics at the University of California at Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology. There he conducted research on black holes and neutron stars. He worked alongside experimental physicist and Noble Prize winner Ernest Lawrence, played by Josh Hartnett in the film.
Oppenheimer's wife, children
He married Katherine “Kitty” Puening (played by Emily Blunt in the upcoming movie) in 1940 and had two children, Peter and Toni, according to the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History.

What role did Oppenheimer serve in the Manhattan Project? What was Los Alamos?
Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico, a key location in the ""Oppenheimer"" movie, was a lab responsible for the top-secret design and production of atomic bombs. Part of the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos (or Project Y as it was known at the time) was greenlit in 1942, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. It was then that General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project (played by Matt Damon), selected Oppenheimer to lead the project, and the pair began planning.
They selected a remote location surrounded by mountains to build a secret town where scientists and their families could live, according to the National Parks Service. There, hundreds of scientists and engineers developed the Gadget (the world’s first nuclear test device), Little Boy (the uranium-fueled atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan), and Fat Man (the plutonium-fueled atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan).

The Oppenheimer hearing
In 1954, during the era of McCarthyism, the Atomic Energy Commission called Oppenheimer to testify on his past involvement with communist organizations, due to fears that he was a Soviet spy.
It is unclear if Oppenheimer was ever a part of the Communist Party, but he was sympathetic to communist goals, according to the Atomic Heritage Foundation's nuclear museum. He became acquainted with leftist politics through his turbulent love affair with communist and medical student Jean Tatlock (played by Florence Pugh in the film) and was fueled by anger toward the oppression his Jewish relatives were suffering in Nazi Germany. Oppenheimer’s brother, Frank Oppenheimer, joined the Communist Party in 1937.
Oppenheimer’s communist ties were scrutinized when he was selected to partake in the Manhattan Project, but he was approved with the support of General Groves, the museum notes.
Oppenheimer testified for 27 hours in 1954 to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) according to the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History. In the end, his security clearance was revoked.
Sixty years after his hearing, the U.S. Department of Energy released the full, declassified transcript of the hearing.
Oppenheimer: Hydrogen bombs vs. atomic bombs
After the Soviet Union successfully tested nuclear weaponry in 1949 and U.S. turned attention to advancing its nuclear arms, Oppenheimer resisted the development of fusion weapons (like the hydrogen bomb) instead of fission weapons (like the atomic bomb) for concerns that the weapons would only be used on human populations, according to the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History.
J. Robert Oppenheimer death
In 1967, Oppenheimer died in Princeton, New Jersey, of throat cancer, according to the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History.

What to know about other 'Oppenheimer' characters in real life
Leslie Groves Jr.: Played by Matt Damon in the film, Groves was appointed to head the Manhattan Project in 1942 and worked alongside Oppenheimer. He was reportedly known for his stubbornness, egotism, intelligence, and abrasive nature, according to the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History. He fiercely defended Oppenheimer during the AEC hearing.
Jean Tatlock: Played by Florence Pugh in the film, Jean Tatlock (1914-1944) was an American psychologist and Communist Party member. For several years, she maintained a relationship with Oppenheimer, who she met while studying at the Stanford University Medical School. Oppenheimer proposed to Tatlock twice, although she declined both times, according to the nuclear museum.
Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer: Played by Emily Blunt, “Kitty” Oppenheimer married J. Robert Oppenheimer in 1939. She was a trained botanist forced to put her career on hold when moving to Los Alamos with her husband. She served as an important confidant for Oppenheimer, per the museum.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L21vdmllcy8yMDIzLzA3LzEyL2otcm9iZXJ0LW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWRlYXRoLWNoaWxkcmVuLXdpZmUvNzAzOTk0NTkwMDcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Cillian Murphy nearly played Oppenheimer on TV almost a decade ago,"Cillian Murphy is the star of Christopher Nolan's latest box office hit, but he very well could've been in the same role on the small screen.","But it turns out that it may not have been Murphy's only brush with playing the American scientist, as it turns out that Murphy was also considered to play Oppenheimer in TV series Manhattan.

Speaking about their time on the series, Lila Byock (The Leftovers), a writer on Manhattan and wife of series creator Sam Shaw (Castle Rock), told Vanity Fair: “When we were casting Oppenheimer, we went through a whole series of different ideas.”
Shaw said: “We wanted Oppenheimer to feel both like he possessed a certain undeniable charisma, a presence onstage, but also that he was playing a different instrument. He needed to feel alien, or other, in some ways.”
He then revealed: “Cillian Murphy was on that list.”
“It still smarts that we didn’t get to tell the story in its fullness as we had hoped,” Shaw added.

The short-lived show premiered on WGN America back in 2014 and was named after The Manhattan Project, which produced the first atomic weapons. The show wasn't intended to be historically accurate, but focused on fictional character Frank Winter (played by John Benjamin Hickey), a physics professor who led the Manhattan Project.
Although he wasn't a main character for the first season, J Robert Oppenheimer appeared in the first instalment and held a meatier role in season 2, although that was to be the last run for the series as a whole. Although Murphy wasn't part of the series, the Manhattan TV role was played by actor Daniel London.

TV series possibilities aside, Murphy continues to be at the forefront of critical acclaim for Nolan's recent cinematic marvel, with fellow Oppenheimer actors Emily Blunt and Matt Damon stating that Murphy was the perfect man for the role.
Chatting exclusively to RadioTimes.com, Blunt said of Murphy's portrayal: ""When I read the script, I found him to have so much duality to him.
""And he was sort of the perfect actor to play him because Cillian is so mesmeric in that way, and I think I was uncertain as to what his feelings on it were, and how much he was atoning for his sins by playing the martyr at the end, or how much he was truly traumatised by it.
More like this
""I think it's the delicacy of Cillian's performance when I watched it – he's such a tragic figure to me, that I wasn't expecting to feel so pulled into him and feel for him.""
Damon added of Oppenheimer: ""He lived the most consequential life and there were no easy answers for him, or for us, in kind of investigating his story. And so yeah, I think Cillian was the exact person to play him for sure.""
Oppenheimer is available to watch in UK cinemas now. Check out more of our Film coverage or visit our TV Guide to see what's on tonight.

However, there is only one movie theater in the Mile High City where you can watch ""Oppenheimer"" on 35mm film.","DENVER (KDVR) — Movie fanatics all over the globe are preparing for July 21 when the two most highly anticipated blockbusters premiere in theaters, “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.” However, there is only one movie theater in the Mile High City where you can watch “Oppenheimer” on 35mm film.
The Sie FilmCenter located off of Colfax Avenue in the Congress Park neighborhood is the only theater in Denver where you can catch Christopher Nolan’s latest film on 35mm. A film shown in this format is described as, “35mm anamorphic film screenings project light through the entire 35-millimeter frame to deliver clear, high-resolution images with rich analog color combined with state-of-the-art digital sound in most locations.”
“Oppenheimer” follows the story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II. So, watching the film on 35mm adds to the novelty of that time period.
According to Kodak, 35mm film was invented around 1890 and used in 1936. Having the ability to watch “Oppenheimer” on film that was used in the same time period it was set in gives it more realism.
The Jacob Burns Film Center describes watching films on 35mm as “a more accurate representation of the actual scene.” The footage gives a more subtle and accurate depiction of the images.
Of course, you can see this summer’s blockbuster in IMAX which has a resolution almost 10 times more than a 35mm projector, but Sie FilmCenter is giving moviegoers a chance to step back into the past.
So, if you want to see “Oppenheimer” on 35mm, you can purchase tickets on Sie’s website.
The film has showings from Thursday, July 20 through Thursday, July 27.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8va2R2ci5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9ob3cteW91LWNhbi13YXRjaC1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1vbi0zNW1tLWZpbG0taW4tZGVudmVyL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8va2R2ci5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9ob3cteW91LWNhbi13YXRjaC1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1vbi0zNW1tLWZpbG0taW4tZGVudmVyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,‘Oppenheimer’ movie about the man behind the atomic bomb has Oak Ridge connections,A thriller directed by Christopher Nolan that tells the story about “the father of the atomic bomb” has an interesting history with Oak Ridge.,"The story of J. Robert Oppenheimer is a cautionary tale.
Director Christopher Nolan’s film “Oppenheimer,” which opens this week, is a thriller about the physicist's role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Or as Universal Pictures puts it, a story about ""the enigmatic man who must risk destroying the world in order to save it.”
Under Oppenheimer’s leadership, the Y-12 National Security Complex Oak Ridge was instrumental in the development of the atomic bomb, making the rural area in East Tennessee known worldwide and earning him the title of ""father of the atomic bomb.""
Oppenheimer in Oak Ridge
J. Robert Oppenheimer was selected in 1942 to lead the secret research and development of the first atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
The Y‑12 plant was built to make enough enriched uranium for the bomb. Oak Ridge was a perfect site for this operation because of its remote location and sparse population and because it could efficiently be powered by the Tennessee Valley Authority, the National Park Service notes.
Oppenheimer visited Y-12 several times during the project and worked with Major General Kenneth Nichols (played in the movie by actor Dane DeHaan), who oversaw construction and operation of the plant, according to Oak Ridge historian D. Ray Smith.
He even sent his brother, Frank Oppenheimer (played by Dylan Arnold), to Y-12 in 1944 and 1945 to monitor the plant’s equipment. Frank had experience with uranium isotope separation.
Oak Ridge references in the ‘Oppenheimer’ movie
Despite their contributions to the Manhattan Project, don’t expect many Y-12 or Oak Ridge references in the “Oppenheimer” movie. The plot largely takes place at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, and most filming occurred in and around Los Alamos and Santa Fe, New Mexico, according to the National Park Service.
However, key Y-12 figures will appear onscreen, including Nichols, Frank Oppenheimer and Ernest Lawrence, who created a device to separate uranium and went to Oak Ridge to accelerate developments at Y-12.
When to watch ‘Oppenheimer’ in Knoxville
“Oppenheimer” will premiere in Knoxville and Oak Ridge July 20, a day before its nationwide release. Showtimes as early as 5 p.m. are available atRegal cinema locations and Cinemark Tinseltown in Oak Ridge.

The film is written and directed by Christopher Nolan (“Dunkirk,” “The Dark Night” trilogy) and has an A-list cast, starring Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, plus Matt Damon (Leslie Groves), Emily Blunt (Kitty Oppenheimer), Robert Downey Jr. (Lewis Strauss), Florence Pugh (Jean Tatlock) and Josh Hartnett (Ernest Lawrence).
“Oppenheimer” is based on the biography “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” and is targeting a $40 million opening weekend at the box office, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

2023-07-29 19:15:39+00:00,'Oppenheimer' Star Addresses MCU Involvement - Inside the Magic,"In a recent interview, an 'Oppenheimer' star addresses the rumors of their possible involvement in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","Now that Oppenheimer has exploded at the box office, with an opening week return of $173.8 million, many are praising the performances of the film’s cast across the board. Of course, lead Cillian Murphy is getting much of the acclaim due to his genuine and layered portrayal of theoretical physicist and father of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer.
Murphy has been the subject of much speculation after his performance, with many fans suggesting other roles and films he would be a good fit for. DC fans have already claimed Murphy as a possible candidate for the upcoming DC Cinematic Universe, DC Studio’s upcoming rebooted film universe spearheaded by former Marvel alum, James Gunn. Recently, Murphy’s original audition for Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins (2005) has resurfaced on the internet, igniting a call for Murphy to take on the role of Batman himself for the Batman: The Brave and the Bold adaptation.
Murphy is no stranger to the Batman franchise, having lost out on the role of the Caped Crusader in the Dark Knight trilogy but earning the role of Batman’s nemesis, Scarecrow. His audition has gained him a lot of attention, with many fans calling for him to finally take on the role. However, at the moment, there seems to be no casting going on for the next Batman film due in large part to the Hollywood strikes going on. However, Marvel fans have thrown their hat into the ring, calling for Murphy to join the other major superhero studio.
Since Marvel’s Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness (2022) introduced a multiverse variant of Mister Fantastic on screen, Kevin Feige has confirmed that a Fantastic Four feature film is in the works, although not much is yet known about the film or potential cast. However, the iconic Fantastic Four franchise wouldn’t be complete without its arch-nemesis, Doctor Doom. While there have not been any official castings yet, fans believe they have found the ideal actor to embody the menacing Doctor Doom in Cillian Murphy.
Doom is a Marvel supervillain leading the fictional country of Latveria. Doom is one of the most well-known villains of the Marvel Universe, but since his first appearance in The Fantastic Four #5, he is most known as a direct antagonist of the Fantastic Four. The character played a pivotal role in the 2005 version of Fantastic Four, as well as the sequel, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007).
Cillian Murphy’s extensive acting career and remarkable versatility make him a compelling choice for the role of Doctor Doom. He already has experience playing a villain in Nolan’s Dark Knight Batman trilogy, and it’s clear that fans think he deserves to be featured in a franchise. With his exceptional portrayal in Oppenheimer, Murphy has proven he’s ready for bigger starring roles.
He addressed the rumors surrounding a potential MCU role, saying that for him, “it’s always about the script…if someone sends a script, I’ll read it. And you never know what turns up.” It doesn’t confirm or deny a future working with Marvel, but gives fans hope that they may see Murphy rejoining the comic book movie genre sometime soon.

Christopher Nolan may have a cell phone ban on the set of his movies, but Emily Blunt says her experience working on the director's latest film, ""Oppenheimer,"" was a lot lighter than one may imagine.
""I think people would imagine it was terribly intense and we all walked around saying we are making an important movie with a capital 'I,' but it didn't feel like that,"" Blunt told Josh Horowitz on the ""Happy, Sad, Confused"" podcast when asked what it was like working on the Universal Pictures' biopic.
""It felt very warm and fun and joyful even though there's the inevitable intimidation factor of working with Chris Nolan and the awareness that you're gonna have to tighten the screws on yourself,"" Blunt said.
Blunt said Nolan creates a ""rather casual attitude"" on set, even when filming the biggest of scenes.

""Oppenheimer,"" which has now grossed over $419 million worldwide, tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) and his involvement in the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II.
Blunt plays Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty, who juggles raising two children while nursing a substance addiction.
""She was so fiery. She was so complicated — riddled with demons herself — and I think it's so cool to play someone who's sort of at war with herself really and a non-conformist for the 1950s housewife ideal,"" Blunt said of playing the character who isn't afraid to defend her husband when no one else will against a corrupt security clearance hearing late in the film.

2023-07-31 18:02:19+00:00,How the Mushroom Cloud Boomed and Bloomed Across American Pop Culture,"From the Trinity test to “Oppenheimer” and “Asteroid City,” the symbol of nuclear destruction has held multiple but equally disturbing meanings.","And yet something so novel and dazzling couldn’t help but make its way into popular culture. If the Bikini test could inspire the name of a swimsuit, then of course the mushroom cloud would be picked up as a titillating marketing gimmick. A few beauty queens were deployed as “Miss Atomic Bomb” and the like, wearing mushroom-shaped headgear or swimwear, part of a general fad for atomic-themed kitsch (as memorably chronicled in the documentary “The Atomic Cafe”). The Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce offered calendars with detonation times for watching the mushroom clouds from desert tests. In Wes Anderson’s desert-set “Asteroid City,” characters also observe an atomic test on the horizon, trooping out of a diner to watch with nonchalance.
But a golden era of sci-fi movies in the 1950s ensured that the deadly possibilities of the atomic age were also explored in vivid visual fashion. These mushroom clouds directly addressed new sources of anxiety: the arms race (set off after the Soviets’ 1949 atomic test), the effects of radiation, and the hydrogen bomb and its even bigger boom. Monster and alien movies (and sci-fi book covers) featured the cloud as a modern Pandora’s box, a foolish unleashing of unknown forces.
From early on, it could signify the unthinkable — the erasure of civilization — as in Arch Oboler’s movie “Five” (1951), which opens with explosions and a montage of historical monuments. The cloud could represent the beginning or the end (to echo the title of a 1947 docudrama about Oppenheimer). It might be the prelude to a plot about surviving the aftermath of a nuclear blast, or the doomsday finale to a story that has gone very, very wrong. Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove,” from 1964, falls into the second category, concluding with a montage using footage from explosions (including the Trinity test).
But Kubrick alters our understanding of the mushroom clouds with the ironic usage of Vera Lynn singing “We’ll Meet Again,” originally a British World War II standard. Viewed silently, the explosions might have induced the usual dread, an emotion that in a way also fed back into awe and fear of military prowess. Kubrick’s peerless satire redirects our focus toward those in power, the absurd-sounding game-theory strategies at work, and the self-serving vanities involved — including the image of Slim Pickens riding the bomb, bronco-style, American soldier as cowboy.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMzEvbW92aWVzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWFzdGVyb2lkLWNpdHktbXVzaHJvb20tY2xvdWQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Oppenheimer viewers had no idea President Truman was played by Gary Oldman,"Gary Oldman appeared in Oppenheimer, but fans have only just noticed his role in Christopher Nolan's new historical blockbuster","People who have been to see Oppenheimer at the cinema have only just realised that Gary Oldman was in it.
Obviously, Christopher Nolan’s historical epic has an absolutely stellar cast, with Cillian Murphy taking on the title role of scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer.
Murphy is joined in the ensemble by Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, and Robert Downey Jr. to name but a few.

However, one actor managed to go unspotted by a lot of people who have seen the movie, despite that fact he plays a key figure in the whole saga.
Admittedly, he’s not a main character, but he’s still the US president.
It’s Gary Oldman, playing Harry S. Truman.

It turns out that loads of people just didn’t realise he was in the film at all, let alone right in front of their faces playing one of the most significant politicians of the 20th century.
Oldman has previous for this sort of thing, too.
If you remember, a few years ago he completely transformed his appearance for his role in Darkest Hour, playing the UK’s Second World War Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

He won an Oscar for that portrayal, and while he’s unlikely to be considered by the Academy for this performance, a lot of people were shocked and intrigued to see that he featured in this latest historical blockbuster.
One fan gushed: “Am I the only one who didn't realise that PRESIDENT TRUMAN in OPPENHEIMER was played by GARY OLDMAN?
“Absolutely freaking amazing actor!!”
Another person said: “I just learned Gary Oldman played Harry S. Truman in Oppenheimer.”

A third said: “Tell me why I needed to watch Oppenheimer twice to recognise who Gary Oldman is playing”
And so on and so forth.
Oldman has worked with Nolan in the past, as the now-65-year-old was in his Dark Knight trilogy, as future commissioner James Gordon.
Nolan and Oldman kept his appearance in this latest movie under wraps for a good while, with Oldman only revealing himself on the red carpet when the film was premiered.

In the movie, Oldman appears as an incredibly pleased US president, who congratulates a distraught and guilt-ridden Oppenheimer on the success of his newly-created weapon of mass destruction.
Oppenheimer goes on to state that he has ‘blood on his hands’, a comment that reportedly annoyed Truman at their real-life meeting after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

2023-07-25 19:34:12+00:00,The Technocrats of Silicon Valley ‘Don’t Get’ Oppenheimer,"Christopher Nolan's blockbuster thriller ""Oppenheimer"" failed to impress the tech leaders of Silicon Valley like Sam Altman and Elon Musk.","Christopher Nolan’s blockbuster thriller Oppenheimer has received rave reviews from film critics and audiences alike since its release on Friday (July 21). But the biopic about WWII physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer has apparently failed to impress the science-minded tech leaders of Silicon Valley.
“I was hoping that the Oppenheimer movie would inspire a generation of kids to be physicists but it really missed the mark on that,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman tweeted on Saturday (July 22). Altman then drew reference to The Social Network, a 2010 film based on the story of Mark Zuckerberg and the creation of Facebook, saying the movie successfully inspired many aspiring startup founders like himself.
“Indeed,” responded Elon Musk, unimpressed with Oppenheimer. Also on Saturday, the Tesla CEO tweeted an image depicting a viewer scrolling through TikTok while watching the movie in a theater captioned, “This Oppenheimer movie is way too long.”
Indeed — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 22, 2023
Altman’s and Musk’s comments spurred mixed reactions online. The discussion was centered around whether Oppenheimer is more about the science behind the creation of atomic bombs or the moral and political conundrum facing the scientist tasked with it.
“I can honestly say that in no way, shape, or form did I think even one second that movie was intended to inspire kids to become physicists. [I don’t know] what Sam was thinking,” tweeted tech founder Ryan Wollner in response to Altman.
Walter Isaacman, author and Musk biographer, would like to see more science in the movie, too. “It would have been useful to include more of the science that they did,” he commented.
But that would be truly missing the point of the story, according to some viewers. “There’s a reason the Promethean myth begins the movie,” tweeted Pat Kane, a consultant based in the U.K., referring to the film’s opening scene. “Indeed, the whole thing can seem a caution against the ontological delirium that an obsession with physics induces.”
As for Nolan himself, the writer and director likely didn’t make the film with any intention whatsoever.
“When you talk about intention, I would resist the characterization perhaps because I don’t think films work well when they are overly didactic, when they are trying to send a very specific message,” Nolan told physicist Brian Cox in an interview for Esquire last week. “The interesting thing, the dramatic thing about stories is there’s no easy answers. You are asking troubling questions.”
“ChatGPT, please generate a plot for the Oppenheimer movie that Sam will enjoy,” a Twitter user commented under Atlman’s post on Saturday, taking a gibe at OpenAI’s popular text generator.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvdGhlLXRlY2hub2NyYXRzLW9mLXNpbGljb24tdmFsbGV5LWRvbnQtZ2V0LW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-24 20:00:15+00:00,Review: 'Oppenheimer' ushers in the atomic age in bleak but absorbing biopic,Director Christopher Nolan delivers an impactful 3-hour portrait of the brilliant physicist who altered humanity's fate.,"People always pontificate about the power of cinema — its ability to suspend disbelief, transport audiences and evoke raw emotions.
It's precisely that shock-and-awe effect that's on full display in director Christopher Nolan's unsettling historical drama, ""Oppenheimer.""
With the energy of a slow-building thermonuclear blast wave, Nolan masterfully captures the turbulent life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, an accomplished theoretical physicist who became the father of the atomic bomb, with results that range from hallucinatory to ponderous. It's a monumental achievement by perhaps our generation's greatest living filmmaker operating on all cylinders, with a singular-but-cloudy vision and dedicated dream cast and crew to pull it all together in rare style.
""Oppenheimer"" is a weighty, three-hour, R-rated biopic blanketing essential scientific and political topics that feels like an impassioned lovechild of Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind"" and Oliver Stone's ""JFK."" Never boring but often tripping over its own temporal meandering, ""Oppenheimer"" demands some level of marination and contemplative processing after any thunderous IMAX screening.

Adapted from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin's award-winning 2005 biography, ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,"" this $100 million movie stars Cillian Murphy in the title role as the Manhattan Project's enigmatic director, Emily Blunt as his boozy wife, Katherine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer, Matt Damon as the gruff Gen. Leslie Groves, and Robert Downey, Jr. as duplicitous politician Lewis Strauss.
The impressively grand scale ""Oppenheimer"" exhibits is truly breathtaking (and deafening as well), especially since it was shot by Dutch-Swedish cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema (""Interstellar,"" ""Dunkirk,"" ""Tenet') using massive IMAX cameras equipped with special 65-millimeter film stock. Visual effects recreating atomic explosions were conducted in-camera without the use of digital trickery.
Cillian Murphy has been nailing every performance he's ever filmed, from his turn in director Danny Boyle's chilling zombie flick ""28 Days Later"" to his psychopathic villain, Scarecrow, in Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" to a BAFTA-nominated gig in Netflix's period crime drama ""Peaky Blinders."" Here on the biggest of screens, Murphy is transformed in his finest role to date, bringing to life all the complexities and contradictions of the tortured rock-star scientist, J. Robert Oppenheimer.

The performances are all outstanding — not only by Murphy, Downey Jr., Blunt and Damon but also by the movie’s stellar array of esteemed actors in memorable ensemble roles, including James Remar, Matthew Modine, David Dastmalchian, Josh Hartnett, Florence Pugh, Jason Clarke and Kenneth Branagh. Particularly absorbing are Tom Conti as an elderly Albert Einstein and an especially riveting cameo by another Nolan alum, Gary Oldman, as President Harry S Truman.
One glaring omission seems to be Nolan's decision to not reveal ground zero historical images in the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosions, or Oppenheimer's own reactions to those photos. However, it's obviously a conscious decision to respect the Japanese victims of those terrifying moments of horror, to not glorify or sensationalize war itself, and avoid any derivative or cliched Hollywood tropes.
Aside from the riveting bomb-building sequences unfolding in little Los Alamos, New Mexico, the film keeps its focus tightly wrapped around suspicious closed-door government hearings and the anti-communist hysteria that led to Oppenheimer's security clearance being revoked years after two atomic bombs were dropped on Japan and the U.S. was entering a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. Equally, it would have been interesting to tour the Trinity Test Site itself to survey the melted blast crater and surrounding destruction as a harbinger of things to come.

Music is always a major component of any Christopher Nolan spectacle, and on ""Oppenheimer"" he has again chosen to work with Academy Award-winning composer Ludwig Göransson (""Black Panther""). Göransson delivers a stupendous epic score for ""Oppenheimer,"" one that elevates this film in myriad ways with its ominous strings, heavenly harps, interludes of classical piano and old-fashioned Hollywood elegance. Göransson previously wrote the soundtrack for Nolan's ""Tenet"" and is best known by ""Star Wars"" fans for conjuring up the rousing score for Disney+'s ""The Mandalorian.""
One word of warning: These modern-day IMAX screenings often have the sound volume cranked up near the ""threshold of pain"" level, so be kind to your eardrums and have a pair of plugs handy to go with your $20 tub of buttered popcorn.
Van Hoytema, one of Nolan's go-to cinematographers, unleashes the full brunt of his natural filmmaker's flair with artful compositions that take advantage of the large-format IMAX cameras and offer sweeping New Mexico vistas, nightmarish visions of atomic reactions, claustrophobic black-and-white witch hunts, anguished close-ups and even a gratuitous sex scene or two.
At times the chronology of the events becomes a bit laborious as Nolan tries to shoehorn three distinct periods in Oppenheimer's life into one movie, and the narrative starts to feel slightly over-cooked. Although the extended final act devolves into a standard “Kangaroo Court"" affair that becomes repetitive to a degree, no one can deny the ferocious force of pure cinematic alchemy and Nolan's earnest focus in crafting this astounding project, even if it loiters a bit in political rhetoric.

Its most devastating moment comes midway through the film, as ""the gadget"" is detonated 210 miles (340 kilometers) from Los Alamos. The blast nearly blinds the audience and almost literally blows viewers to the back of the theater as a mushroom cloud engulfs the screen, signaling a pivotal event in global history that will be discussed and debated for centuries.
Is Universal Pictures' ""Oppenheimer"" perfect? Not at all. But, like the brilliant man lodged at the nucleus of Nolan's story, it's significant and disturbingly profound.
""Oppenheimer"" is currently playing in theaters nationwide.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1ub2xhbi1maWxtLWF0b21pYy1ib21iLXJldmlld9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,‘Oppenheimer’ blew away my expectations,"After a marathon of a day at the movies, “Barbie” emerged victorious in the ""Barbenheimer"" war, but I was blown away by “Oppenheimer” nonetheless.","Before July 22, I liked exactly two biopics: “The Eyes of Tammy Faye” and “Spencer,” which I’m not sure even counts as a biopic. It’s not a genre I gravitate toward, so my expectations going into the phenomenon that is “Barbenheimer” was that “Barbie” would be my favorite, and it wouldn’t be particularly close.
After a marathon of a day at the movies, “Barbie” did indeed emerge victorious, but I was blown away by “Oppenheimer” nonetheless.
“Oppenheimer,” directed by Christopher Nolan, follows the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb. The film unfolds in a dual narrative structure as Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) leads the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos in the 1940s and Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) goes through a confirmation hearing for the position of U.S. Secretary of Commerce in 1959. The connective tissue between the two plotlines is a private 1954 hearing in a cramped room as the Atomic Energy Commission decides whether to renew Oppenheimer’s security clearance.
If that sounds like a lot of men talking in rooms, it is. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that means the film is boring, though.
Nolan has never set the stakes higher in one of his films, and the tension has never been greater. After all, the fate of the entire world hangs in the balance as Oppenheimer is blinded by discovery and his own ego.
Murphy shines as Oppenheimer throughout the movie. He transforms from an overconfident, idealistic physicist to a broken man crushed by guilt and anxiety in what’s sure to be an Oscar nomination if not a win for Best Actor at next year’s Academy Awards.
Parts of the script for “Oppenheimer” were written in first-person, a testament to Nolan’s dedication to telling the story from Oppie’s point of view. While Strauss’s confirmation hearing and the events surrounding it are shown in black and white, “objective” according to Nolan, the rest of the film is in “subjective” color.
It’s easy to criticize “Oppenheimer” for failing to adequately address the suffering of Japan and in particular the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki following the attacks. That’s the point of the film, though. To Oppenheimer himself, who never explicitly apologized for the use of nuclear weapons on Japan, the threat he unleashed on the world was both abstract and existential, a chain reaction to destroy the world at large and not a singular event.
The horror of “Oppenheimer” is how little thought is given to Japan. At one point, a politician rules out Kyoto as a potential target because he and his wife had honeymooned there. Later, President Harry Truman calls Oppenheimer a crybaby for the guilt he feels over giving humanity the power to destroy itself.
Beyond the terror of nuclear warfare, “Oppenheimer” dedicates a surprisingly large amount of its runtime to dissecting McCarthyism and the Red Scare. The third act of the movie centers on Oppenheimer’s ties to the Communist Party and whether he posed a security risk to the nation. Every relationship and interaction is picked apart and weaponized as an excuse to revoke his security clearance and prevent him from speaking with authority against the development of even more powerful weapons.
Nolan brought together a stellar cast to tell this story. Robert Downey Jr. especially stands out as he finally manages to shake the last remnants of Tony Stark off. Emily Blunt also packs a punch with the little screen time she has as Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty, and Matt Damon finally has a role I appreciate in Leslie Groves.
Ludwig Görannson’s score also shines in every moment of the film. “Can You Hear The Music” and “American Prometheus” especially stand out, and I’d be shocked if he doesn’t win Best Original Score next year.

Will Oppenheimer supplant “Interstellar” as my favorite Nolan movie? Absolutely not, but between the performances, the story, and all the technical elements from sound design to editing that make “Oppenheimer” shine, this film is now a very close second.

Oppenheimer is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography titled American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer. The biopic follows J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), the scientist who famously led the Manhattan Project — the effort to create an atomic bomb during World War II.
Also part of the star-studded cast are Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Josh Hartnett, Gary Oldman, Jack Quaid, Rami Malek, Dane DeHaan, Josh Peck and more.
Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling lead an equally impressive cast in the comedy Barbie, which follows the titular Mattel doll (played by Robbie, 33) and her main squeeze Ken (Gosling, 42) as they explore life beyond Barbie Land.
Barbie's cast also includes Kingsley Ben-Adir, Scott Evans, Simu Liu and Ncuti Gatwa, who appear as different versions of Ken in the film. Meanwhile, Hari Nef, Emma Mackey, Dua Lipa, Ana Cruz Kayne, Sharon Rooney, Kate McKinnon, Nicola Coughlan, Alexandra Shipp, Ritu Arya and Issa Rae play different versions of Barbie. Emerald Fennell will appear as Midge, and Michael Cera will play Allan.
At the time of the trailer's release, character posters were also unveiled for non-Barbie characters, including America Ferrera as ""a human,"" Ariana Greenblatt as another ""human,"" Helen Mirren as ""the narrator,"" Connor Swindells as an ""intern"" and Jamie Demetriou as ""a suit,"" plus Will Ferrell.
Aside from fans, celebrities are even showing their support for seeing both films when they come out — including Tom Cruise, whose own movie Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One premieres this Wednesday.
“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,” Cruise wrote alongside photos of himself and his director Christopher McQuarrie in front of posters for Oppenheimer and Barbie, as well as the recently released Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
""Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indy and one of the most iconic characters in history,"" added the actor, 60. ""I love a double feature, and it doesn't get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Oppenheimer and Barbie.”
Robbie and Barbie director/co-writer Gerwig, 39, even got in on the action, with the official Barbie movie Twitter account sharing photos of the two women holding tickets for Oppenheimer, Dead Reckoning — Part One and Dial of Destiny, while posing in front of the movies' posters.
""Mission: Accepted!"" read the accompanying tweet.

2023-07-24 12:20:23+00:00,Oppenheimer’s use of sacred text in sex scene angers Hindu right wing in India,Members of BJP government say use of Bhagavad Gita is ‘attack on Hinduism’ and call for scene to be deleted,"Christopher Nolan’s biopic Oppenheimer has prompted outrage among the Hindu right wing in India, who have alleged that a sex scene featuring a sacred text has offended religious sentiments.
The blockbuster tells the story of Robert Oppenheimer, known as the father of the atomic bomb and includes a sex scene in which the tortured physicist, played by Cillian Murphy, reads the Bhagavad Gita to his lover Jean Tatlock, played by Florence Pugh.
The words he reads aloud, which he translates from Sanskrit, are those of the god Krishna – “I am become death, the destroyer of worlds” – a quote the real Oppenheimer recalled after the first detonation of the atomic bomb he had invented. Oppenheimer taught himself Sanskrit and during his life, he spoke of drawing from the Hindu text.
The presence of the Bhagavad Gita in the middle of the sex scene prompted a member of India’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government to call the film an “attack on Hinduism”.
In an open letter, Uday Mahurkar, an information commissioner, said the scene was “a direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus”. He alleged it amounted to “waging a war on the Hindu community” and almost appeared to be part of a “larger conspiracy by anti-Hindu forces”.
Anurag Thakur, the information and culture minister, was among those to demand that the scene be removed and called for action to be taken against India’s Central Board of Film Certification. The film was rated U/A, which recommends parental guidance for viewers aged under 12.
Oppenheimer has proved popular with Indian audiences, taking £1.2m on the first day alone, the biggest box office opening day for a Hollywood film in India this year.
The blockbuster is not the first to fall afoul of rightwing Hindu groups since the BJP government came to power. The BBC/Netflix television adaptation of A Suitable Boy was also accused of hurting religious sentiments by senior BJP ministers and subjected to police complaints for a scene of a Hindu girl and Muslim boy kissing near a temple.

During an interview with Wired, he revealed that some early viewers had a very emotional reaction to the film, which depicts the invention of the atomic bomb.
“Some people leave the movie absolutely devastated,” he revealed. “They can’t speak. I mean, there’s an element of fear that’s there in the history and there in the underpinnings. But the love of the characters, the love of the relationships, is as strong as I’ve ever done.”

Oppenheimer tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer – the scientist behind America’s top-secret nuclear weapons program during World War II.
He’s often credited as the father of the atomic bomb and spearheaded the ambitious Manhattan Project which saw the US scientific community come together with the goal of creating the world’s first nuclear bomb.
Obviously, the threat of nuclear war weighed heavily on the US throughout the Cold War, so it’s something that has long been part of the national consciousness. Now, Nolan is using it to unsettle and terrify his audiences.
“It is an intense experience because it’s an intense story,” he said. “I showed it to a filmmaker recently who said it’s kind of a horror movie. I don’t disagree.”
The film focuses on the lead-up to the Trinity nuclear test – the world’s first nuclear test.
As the recent trailer showed, it’s more than a little tense.
“Oppenheimer’s story is all impossible questions,” Nolan added. “Impossible ethical dilemmas, paradox. There are no easy answers in his story. There are just difficult questions, and that’s what makes the story so compelling. I think we were able to find a lot of things to be optimistic about in the film, genuinely, but there’s this sort of overriding bigger question that hangs over it. It felt essential that there be questions at the end that you leave rattling in people’s brains and prompting discussion.”
Cillian Murphy stars as J. Robert Oppenheimer alongside an all-star cast that includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek, and many more. David Dastmalchian also recently joined the cast in an unknown role, with Drake and Josh star Josh Peck joining as scientist Kenneth Bainbridge.

2023-07-30 19:50:35+00:00,‘Barbenheimer’ box office success has reawakened America’s moviegoing muscle,It’s a tale of two movies and a box office triumph: “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” maintained incredible momentum into their second weekends.,"New York CNN —
It’s a tale of two movies and a box office triumph: “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” maintained incredible momentum into their second weekends.
“Barbie” wore several hats this weekend, with domestic “Barbie” impressing with $93 million in gross revenue and international “Barbie” bringing in around $122 million, making it the No. 1 release worldwide.
It is the largest domestic second weekend performance ever for Warner Bros., which distributed the movie. (CNN and Warner Bros. are both owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.)
“Oppenheimer” also had a blowout weekend, with a domestic total of $46 million, according to estimates from media analytics company Comscore, bringing its worldwide total to almost half a billion dollars. Universal, which distributed the movie, estimated Oppenheimer will be Nolan’s biggest non-superhero film of all-time in 40 regions, and his biggest film ever in 28.
Crucially, these numbers reflect that not only is there high energy and excitement for movies, but an appetite for the movie theater experience.

“Barbenheimer was never going to happen on your TV, it’s just not,” said Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theater Owners in the United States. “You have to go into the theater to experience it.”
Repeat viewings are also fueling box office earnings. Midwest-based chain B&B Theaters estimated that across its 55 theaters, more than 2,100 people saw “Barbie” both opening weekend and this weekend, and almost 500 returned to see “Oppenheimer.”
“Hollywood” is often considered interchangeable with “the movie industry,” and O’Leary notes that there has always been a strong movie theater culture in the United States.
After the pandemic ravaged theaters and public screenings, people are now looking forward to “sitting in a theater with world-class projection and sound systems, having an immersive experience alongside other people,” he said.
“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” will trigger more and more people going to the movies by reminding them “the best of what the theatrical experience can be. It’s a reawakening,” he added.

O’Leary expects the movies to perform well for weeks to come, noting there’s been a rise over the past several years in very strong holdover weekends. That could be partly due to energetic word-of-mouth stoked by social media.
“At their core, consumers want to go see a compelling story, they want to be entertained,” he said. “If stories resonate with people… they tell other people.”
The overwhelming appreciation for these creative projects means that the ongoing Writers Guild of America and actors union SAG-AFTRA strikes could be a dark cloud over the these financial successes, according to some analysts.
“There’s pressure to resolve (these labor disputes) because the possibility of revenue is built on the foundation of having movies and actors to promote them,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. “For now we have high-profile films, but that pool will be drying out.”

The production limbo caused by a lack of negotiations on the part of studios are leading to a ripple effect where the release dates for those projects will also be postponed. According to Boxoffice Pro chief analyst Shawn Robbins, this means that in the second half of 2023 and throughout 2024, theater chains will need “to keep a weather eye on the horizon for problems beyond their control.”
“While it’s important to celebrate the good times right now and realize they can be a barometer for the future, it’s just as important to recognize the fight for equality by so many who play a part in creating the content we see on our screens, large and small,” he added.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8zMC9idXNpbmVzcy9iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItYm94LW9mZmljZS1tb3ZpZXMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBW2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjMvMDcvMzAvYnVzaW5lc3MvYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtbW92aWVzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-15 16:15:20+00:00,"How ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ became Barbenheimer, the summer movie showdown","There’s even some disagreement over whether it’s “Barbieheimer” or “Barbenheimer” or “Boppenheimer.""","The very online showdown between Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” all started with a date: July 21.
It’s not uncommon for studios to counterprogram films in different genres on a big weekend, but the stark differences between an intense, serious-minded picture about the man who oversaw the development of the atomic bomb and a lighthearted, candy-colored anthropomorphizing of a childhood doll quickly became the stuff of viral fodder.
There’s even some disagreement over whether it’s “Barbieheimer” or “Barbenheimer” or “Boppenheimer” or yet another tortured portmanteau — a phenomenon on which the AP Stylebook has yet to offer guidance, but for the purposes of this article will be “Barbenheimer.”
It didn’t hurt that both Nolan and Gerwig have very passionate and very online fandoms eager to join in. Never mind that many of those fans overlap — the memes, allegiances, and T-shirts were just too fun.
Both movies often trend on social media when the other releases a new asset — a trailer, a picture, an interview. On one level, it’s a marketing department’s dream. Awareness could not be higher, the conversation couldn’t be louder, and neither film even has official reviews out yet.
“‘Barbenheimer’ is a marketing gift borne out of social media and I think it’s benefiting both films,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for analytics firm Comscore. “You’re certainly aware of both movies in a more profound and compelling way than I think might have otherwise happened had they been released on different weekends.”
AMC Theaters reported that 20,000 of its AMC Stubs members had purchased tickets for a double feature. If you’re counting, that’s 294 minutes of movie-watching. Even Margot Robbie — Barbie herself — and Tom Cruise, the star of another summer blockbuster, have started plotting the ideal “Barbenheimer” day.
“It’s a perfect double bill,” said Robbie at her movie’s London premiere Wednesday. “I think actually start your day with ‘Barbie,’ then go straight into ‘Oppenheimer’ and then a ‘Barbie’ chaser.”
Cruise — whose “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” opened a little over a week before the “Barbenheimer” showdown — said at his premiere he’d plan to see both on their opening day, likely starting with “Oppenheimer,” which seems to be the internet’s preferred viewing order as well.
“Barbie” actor Issa Rae thinks there’s a reason for that.
“I think that there’s a very specific order that if you see them in. If you see ‘Oppenheimer’ last, then you might be a bit of a psychopath,” she diagnosed at the London premiere.
The showdown has made armchair marketing experts out of everyone, quick to scrutinize every move by Warner Bros. and Universal — as though it’s possible to compare two extraordinarily different campaigns.
One has infinite opportunities for very pink, sparkly photo opportunities, whimsical brand partnerships for seemingly everything from underwear to pool floats, large-scale fan events with autograph signings and pop stars like Billie Eilish posting about the soundtrack. In other words, the “Barbie” campaign can go nuclear.
“Oppenheimer” has the bomb, the alluring mystery and the big screen hook, but it’s not the kind of movie that lends itself to, say, a frozen yogurt collaboration.
Is the competition real, though, or just a meme? Some in Hollywood wondered if Warner Bros. plopped “Barbie” on the weekend as a slight to Nolan, who had opened many films for the studio in that corridor including “Inception” and “Dunkirk.” He left Warner Bros. amid its controversial decision to send a year’s worth of movies to streaming and made “Oppenheimer” with Universal instead. But a pointed box office war doesn’t exactly make sense for a studio that has talked recently about wanting to lure Nolan back.
There is an unspoken code of conduct: Never badmouth another studio’s film, publicly at least. This is partly decorum, especially when it comes to “box office showdowns” which all will say are a creation of the press and sideline spectators. But it’s also rooted in some truth: The conventional thinking is that having eyes on one movie is good for other movies — you see their posters and trailers and on some level everyone benefits.
And social media has allowed movie stars to get in on the game, too. Following reports that Cruise was irked the latest “Mission: Impossible” was going to lose its IMAX screens to “Oppenheimer” after only a week, Cruise posted photos of himself and director Christopher McQuarrie standing in front of posters for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” holding tickets for each.
“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters. These are just a few that we can’t wait to see on the big screen,” Cruise’s Instagram caption read.
The official accounts for “Indiana Jones,” “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” responded with supportive notes. Gerwig and Robbie even followed with a similar photo series a few days later, which the official “Oppenheimer” Instagram account reposted in its stories. Charged with playing Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy told the AP at his movie’s London premiere that “of course” he’d be seeing “Barbie.” The sporting cross-promotion between four studios — Universal, Warner Bros., Disney and Paramount — is something the film business has not quite seen before.
“Not only is Tom Cruise the biggest box office star in the world, but he’s also an incredible ambassador for the movie theater, for the movie theater experience and boosting other movies,” Dergarabedian said. “And that collegial atmosphere within the framework of what is seen as the very competitive box office derby is kind of a nice thing.”
Still, everyone likes a No. 1 debut, and both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” reportedly carry $100 million production price tags (not including the millions spent on marketing). As far as box office tracking goes, “Barbie” has it in the bag with forecasts showing that it could open above $90 million in North America. “Oppenheimer” meanwhile is tracking in the $40 million range. Then there’s the wild card of “Mission: Impossible 7’s” second weekend, which could snag second place.
Still even with a second- or third-place start, “Oppenheimer” could be destined for a long, steady, profitable run into awards season. Adult audiences for R-rated movies are not often the ones who pack theaters the first weekend.
Back in 2008, in the midst of the recession, Warner Bros. and Universal faced off on the same July weekend with another Nolan film that went up against a lighthearted confection: “The Dark Knight” and “Mamma Mia!” — both of which went on to be enormously profitable (though Nolan did win the first weekend).
The bigger worry is that what’s been heralded as Hollywood’s post-pandemic comeback summer has had more ups and downs than anyone might have hoped. That’s putting quite a bit of pressure on “Barbenheimer” to overperform and boost the lagging summer box office, which pales in comparison to the bigger issues facing the industry as actors join the writers on strike.
But with just over a week to go, it’s still a source of amusement. Even “Barbie” co-star Will Ferrell threw the gauntlet in his winking way at the London premiere.
“I think the world maybe wants to see ‘Barbie’ a little bit more right now,” Ferrell said. “Just saying!”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTUvaG93LWJhcmJpZS1hbmQtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItYmVjYW1lLWJhcmJlbmhlaW1lci10aGUtc3VtbWVyLW1vdmllLXNob3dkb3duL9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTUvaG93LWJhcmJpZS1hbmQtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItYmVjYW1lLWJhcmJlbmhlaW1lci10aGUtc3VtbWVyLW1vdmllLXNob3dkb3duL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Bowdoin Scholars Weigh In on Blockbuster Movie Releases Oppenheimer and Barbie,,"Allison Cooper (L) and David Hecht
Associate Professor of History David Hecht, a scholar of the Cold War and the history of science, posted an opinion piece about Oppenheimer in The Portland Press Herald over the weekend, while film scholar Allison Cooper took to the airwaves last week to discuss the “Barbenheimer” phenomenon, as many are calling it.
Hecht said he enjoyed Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer biopic—""the movie tells a complex story in a clear and compelling manner”—which explores the life of the brilliant physicist many describe as “the father of the atomic bomb” and his role in developing the world’s first nuclear weapon (an initiative known as The Manhattan Project).
However, the historian does have one question: “why focus on Oppenheimer in the first place? After all,” he commented, “it was Groves who hired him.” Hecht, author of Storytelling and Science: Rewriting Oppenheimer in the Nuclear Age (University of Massachusetts Press, 2015), is referring to General Leslie Groves, the head of the Manhattan Project, played by Matt Damon in the movie.
Groves was central to the project, stressed Hecht, overseeing the construction of the test facilities, including Los Alamos, securing supplies of uranium, and ensuring the US military was able to transport the bombs and drop them on the chosen targets. “Of course, he did not do these things alone—much as Oppenheimer was not solely responsible for Los Alamos’s success,” wrote Hecht. “But any book or movie that aspires to tell the whole story of the Manhattan Project should surely have Groves as the main character, and Oppenheimer as the supporting one.”
However, he concedes, while a movie about Groves would be a “more complete and accurate depiction of the Manhattan Project,” it may be lacking in dramatic appeal. “The struggles of a brilliant but conflicted scientist make for better on-screen drama than would the minutiae of construction schedules and procurement protocols.” Read more.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvd2RvaW4uZWR1L25ld3MvMjAyMy8wOC9ib3dkb2luLXNjaG9sYXJzLXdlaWdoLWluLW9uLWJsb2NrYnVzdGVyLW1vdmllLXJlbGVhc2VzLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWFuZC1iYXJiaWUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 14:30:00+00:00,We Need to Talk About Those ‘Oppenheimer’ Sex Scenes,"Perhaps the most surprising element of ‘Oppenheimer’ is its sex scenes, the first ones filmed by director Christopher Nolan.","The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry, and two films explore that abiding Robert Burns proverb this week: Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s IMAX-sized three-hour biopic of the “father of the atomic bomb,” and Barbie, a Mattel-sanctioned deconstruction of the patriarchy from the fertile mind of Greta Gerwig. Only one of these summer blockbusters, however, boasts a number of sex scenes, and it isn’t the one starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.
Oppenheimer explores the life and times of renowned theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (embodied by an admirably committed Cillian Murphy) through the twin prisms of his time as de facto leader of the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico, as the U.S. and its team of scientific avengers raced to create the first atomic bomb before the Nazis; and his 1954 security clearance hearings, where Congress sought to paint their erstwhile savior as a commie governed by anti-American hostilities and wanton sexual desire (ugly stereotypes all-too-commonly foisted on American Jews like Oppenheimer). There is also a black-and-white 1959 congressional hearing on the cabinet nomination of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr., never better), chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and a supposed friend of Oppenheimer’s, though the less said about this prolonged deviation the better.
We are treated to glimpses of Oppenheimer’s years teaching in the physics department at UC Berkeley, where he and his students made a number of valuable advances in the realms of quantum chemistry and molecular physics, and nuclear reactions in particular. This is where Oppenheimer, an attractive, slender man with piercing blue eyes, met Jean Tatlock (played by Florence Pugh), a young Stanford Medical School student and Communist Party member who wrote and reported for the Western Worker, a communist newspaper. Tatlock helped fuel Oppenheimer’s — or Oppie, as she would call him — interest in the field of psychology, as well as radical left-wing politics, and their passionate romance would eventually attract the interest of the FBI. Editor’s picks
Early on in Oppenheimer, Professor Oppenheimer is introduced to Tatlock during a Communist Party get-together, and the two immediately click. Cut to a scene of a nude Pugh-as-Tatlock riding Murphy’s Oppie like the end of Dr. Strangelove, only to pause in the action when her eye catches a book on his shelf: the Bhagavad Gita, a Hindu scripture that was a favorite of Oppenheimer’s. She turns to a section and, as she is on top of him, has him read it to her: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds” — a line famously uttered by Oppenheimer about him and his terrifying creation during a 1965 TV broadcast. In lieu of capturing the intensity of Oppenheimer and Tatlock’s affair, it comes off as clumsy and unintentionally funny. Why is Tatlock making Oppenheimer read one of his most famous quotes back to her while fucking him?
Now, it is the first sex scene that Nolan has ever filmed, after all — Oppenheimer is the first Nolan flick to attract an R rating since 2002’s Insomnia due to its sex scenes — so perhaps we should cut him a bit of slack. I mean, who can forget Spielberg’s supercharged sex scene in 2006’s Munich, a baffling mélange of sweat, thrashing, terror, and climax-as-exorcism, set to a religious hymn and intercut with scenes of Israelis being gunned down during the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics by Palestinian militants. Shooting a good sex scene is a gift that can escape even some of our greatest filmmakers. Not everyone can be Nicolas Roeg. And Nolan appears well-aware of this.
“Any time you’re challenging yourself to work in areas you haven’t worked in before, you should be appropriately nervous and appropriately careful and planned and prepared,” Nolan told Insider about filming his first sex scenes.
He added, “When you look at Oppenheimer’s life and you look at his story, that aspect of his life, the aspect of his sexuality, his way with women, the charm that he exuded, it’s an essential part of his story… It felt very important to try to understand their relationship and to really see inside it and understand what made it tick without being coy or allusive about it — but to try to be intimate, to try and be in there with him and fully understand the relationship that was so important to him.” Related

Indeed, Oppenheimer was quite the ladies’ man. In addition to his romance with Tatlock, which is said to have lasted well into his marriage to Kitty (Emily Blunt), the film implies that he’d conducted an affair with Ruth Sherman Tolman (Louise Lombard), the wife of Oppenheimer’s pal Richard Tolman, a physicist who served as scientific advisor to Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) in the Manhattan Project. Their alleged affair is explored more in-depth in the 2013 book An Atomic Love Story: The Extraordinary Women in Robert Oppenheimer’s Life.
“Robert was seen dating a number of ‘mostly very attractive youngish girls,’” during his time at Berkeley, according to the Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, upon which Nolan’s film is based. “Among others, he had relationships with Haakon Chevalier’s sister-in-law, Ann Hoffman, and Estelle Caen, the sister of the San Francisco Chronicle’s columnist Herbert Caen. Bob Serber recalled a half-dozen girlfriends, including a British emigré named Sandra Dyer-Bennett. He broke several hearts. Still, whenever Tatlock phoned him in a low mood, he came to her and talked her out of her depression. They remained the closest of friends, and occasional lovers.”
After Tatlock broke things off with Oppenheimer, who’d proposed marriage to her at least twice, he met Kitty Harrison (née Peuning), who was married at the time to Stewart Harrison, a doctor. He rekindled his romance with Tatlock while married to Kitty, though refused to say goodbye to Tatlock before departing for Los Alamos.
In 1943, on a visit to Berkeley in the midst of the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer reunited with Tatlock – even though she was seeing his friend, a psychologist named Dr. Siegfried Bernfeld. He was monitored by agents of the military during their entire rendezvous, who later reported their findings to the FBI. According to American Prometheus, those findings were that: “‘On June 14, 1943, Oppenheimer traveled via Key Railway from Berkeley to San Francisco… where he was met by Jean Tatlock who kissed him.’” The two went out for dinner and drinks, and then to Tatlock’s apartment, where Oppenheimer wouldn’t emerge until 8:30 a.m. the next morning, and the FBI report noted that “the relationship of Oppenheimer and Tatlock appears to be very affectionate and intimate.”
As far as we know, he never saw her again after San Francisco.

Aside from this clandestine rendezvous, Pugh’s Tatlock disappears for much of Oppenheimer — save a scene during Oppenheimer’s 1954 security clearance hearings that has to be seen to be believed. Oppenheimer is being grilled by seedy congressmen over his allegiances, with the blowhards repeatedly claiming that Oppenheimer’s affair with the communist Tatlock during his marriage to Kitty, and his association with her communist friends, confirmed that his loyalty to America was precarious at best.
Blunt’s Kitty is in the room as Murphy’s Oppenheimer is being interrogated by these congressmen over Tatlock and we switch to her perspective, as she envisions Oppenheimer and Tatlock — naked — having sex right in front of her, in that very room, with Pugh’s nude Tatlock grinding on Oppie’s lap. Tatlock locks eyes with Kitty in this fantasy scenario, taunting her. You get what Nolan is attempting here — to convey Kitty’s jealousy over her husband’s extramarital tryst — but the scene is so wildly over-the-top that your eyes will roll back into your head.

There is much to admire in Nolan’s Oppenheimer. It is a staggering technical achievement, its score by Ludwig Göransson is dizzyingly alive, the compositions by Hoyte van Hoytema deserve to be taken in on the biggest screen possible, and its performances are stellar across the board (save Josh Hartnett and Benny Safdie’s distracting turns). The film is brimming with ambition, but its sex scenes — and the portrait of Oppenheimer and Tatlock’s relationship as a whole — could have used some work.
Tatlock, by then a doctor whose star was on the rise, took her own life in 1944. She had battled crippling bouts of depression. The name of the first nuclear test, “Trinity,” was reportedly made in tribute to her.

,'Oppenheimer': Christopher Nolan's new movie about nukes is 'the stuff of cinematic drama',"The epic and tragic story of American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the father of the atomic bomb, never left Christopher Nolan's mind.","In 1982, back when Christopher Nolan was 12, he was gripped by an existential fear.
“There was an intense debate about nuclear weapons” at the time, Nolan remembers. “My friends and I thought we would die in a nuclear Armageddon at some point in our lives.”
Fast-forward 41 years and that childhood trauma has found full expression in “Oppenheimer” (in theaters Friday), arguably the most ambitious and straightforward of the British director’s dozen works that range from “Memento” to “Inception” with a few ""Batman"" movies thrown in for populist measure.
In this opening salvo of 2023’s Oscar battle, Nolan has enjoined a star-studded cast for a retelling of the brilliant and haunted life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American physicist whose stewardship of the Manhattan Project led to the atomic bomb, the death of tens of thousands and the end of World War II.
It's a movie Nolan has ached to put on the big screen for decades. “In 1985, Sting came out with his song ‘Russians,’ and there’s a line in it that hit hard,” he says. “It goes, ‘How can I save my little boy from Oppenheimer’s deadly toy?’""
The result of that lifelong obsession is a movie that Cillian Murphy (""Peaky Blinders""), the Irish actor who plays the titular character, calls Nolan's ""magnum opus.""
Seeing the completed film for the first time, Murphy says he was ""emotionally winded, it grabbed me by the throat.""
Who was J. Robert Oppenheimer?What to know about atomic bomb physicist's life, career, death
The draw for moviegoers: epic scale and a riveting true story
Nolan was captivated by Oppenheimer and his impossible dilemma: How do you use your beloved science to bring peace through death? In 2020, as the director was finishing the sci-fi thriller “Tenet,” he received a gift from cast member Robert Pattinson: a book of Oppenheimer’s speeches.
“In them, he’s wrestling with the consequences of this technology,” Nolan says.
On its surface, “Oppenheimer” could play like a documentary, following the scientist as he develops a passion for physics and women before being asked by Atomic Energy Commission head Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) to lead a secret bomb-making project overseen by Army Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon).
In the war’s aftermath, Oppenheimer suddenly finds himself in Strauss' crosshairs. His loyalty to the U.S. is publicly challenged as the Communist witch hunt rages. His military security clearance is revoked, and his name is tarnished.
But Nolan’s faithfulness to his source material aside (the Pulitzer-winning biography “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin), “Oppenheimer” is committed to making audiences share in the same wide-eyed trepidation and amazement Nolan felt as a child.
'Oppenheimer' mined a dark fear: Would the first atomic bomb blow up Earth?
Achieving his cinematic vision meant shooting in massive IMAX; building a town in New Mexico to double as the Los Alamos project site; filming scenes in Oppenheimer’s real offices and homes; and using practical effects instead of computer-generated imaging.
A fully computer-generated nuclear blast would take viewers away from the film’s intended realism, Matt Damon says in an interview conducted before the Screen Actors Guild strike.
“It’s a real philosophy of his movie-making,” Damon says. “It’s better for your actors to totally immerse them, and more importantly, for the audience, because you can never quite put your finger on why something works or doesn’t, but you can tell if it doesn’t.”
To heighten the horror, Nolan focused on a genuine if fleeting concern that gripped the physicists: the possibility that a chain reaction would literally set fire to the entire planet.
“Once I got ahold of that fact, that stuck with me,” he says.
Christopher Nolan gets 'great performances' out of his stars
For the actors in this ensemble, Nolan was the touchstone.
“He’s a hurricane of talent who understands actors, which is why in these huge, gargantuan films, he gets such great performances out of people,” says Emily Blunt, who plays Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty in a pre-strike conversation.
“Oppenheimer’s story arc is all over the place and hard to pin down,” says Murphy. “I leaned on Chris greatly to modulate what I did, turning things up and then down so I kept a great deal of ambiguity.”
Key to Murphy’s portrayal is a studied look that's uncannily similar to famous photographs. “I started from the outside in,” he says. “I wanted to get his silhouette right. The right shape and costuming and hair and makeup. It was a long process.”
Over the last two decades, Nolan had cast Murphy in five movies. This time, ""I called and said, ‘This is the one, you’ll take center stage,” says Nolan. “He knew he had a lot of work to do.”
Will 'Barbenheimer' buzz boost turnout?
But one great lead actor performance does not a summer blockbuster make. And while Nolan may be an artiste, he does measure success in box office tallies. He's confident the gripping and real nature of this tale will captivate popcorn-hungry crowds.
“ ‘American Prometheus’ was the most dramatic story I’ve ever read, full stop,” says Nolan. “It’s the stuff of cinematic drama. For me, cinema means engagement, whether by horror, comedy, or love, so movies can be anything. If the story is dramatic and engaging, you can bring it to a wide audience.”
Even if it’s three hours long, a length that Nolan targeted. He believes every movie has a predetermined length, “whether that’s this movie at three hours or ‘Dunkirk’ at 100 tight minutes.”
Like James Cameron and Tom Cruise, Nolan says those who make movies must work to bring post-pandemic audiences back into the theater.
“Movies combine the subjectivity of a novel with the empathetic response of other people in the audience,” he says. “There’s no other medium that does that.”
Nolan demurs on whether that means he’ll be in line for “Barbie” (also out Friday), the other half of the so-called ""Barbenheimer"" double bill.
But he’s glad the marketing hoopla − which comes at a tenuous time for an industry plunged into a writers' and actors' strike − could mean more people shuffling into darkened theaters to experience escapism, including the nightmares of a 12-year-old writ large on an IMAX canvas.
“I don’t make films for myself as a creative, I make them for myself as an audience member,” he says. “As for the success or failure of a movie you make, that’s an imponderable. All I can really do is simply know I made the best film I possibly could.”

Murphy plays J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist commonly regarded as one of the ""fathers of the atomic bomb"", in Christopher Nolan's new biopic. Downey Jr. told People magazine that Murphy's role was no small undertaking, but as an actor, he had the ""humility"" to deliver a truly transformative performance.
""I have never witnessed a greater sacrifice by a lead actor in my career,"" Downey Jr. said. ""He knew it was going to be a behemoth ask when Chris [Nolan] called him. But I think he also had the humility that is required to survive playing a role like this.""

Downey Jr., who plays Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss in the movie, shared a brief but illustrative anecdote to elaborate further on the qualities Murphy brought to the role, specifically his dedication and the time he personally invested in perfecting his portrayal of the movie's titular physicist.
""We'd be like, 'Hey, we got a three-day weekend. Maybe we'll go antiquing in Santa Fe. What are you going to do?' 'Oh, I have to learn 30,000 words of Dutch. Have a nice time,' "" Downey Jr. recalled before adding, ""But that's the nature of the ask.""
Murphy's devotion to the role included following an extremely restrictive diet in order to become the ""emaciated"" Oppenheimer. His co-star Emily Blunt, who plays his onscreen wife, told Extra that Murphy ""could only eat, like, an almond every day"" as part of a ""monumental undertaking"" to transform into the character.
Separately, Murphy told The New York Times: ""I love acting with my body, and Oppenheimer had a very distinct physicality and silhouette, which I wanted to get right. I had to lose quite a bit of weight, and we worked with the costume and tailoring; he was very slim, almost emaciated, existed on martinis and cigarettes.""
Oppenheimer is an adaptation of the 2005 Pulitzer Prize-winning book, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, which chronicles the life of the famed nuclear physicist. The movie explores his work on the Manhattan Project and his role in developing the atomic bomb.
Nolan's big-screen biopic hit theaters on July 21 as one part of the 'Barbenheimer' phenomenon. IGN's review of Oppenheimer described it as a ""jolting thriller"" that offers ""a disturbing, mesmerizing vision of what humanity is capable of bringing upon itself, both through its innovation and through its capacity to justify any atrocity"".

,‘Barbie’ or ‘Oppenheimer’? We asked senators which movie they’re seeing.,"From a meme to the halls of Congress, no one can escape the “Barbenheimer” phenomenon.","“Which of your state’s senators is seeing the Barbie and which is seeing Oppenheimer? (you have to choose),” one Twitter user posted late Wednesday evening, wracking up 1 million views as of the morning of release day.
Senators and their constituents have been musing publicly on the topic: A ticket to “Barbie” for Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.)? “If you say so,” he says. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio)? “Neither Barbie nor Oppenheimer. I’m a Ken.” Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.)? A lawmaker who “can do both” — fittingly on-the-fence for the former Democrat-turned-independent.
To put an end to the speculation, POLITICO asked each senator about which — if any — of the two movies they intend to see this opening weekend. Here’s what they said.
Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer are in the “Oppenheimer” camp. | Universal Pictures via AP
Double Feature-ers
Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) told POLITICO he plans to see both, and is taking some people from Capitol Hill to see “Barbie.” And while he said he won’t be able to see them back-to-back, he has strong opinions on the viewing order.
“You need the seriousness and then the desserts,” Booker said. “You don’t see ‘Barbie’ and then ‘Oppenheimer.’ You see ‘Oppenheimer’ and then ‘Barbie.’”
Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) was one of Booker’s invitees, though the details of the outing had yet to be nailed down as of Thursday night, according to a spokesperson for Cardin. Regardless, the Maryland Democrat is interested in seeing the “Barbie” movie with his granddaughters.
Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said he and his wife agreed to watch both. While he is more of an “Oppenheimer” fan himself — he did get Oppenheimer-endorsed legislation — Markey said his wife is passionate about “Barbie.” But he firmly believes in doing a double-header.
“Why make a choice when none is required?” Markey said. “You’re asking me to choose between two movies I can see on the same day.”
“The question really would be: What would I eat in between the movies?” he added.
Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) is planning on doing the double feature, though probably not this weekend, according to a spokesperson.
“I’ll see both,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said in an email. “I loved the bio ‘American Prometheus’ on which ‘Oppenheimer’ is based. I would not see ‘Barbie’ … except for Greta Gerwig directing. She can make cinematic gold from straw. As for when? Who knows?”
Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) will also see both — but not back-to-back, according to his team.
Team ‘Barbie’
For Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), it’s a no-brainer. She’s a “Barbie” girl in a Capitol Hill world.
“How could you not be team ‘Barbie’?” Warren told POLITICO. While she probably won’t have time this weekend, she is coordinating when to watch with her granddaughters.
Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) is also planning on seeing “Barbie” sometime next week, a spokesperson said.
Team ‘Oppenheimer’
Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer are in the “Oppenheimer” camp, as are Sens. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) and Bob Casey (D-Pa.), both history buffs, according to their teams.
Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) is definitely in for “Oppenheimer,” and “would likely see ‘Barbie,’” a spokesperson said, though he won’t be doing the double feature.
“After learning that Oppenheimer contained extensive scenes from 1950s-era Senate committee hearings, and three hours of American history, Senator [Michael] Bennet cannot wait to go,” a spokesperson for the Colorado Democrat said. “His wife and daughters will be watching ‘Barbie’ tonight without him.”
“As one of the key Senators responsible for vindicating J. Robert Oppenheimer,” Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) “looks forward to seeing Oppenheimer with his family in the future,” a spokesperson said. Heinrich was one of the four senators who urged President Joe Biden to rescind the Atomic Energy Commission’s characterization of the physicist as “untrustworthy and unfit to serve his country.”
And Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) wants to see “Oppenheimer,” but the new “Indiana Jones” movie is at the top of his list.
Uhh, no thanks
Sens. Chris Coons (D-Del.) and James Lankford (R-Okla.) don’t have plans to see either, their teams said.
Sens. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) have a different movie in mind: “The Sound of Freedom,” based on a former government agent’s efforts to save child trafficking victims.
“I had plans to see neither, but that meme has made me wonder if I now need to see both,” Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), said in reference to a photo that dubbed him as “Oppenheimer” and Sinema, with whom he was speaking, as “Barbie.”
Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) also doesn’t plan to see either of two films; but he is currently reading “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” a spokesperson said.
A spokesperson for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) declined to comment.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDcvMjEvYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLTAwMTA3NTQw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Now it’s breaking box office records while elevating international awareness of the Gem City. “Oppenheimer” is based on the true story of developing atomic bombs to end World War II in the 1940s. Quincy native Paul Tibbets piloted the plane that dropped the first bomb.,"QUINCY (WGEM) - It’s a story that changed the course of history. Now it’s breaking box office records while elevating international awareness of the Gem City.
“Oppenheimer” is based on the true story of developing atomic bombs to end World War II in the 1940s.
Quincy native Paul Tibbets piloted the plane that dropped the first bomb.
“Tibbets changed the course of history,” Quincy University History Professor Dr. Justin Coffey said.
Coffey said the new movie brings history to life through the power of storytelling, including interesting details that might’ve been overlooked in the history books.
“It’s very complicated,” Coffey said. “The movie really does an excellent job of bringing that home. For example, Oppenheimer told Paul Tibbets that there was a chance that he might not survive after dropping the first atomic bomb. Tibbets decided to do it anyway.”
Coffey said “Oppenheimer” should serve an important history lesson that still has relevance today.
“Right now, there are times we’re almost at the brink of nuclear war,” Coffey said. “The situation in Russia and Ukraine. Russia has nuclear weapons. We must remember how dangerous these weapons can be in the birth of the atomic age.”
The true story also raises Quincy’s visibility in a highly competitive tourism market. Holly Cain with the Quincy Convention and Visitors’ Bureau created promotional brochures six years ago that feature interesting stories and people of Quincy’s past.
“We know visitors want to learn a bit of our history, so this allowed them to do that,” Cain said.
She said the brochure also has educated Tri-State natives.
“My home was right near Mary Astor’s,” Cain said. “I had no idea it was right there.”
Cain said her office plans to republish the promotional brochure this fall with additions including Quincy native Paul Tibbets.
“This is my favorite piece,” Cain said. “While sharing history in a fun manner.”
“Oppenheimer” is playing right now at several movie theaters throughout the Tri-States.
More information about Tibbets is available at the Historical Society of Quincy and Adams County.

2023-08-19 17:00:24+00:00,Box office record: ‘Oppenheimer’ beats ‘Sing’ as highest-grossing movie to never be number one,It's actually quite hard for a movie to make more than $200 million in North America without ever having a single weekend in first place.,"It’s probably a little bit of an odd box office record to boast about, but when Universal‘s animated movie “Sing” made $270.3 million in North America and $631 million globally, it did so without ever having been number one at the domestic box office. Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer,” a biopic starring Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, has just surpassed “Sing’s” domestic box office, so it now holds that all-time record.
Maybe that doesn’t seem so odd, but it’s actually quite hard for a movie to make more than $200 million in North America without ever having a single weekend in first place, even if only its opening weekend. In fact, only eight movies made over $200 million without being number one, and that’s including “Oppenheimer.”
SEE Box office: All time domestic top-grossing movies
In 2002, Nia Vardalos‘ breakout indie hit “My Big Fat Greek Wedding” had an astounding run at the box office, eventually grossing $241.4 million. During that entire run, which began well outside the Top 10 in May 2002, it only got to second place at the end of that summer, and it was never able to move into first place despite its longevity. It then remained in the Top 10 for two full months, hitting the $200 million mark just before Thanksgiving. (Ironically, a third movie in Vardaolos’ series is being released in just a few short weeks.)
The other highest-grossing films to never be number one include “Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel” (2009) at $219 million, “Alvin and the Chipmunks” (2007) at $217 million, “A Star Is Born” (2018) at $215 million, “Sherlock Holmes” (2009) at $209 million and “World War Z” (2013) at $202 million.
“Oppenheimer” added another $2.6 million on Wednesday, which brought its domestic total to $272.6 million. Since it constantly had Greta Gerwig‘s “Barbie” holding it back from taking first place, it’s now the current holder of that strange record to have. Similarly, “Sing” had the behemoth “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” to compete against when it was released in December 2016.
SEE Grab the popcorn and sound off in our movie forums
This is actually the first time since “Interstellar” in 2014 when a movie directed by Nolan didn’t at least open in first place. That movie ended up making $188 million domestically, so it was well behind the record, long before “Sing” came along to take that title.
Since “Oppenheimer” is likely to be bumped from second place this coming weekend, it’s probably going to hold onto this title for some time, because again, it’s somewhat of a rarity that’s becoming more and more common in recent years.

,Oppenheimer: Psychiatric Associations to the Movie and Man,Have you seen the movie “Oppenheimer”?,"Romolo Tavani/AdobeStock
PSYCHIATRIC VIEWS ON THE DAILY NEWS
The physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer had a great influence on society—some say the greatest—because he spearheaded the development of the atomic bomb and thereby the end of World War II, but with the potential to end the world. We do not know exactly what would have happened if this bomb was not built and used for devastating destruction against Japan. You cannot do double-blind scientific comparisons in situations like these. Fortunately, that bomb and its successors have not been used again, although concern has recently increased with Russia’s threat toward Ukraine. Instead, nuclear energy became an alternative energy source to fossil fuels, though accidents at the plants have caused some devastation.
As a very popular movie, Oppenheimer really brings him to the masses, and thereby media coverage and commentary. However, it is important to remember that it is a retrospective movie and not necessarily an accurate portrayal of all that happened.
For all the military success of the bomb, Oppenheimer had moral ambivalence, perhaps best described with his own quote:
“I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.”
Actually, ambivalent mixed feelings are laced throughout his portrayal. On the other hand, President Truman, who made the final decision to drop the bombs, seems much more certain that this was the right thing to have done.
The Greek Prometheus myth is referenced in the title of the book upon which the movie is based.1 Prometheus is eternally punished by the gods for bringing the benefits and dangers of fire to humans.
There also seems to be an earlier reference to the Adam and Eve story about choosing knowledge over ignorance. In a startling scene from his college years, Oppenheimer leaves an apple he has poisoned on the desk of his tutor, but takes it away just in time. Apparently, that led to some required psychotherapy, with unclear results. Later, with Freud and other psychiatric books in the background, he begins a personal and sexual relationship with a woman in training to become a psychiatrist. He married another woman, but this affair continued until her death by apparent suicide in 1944 after he ended it.
He is viewed as a hero after the bomb’s success, though he regretted that it was not available earlier to help others against the Nazi genocidal goal. However, about a decade later he loses his security clearance under a Kangaroo court, which is only restored posthumously last year. Nevertheless, he still goes on to lead a productive think tank.
Probably most in our field would be interested in his character as a person, along with that of some of his colleagues. For “Oppie,” there are some startling and inventive depictions of flashbacks, dissociation, temptations, fears, brilliance, naivety, and flashing blue eyes.
The last part of the movie portrays organizational politics, with which I have had some familiarity, especially the danger of encountering combined jealously and humiliation. Some may also be reminded of the destructiveness of for-profit managed health care with its dual ethical allegiances.2
I am most reminded of the psychologist Timothy Leary and psychedelics. Psychedelics, it could be said metaphorically, is the atomic energy of the mind, with great potential for harm or benefits. In that respect, Leary is psychiatry’s Oppenheimer. Psychedelics were federally outlawed and he was imprisoned off and on by the 1970s. It appears that he never had second thoughts, nor moral reservations, about advocating and using them until his death in 1996. Recently, there is a second coming of their potential benefits.3
Now the world is confronting the potential benefits and harms of artificial inteligence. We in medicine and psychiatry try to follow the Hippocratic Oath of doing no harm. It is an ideal for living worth pursuing by anyone, because assessing harm versus benefits is part and parcel of most everything we do, whether that is done consciously or not.
In case you are wondering, as portrayed in the movie, did I think that the benefits of the bombing were worth the accompanying harms? With anguish, yes. Did I think that the harms, which seemed to be only minimally covered, could have been less and better addressed during and after the use of the atomic bombs? Yes. And you?

8/2/2023 18:59,'Oppenheimer' ticket prices go through the roof on resale market,"Tickets for ""Oppenheimer"" screenings in 70mm IMAX are being resold on Craigslist for as much as triple their value.","Cillian Murphy stars as J. Robert Oppenheimer in Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer.” People are reselling tickets for the popular blockbuster for triple their value on Craigslist. Universal
Jason, a 23-year-old reporter living in San Francisco, found himself in a conundrum earlier this week.
He had purchased tickets for one of the highly anticipated screenings of Christopher Nolan’s blockbuster “Oppenheimer” at the AMC Metreon, just one of a few theaters in the country to be showing it in 70mm IMAX, the way the director said it was intended to be seen.
But Jason realized he was double-booked. He had already promised his girlfriend he would see Alicia Keys with her in Oakland on the same night.
“I was kind of frantically looking to reschedule for this IMAX format,” said Jason, who requested SFGATE use only his first name for anonymity and was granted it in accordance with Hearst's ethics policy. “The marketing and everything said it was the best way to experience it. But all of the screenings were fully booked up.”

He wasn’t sure what to do with the pair of tickets, and he didn’t want them to go to waste. The day before the movie, a question popped into his mind: How much were they going for on Craigslist?
“I was pretty surprised when I saw the price points people were either selling or trying to buy tickets for,” he said. “It was hovering around $100 on average.”
Jason figured he could make something out of his missed opportunity and listed his own tickets at $50 each — almost quadruple what he had originally purchased them for at a discounted Tuesday rate of $13 each. Within 10 minutes, he received a couple of emails from people asking for more information on the seats. And over the course of the afternoon, his girlfriend helped him field requests from seven or eight other interested buyers.
He ultimately sold the tickets within four hours. (In the end, the man who purchased the tickets haggled the price down to $40 each.)

“It’s probably going to fund dinner before the concert tonight,” Jason said with a chuckle.
On Wednesday morning, there were at least 18 active posts on the San Francisco Bay Area Craigslist from people trying to either buy or sell tickets for the film, which is nearly sold out for the next few weeks and debuted at $80.5 million in its opening weekend.
Some of the hopeful buyers were still offering up to $100 to see the movie. “Looking for a single ticket to any Oppenheimer 70mm IMAX showing at AMC Metreon. Ideally middle of row L but any decent seat will do,” one post read.
Another post from a possible buyer offered as much as $150 for a pair of unclaimed tickets.

“Looking for 2 Oppenheimer tickets for 70mm IMAX at Metreon any day any time,” the post read, which included a Photoshopped image of star Cillian Murphy accompanied by glittering dollar signs. “Will pay over retail up to $150+ for good seats and date.”
The trend isn’t specific to San Francisco. A tweet went viral last week showing one Craigslist ad selling eight tickets at AMC Lincoln Square 13 in New York City for $1,400 altogether, as Decider first reported. They appeared to have sold — the post has since been removed.
On Tuesday, a manager at the AMC Metreon told SFGATE the theater had added more morning screenings of the film to accommodate for the high demand but declined to comment on moviegoers reselling tickets at increased rates. A corporate representative for AMC did not respond to SFGATE by time of publication.

The biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist known as the father of the atomic bomb, also stars Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon and Florence Pugh. It's showing in 70mm IMAX in just 19 theaters nationwide.
“The sharpness and the clarity and the depth of the image is unparalleled,” Nolan told the Associated Press in June. “The headline, for me, is by shooting on IMAX 70mm film, you’re really letting the screen disappear. You’re getting a feeling of 3D without the glasses... You’re filling the peripheral vision of the audience. You’re immersing them in the world of the film.”
In a separate interview with the New York Times, Nolan called out several IMAX theaters that would bring his vision to life, specifically referencing the AMC Metreon's ""wonderfully huge screen.”
Jason said he still hopes he gets his chance to see “Oppenheimer” on the big screen. He even considered driving 60 miles to Dublin, the only other IMAX theater in the Bay Area that was showing it in 70mm.

,Multifaceted marketing gives ‘Barbenheimer’ top billing,"Claudia Townsend, associate professor of marketing in the Miami Herbert Business School weighs in on the blockbuster roll out of the “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” movies that scored massive success at the box office.","In a dazzling showcase of movie marketing mastery, the much-anticipated summer movie releases of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” shattered expectations for the film industry, transforming an opening weekend into an unprecedented blockbuster phenomenon.
Combining the charm of a beloved doll with the captivating story of a visionary physicist, the two films broke records worldwide. Their rise to box office record-breaking numbers—“Barbie” pulling in $155 million and “Oppenheimer” making $82.4 million in their opening weekends—can be attributed to innovative and multifaceted marketing strategies.
Claudia Townsend, associate professor of marketing in the University of Miami Patti and Allan Herbert Business School, weighed in on the perfect storm that touted massive success in the theater by addressing some queries about the movies and their marketing strategies.
The release of Barbie and Oppenheimer, or “Barbenheimer,” as social media dubs the films, has had tremendous success. Why such a phenomenon?
It’s pretty interesting; usually, big movies do not try to release on the same day. Universal was coming out with “Oppenheimer” and Warner Brothers was coming out with “Barbie.” At first it was a question of which movie studio was going to change the date of release. Neither of them backed down. However, from a marketing point of view, that made sense. This is an example of counter-programming. One of the essential ideas of marketing is that a product, in this case a movie, has a target audience. And other products that may be in the same category but not going after the same target audience are not really competing with you. “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” are a great example of this as they have very different target audiences. And so, that meant that these movies really aren’t competing. Barbie’s audience is mostly female, and mostly younger, with 75 percent being younger than age 29. Oppenheimer’s audience is mostly male, and skews to an older clientele. The movies aren’t competing because they really aren’t going after the same people. Given this, it’s OK for them to release on the same day. But then, because they’re both such big movies with huge marketing budgets behind them, it actually created a moment and created a phenomenon, where the two movies together are bigger than the sum of their parts. So, by creating this Barbenheimer phenomenon, people are now talking about going to see both movies. You’re getting people who might have just seen “Barbie” also going to “Oppenheimer,” and people who might have only seen “Oppenheimer” also going to “Barbie.”
And then there’s this additional effect, which is to say, since COVID-19, the movie theaters have been desperate to get people back inside. There was this first moment around “Top Gun” that was kind of the first big movie after COVID-19, where consumers were going to the movie theaters in large numbers. And again, that was because there was this cultural moment around it. And now Barbenheimer is doing that again. People want to be a part of the conversation. Not only are people watching the movies, but they’re not waiting to see them at home. So, really, it’s kind of this perfect storm.
A nostalgia factor may have driven audiences to see “Top Gun.” What kind of factors are driving the fan craze behavior for these two films?
“Barbie” is the bigger movie for two reasons. First is that the marketing budget behind it was much bigger. “Oppenheimer,” while it is a big blockbuster movie and it’s got a lot of marketing behind it, is potentially benefiting more from being associated with “Barbie.”
Second, like “Top Gun,” the success of “Barbie” will be in part due to nostalgia. “Barbie” is a good example of where much of the film industry is focusing its attention right now. Movies are expensive and studios are investing in movies that have a preexisting built-in audience. That’s why you see the Marvel movies or other movies using characters that already have a built-in fan base. Barbie is a global brand. Everyone knows Barbie. But what’s interesting about “Barbie” is that, while people have strong feelings about Barbie, not everyone loves Barbie.
There has been generations of people saying, “I don't know if I want my daughter playing with Barbie.” The movie has done a really good job of addressing that. The movie couldn’t be about how great Barbie is. It also couldn’t just be bashing Barbie. It manages to thread the needle. The movie is really kind of upholding Barbie and what she stands for, but also addressing why people may not like her. Particularly for females, everyone knows about her and has some relationship with her. More often than not these days, we see movies being made where the studios can count on an audience going because there’s some history there. It’s very similar to the reason movie studios want to put a big-name star in their film. The star draws an audience. Barbie is a really big celebrity.
What kind of tactics did they use, especially on social media, that drove this craziness that movie marketers will probably look to emulate moving forward?
You wouldn’t be crazy to think that Barbie is a lifestyle brand. Meaning that right now, Barbie is in fashion, Barbie is in makeup, Barbie is in décor, Barbie is in travel. Right now, Barbie owns the color pink.
I think the marketing lesson is probably less about the movie but more about what you can do with a product and a moment. Along with the huge marketing budget behind this movie there was already this built-in base of understanding who Barbie is and what she stands for. There’s so much more to it than the movie when we see brands coming out with pink clothing or Barbie makeup. They’re referencing the movie because of the moment but they’re also referencing the bigger brand and the doll.
Is there anything else you want to add about the roll out of these movies and the significant impact that it has had on the movie industry?
We should consider Mattel’s role. The “Barbie” movie comes out of the toy company’s new film division. By creating this movie, the Barbie IP is now so much more valuable. What they have done has been enormously effective. Barbie is having a cultural moment and the meaning of Barbie is currently bigger than the actual product. This is marketing gold.
I think from the marketing perspective what’s interesting here is that Mattel has done something really difficult. We talked about brand positioning and what a brand stands for. Repositioning a brand is very difficult. Right now, Mattel is revamping and repositioning Barbie, without losing her original identity. She had this original identity of being pretty and pink but also kind of unattainable and potentially making people feel bad about themselves. I think what happened here was that Mattel really listened to the consumer, who for years had been kind of unhappy with Barbie. And Mattel tried to address the shortcomings of the product with the movie. In doing so, Mattel repositioned the brand. Barbie now has been repositioned to be a kind of feminist icon, and that's difficult to do. Reinventing a brand is incredibly difficult. That’s something that requires not just money, but great strategy. And it seems like they’ve been able to do that.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5taWFtaS5lZHUvc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLzA4L211bHRpZmFjZXRlZC1tYXJrZXRpbmctZ2l2ZXMtYmFyYmVuaGVpbWVyLXRvcC1iaWxsaW5nLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

All seven episodes of the Sam Waterston-led drama series from 1980 is now available in full on the BBC streaming service. Until now, the BAFTA-winning and Emmy-nominated series was only available to rent or purchase on Prime Video. Its release comes weeks after Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” movie began tearing up the box office with “Barbie” as part of the “Barbenheimer” cinematic event. “Oppenheimer” has now grossed more than $405 million in worldwide box office.
Distributed by BBC Studios, the TV show starred Waterston as the contemplative father of the atom bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and “Poirot” star David Suchet as the Los Alamos scientist Edward Teller. The cast was mainly comprised of American actors, who were all based in the U.K. at the time, save for Waterston.
Produced for $1.5 million (the equivalent of around $5.5 million today), the series filmed between the U.K. and U.S., and built an extensive set in Colorado Springs to depict Oppenheimer’s Los Alamos project, which housed the scientists of the Manhattan Project.
Variety recently uncovered the rich history of the show, which isn’t a commission you’d see from the BBC nowadays given its American subject matter.
“When [producer Peter Goodchild] put up ‘Oppenheimer’ as an idea, it was clearly an important subject matter, because it’s not just about the country we live in, but about the world that we live in,” said Ruth Caleb, who was a line producer on the series. “I think they trusted that Peter would come up with something pretty special.”
Goodchild’s research process for the series involved a trip to the U.S. with writer Peter Prince to meet Oppenheimer’s family and friends.
“It was an amazing story, and I’d always wanted to do it,” said Goodchild, a long-time editor on BBC science program ‘Horizon.’ “Someone suddenly presented me with a book about Oppenheimer and his relationship with one of his other scientific colleagues, which was an excellent story. I said, ‘I’d love to take it further.’ And we did.”
Added Peter Prince over email: “My abiding memory of the production is how nice Sam Waterston was to work with. I re-watched a couple of episodes to refresh my memory and was reminded again how good Sam was as the actor: he was the complex Oppenheimer — charming, conflicted and driven.”
“Oppenheimer” is now streaming on BBC iPlayer.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy90di9nbG9iYWwvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc2FtLXdhdGVyc3Rvbi1iYmMtaXBsYXllci0xMjM1Njg0NDU1L9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy90di9nbG9iYWwvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc2FtLXdhdGVyc3Rvbi1iYmMtaXBsYXllci0xMjM1Njg0NDU1L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Despite the clichés about its testosterone levels, Oppenheimer is much more than a biopic about the American physicist (played by Cillian Murphy) who ended up becoming the father of the atomic bomb. The thriller also narrates his tortuous relationship with psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, the most influential woman in Oppenheimer’s life, played by Florence Pugh. The young intellectual rebelled against the social conventions that restricted women at the time. Her early death is still the subject of theories and conspiracies today. Although many have tried to reduce her role to that of a mere mistress, the facts say otherwise. This is her tragic story.

Robert Oppenheimer met Tatlock during his tenure as a physics professor at UC Berkeley in California. He was good friends with her father, John, a renowned English professor on the faculty, and his 22-year-old, green-eyed, brown-haired firstborn daughter was already well known around the medical campus, where she was training to be a psychiatrist. The year was 1936, and to see a woman in a university classroom was still considered unusual, even more so one with Tatlock’s academic brilliance, life history — she had toured Europe studying psychoanalysis — and good looks. “We were all a bit jealous,” confirms a friend in the scientist’s biography. Despite the ten years’ difference that separated them, all of Oppenheimer’s close friends maintain that Oppenheimer fell in love with her as he never had before. “Jean was Robert’s truest love. He loved her more than anyone else. He was devoted to her,” said Robert Serber, a nuclear physicist and Oppie’s confidant. He proposed to Tatlock, unsuccessfully, at least twice.
The young woman’s sympathy for the Communist Party brought great headaches to the couple. Tatlock was placed under FBI surveillance on suspicion that she might be a source of radicalization for Oppenheimer or even a Soviet spy. Even after the young woman’s death, the physicist continued to be forced to deny these claims in harsh interrogations before the U.S. government. “Her party affiliation was intermittent and never seemed to provide her with what she was looking for. I don’t think her interests were really political. She loved her country, her people and her life,” he testified at a government hearing. The paranoia went so far that the notorious and controversial J. Edgar Hoover, in charge of the intelligence bureau, had the psychiatrist’s apartment phone tapped and her every move tracked.
Jean Tatlock and Robert Oppenheimer broke off their relationship in 1939. A few months later, the scientist met Katherine Kitty Puening, a biologist who had been married twice before and soon became his wife and the mother of the couple’s two children. Despite being married, Oppenheimer continued to see Tatlock, who was beginning to suffer increasingly acute depressive episodes. It is said that the doctor’s mental state worsened after the loss of contact with her great love. On June 14, 1943, after he began directing the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos that would culminate in the creation of the atomic bomb, he returned to San Francisco to spend what would be his last day with her. Followed by Army officers without his knowledge, Oppenheimer met Tatlock at the train station and, after kissing, they spent the entire day together. Reports certify that they turned off the lights in the young woman’s apartment at 11:30 p.m. After breakfast together again, the doctor drove Oppie to the airport to return to the military compound.
On January 4, 1944, Tatlock’s father came to the apartment after Tatlock had not answered the phone for several days. After climbing through a window to gain access, he found his daughter dead, her head submerged in a half-filled bathtub. She was 29 years old. Next to her was a note that read: “I am disgusted with everything. To those who loved me and helped me, all love and courage. I wanted to live and to give, and I got paralyzed somehow. I tried like hell to understand and couldn’t... I think I would have been a liability all my life — at least I could take away the burden of a paralyzed soul from a fighting world.” Although the conspiracy theory regarding Tatlock’s alleged murder has been stoked for nine decades on purely speculative grounds, some proven facts fuel that fire.

Once the young woman’s inert body was found, John Tatlock took it upon himself to burn all of his daughter’s correspondence and images before calling the funeral services, supposedly to clear her of any suspicion of links to communism. The autopsy, which determined that the cause of death had been asphyxiation by drowning, also revealed that there were no traces of alcohol in her blood and that none of the barbiturates the psychiatrist had taken had reached her vital organs at the time of her death. A doctor with access to the details of Tatlock’s death confessed to the authors of the book American Prometheus, on which Christopher Nolan’s film is based, that “if you’re smart and you want to kill someone, this is the right way to do it.” Her brother Hugh Tatlock always supported the assassination theory.
Peter De Silva, a CIA officer in charge of security at Los Alamos, was in charge of informing Oppenheimer of Jean’s death. The scientist was devastated after the news and went for a long walk. “He said he didn’t have anyone else he could talk to anymore,” De Silva said. Robert Oppenheimer dubbed the first atomic bomb test Trinity. As those close to him recounted, the name is an homage to a poem by John Donne that Jean Tatlock shared with him.

A new biopic is shedding light on rise and fall of ""the father of the atomic bomb"". But few people know that he spent many of his final days as a Caribbean castaway.
I was 20 years old and had J Robert Oppenheimer's house all to myself. From the porch of the small yellow cottage, four steps led down to the beach where coconut trees swooped low at the water's edge and the Evian-clear Caribbean gently lapped the sugar-white sand. Day after day, I'd hike here after work to marvel at the parrotfish, butterflyfish and hawksbill turtles that glided between the shallow coral reefs, never once seeing another soul.
To me, this deserted white-sand crescent was the perfect hideaway – just as it must have been for ""the father of the atomic bomb"" after World War Two.

When one of the year's most highly anticipated films, Oppenheimer, is released on 21 July, people around the world will get to witness the rise and stunning fall of the enigmatic scientist who unleashed a weapon so deadly it had the potential to destroy humanity. But while Oppenheimer publicly grappled with the moral consequences of his creation after World War Two, few people know that the political fallout that followed affected Oppenheimer's personal life so deeply that he spent many of his remaining days effectively hiding out on the tiny, remote island of St John in the US Virgin Islands.

""In 1945, after [the US military dropped an atomic bomb on] Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Oppenheimer was hailed as a national hero. His image was put on the cover of Time and Life [magazines] and he becomes America's most famous celebrity scientist,"" said Kai Bird, whose Pulitzer Prize-winning book, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer, written with the late Martin J Sherwin, inspired the new biopic. ""Then in 1954, he suddenly becomes a pariah and disappears from national life until virtually the day he dies.""

It was a great place to hide out and be anonymous

Today, the two-acre plot where the physicist disappeared and lived in a modest cottage part-time from 1955 until his death in 1967 is public land, known locally as Oppenheimer Beach. Though it doesn't appear on most tourist maps, it's regularly touted as one of the best beaches in the Virgin Islands and one of its best-kept secrets. Similarly, the little-known story of how Oppenheimer went from hero to villain to Caribbean castaway offers a fascinating glimpse into the life of one of the US' most famous scientists, and the island that ultimately shaped his final days.

From patriot to pariah

Oppenheimer's journey to St John began with the top-secret Manhattan Project, where he led the team who developed the first atomic bomb. As Bird explained, ""Oppenheimer's view of the gadget he was building never really changed. He was perfectly aware from the day he joined the Project in 1942 what a terrible thing it was, and that he was building a weapon that would have enormous destructive potential."" Instead, Oppenheimer, Albert Einstein and most leading physicists of the time were convinced the bomb's creation was inevitable, and that if Oppenheimer didn't create it, the Nazis would first.

""It was a race to build this weapon, and he thought if Hitler had it first, he would use it to win the war for fascism, which would be a terrible, tragic outcome. So, he felt compelled to do this,"" Bird said. ""Immediately after Hiroshima, he fell into a deep depression… he spent the rest of his life trying to warn humanity about the dangers of these weapons and the need to control them, so he had a very complicated relationship to this terrible thing that he himself was responsible for building.""

When the Soviets exploded their first atomic bomb in 1949, US President Harry Truman ordered American scientists to embark on a new programme to build a hydrogen bomb, whose nuclear explosion could be 1,000 times more powerful than an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer, the government's chief scientific advisor on nuclear policy and defence, objected on moral and practical grounds, reportedly telling Truman, ""I feel I have blood on my hands."" Oppenheimer's defiance ultimately made him a chief target of the US' anti-communist hysteria during the Cold War. In the spring of 1954, he endured an exhaustive four-week interrogation that questioned his US loyalty and ultimately stripped him of his security clearance. (The US government would ultimately clear his name 68 years later.)

According to Bird, a now-fully-white-haired Oppenheimer was left ""humiliated, terribly wounded and physically and psychologically exhausted"". So, that summer, the disgraced physicist left his Princeton, New Jersey, home, boarded a 72ft ketch with his wife and two children and set sail for St John.

""He was escaping – escaping the notoriety of being the father of the atomic bomb, but also the notoriety that plagued him after the '54 trial, the suspicions of disloyalty, of being a Communist or perhaps a spy,"" Bird said. ""When they saw the island for the first time, [Oppenheimer] fell in love with St John … so, he went back the following year and eventually found some property on the beach and built a very simple, spartan cabin, and it's where he spent the rest of his life – you know, many months of the year, both in the winter, but sometimes in the spring and summers … it wasn't about penance; it was about getting back to the physicality of the natural world.""

Oppenheimer's St John

St John couldn't be further from the life Oppenheimer left – and that was the point. Oppenheimer grew up in a posh home in Manhattan's Upper West side with three maids, a chauffeur and Van Gogh paintings hanging on the walls. When the family landed on the Manhattan-sized island in July 1954, Bird and Sherwin write that there were virtually no phones or electricity, and peacocks and donkeys roamed the dirt streets. St John had only been a US territory for 37 years and 90% of its 800 residents were the descendants of formerly enslaved people the island's previous Danish landlords had kidnapped from Africa to work on their sugar and cotton plantations. The island's first bar wouldn't be built for two more years, and its largest building was a one-storey West Indian gingerbread-style cottage.

""The reason they chose St John was because it was a backwater,"" said David W Knight Sr, a local historian whose family was good friends with the Oppenheimers and who housesat at their cottage when they were away. ""No one was going to harass [Robert]. No one knew who he was or cared. It was a great place to hide out and be anonymous. It's that simple.""

The Rockefeller connection Two years before Oppenheimer landed on St John, conservationist Laurence Rockefeller (son of business magnate John Rockefeller) visited. He was so struck by its natural beauty, he bought most of the island and eventually donated it to the US government for the creation of the Virgin Islands National Park.

In addition to anonymity, the Oppenheimers' great escape also served a practical purpose. As the scientist's possible communist ties came under scrutiny in the 1950s, the FBI wiretapped his New Jersey home, but as Bird and Sherwin write, ""The FBI found it impossible to keep Oppenheimer under surveillance while he was on St John.""

Knight also suggested that Oppenheimer's decision to relocate to St John was motivated by his increasing anti-nuclear stance. ""My parents often repeated the story that the reason why Oppenheimer had chosen the US Virgin Islands is that he was convinced that due to the trade winds, it would be one of the last places affected by nuclear fallout.""

In 1955, the Oppenheimers purchased land on Hawksnest Bay and hammered together a humble home on the beach. As Bird and Sherwin write, ""The gentlest part of Robert's nature was unfurled on St John."" The physicist wrote poetry at his desk facing the bay. He and his wife, Kitty, spent days sailing between the US and British Virgin Islands. Each September, the couple sent three dozen invitations to their friends for a New Year's Eve party, where they would serve lobster salad and Champagne, hire a local calypso band and Robert would dance on the beach before pointing out various constellations to guests.

""All sorts of people came – Blacks and whites, educated and uneducated. Robert made no distinction,"" Bird and Sherwin write. A former friend told the authors: ""He was the gentlest, kindest man I think I have ever met. I have never known anyone who felt or expressed less ill will to any other person.""

Yet, despite physically distancing himself from his past, Oppenheimer could never escape what he'd seen or done. One evening in 1961, Bird and Sherwin write that a friend of the Oppenheimers had gone swimming and caught a small hawksbill turtle. Over dinner, he displayed the squirming creature and announced he wanted to cook it. ""Wincing, Robert pleaded for the turtle's life, telling everyone that it 'brought back to him the horrible memories of what happened to all the creatures after the [first atomic bomb explosion] test in New Mexico'.""

Six years later, Oppenheimer would die of throat cancer at the age of 62. At his request, Kitty took her husband's ashes out in a boat towards Carval Rock, a tiny island he used to gaze out at from the cottage, and dropped them into Hawksnest Bay. When Kitty passed in 1972, her ashes were scattered at the same spot. Their daughter, Toni, suffered from depression but was especially fond of the island. In 1977, she took her life in the beach house her father built, but not before leaving a handwritten note on the bed, deeding the house and property ""to the people of St John"".

St John today

Nearly 70 years after Oppenheimer escaped to St John, it remains the smallest, most remote and least developed of the three US Virgin Islands (which also include St Thomas and St Croix). Thanks to Rockefeller's donation, two-thirds of St John remains a protected national park with gnarled forests and spiky cacti carpeting its mountains and more than 20 hiking trails crisscrossing its 20-square-mile terrain. There are no airports or cruise ship docks, and wild donkeys still roam free along the island's secluded eastern hills.

Unless you sail in on your own boat as the Oppenheimers did, visitors arrive at St John's main town, Cruz Bay, via the ferry from St Thomas, where most of the island's 3,880 residents live. From the dock, a fleet of open-air trucks-turned-taxis whisk travellers up North Shore Road, past the island's most famous resort, Caneel Bay, and its most popular beaches.

Fun fact The Virgin Islands is the only US territory where people drive on the left side of the road.

While Trunk Bay and its underwater snorkel trail is considered one of the world's finest beaches, it's also among the island's most crowded. Instead, if you're looking to escape the crowds as Oppenheimer did, look for a white-picket fence on the left-hand side of the road after Hawksnest Beach. There is no sign and only three parking spots – hence why Oppenheimer Beach is considered a locals-only secret. A few steps from the fence, an original black-iron gate reading ""Oppenheimer"" opens up to the turquoise bay.

""It's absolutely one of the most beautiful beaches in the USA. The water's so crystal-clear you can go in up to your neck and see your toes,"" said Bridgette Key, whose company Palm Tree Charters, guides travellers along St John's North Shore. ""But what makes it so special is it's so secluded.""

By the time I arrived on St John in 2003, the Oppenheimer home and property was still open ""to the people of St John"", but the inside was boarded up and abandoned. Years of pummelling hurricane-force winds eventually carried the cottage out to sea after I left, but in its place, a community centre now stands on the original foundation. Friends tell me that anyone can rent it out today for a picnic or wedding, and fittingly, calypso bands still play there.

""Although the house Oppenheimer lived in looks very different than the structure that is there today, it's easy to sit on the outdoor patio and take in a view similar to what Oppenheimer would have experienced,"" said Andrea Milam, a St John correspondent for the Virgin Islands Daily News newspaper. ""Perhaps the bay brought Oppenheimer peace and quietude as he sought to escape the magnitude of his impacts on the world.""

,US Army warns of large crowds at nuclear Trinity Site in NM due to 'Oppenheimer',"With the release of the Oppenheimer movie, it will be harder to visit the Trinity Nuclear Test site. Find out how to visit the site and see the film","Fans of ""Oppenheimer"" may find it difficult to visit the Trinity Site, the location of the world's first nuclear bomb detonation as featured in Christopher Nolan's latest film, released in theaters July 21.

The Trinity Site, located within White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, is only open to visitors two days each year: Oct. 21, 2023, and April 6, 2024.

In a statement by the United States Army, which operates the White Sands Missile Range, visitors were warned that ""due to the release of the movie Oppenheimer in July, we are expecting a larger than normal crowd at the 21 October open house.""

Those hoping to get a rare glimpse of Ground Zero of the Nuclear Age ""may experience wait times of up to two hours,"" the statement reads.

""If you are not one of the first 5,000 visitors,"" the Army advises, you might not make it through the Missile Range's Stallion Gate before closing at 2 p.m. The Trinity Site closes promptly at 3:30 p.m. on Oct. 21. The Stallion Gate, outside of San Antonio, New Mexico, is around a three-hour drive from El Paso.

Oppenheimer age rating

The Oppenheimer movie is about the creation of the world's first nuclear weapon and deals with themes of war and violence. For this heavy subject matter, along with nudity, some sexual content, and explicit language, the film is rated R.

Oppenheimer run time

If you want to catch a screening of Oppenheimer before you try your luck at the Trinity Site in October, be prepared for a movie run time even longer than the expected wait to get into the Missile Range: Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer movie is three hours long.

What is at Trinity Site, New Mexico?

The Trinity Site was chosen as a test location for the world's most deadly weapon by researchers like J. Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for its isolated desert environment. The landscape is as stark and empty as it was on July 16, 1945, when the bomb was tested.

Now an obelisk marks the exact location of the detonation, as well as some historical photographs and samples of trinitite — an extremely rare and ""glasslike substance that was created from the sand and other materials ... during the intense heat of that first atomic test,"" according to the Los Alamos National Laboratory's Bradbury Science Museum.

Is Trinity Site still radioactive?

After the bomb's explosion in 1945, the military encircled the Trinity Site with chain-link fencing to keep both White Sands Missile Range personnel and the public away from dangerous radiation. Just eight years later in 1953, however, the radiation levels were deemed safe and the first public open houses of the area began.

Today it is safe to visit the Trinity Site, a public affairs specialist with White Sands Missile Range assured the El Paso Times in a 2018 interview. ""If it wasn't,"" she added, ""we wouldn’t open it to the public.”

Why is the Trinity Site only open twice a year?

Although the Trinity Site is a National Historic Landmark, representing ""an outstanding aspect of American history and culture,"" it is located within the White Sands Missile Range, a highly active and restricted site for the U.S. Department of Defense.

Public access to the Trinity site is only open twice a year to comply with the military's frequent weapons testing at White Sands.

,Nichols and Mason: The impact of two former Oak Ridgers on Oppenheimer,Carolyn Krause continues her research into J. Robert Oppenheimer and the connection to Oak Ridge.,"D. Ray Smith

Historically Speaking

Carolyn Krause continues her research into J. Robert Oppenheimer. She uses both the movie “Oppenheimer” by Christopher Nolan, and the book on which it is based, “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin.

Enjoy her review:

***

Because of the excitement about the Christopher Nolan biopic “Oppenheimer” that was first shown in Oak Ridge on July 21 and the earlier reprinting of my 2022 Historically Speaking columns on Oppenheimer’s beneficial impact on Oak Ridge and his unfortunate experiences with Maj. Gen. Kenneth Nichols, a former Oak Ridger, I was asked by Becky Dodson to give a talk on Oppie to the Oak Ridge Sunset Rotary Club. My title was this: “How Oppenheimer Made Oak Ridge Famous … and How a Former Oak Ridger Helped Humiliate Him … and How a Former Oak Ridger Helped Restore His Honor.”

This invitation to speak on July 24 inspired me to see the movie and read many of the 600 pages of the Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biography of the “father of the atomic bomb” that the movie is based on: “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin. After seeing the captivating movie, I decided that to fully grasp the complex Oppenheimer story, it is worthwhile to watch it two or three times and to read the book, which was researched and written over 25 years.

Oppenheimer (1904-67) made Oak Ridge famous, I told the Rotarians, because of his actions that ensured that enough enriched uranium was produced to be the fuel for the first atomic bomb used in war, which was detonated over Hiroshima, Japan, on Aug. 6, 1945, helping to end World War II.

Otherwise, the fuel for the first atomic bomb would likely have been plutonium, as was the case for the second atomic bomb, which was dropped Aug. 9, 1945, on Nagasaki, Japan. The movie does not show the terrifying explosions that killed more than 200,000 people, but it does reveal that Oppie agreed that the bomb should be dropped on a city to shock humankind into ending nuclear war for all time.

For Oak Ridge, Oppenheimer, the scientific director of the Manhattan Project and director of Los Alamos laboratory, created many jobs as he pushed successfully for two projects: the expansion of the electromagnetic separation of uranium isotopes at the Y-12 plant and for the rapid “just in time” construction of the liquid thermal diffusion S-50 plant close to the K-25 plant that enriched uranium by gaseous diffusion. The three plants were a winning combination – they produced just enough bomb-grade material, enriched with the rare uranium-235 isotope that undergoes fission, to create the world’s first atomic bomb, making Oak Ridge internationally known as the secret city that helped defeat Japan. and end the war. These actions are not mentioned in the movie.

The culmination of the movie is the successful detonation of the first atomic bomb, which was a secret demonstration, not a wartime use. On July 16, 1945, he and his colleagues joyfully celebrated the secret Trinity explosion over the New Mexico desert of the atomic bomb called “Gadget.” The awesome light show of the mushroom cloud followed by ear-splitting shock waves demonstrated that the Los Alamos researchers’ second weapon design worked with plutonium from Hanford, Washington. But then Oppie had second thoughts about the first atomic bomb. He is said to have quoted the Bhagavad Gita, uttering “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.”

After that, he opposed the development of the much more powerful hydrogen bomb and advocated for international arms control even as the Soviet Union tested an A-bomb in 1949 and a hydrogen (thermonuclear) bomb in 1953, a year after the first U.S. H-bomb developed under Edward Teller was tested. (The Soviet H-bomb was more explosive.)

So in 1954, because of his opposition to H-bomb work, his unwelcome advice on how to prevent future detonations of a weapon of mass destruction that he showed was possible, and his Communist connections, the Atomic Energy Commission stripped him of his security clearance as an AEC consultant. The inquiries leading up to this tragic event for Oppie were covered throughout the movie.

Sadly, Oak Ridge is mentioned only twice in the movie; there was a comment that construction had started here and another about uranium being sent from Oak Ridge to Los Alamos.

Oak Ridge is not listed in the index of the “American Prometheus” book. I was disappointed that two important Manhattan Project developments described on page 278 failed to mention Oak Ridge’s involvement. Oppenheimer’s realization that his boss, Gen. Leslie Groves, made a mistake in not pushing for the construction of the S-50 thermal diffusion plant and his success in convincing Groves to order that it be built is described in detail on that page.

“After sitting on Oppie’s recommendation for a month, Groves agreed to explore it,” Bird and Sherwin wrote. “A plant was rushed into production, and by the spring of 1945 it was producing just enough extra, partially enriched uranium to guarantee a sufficient amount of physical material for one bomb by the end of July 1945.”

Also, on page 278 the authors wrote, “In July 1944, however, it became clear from tests performed on the first small supplies of plutonium that an efficient plutonium bomb could not be triggered within the ‘gun-barrel’ design. Indeed, any such attempt would undoubtedly lead to a catastrophic pre-detonation inside the plutonium gun.”

The book does not state that the “small supplies of plutonium” were produced successfully at the Graphite Reactor in Oak Ridge by neutron irradiation of the uranium slugs, followed by chemical separation. The plutonium was sent to Los Alamos in a briefcase handcuffed to a courier who rode there in a car and train.

That plutonium sample led to the realization that the Los Alamos scientists could use the gun-barrel weapon design only for a uranium bomb; in this weapon, a uranium projectile is shot at a uranium target to achieve criticality. They had to pivot toward perfecting an implosion design for a plutonium bomb in which a plutonium sphere is compressed enough to achieve criticality by the forces of surrounding explosives. The stressful year-long effort leading to the Trinity implosion bomb test is covered at some length in the movie.

Oppie’s chief adversary was Lewis Strauss, AEC chairman, who later aspired to be secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Strauss disliked Oppie for multiple reasons, including his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb.

But the movie also made Lt. Col. Nichols, who is somewhat of a hero in Oak Ridge, look bad as he delayed giving Oppie a security clearance at Los Alamos and then supported revoking it as a major general and general manager of AEC.

Nichols was the former Oak Ridger who helped humiliate Oppenheimer; he could have let suffice the three-man personnel security review board’s recommendation to the AEC that Oppie’s security clearance be revoked. Instead, wrote Bird and Sherwin, Nichols reinterpreted the board’s narrative: “In effect, Nichols retried Oppenheimer, dismissed the Gray Board’s majority opinion, and presented the AEC commissioners with an entirely new basis for removing Oppenheimer’s security clearance.”

Nichols argued that Oppie had lied to the security board in 1954 and that he was “not reliable or trustworthy.” Furthermore, Oppie’s lawyers were not allowed to see and comment on whatever evidence was in Nichols’ letter before the AEC voted 4-1 for revocation.

Former ORNL director comes to the rescue

Fortunately, another former Oak Ridger has come to the rescue. Thom Mason, who was director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory from 2007 to 2017 and is now director of Los Alamos National Laboratory, wrote an influential letter last year to the U.S. Department of Energy, the successor of AEC, that was signed by eight former Los Alamos lab directors.

In April 2022, Mason and the eight former Los Alamos directors delivered a signed letter to Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm offering their perspective on Oppenheimer’s clearance. They strongly suggested that the DOE nullify the AEC’s decree as an “historically appropriate remedy” to the egregious errors committed by the personnel security review board and asked the DOE to issue an apology.

“Although this brings no peace to Dr. Oppenheimer, who died long ago, it brings needed perspective to the real truth of his legacy, integrity and moral courage,” Mason said. “It also sends a message that while the U.S. government takes security seriously and expects truthfulness, it must reciprocate with a fair analysis and principled decisions.”

In December 2022, a few days after a trailer for “Oppenheimer” was released, Energy Secretary Granholm nullified the 1954 decision to revoke Oppenheimer’s clearance. She cited a “flawed process” that violated the AEC’s own regulations.

“More evidence has come to light of the bias and unfairness of the process that Dr. Oppenheimer was subjected to,” Granholm said, “while the evidence of his loyalty and love of country have only been further affirmed.”

In defense of Nichols (1907-2000), who was second in command to Groves as a military director of the Manhattan Project, he served capably in his job overseeing the construction and operation of nuclear fuel plants at Oak Ridge and Hanford.

In 1942, he traveled to New York City and purchased 1,200 tons of uranium ore from Edgar Sengier, who owned a uranium mine in Belgian Congo and did not want the Nazis to get the ore for possible use in building the first atomic bomb for wartime use. The purchased ore was sent from a Staten Island warehouse to various plants for processing on its way to the Y-12 electromagnetic separation plant.

The second important effort Nichols made before he was promoted and before he moved to 103 Olney Lane in Oak Ridge in August 1943 was to travel to West Point in New York to borrow 14,700 tons of silver. Because of the wartime copper shortage, the silver was needed for the electrical conductors and bus bars in Y-12’s electromagnets.

When Nichols made his request to Daniel Bell, undersecretary of the U.S. Treasury Department, Bell said, “We think of silver in terms of troy ounces, not tons.” So, Nichols made a quick calculation and replied, ‘Okay, I need 300 million troy ounces of silver for the war effort.”

I highly recommend the “American Prometheus” book and “Oppenheimer” movie. Both are thought provoking. Should scientists work for the government if their reasonable dissent that should be considered for sound decision-making could be equated with disloyalty? How can we ensure that our inventions and discoveries serve us without destroying us? It's a question that artificial intelligence researchers and others are asking today.

The acting in the movie by Cillian Murphy (Oppenheimer), Matt Damon (General Groves), Robert Downey Jr. (Lewis Strauss), Emily Blunt (Kitty Oppenheimer) and others is outstanding, as they convey the compelling story of how, like Prometheus, Oppie captured atomic fire from the heavens and was punished for it by powerful government figures. But I have a warning for older people as well as young people enjoying supersized drinks during the movie. Beware that this three-hour blockbuster is a potential bladder buster. But you won’t want to go because that would disturb your attention to this gripping movie’s flow!

Thank you, Carolyn. Keith McDaniel and I interviewed Kai Bird on “Hidden History: Stories from the Secret City” recently. Kai also was involved in the effort that led to the Secretary of Energy “vacating” the process that removed Oppenheimer’s security clearance. He also credits Thom Mason.

,From 'Barbie' to 'Oppenheimer': Columbia Connections to This Summer's Blockbusters You Should Know,,"Brian De Palma (CC’62), known as a “master of the unexpected,” according to Columbia College Today, was at the helm of the first 1996 film, which was heralded as a sweeping spectacle. De Palma is the man behind such mainstream box office hits as Scarface, Carrie, and The Untouchables, but he is also known for cult favorites such as Carlito’s Way, Phantom of Paradise, and Sisters. For those of you Bruce Springsteen fans, he also directed The Boss in the “Dancing in the Dark” music video.

“We all wanted to get into the studio system,” De Palma told Indiewire in 2016. “I was the most iconoclastic of the group who was most disenchanted with the studio system, because it had a really corrosive effect on what you did. They basically want you to duplicate the same thing over and over again. I always felt that was not good for an artist. I would fall in and out of the studio system. But you need to make hits in order to make movies. So I would go in and make a hit, be able to make a couple of weird movies, then have to start over again.”

All Mission: Impossible movies are streaming on Paramount+, so why not head back to where it all began?

Oppenheimer

We are nothing if not thorough here at Columbia News. Although we can’t find a clear Columbia filmmaking connection to Christopher Nolan’s three-hour epic about American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic bomb, opening July 21, Columbia does have a strong connection to the Manhattan Project and the research that preceded it. You can read more about II Rabi, Enrico Fermi, Edward Teller, Leo Szilard, Robert Serber (who are all portrayed in the film), and more groundbreaking physicists' work at Columbia here.

Consequently, we also uncovered the fact that Oppenheimer himself once gave a radio address for the Columbia University Bicentennial Celebration in 1954.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5jb2x1bWJpYS5lZHUvbmV3cy9iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY29sdW1iaWEtY29ubmVjdGlvbnMtc3VtbWVycy1ibG9ja2J1c3RlcnMteW91LXNob3VsZC1rbm930gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,'The danger never goes away': Christopher Nolan didn't intend for Oppenheimer movie to be so timely,"Known as the father of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer changed the course of history. Now, director Christopher Nolan takes his story to the screen - but does the three-hour epic pull it off? Critics think so.","The world's first nuclear explosion happened on 16 July 1945, when a plutonium implosion device was tested in New Mexico.

Now a new film about the so-called father of the atomic bomb, J Robert Oppenheimer, looks at how he came to create a weapon that would change the world and how it changed him.

Decades since its invention, as Russia's war rages in Ukraine, the weapon's threat to the world is back in people's minds.

Director Christopher Nolan, who also wrote the movie, basing it on the Pulitzer Prize winning book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin, told Sky News he never meant for his film to be so timely.

""I had a conversation with one of my teenage sons about what I was working on and he literally said to me - 'Does anybody really worry about nuclear weapons anymore? Is that really a thing in the world?'

""To which I said, 'Well, maybe that's a reason for making the film but beyond that, it's just a very, very dramatic story about how our world changed forever'.

""Two years later, he's not asking that question anymore and neither is anybody else for all the worst possible reasons, and that's symptomatic of our relationship with the threat of nuclear weapons and nuclear holocaust - it ebbs and flows with geopolitical shifts in a way that it shouldn't - I mean, the danger never goes away.""

To inhabit the role of Oppenheimer, Peaky Blinders star Cillian Murphy lost weight and perfected a new accent and also had to learn about quantum physics and grapple with Oppenheimer's morality.

""Actors love getting jobs and then they're dying to finish them, that seems to be the way,"" Murphy told Sky News.

""So, yeah, it was time for a holiday after that for sure, if you do anything for like 17, 18 hours a day and you're in that and you're on set all the time, naturally there will be a cost and then you feel at the end there's all this displaced energy and you're not quite sure what to do with it, and you start moving furniture around.""

Nolan interjects: ""And have a sandwich"".

For the director, known for movies including Intersteller, Inception and Dunkirk - and who has a reputation for shunning digital effects and greenscreen - it wasn't recreating a nuclear explosion that posed a challenge.

Instead, he says he found the casting process daunting.

""The ensemble - with Cillian at the heart of it as Oppenheimer - but then his interactions with this entire team of people coming together to pull off this, you know, impossible feat, that was a challenge for me.

""Doing these group discussions, these arguments, these interpersonal relationships and all of that, all of which came into such a kind of hothouse atmosphere with the Manhattan Project and everything they had to do in the years that they were there.

""That was something I'd never really taken on before.""

The extremely positive early reviews for Oppenheimer suggest Nolan rose to that challenge.

But now, with promotion for the film interrupted by the US actor's strike, it remains to be seen whether audiences will have the appetite for a three-hour epic about the creation of the atomic bomb - the end of the world perhaps too close for comfort to be considered entertainment.

2023-07-24 18:41:56+00:00,"Every Christopher Nolan Movie Ranked From Worst to Best, Including ‘Oppenheimer’","All 12 Christopher Nolan movies ranked, including 'The Dark Knight,' 'The Prestige,' 'Tenet' and 'Inception.'","With the release of Oppenheimer, it’s time to rank all of director Christopher Nolan‘s movies from worst to best (BWAAAAAHM!). This wasn’t an easy task. Unlike ranking five Indiana Jones movies or seven Mission: Impossible films, Nolan offers 12 films that range from historical dramas (Dunkirk, Oppenheimer), to sci-fi thrillers (Interstellar, Tenet) to mysteries (The Prestige, Memento) to his Batman trilogy. Through it all, Nolan has risen to become one of the world’s finest filmmakers, one of the few who can dependably fill theater seats on an opening weekend, and is considered the last respite for grown-up cinema fans. Here are all of Nolan’s films, from the weakest to the strongest.

12. Insomnia (2002)

It says a lot about Nolan that the “worst” film he directed is still rather good and worth watching. Insomnia is a remake of the Norwegian title and is perhaps notable that it’s the only movie Nolan directed that he didn’t also write or co-write. Here, a veteran Los Angeles detective (Al Pacino) teams with a small-town investigator (Hilary Swank) to solve a murder in remote Alaska. It’s a nice, moody detective drama, but it lacks Nolan’s usual ambitious scope.

11. Following (1998)

Nolan’s debut feature, made for a reported $6,000, showed all the promise for the then-20-something director. Shot in black-and-white, it features some themes Nolan would continue to explore for decades to come. Its protagonist is a single-minded obsessive alienated from society who follows a code (sound familiar?), and it has a twisty third act and smart expositional dialogue that rings Nolan. The feature centers on a man who follows strangers around London and becomes embroiled in more than he expected after breaking his rule never to follow the same person twice. At just 70 minutes, some might argue it’s not a feature-length movie, but Nolan — who put three years of his life into scraping it together — has said it’s just as valid as anything he’s done.

10. Tenet (2020)

John David Washington is compelling as a secret agent trying to prevent World War III — a war between the present and future. Tenet feels like a collection of Nolan’s most frustrating habits — from an oppressive soundscape that eclipses dialogue, to stylish yet flat characters, to a narrative that’s twisty to the point of sometimes losing the audience. Still, Tenet earns some admittedly shallow points for looking cool and sounding cool and trying gamely to do something original with time travel. (THR’s review.)

9. The Dark Knight Rises (2012)

Tom Hardy is marvelous as the menacing terrorist Bane and there are some strong sequences in the climax to Nolan’s Batman trilogy (such as the plane hijacking opener, and Bruce’s trial in The Pit). Also, the film deserves credit for thinking big — criminals entirely taking over Gotham City is a storyline that really goes for it (so long as you don’t think too much about the believability of a police force being conveniently trapped in a sewer for months). (THR’s review.)

8. Memento (2000)

The one that got everybody’s attention: Nolan’s sophomore effort (co-written with his brother Jonathan) is a twisty noir thriller starring Guy Pearce as a man unable to make new memories trying to solve his wife’s murder. It’s a compelling puzzle that showed a filmmaker who can blend an accessible genre movie with a challenging narrative and pull it off, all leading to an ending that’s, well, unforgettable.

7. Dunkirk (2017)

Dunkirk is masterfully well made from its very first shot, which smash cuts into falling leaflets on a street amid a ticking clock as British World War II soldiers attempt to flee the Germans as they invade France. Nolan’s skill in staging action is on display in one gripping sequence after another. Yet several of the heroes feel unknowable and interchangeable, which keeps the audience at an emotional distance even as Nolan employs every sweeping cinematic technique to pull us close. (THR’s review.)

6. Interstellar (2014)

Nolan is often accused of being a cold filmmaker — and can be. But there’s nothing aloof about Matthew McConaughey’s powerful performance as an astronaut who leaves behind his daughter in a quest to save humanity by finding a new world to replace a dying Earth. While the story has some plot holes (OK, a lot), the resulting combination of 2001: A Space Odyssey-inspired cinematic wonder and its emotional heft make this one of Nolan’s most popular films (and currently his most successful non-superhero title at the box office). (THR’s review.)

5. Inception (2010)

From here on, Nolan is hitting home runs. Inception has Nolan putting together so many of his signature talents into one original blockbuster as it follows Leonardo DiCaprio as a man who implants false memories for his corporate clients. It’s visually spectacular, exceedingly clever and has the filmmaker’s coolest ending shot. While Hans Zimmer’s score became a meme for that iconic bwaaaahm, it’s also one of the composer’s greatest efforts (see “Time”). (THR’s review.)

4. Batman Begins (2005)

The first hour of Batman Begins is a fantastic launch to not only a grown-up Dark Knight trilogy but also a re-imagining of what superhero movies can be, if they’re treated like larger-than-life crime dramas with practical effects instead of quip-filled, save-the-world, CGI-fueled dramedies. Christian Bale quickly proved he’s a fine successor to the cowl and there’s never been a better Alfred than Michael Caine, even though the film’s final act staggers a bit.

3. The Prestige (2006)

The Prestige is a marvelous mystery based on Christopher Priest’s novel about dueling turn-of-the-century obsessive magicians with terrific performances by a dogmatic Bale, a searing Hugh Jackman (“You don’t know?!“), and an all-too-wise Caine. The Nolan brothers’ script uses voiceover and narrative in such a confident and propulsive way, and there’s an ending twist you’ll never see coming.

2. Oppenheimer (2023)

Oppenheimer is too long, overly chatty and its final act goes from fate-of-the-world stakes to men sitting around tables arguing over a security clearance (imagine if Batman defeated the Scarecrow in Batman Begins and then spent another 40 minutes discussing how to best fix Gotham City’s damaged monorail system). And yet, Nolan uses every well-honed instrument in his toolbox to create a dramatic masterpiece that has something that his other, more pulpy films largely lack: modern-day, real-world importance. In the film, based on the biography American Prometheus, Nolan successfully tells the story of a major historical figure, champions science and movingly reminds the world of the dangers of weapons of mass destruction. The score by Ludwig Göransson might be the best yet for a Nolan film. And Nolan’s hellish post-Trinity test pep rally scene is perhaps the most cleverly directed and emotionally powerful sequence of his career. (THR’s review and cover story.)

1. The Dark Knight (2008)

Because you’re never going to watch Oppenheimer as many times as you’ve probably already watched The Dark Knight — as the clown says, it’s “just too much fun.” It’s still the best superhero movie ever made, with Heath Ledger delivering a legendary (and posthumous Oscar-winning) performance as the Joker that looms over every frame, despite only appearing in 33 minutes of the 152-minute film. The script (by the Nolan brothers, along with David S. Goyer) is fantastic, with so many iconic lines (“You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain” … “It’s all part of the plan…”). Every supporting cast member pops, Zimmer’s score is ominously tense, and the action sequences are grounded and effective. So many of Nolan’s movies have lengthy run times, but this is one you don’t want to end. (THR’s review.)

The story has deep connections to Chicago — specifically the University of Chicago — and the Manhattan Project that led to the development of the first atomic bomb.

Below is a Q&A with John Mark Hansen, professor of political science at the University of Chicago who has done extensive research on the birth of the nuclear age in Hyde Park’s “atomic village.”

(The interview has been edited for length and clarity.)

WTTW News: How did Chicago come to be the epicenter of research to make a self-sustaining nuclear reaction — the first step toward making an atomic bomb?

John Mark Hansen: Well, it was largely happenstance. The happenstance was that when the authorities in Washington who had been working on the development of nuclear power after the creation of the Manhattan Project in 1939, they decided that they would designate the first stage in the project to be under the direction of Arthur Compton, who was a professor of physics here at the University of Chicago and Nobel laureate, the chair of the physics department and the dean of the physical sciences division. And it was Compton then who within a month or so made the decision to gather all of the people he needed for that first stage of the project in Chicago. And so he was the one who asked Fermi and his group to come to Chicago.

Tell me a little bit about why Compton, because obviously, there are so many names that we are familiar with. We’re familiar with Oppenheimer. Obviously, we’re familiar with the Fermi. I don’t think as many people would know Compton. Why was Compton the man designated to get this project off the ground?

Hansen: Well, Compton was part of a group of physicists who were involved in an earlier project called the Uranium Project. He was asked by the government authorities in 1941 to produce a report about the feasibility of creating an atomic weapon and what the timetable would look like. So he was the chair of that committee, and I think it was kind of a natural extension then to ask him to be the one to lead it.

You’ve written about Hyde Park’s “atomic village.” Did the scientists talk about it in those terms at the time or is that something applied in retrospect? Is that how they thought of themselves?

Hansen: No, not really. That’s a name that I have given it in retrospect. You know, there were atomic villages that were built at Oak Ridge in Tennessee, at Hanford, in Washington and at Los Alamos in New Mexico. What I thought interesting about the group of scientists assembled here was that they weren’t segregated off from the rest of society the way they were at the other three sites. They lived out in the community and they did their work on a college campus not in a specially designed laboratory.

I can understand why they isolated the folks at Los Alamos and the other places you mentioned for security reasons. So why didn’t they do that in terms of the folks who were working in Chicago? It just seems like it would be a huge security risk.

Hansen: Well, part of it was just that they needed to get this going fast and they didn’t have anything built yet. So that’s one answer. Another answer is that they had originally, or Compton himself had originally wanted, to build the nuclear reactor that achieved the first sustainable chain reaction in 1942 — he had originally wanted to put that out at in part of the Argonne Woods Forest Preserve out in Palos Park. But the contractor didn’t get it done on time. And so it ended up being done under the West Grandstand of Stagg Field here on the campus just because they didn’t want to further delay the project.

Did all of the scientists who were working on the project have a clear notion that the end goal was to create a weapon?

Hansen: Every scientist who had a significant responsibility knew that that was the end point.

So after the first chain reaction had been achieved in Chicago, did many of the folks who were working in Chicago, were they transferred to Los Alamos?

Hansen: Yes. So a significant number were and there was a group that went to Oak Ridge, there was a group that went to Hanford and there was a group that went to Los Alamos. Oftentimes, on the way to Los Alamos, having been either at Oak Ridge or at Hanford in between.

It seems a very short period of development to go from that first chain reaction to within, I think it was 2.5 years, the Trinity test. How was that possible? Was it the fact that the government was just throwing so much in terms of personnel and money at this project?

Hansen: Well, a big part of it was that there was no expense that was spared in developing the bomb. But I would also say that Compton in his report about the timetable to the development of the bomb pretty much called it exactly right. He said that the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction could probably be achieved by early 1943 and the first battlefield weapons by sometime in 1945. So, it was anticipated even years in advance that that would be about the amount of time that would be required.

Obviously Oppenheimer himself was famously conflicted about this power he had helped to develop. Was that shared by many of his colleagues? I assume there was a range of opinions — they had achieved this incredible objective and created a weapon that ultimately did end the war. How did they feel about it?

Hansen: Well, as one might imagine, I think that there were differences in the degree to which the scientists who were involved in it felt conflicted. There were many scientists who were involved in the project who wish that we’d gotten there earlier so that the bomb might have played a role in ending the war in Europe sooner. A large number of the scientists in fact emigrated from Europe, many of them Germans who had been forced out of Germany by the Nazi regime. Many of them were Jewish and had relatives who perished and certainly friends who perished in the Holocaust. You know, on the other side, there were many scientists who were concerned not so much about having participated in the development of the bomb but not having any control over how that knowledge and how that science would be used.

So here at the Metallurgical Lab at the University of Chicago, starting in 1944, there was a major effort by the scientists to begin to sound alarms and to convince the government to begin to think about how to put in place controls over the development and use of nuclear energy. There was a lot of concern even in 1944 about the prospect of an arms race once it became known that there was such a thing as an atomic bomb. And that led in 1945 and into 1946 into a sustained effort on the part of the atomic scientists led by the people here at the Met lab to create a governance structure for nuclear energy development that would be accountable to democratically elected public officials and be accountable to the public.

In terms of the film, I don’t know whether you’ve had a chance to see it yet, but do you think the interest it has generated in the story of Oppenheimer and the development of the atomic bomb — is it a good thing that people are relearning this history?

Hansen: I think so. It certainly is going to raise awareness of the continuing issues of nuclear proliferation and of the prospects of nuclear confrontations — probably not in the places that we once thought about, but rather in places like South Asia or in East Asia. So that’s one thing I. I think the other thing it really puts on the agenda is the questions about the dangers in the development of technology and how one contains those dangers. And those are still with us. You know there are lots of technologies out there that could have far-reaching social effects and sort of bringing back to the public’s attention the way in which nuclear scientists really wrestled with the dictates of their conscience at the same time that they were developing these technologies I think that has many lessons for us as well.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and other organizations are hosting a special showing of “Oppenheimer” at the Music Box Theatre on July 29, followed by a post-movie panel conversation.

2023-08-08 04:54:32+00:00,"Beyond Barbie and Oppenheimer, how do cinemas make money? And do we pay too much for movie tickets?","Movie tickets are nearly always the same price, whether the film is a flop or a sold-out blockbuster. Why? And how much more does a trip to the movies cost than 20 years ago?","I’ve got two questions about blockbuster movies like Barbie and Oppenheimer.

Why aren’t the cinemas charging more for them, given they’re so popular? Why are they the same price, given Oppenheimer is an hour longer?

The opening weekend for both films saw an avalanche of Australians returning to the cinema. Extra staff had to be put on (although probably not enough) to manage queues, turn away pink-clad fans who couldn’t get in, and clean up mountains of popcorn trampled underfoot.

An obvious solution to such a rush of demand is to push up prices. Airlines do it when they are getting low on seats. When more people want to get a ride share, Uber makes them pay with “surge pricing”.

Even books are sold at different prices, depending on the demand, their length, their quality and how long they’ve been on the shelves.

But not movie tickets, which are nearly always the same price, no matter the movie. Why? And how much has the cost of a trip to the movies risen over the past 20 years?

Why not charge more for blockbusters?

In suburban Melbourne, Hoyts is charging $24.50 for the two-hour Barbie – the same as it is charging for the three-hour Oppenheimer, even though it could fit in far fewer showings of Oppenheimer in a day. It’s also the same price as it is charging for much less popular movies, such as Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.

It’s also how things are in the United States, where James Surowiecki, author of The Wisdom of Crowds blames convention and says

it costs you as much to see a total dog that’s limping its way through its last week of release as it does to see a hugely popular film on opening night.

Australian economists Nicolas de Roos of The University of Sydney and Jordi McKenzie of Macquarie University quote Surowiecki in their 2014 study of whether cinema operators could make more by cutting the price of older and less popular films and raising the price of blockbusters.

By examining what happened to demand on cheap Tuesdays, and developing a model taking into account advertising, reviews and the weather, they discovered Australian cinemas could make a lot more by varying their prices by the movie shown. We turn out to be highly price sensitive. So why don’t cinemas do that?

‘There’s a queue, it must be good’

It’s the sort of thing that puzzled Gary Becker, an economic detective of sorts who won the Nobel Prize for Economics in the early 1990s. A few years earlier, he turned his attention to restaurants and why one particular seafood restaurant in Palo Alto, California, had long queues every night but didn’t raise its prices.

Across the road was a restaurant that charged slightly more, sold food that was about as good, and was mostly empty.

His conclusion, which he used a lot of maths to illustrate, was there are some goods for which a consumer’s demand depends on the demand of other consumers.

Queues for restaurants (or in 2023, long queues and sold out sessions, as crowds were turned away from Barbie) are all signals other consumers want to get in.

This would make queues especially valuable to the providers of such goods, even if the queues meant they didn’t get as much as they could from the customers who got in. The “buzz” such queues create produces a supply of future customers persuaded that what was on offer must be worth trying.

Importantly, Becker’s maths showed that getting things right was fragile. It was much easier for a restaurant to go from being “in” to “out” than the other way around. Once a queue had created a buzz, it was wise not to mess with it.

Cashing in from the snack bar

There are other reasons for cinemas to charge a standard ticket price, rather than vary it movie by movie.

One is that it is hard to tell ahead of time which movies are going to soar and which are going to bomb, even if you spend a fortune on advertising as the makers of Barbie did. In the words of an insider, “nobody knows anything.”

Another is the way cinemas make their money. They have to pay the distributor a share of what they get from ticket sales (typically 35-40%). But they don’t have to pay a share of what they make from high-margin snacks.

This means it can make sense for some cinemas to charge less than what the market will bear – because they’ll sell more snacks – even if it means less money for the distributor.

Rising prices, despite some falling costs

But cinemas still charge a lot. From 2002 to 2022, Australian cinemas jacked up their average (not their highest) prices from $9.13 to $16.26 – an increase of 78%.

In the same 20 year period, overall prices in Australia, as measured by the consumer price index, climbed 65% – less than the rise in movie ticket prices.

A 2015 study found Australian cinemas charge more than cinemas in the US.

Yet some of the cinemas’ costs have gone down. They used to have to employ projectionists to lace up and change reels of film. Digital delivery means much less handling.

A now-dated 1990s report to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission found the two majors, Hoyts and Greater Union/Village, charged near identical prices except where they were faced with competition from a nearby independent, in which case they discounted.

Whether “by design or circumstance”, the two cinema chains rarely competed with each other, clustering their multiplexes in different geographical locations.

Longer films no longer displace shorter films

I think it might be the multiplex that answers my second question: why cinemas don’t charge more for movies that are longer (and movies are getting longer).

In the days of single screens, a cinema that showed a long movie might only fit in (say) four showings a day instead of six. So it would lose out unless it charged more.

But these days, multiplexes show many, many films on many screens, some of them simultaneously, meaning long films needn’t displace short films.

Although we have fewer cinema seats than we had a decade ago (and at least until the advent of Barbie, we’ve been going less often) we now have far more screens.

Long movies no longer stop the multiplexes from playing standard ones. And because cinemas like to keep things simple, you pay the same price, no matter which movie you chose.

2023-08-19 15:07:00+00:00,"‘Oppenheimer’ Soaring Past $700M Global Box Office Today, Will Overtake Christopher Nolan’s ‘Interstellar’ On Sunday","Christopher Nolan and Universal’s Oppenheimer is on its way to yet another milestone, poised to cross $700M globally through today.","UPDATE, SATURDAY August 19: Christopher Nolan and Universal’s Oppenheimer is on its way to yet another milestone, poised to cross $700M global through today. After five frames, the epic is expected to reach $718M with tomorrow’s numbers included. That will make it Nolan’s 4th highest-grossing film ever worldwide, overtaking Interstellar. It will also move into the No. 4 spot on the global chart for 2023 so far.

The international box office cume through tomorrow is projected at $432M after a $31.8M fifth session. Oppenheimer is the biggest Nolan film of all time at the international box office when restated to today’s dollars and excluding un-released markets.

For the year so far, the Cillian Murphy-starrer is the No. 3 movie overseas, excluding China where it releases on August 30. As previously noted, this is Nolan’s highest-grossing movie in 50 markets, and now his top non-superhero title in 63.

The Top 5 markets through Friday are the UK ($62.1M), Germany ($38.1M), France ($30.4M), Australia ($22.1M) and Spain ($17.8M). Also notable, Korea is seeing a big opening weekend with $10.4M through today.

We’ll have a full update on Sunday.

PREVIOUS UPDATE, August 10: With today’s business, Christopher Nolan’s epic Oppenheimer will hit yet another benchmark, crossing $600M at the global box office. The latest milestone comes just 23 days into release.

Adding $7.7M on Wednesday from 78 overseas markets, the Universal title’s international box office cume through yesterday is $350.7M. The worldwide total is $593.5M. Markets still to release include Vietnam (today) and Italy, Korea and China through the rest of August.

Already having surpassed Dunkirk as Nolan’s fifth-highest grossing film of all time globally this past weekend and becoming the biggest WWII movie ever worldwide (see previous post below), Oppenheimer is now the filmmaker’s top movie ever in 47 markets, including Germany, Netherlands, India, Belgium, Norway, the UAE, Poland and more. It’s also the best for Nolan outside the Batman franchise in 61 markets, including Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, Central America and the Philippines.

The Cillian Murphy-starrer has been seeing solid midweek play and, through Wednesday, is led by the UK with $53.4M, in line with Dunkirk (+1%) and The Dark Knight Rises (-7%) at the same point, having already surpassed the lifetimes of Inception, Interstellar and Tenet in the market.

Germany has also advanced since Sunday, now at $31.5M through Wednesday when it surpassed the lifetime of The Dark Knight Rises to become the biggest Nolan film ever in the market.

France has grossed $26.1M to date, running 20% above The Dark Knight Rises at the same point in time. Australia is at $19.1M through Wednesday, which is 16% above Inception, having already surpassed the lifetimes of Dunkirk, Interstellar and Tenet. And, India is now at $16.7M.

Other notable cumes include Mexico’s $15.4M, the 2nd biggest Nolan film in the market (having passed The Dark Knight this week); Spain’s $15M, Netherlands’ $12.7M; Brazil’s $10.2M, the 2nd biggest Nolan film ever, behind The Dark Knight Rises and performing 12% above that film at the same point; and Sweden with $6.5M, the 2nd biggest Nolan film in the market (behind The Dark Knight Rises).

PREVIOUS, August 5: Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer has reached the $500M global milestone, on its way to an estimated $551M through Sunday. This would make it the filmmaker’s fifth-highest-grossing film of all time, ahead of Dunkirk. The worldwide total through Friday is $499.3M, meaning that it has already topped the five-century mark today.

Overseas, the Universal title is expected to see an impressive 33% drop in the third frame, adding $51M and reaching an estimated international box office cume through Sunday of $323M, which is 129% above Dunkirk, 169% above Interstellar, 212% above Tenet, and 25% above The Dark Knight Rises at the same point in like-for-like markets.

The Cillian Murphy-starrer is the biggest Nolan film of all-time in 41 markets including the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, India, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. It is Nolan’s top non-Batman pic in 55, including Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Austria, Poland and Malaysia.

The epic story of the titular complicated and brilliant physicist tasked with leading the Manhattan Project, the secret effort to create the atom bomb, and the moral and political struggles that followed is now one of four biographical films to cross $500M global box office ever, including Bohemian Rhapsody, The Passion of the Christ and American Sniper.

Through Sunday, Oppenheimer will rank as the highest-grossing WWII movie of all time worldwide in reported historic grosses, ie also ahead of Saving Private Ryan ($482M) and Pearl Harbor ($449M).

The Top 5 markets through Friday are the UK/Ireland with $45M followed by Germany with $24.6M, France ($21.8M), Australia ($16M) and India ($15M).

2023-07-23 16:24:57+00:00,‘Barbie’ Box Office to the World: The Pandemic Is Officially Over,"With the biggest revenues since 2019, “Barbenheimer” gives the usual franchises a run for their money, selling out even predawn screenings.","“Barbie” arrived as a full-blown cultural event, with thousands of moviegoers draping themselves in pink for screenings, doll memes flooding social media and marketers scrambling (sometimes awkwardly) to glom onto the moment. The audience was 65 percent female. “For a film this pink, you would have expected the audience to be closer to 90 percent female — we got a ton of guys,” said Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros. “It exploded everywhere: large markets, small markets, coast to coast.”

Some theaters seemed to be caught off guard. One high-end theater in the Washington, D.C. suburbs went all out on promotion, with pink lights to highlight “Barbie” and a wall of movie posters featuring both films. But the theater may have miscalculated Saturday attendance. By the 10 p.m. showing, it had run out of multiple food items. It also lacked soft drinks and, amazingly, ice.

Another theater in Arlington, Va., had it worse: The air conditioning went out, leading to a sweltering experience. While the theater offered refunds, many ticket buyers stayed.

The question now is whether Hollywood can keep the momentum going. Studio executives have long pointed out that moviegoing begets moviegoing — that the habit of watching movies in theaters is crucial. Coming up, however, studios are facing another crisis: A strike by unionized actors, which started on July 14, could force movie companies to push back coming films because striking stars cannot take part in publicity campaigns. “Challengers,” a sports drama involving a love triangle and starring Zendaya, has already been pushed from September to April.

There are no talks scheduled between SAG-AFTRA, as the actors’ union is known, and studios.

“Oppenheimer” helped fuel “Barbie” and vice versa, with their simultaneous release nicknamed Barbenheimer and movie fans captivated by their wild incongruity. Nolan’s film, which cost Universal Pictures at least $100 million to make, not including a megawatt marketing campaign, is a three-hour period drama about Robert Oppenheimer, the man known as “the father of the atomic bomb.” About 200,000 people purchased tickets to see “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” as a double feature, according to the National Association of Theater Owners, a trade organization.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMjMvbW92aWVzL2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW51bWJlcnMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Steven Spielberg and Paul McCartney Go to the Movies Together for 'Oppenheimer' in the Hamptons,"Steven Spielberg and Paul McCartney were spotted earlier this week at a movie theater, in line to see the new Christopher Nolan movie 'Oppenheimer' in the Hamptons","Steven Spielberg and Paul McCartney experienced one of the summer's hottest movies together.

On Monday, Spielberg, 76, and McCartney, 81, were spotted outside a movie theater in New York's summer vacation hotspot the Hamptons as they attended a showing of Christopher Nolan's new movie Oppenheimer.

Spielberg wore a white hat with a matching jacket, jeans, sneakers and a blue-and-white shirt to the theater, while McCartney wore a blue sweatshirt, dark pants and sunglasses.



The Beatles alum referenced knowing director Spielberg as far back as 1986, when he told Rolling Stone he sought out Spielberg's advice on the possibility of making a movie about the Beatles' career.

Back in December, Spielberg noted that one of McCartney’s famed Beatles song — “Michelle” from 1965’s Rubber Soul — helped grant him an opportunity to share a first kiss with a girlfriend in college.

""She would agree to let me take her out to dinner or to a jazz club or out to a movie but she would never ever ever let me kiss her,"" Spielberg recalled during an appearance on BBC Radio 4. He said the song began playing in the car ""and I think we heard it for the first time together on the radio.""

""The melody is just heart-achingly beautiful,"" Spielberg said of the McCartney-written tune. ""I look over at her and she’s got tears in her eyes — just before the song was over she jumps over on my side of the car and starts kissing me.”



“When I got to know Paul a number of years ago, when Paul and I met and became friends, that was one of the first stories I ever told him,"" he added. ""I had a chance to tell Paul McCartney that story.”

Oppenheimer stars Cillian Murphy as physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and features performances from Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr. and a large ensemble cast.



The film follows Oppenheimer's life and participation in the United States' atomic weapons program during World War II and beyond. Its opening weekend box office success has been tied to its simultaneous release with the blockbuster Barbie movie. One study found that Oppenheimer made nearly $5 million of its ticket sales from moviegoers who originally planned to see Barbie but made a backup plan when the comedy was sold out.

Several stars shared that they would be in line to see Barbie and Oppenheimer, including Tom Cruise, whose latest Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is also in theaters now.

""This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters. Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indy and one of the most iconic characters in history,"" Cruise wrote on Twitter in June, adding, ""I love a double feature, and it doesn't get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Oppenheimer and Barbie.""



Oppenheimer is in theaters now.

2023-08-03 18:16:10+00:00,David Krumholtz Oppenheimer movie: How he stood out amidst a cast of leading men.,"It's not just his role in Oppenheimer that's making people want ""more than just a krum.""","You know what positively thrills me? All over the country, there are hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people watching Oppenheimer at this very moment. And this means that all over the country, dozens of people, maybe more, are having the following thought dawn on them: David Krumholtz kind of rules.

If you haven’t had the pleasure of seeing Oppenheimer yet, I can’t emphasize enough the degree to which every white man you’ve ever heard of is in this movie. It’s not just that Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr. are deigning to play supporting roles—literal Oscar winners like Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh show up and have, like, six lines each. More fairly prominent people like Tony Goldwyn, Jack Quaid, and Dane DeHaan are there too, in totally unimportant roles. The sheer number of guys we’re dealing with here is such that an actor I love named Michael Angarano is in the movie and I literally didn’t notice him. I haven’t even mentioned Josh Hartnett yet! It’s unreal, the density of guys you will recognize. So when I say that David Krumholtz was my favorite member of the ensemble, know that he faced some stiff competition.

In the movie, Krumholtz plays Isidor Isaac Rabi, a colleague and friend of Cillian Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer. They first meet as young physicists in Europe, two Jewish kids from New York, but as Rabi’s ribbing of Oppenheimer for not speaking Yiddish underscores, they come from different backgrounds: Rabi is an Eastern European immigrant from the Lower East Side and Brooklyn, but Oppenheimer had a comparatively fancier path, emigrating from what is now Germany and living on Riverside Drive. Where Oppenheimer can be aloof, Rabi is warm and friendly, handing him orange slices and commanding him, “Eat!,” bubbe-style. Compared with characters like Benny Safdie’s Edward Teller who clash with Oppenheimer, it’s hard not to be partial to loyal, circumspect Rabi, who is, as one Twitter user put it, the “conscience of the film.” He’s a likable character as written, but Krumholtz was the perfect choice to play him—there are not very many actors whose geniality can withstand audiences watching them build a bomb that has the power to destroy humanity, but such is the magic of Krumholtz.

I’ve been pleased to see that I’m not the only person who walked out of Oppie high on Krumholtz’s portrayal of Rabi. As another Twitter user put it, “I’m watching ‘Oppenheimer’ and looking for something good, something pure in the darkness and who do I see? David Krumholtz. MVP of the film.” Yet another wrote, “We are on the precipice of David Krumholtz having a mid to late career resurgence as a kind and wise Jewish man in every period drama set in New York for the next 15–20 years.” We should be so lucky!

On Reddit a couple of weeks ago, fans of the movie podcast Blank Check started a thread devoted to Krumholtz worship. The original post reads, “Look obviously Oppenheimer is full of likeable middle-aged men being compelling, but my god has David Krumholtz hit his stride. Like he was decent as a young guy, but I am LOVING this avuncular chap with that distinct New York Jewish charm and a wistful smile who exudes intelligence and integrity. I loved that upsetting, harrowing, depressing movie, but it absolutely could have done with more Krumholtz.” Other users chimed in to agree: “I want more than a krum, I want the whole loaf,” one said, a catchphrase I would love to start seeing on T-shirts and bumper stickers. Another wrote, “He gave so much Alfred Molina in this movie that for a second I thought he WAS him. Which is a big compliment.”

As the Reddit thread alludes to, Krumholtz has been knocking around Hollywood for a while now. He is one of several former child stars in Oppenheimer, itself a strong argument for Christopher Nolan as visionary. Krumholtz is particularly remembered for playing Bernard the Elf in 1994’s The Santa Clause, a role he was actually still playing as of last year’s Disney+ revival series. You’ve got to respect someone appearing simultaneously in two properties as different as The Santa Clause and Oppenheimer. Many of Krumholtz’s roles, Oppenheimer and the CBS procedural Numb3rs among them, have had a distinctly Jewish flavor, so it’s hilarious to think that one of his earliest and still most famous roles was as one of Santa’s elves. Perhaps it was a joke that went over my head as a child that Santa would have such a Jewish-coded elf? In any case, some of Krumholtz’s best roles over the years have been in this tradition, from Goldstein in the Harold & Kumar movies to his lone-episode appearance on Freaks and Geeks as an older brother of one of the geeks, which is impossible to watch without developing a crush on him. Krumholtz more recently showed up in The Plot Against America and Leopoldstadt on Broadway, and it’s pleasing to see that the entertainment industry now accepts that when making something very Jewish, Krumholtz better be in the mix. He also seems to have menschy values in real life: Did you catch him on the Screen Actors Guild picket line with his castmates this week?

Many of us have been proudly Krumholtz-pilled for years now, and I suspect that many more have unconsciously loved him but didn’t realize it until Oppenheimer. Whatever the case, it’s been wonderful to witness this collective awakening. Barbenheimer has gotten a lot of credit for bringing people together and making them feel like they’re part of something again, but maybe David Krumholtz has been doing more of the heavy lifting than anyone’s acknowledged. He’s the heart of the movie, people! Is there a Barbenheimer without him? I’m glad we’ll never have to find out.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy8wOC9kYXZpZC1rcnVtaG9sdHotb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY2FzdC1tb3ZpZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"The omission of women's contributions in 'Oppenheimer' is part of a harmful trend, Pitt experts say","Lack of representation can reinforce stereotypes about who belongs in the sciences, write Carl Kurlander and Chandralekha Singh.","Lise Meitner: A pioneering role model in physics

The Manhattan Project would not have been possible without the work of physicist Lise Meitner, pictured above, who discovered nuclear fission. Meitner used Einstein’s E=MC² to calculate how much energy would be released by splitting uranium atoms, and it was that development that would prompt Einstein to sign a letter urging President Franklin Roosevelt to begin the United States’ atomic research program.

Einstein called Meitner the “Madame Curie of Germany” and was one of a pantheon of physicists, from Max Planck to Niels Bohr, who nominated Meitner for a Nobel Prize 48 times during her lifetime.

Meitner never won. Instead, the prize for fission went to Otto Hahn, her male lab partner of 30 years in Berlin. Hahn received the news of his nomination under house arrest in England, where he and other German scientists were being held to determine how far the Third Reich had advanced with its atomic program.

Of Jewish descent, Meitner had been forced to flee the Nazis in 1938 and refused to use this scientific discovery to develop a bomb. Rather, she spent the rest of her life working to promote nuclear disarmament and advocating for the responsible use of nuclear energy.

Meitner was not the only woman who made a significant contribution during this time. But the lack of physics role models like Meitner in popular media leads to real-life consequences. Meitner doesn’t appear as a character in the film, as she was not part of the Manhattan Project, but we hope the script alludes to her groundbreaking work.

A lack of representation

Only around 20% of the undergraduate majors and PhD students in physics are women. The societal stereotypes and biases, expectation of brilliance, lack of role models and chilly culture of physics discourage many talented students from historically marginalized backgrounds, like women, from pursuing physics and related disciplines.

Societal stereotypes and biases influence students even before they enter the classroom. One common stereotype is the idea that genius and brilliance are important factors to succeed in physics. However, genius is often associated with boys, and girls from a young age tend to shy away from fields associated with innate brilliance.

Studies have found that by the age of 6, girls are less likely than boys to believe they are “really, really smart.” As these students get older, often the norms in science classes and curricula tend not to represent the interests and values of girls. All of these stereotypes and factors can influence women’s perception of their ability to do physics.

Research shows that at the end of a yearlong college physics course sequence, women with an “A” have the same physics self-efficacy as men with a “C”. A person’s physics self-efficacy is their belief about how good they are at solving physics problems — and one’s self-efficacy can shape their career trajectory.

Women drop out of college science and engineering majors with significantly higher grade-point averages than men who drop out. In some cases, women who drop out have the same GPA as men who complete those majors. Compared to men, women in physics courses feel significantly less recognized for their accomplishments. Recognition from others as a person who can excel in physics is the strongest predictor of a student’s physics identity, or whether they see themselves as someone who can excel in physics.

More frequent media recognition of female scientists, such as Meitner, could vicariously influence young women, who may see them as role models. This recognition alone can boost young women’s physics self-efficacy and identity.

When Meitner started her career at the beginning of the 20th century, male physicists made excuses about why women had no place in a lab – their long hair might catch fire on Bunsen burners, for instance. We like to believe we have made progress in the past century, but the underrepresentation of women in physics is still concerning.

Diversity as an asset to science

If diverse groups of scientists are involved in brainstorming challenging problems, not only can they devise better, future-oriented solutions, but those solutions will also benefit a wider range of people.

Individuals’ lived experiences affect their perspectives – for example, over two centuries ago, mathematician Ada Lovelace imagined applications far beyond what the original inventors of the computer intended. Similarly, women today are more likely to focus on applications of quantum computers that will benefit their communities. Additionally, physicists from Global South countries are more likely to develop improved stoves, solar cells, water purification systems or solar-powered lamps. The perspectives that diverse groups bring to science problems can lead to new innovations.

Our intention is not to disparage the “Oppenheimer” movie, but to point out that by not centering media attention on diverse voices – including those of women in physics like Meitner – filmmakers perpetuate the status quo and stereotypes about who belongs in physics. Additionally, young women continue to be deprived of exposure to role models who could inspire their academic and professional journeys .

2023-08-03 12:02:10.343000+00:00,Oppenheimer Fans Spot Disturbing Detail That Hints at a Horrifying Conspiracy,Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer features a horrifying detail that hints towards a decades-old conspiracy.,"Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer.

A disturbing detail in Oppenheimer seems to hint at a larger conspiracy... and it sees director Christopher Nolan in true ""horror mode.""

During a harrowing sequence of quick shots, the death of Jean Tatlock is shown as she seemingly drowns herself in the bath. However, a pair of black-gloved hands hints that all is not as it seems.

“One thing in Oppenheimer I haven't been able to get out of my head is that brief insert of black gloves in that one flashback with Florence Pugh,” said film fan Josh Lewis on Twitter. “Nolan was really in his horror mode.”

One thing in Oppenheimer I haven't been able to get out of my head is that brief insert of black gloves in that one flashback with Florence Pugh. Nolan was really in his horror mode. — Josh Lewis (@thejoshl) July 23, 2023

He’s not the first to notice the gloved hands, and the scene seems to suggest that Tatlock’s death wasn’t suicide at all. Tatlock is played by Florence Pugh and features throughout the movie as Oppenheimer’s lover who continued to have a relationship with the scientist while he was married to his wife, Kitty (played by Emily Blunt).

Not only frowned upon due to the illicit nature of their relationship, Tatlock was also a keen member of the Communist party and was seen by many to be a security risk. Tatlock’s fate is teased throughout the film, with a flashback eventually revealing she supposedly drowned herself in the bathtub.

Of course, the gloved hands suggest otherwise, and fans have since been debating its meaning. Some believe the scene is a manifestation of Oppenheimer’s guilt and the gloved hands are meant to represent Oppenheimer blaming himself for her death.

The horrifying blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment is the closest Nolan comes to horror in Oppenheimer. However, it also teases a decades-old conspiracy. Following her death, an autopsy determined her cause of death as death by drowning, however, a “faint trace” of chloral hydrate was found in her system, a substance capable of sedating a person.

According to the book American Prometheus, on which Oppenheimer is based, at least one physician had doubts about her cause of death, speculating she may have been drugged and forcibly drowned. “If you were clever and wanted to kill someone, this is the way to do it,” said one doctor.

This subsequently led to speculation by historians, as well as Tatlock’s own brother, that she may have been killed by U.S. Government officials due to her affiliation to the Communist party, coupled with her closeness to one of the Manhattan Project’s key players.

“I do not believe that her interests were really political,” Oppenheimer told The United States Atomic Energy Commission in 1954. “She was a person of deep religious feeling. She loved this country, its people, and its life.”

Nevertheless, it looks as though Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan may have been convinced enough to tease that her death wasn’t a suicide at all.

IGN’s Oppenheimer review gave it 10/10 and said: “A biopic in constant free fall, Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s most abstract yet most exacting work, with themes of guilt writ large through apocalyptic IMAX nightmares that grow both more enormous and more intimate as time ticks on. A disturbing, mesmerizing vision of what humanity is capable of bringing upon itself, both through its innovation, and through its capacity to justify any atrocity.”

The thriller comes out Friday, and it remains to be seen what, if any, role the Wilmington-based DuPont Co. and its employees play in the film that ties together physics, engineering and chemistry.

DuPont was a significant part of the ""Manhattan Project"" the code name given to the top-secret project that produced the atomic bomb.

""The $2 billion project employed over 125,000 people across America, most of whom had no idea what they were working on,"" according to an exhibit at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans.

But the Delaware company, which produced enough enriched Uranium-235 to make the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima and enough plutonium for the Nagaski bomb, was not involved in the decision to drop bombs on the Japanese cities.

DuPont's Atomic Energy Division documents and records on atomic weapons and nuclear energy stored at Hagley Museum and Library in Greenville offer greater insight into the top-secret nature of the project conducted during World War II and the company's involvement.

The museum has had exhibitions over the years about DuPont and the Manhattan Project.

Three years ago, when the museum was closed to visitors due to the pandemic, historian Lucas Clawson on YouTube discussed DuPont's role in the Manhattan Project and the development of the first operational nuclear reactors.

During the hourlong video, which showcases rare documents, footage and photographs from Hagley’s collection, Clawson describes the top-secret project to develop a weapon and how it served as a major catalyst in the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States.

Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves (played in the movie by Matt Damon) was a United States Army Corps of Engineers officer in charge of the construction of the Pentagon.

He became the military head of the Manhattan Project by then-President Franklin Roosevelt after German-born physicist Albert Einstein wrote to the president in 1939 telling him to research atomic weapons because if dictator Adolf Hilter developed one first, the Nazis might win the war and wipe out civilization.

(Ironically, Einstein was denied security clearance by the Army to work on the project and no other scientists or engineers could consult with him. Due to his politically left leanings, Einstein was considered a security risk, according to the American Museum of Natural History.)

With the green light lit, the race for atomic power was on. While recruiting scientists and companies for the Manhattan Project, Groves sought out trustworthy people, according to Clawson. The military leader was well-acquainted with the DuPont Co., a known explosives company that was transitioning into a respected chemical engineering company that had in recent years invented nylon.

In November 1942, Groves came to Wilmington and met with DuPont Co. President Walter Samuel Carpenter Jr. and briefed him on the Manhattan Project. He wanted the company to build and operate plutonium production reactors and other facilities, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

The company's executive committee and board, which included Carpenter, the first member who was not from the du Pont family, were reluctant and had several concerns about their involvement.

According to Clawson, one of the biggest factors was they were not convinced about its safety, a tenet of DuPont since the company was founded as a manufacturer of gunpowder on the banks of the Brandywine in 1802.

Carpenter has said he realized the results of this incredibly dangerous new science of splitting the atom and plutonium could be catastrophic.

Still, Carpenter said he felt DuPont, an American company, had to be involved as a patriotic contribution.

On Dec. 21, 1942, DuPont agreed to take on the Manhattan Project, according to Hagley, but with some conditions. The cost would be $1 because the company didn't want to look like it was profiting from the war.

DuPont was still smarting after it had been criticized as ""a merchant of death"" after producing 40% of smokeless gunpowder used by the Allies during World War I. DuPont said any profits would be returned to the government.

DuPont also wanted to ensure it would have no liability if something went wrong and wanted out of the project by the end of the war.

""One of the amazing aspects of the thing was that nobody in Wilmington here seemed to know what was going on out there,"" Carpenter said in a 1965 interview for the “Voices of the Manhattan Project,” a joint project by theAtomic Heritage Foundation and the Los Alamos Historical Society,

""It had to be kept very secret, and of course, it was kept very secret,"" Carpenter said.

Walter Carpenter State Park, a part of the White Clay Creek Preserve near Newark, is named after the DuPont Co. president and chairman who died in 1976.

DuPont chemical engineer Crawford Greenewalt soon was sent by Carpenter to investigate the project. In Chicago on Dec. 2, 1942, he witnessed Italian physicist Enrico Fermi’s first chain reaction. His engineering notebooks, with the words ""secret' stamped in red on the pages, are a part of Hagley Museum and Library's archives.

Greenewalt, married to Margaretta Lammot du Pont, the daughter of DuPont Co. President Irénée du Pont. served as the DuPont Co. president from 1948 to 1962. He retired as board chairman in 1967 and died at age 91 in 1993.

Greenewalt's brother-in-law was Irénée du Pont Jr., who owned Granogue, the stunning 505-acre private estate near Centreville, Delaware. The estate was acquired by Longwood Gardens in February about a month after du Pont's death at age 103.

During World War II, Greenewalt became the liaison between the physicists at the Chicago Met Lab and DuPont's engineers at Wilmington, according to Atomic Heritage Foundation. His role was helping translate scientists’ theoretical ideas into workable blueprints for the production of plutonium on a massive scale at a reactor that was built in Hanford, Washington.

With the Army's help, DuPont Co. set up a temporary central construction camp accommodating up to 51,000 people and built permanent housing for a community, with schools, churches, and grocery stores, of up to 17,500 people also in Washington.

Greenewalt chose DuPont's chief engineer Grenville M. ""Slim"" Read to head up the design of the facilities that also included a reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. At its Deepwater, New Jersey, plant, DuPont operated one of the three parallel production lines set up for processing uranium ore into metal.

When the first test atomic fission bomb exploded at a remote air base in Alamogordo, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945, Groves called Read in Delaware, according to News Journal archives.

Afraid that his call might be bugged by spies, Groves said just two words: ""It worked.""

""You lucky SOB. You hit the jackpot on DuPont's nickel,"" Read said.

2023-07-23 23:14:33+00:00,Oppenheimer – a ‘formidable’ movie – in 70mm at Atlanta’s Tara Theatre,Read Oppenheimer – a ‘formidable’ movie – in 70mm at Atlanta’s Tara Theatre by Eleanor Ringel Cater for SaportaReport here.,"Chris Escobar got me back to the movies.

He rescued the Tara. He revived the Plaza. He reinvented the Atlanta Film Festival.

Reviewing movies is a wonderful job. It is, nonetheless, a job. And even post-pandemic, the thought of being in a large, enclosed space with people who’ve been exposed to Lord-knows-what wasn’t…well…wasn’t my idea of a good time.

Then along came Escobar. And then, as well, along came this past weekend, which some Hollywood bottom-feeder decided to christen “Barbenheimer ” – as in the twin openings of the films, “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.”

Cillian Muurphy plans Oppenheimer in the move with the same name (Special)

“Barbie” beckoned, but the responsible choice was “Oppenheimer,” three-plus hours of sorta’ recent history about how J. Robert Oppenheimer learned to stop worrying and fear the bomb.

As in, his bomb. The atomic bomb, which he invented. “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds” he supposedly uttered, quoting the Bhagavad Gita. In the original Sanskrit.

In Christopher Nolan’s admirable if imperfect biographical epic, Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) reads those words – in the original Sanskrit – from a book perched on his mistress Jean Tatlock’s (Florence Pugh) original (presumably) bare breasts. (Context: she’s straddling him as they make love.)

Nolan may be a cinematic genius, but he’s a showman as well. Nekked women tend to focus an audience’s attention, especially in 70mm.

My point, I guess, is that while “Oppenheimer” is over-long and over-crowded with white guys in unflattering suits saying mostly unflattering things about our titular protagonist, the movie is also formidable. It tackles a serious topic – the life and times of the man who invented the instrument by which humans could destroy ourselves – and doesn’t pull punches. Here’s J. Robert Oppenheimer’s story, Nolan insists. Here’s all of it. Hence the hefty running time.

The film takes us from the American physicist’s early days as a gifted grad student in England and Germany in the 1920s, through his prolonged and impassioned work on the bomb, his anointment as a national hero and his eventual martyrdom in the 1950s at the hands of the Atomic Energy Commission.

And they are…? A bunch of self-serving politicians (are there any other kind in movies?) led by the devious Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). This is shown as Washington power-mongering at its most repulsive – a closed-door, hush-hush hearing which pits the imperfect but essentially innocent Oppenheimer against a squadron of men for whom political backstabbing is the very air they breathe.

Oppenheimer movie poster (Special)

These scenes provide a framework (and pretty much the last hour) for Nolan’s version of the Big Bang Theory, i.e., who Oppenheimer was, what he did and why it was done. As someone says, the scientists provide the cards; the bureaucrats decide how the hand is played.

The picture is often eerily beautiful, perhaps never more so than when showing us the bomb being tested in the middle of nowhere (i.e., Los Alamos, New Mexico). The movie goes silent – deadly silent – as a Biblical pillar of fire rises in the desert. “Bring in the sheets,” Oppenheimer tells his frustrated, alcoholic wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) earlier that day, giving a semi-demented domestic touch to the day the world changed.

“Oppenheimer’s” talkiness can tire you out. As can the sheer number of topics it tackles, everything from anti-Semitism to power-politics gamesmanship to why we dropped the bomb after the Nazis were already defeated. Nolan’s cinematic mastery helps a lot, as does his impressive cast which brims with memorable performances alongside blink-and-you’ll-miss-‘em cameos (Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, among others).

Blunt is remarkable as Kitty whose underwritten character is mostly viewed through a flask in her purse and an empty cocktail glass. So is Matt Damon as Oppenheimer’s military keeper (foursquare among the slithery bureaucrats). And Downey, having almost singlehandedly destroyed the movies (I am become Iron Man…) is obviously out for a best supporting actor Oscar. One that, in this case, would be well-deserved.

Holding it all together is Murphy, a slim Irish actor with ice-blue eyes. He understands his character’s contradictions; more importantly, he has an uncanny instinct for how to reveal them. For Oppenheimer, the A-Bomb isn’t just a weapon of mass destruction. It’s also his masterpiece. His Beethoven’s 9th. His Sistine Chapel. When he finally dons his trademark fedora and pipe, it’ s like watching a superhero (or villain?) don his spandex costume. With great power comes great responsibility.

More than even a starry-eyed scientist could dream of.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vc2Fwb3J0YXJlcG9ydC5jb20vb3BwZW5oZWltZXItYS1mb3JtaWRhYmxlLW1vdmllLWluLTcwbW0tYXQtYXRsYW50YXMtdGFyYS10aGVhdHJlL2NvbHVtbmlzdHMvZWxlYW5vci9lbGVhbm9yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

“Oppenheimer begins with a quote about Prometheus stealing from the gods, then being punished for all eternity. Which mirrors the tale being told here. But in spite of the fact that this is less biopic, and more horror movie, Oppenheimer nevertheless finds compassion in Robert’s story. Resulting in a towering achievement that’s up there with Nolan’s very best, and a film of both great importance, and true humanity.”

'Oppenheimer' cast walks out of UK premiere 'to write their picket signs' amid SAG-AFTRA strike

The cast of director Christopher Nolan's hotly anticipated war-era drama ""Oppenheimer"" is standing united in the effort to support the SAG-AFTRA strike.

Stars of the film appeared on the red carpet of the film's UK premiere on Thursday before the strike was officially announced, but they ended up walking out of the event ""to write their picket signs,"" according to Nolan.

Addressing the audience inside the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square theater before the screening began, as seen in videos posted to social media, Nolan acknowledged the work of Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh and Robert Downey Jr., among other ""Oppenheimer"" cast members.

""We have to acknowledge (that) you've seen them here earlier on the red carpet,"" Nolan said, adding ""unfortunately they're off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by SAG.""

Nolan continued that the actors who left the ""Oppenheimer"" premiere in support of the union that represents them join ""one of my guilds, the Writers Guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of the union, and we support them.""

The Writers Guild of America (WGA) has been on strike since May.

Actors will picket outside major film and TV studios on Friday as the strike involving Hollywood's biggest stars gets underway.

Blunt told Deadline on the ""Oppenheimer"" red carpet Thursday, prior to the cast walking out of the screening and prior to the strike's official commencement, that her hopes were that ""everyone makes a fair deal and we are here to celebrate this movie.""

""And if they call (the strike), we'll be leaving together as a cast in unity with everyone,"" Blunt said, adding, ""We are gonna have to. So we will see what happens. Right now it's the joy to be together.""

The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)'s president Fran Drescher announced in an impassioned speech during a press conference in Los Angeles on Thursday that the union will go on strike.

The strike went into effect at midnight PT Thursday night.

""Oppenheimer"" is scheduled to premiere in theaters on July 21.

2023-07-30 23:31:59+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’ star Cillian Murphy acknowledges Rays pitcher as doppelganger: ‘He’s a lot better at baseball than I am’,"Ever since Christopher Nolan's blockbuster hit ""Oppenheimer"" premiered in theatres, many have noticed that Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Tyler Glasnow looks eerily similar to Cillian Murphy, who plays the lead role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in the film.","TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) – Ever since Christopher Nolan’s blockbuster hit “Oppenheimer” premiered in theatres, many have noticed that Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Tyler Glasnow looks eerily similar to Cillian Murphy, who plays the lead role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in the film.

After Glasnow went viral on social media for looking like Murphy’s “long-lost twin,” many wondered if Murphy even knew he had a “doppelganger” since he’s not online, let alone one who plays professional baseball.

It turns out he’s very aware.

In an interview with Josh Horowitz on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast, Murphy was asked who’s the last actor he got mistaken for. When Murphy responded, saying it doesn’t really happen to him, Horowitz brought up Tampa Bay’s Tyler Glasnow.

“Are you aware – again, I know you’re not online, this baseball player that’s been mistaken for you?” Horowitz asked.

To which Murphy surprisingly replied, “Yes, I’ve been sent that.”

“You’re the first person to say, but wasn’t that like an AI-generated image or something?” Murphy asked. “Many people have sent the [picture]. I need to turn off more notifications.”

While the Rays’ photo of Glasnow may have been a little touched up, the resemblance between the two is still uncanny.

Although there are several differences between Glasnow and Murphy, like the staggering 18-year age gap and the fact Murphy probably can’t throw a 96 mph fastball, fans can’t help but be in awe over their looks.

“You’ve got a long-lost twin,” Horowitz told Murphy.

“Yeah, well, he’s a lot better at baseball than I am,” Murphy said. When told that he’s probably “a bit better at acting” than Glasnow, Murphy joked, “Well, we’ve all got our skills.”

Horowitz shared that clip of his interview with Murphy on Twitter with the caption, “Yes, Cillian Murphy is aware of his baseball doppelgänger.”

As of right now, Glasnow has yet to publicly comment on the resemblance.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZmxhLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LW5ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc3Rhci1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1hY2tub3dsZWRnZXMtcmF5cy1waXRjaGVyLWFzLWRvcHBlbGdhbmdlci1oZXMtYS1sb3QtYmV0dGVyLWF0LWJhc2ViYWxsLXRoYW4taS1hbS_SAZ0BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2ZsYS5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1uZXdzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXN0YXItY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktYWNrbm93bGVkZ2VzLXJheXMtcGl0Y2hlci1hcy1kb3BwZWxnYW5nZXItaGVzLWEtbG90LWJldHRlci1hdC1iYXNlYmFsbC10aGFuLWktYW0vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

""If you're going to a theater right now, the communal experience is reminiscent of major Marvel and Star Wars films, but without those franchises remotely involved.""
""Barbie"" tallied around $155 million during its first three days in theaters, the highest opening of 2023. Its counterpart ""Oppenheimer"" made $82.4 million over the weekend, according to numbers released Monday.
""Barbenheimer"" exploded over the weekend, generating more than $235.5 million in ticket sales and reinvigorating the domestic box office.
More than 18.5 million tickets were bought for the combination of Warner Bros. ' ""Barbie"" and Universal's ""Oppenheimer,"" 12.8 million for ""Barbie"" and 5.8 million for ""Oppenheimer,"" according to data from EntTelligence.
""It was a truly historic weekend and continues the positive box office momentum of 2023,"" said Michael O'Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. ""More importantly, it proves once again that America loves going to the movies to see great films.""
Both films hold a rating of more than 90% ""Fresh"" on Rotten Tomatoes and inspired moviegoers to dress head-to-toe in pink or don suits and hats during their screenings.
""People recognized that something special was happening and they wanted to be a part of it,"" O'Leary said. ""Our partners in the creative community and at the studios gave audiences two uniquely different, smart and original stories that were meant for the big screen and movie lovers responded by gathering friends and family and heading to their local movie houses across the nation.""
With additional ticket sales from Paramount's newest ""Mission Impossible"" film, Sony's ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" and Angel Studios' ""The Sound of Freedom,"" the weekend box office is expected to reach $302 million, the highest of any weekend in 2023, according to data from Comscore.
""The unprecedented performance of these two films, and the boost it gave to the overall movie marketplace, solidified the movie theater as a cultural hub and epicenter of social interaction,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.
""Barbenheimer"" weekend is currently set to be the fourth-highest weekend haul of all-time, just below the three-day stretch when Disney's ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" arrived in theaters in December 2015 and helped boost the overall weekend haul to $313 million. The second-highest is $314 million from April 2018's opening weekend of ""Avengers: Infinity War.""
Some box office analysts project that Monday's official weekend numbers could be quite a bit higher than Sunday's estimates, and push ""Barbenheimer"" weekend up the charts. However, they won't come close to the highest-grossing weekend ever, which occurred in April 2019 when ""Avengers: Endgame"" hit theaters, drumming up $357 million on its own, and leading to a $402 million overall weekend tally.
The success of ""Barbenheimer"" comes at a time when the domestic box office has faced some hurdles. A slew of adult-aimed blockbusters have underperformed, leading many in the industry to question if consumer tastes have shifted away from Hollywood.
Warner Bros.' ""The Flash"" has fizzled, Pixar's ""Elemental"" failed to lure in family audiences and even the return of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones wasn't enough to pack cinemas.
However, the combination of bombs and blonde bombshells seems to have inspired plenty of moviegoers to leave their couches for the cinema.
""It's a historic result that showcases the enthusiasm audiences have for a variety of fresh content,"" Robbins said. ""These films have exquisitely tapped into the cultural zeitgeist. They've reignited the summer box office flame, and they've proven that studios can be a little more aggressive with counter-programming strategies in the future.""
Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. NBCUniversal is the distributor of ""Oppenheimer"" and owns Rotten Tomatoes.

2023-07-19 19:40:01+00:00,Weekend Box Office Forecast: BARBIE and OPPENHEIMER Tracking to Combine for Potential $200M+ Opening as ‘Barbenheimer’ Phenom Takes Off,"""Barbenheimer"" has captured the pop culture zeitgeist as Barbie and Oppenheimer are set to deliver one of the biggest moviegoing weekends since 2019.","© Universal Pictures. All Rights Reserved.; © 2022 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. All Rights Reserved.
“Barbenheimer” has captured the pop culture zeitgeist, as Barbie and Oppenheimer are set to deliver one of the biggest moviegoing weekends since 2019.
To date, the biggest overall weekend at the box office since 2020 is Spider-Man: No Way Home‘s debut frame in December 2021, which saw the domestic market earn a total of $283 million. Prior to that, theaters posted $263.9 million during The Lion King‘s opening in late July 2019.
Individually, both Barbie and Oppenheimer could be aiming for significant milestones. For Barbie, Greta Gerwig could secure the record of largest opening weekend for a female-directed film. The top three films in that category now are Captain Marvel ($153.4 million, co-directed by Anna Boden and Nia DaCosta alongside Ryan Fleck), Frozen II ($130.3 million, co-directed by Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck), and Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman ($103.3 million).
Meanwhile, Christopher Nolan’s career-best domestic openings outside the Dark Knight franchise are Inception ($62.8 million) and Dunkirk ($50.5 million). Current opening weekend projections for Oppenheimer put the film right in that range.
As the two films, especially Barbie, continue to track above long range expectations in their counter-programming showdown, here’s a rundown of what’s in play for the highly anticipated weekend.
Barbie
Warner Bros. Pictures
July 21, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $140M-$175M
PROS:
Throughout its marketing campaign, Barbie has spurred immense awareness and interest from women of all ages, an audience that has been largely underserved this summer—with the exception of Disney’s The Little mermaid, a domestic box office hit that’s nearing $300 million in total thanks to healthy holding power amid little competition.
Pre-sales have blown away all expectations in recent weeks as the “Barbenheimer” phenomenon has taken hold of social media. Independent sales data reflects the meme’s popularity, with Barbie trending more than 200 percent ahead of The Little Mermaid‘s Thursday previews in true admissions, when Wednesday’s “Barbie Blowout Party” screenings at approximately 500 locations are taken into account. Other bullish models have Barbie trending 29 percent ahead of recent Marvel films Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.
Boxoffice Pro‘s parent company, The Boxoffice Company, reports the film has outpaced all 2023 releases at the same point in the release cycle, making it their top pre-seller since Avatar: The Way of Water.
Reviews are very positive for director and co-writer Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of the Mattel toy line with a 90 percent Rotten Tomatoes score from 138 critics. If audience reception is comparable, Barbie could avoid a sharply frontloaded run.
CONS:
Although the film is gaining scattered showtimes where possible (particularly in Dolby Cinema), Barbie will be missing a large portion of the typical premium screen footprint that accompanies most major studio tentpole releases due to Oppenheimer exclusively holding IMAX as well as many showtimes in other formats. That creates significant volatility in the floor and ceiling of forecasts. (Notably, Warner Bros. is cautiously expecting $75 million for Barbie‘s opening.)
Reviews are pointing to Barbie‘s appeal as a satirical comedy, which is likely to narrow its target audience to young adults and older moviegoers rather than the kid- and parent-friendly demographics that drove The Super Mario Bros. Movie earlier this year.
Oppenheimer
Universal Pictures
July 21, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $52M-$72M
PROS:
Christopher Nolan’s reputation as a pioneer of modern spectacle cinema driven by strong narratives with wide audience appeal is a major driving force behind his latest original film. Another factor driving admissions is Nolan’s loyal fan base, which has expanded since the release of The Dark Knight trilogy and Inception.
Perhaps as a partial consequence of the “Barbenheimer” phenom, Oppenheimer pre-sales across sample regions have exceeded even optimistic expectations, with independent tracking sources putting the film at least 73 percent ahead of the pace of Dune and slightly ahead of John Wick: Chapter 4 when adjusting for Oppenheimer‘s large premium screen demand.
Adjacent to pre-sales trends, double feature screenings are being planned by more than 200,000 moviegoers, according to a report from the National Association of Theatre Owners. This may be working to increase Oppenheimer‘s already high profile among segments of the younger Barbie audience that may not have otherwise turned out for the Universal release on opening weekend.
Oppenheimer‘s initial wave of reviews are incredibly positive, standing at 95 percent fresh from 98 critics. The film is widely considered to be an early award season candidate with strong adult appeal that could drive box office through the rest of summer.
CONS:
With preview show demand adjustment in mind, audiences seem to be favoring PLF for their viewing of Oppenheimer. That could create a more backloaded run in the grand scheme of things—which would be a positive development, even though it increases volatility and lowers the ceiling for opening weekend projections in the event that walk-up sales outside major cities don’t end up as robust as is typical for other films.
As a three-hour, R-rated film, the film may be stepping outside some of Nolan’s audience wheelhouse and skewing appeal more toward metro regions.
Current projection ranges call for a 97% to 127% increase from last weekend’s $134.2 million top ten aggregate.

2023-07-18 17:57:54+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Barbie’ Heads for $100 Million Breakout, ‘Oppenheimer’ Aims for Strong $50 Million",'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' will spark one of the biggest box office opening weekends in ages,"“Barbenheimer” is officially here, and the battle that’s been referred to as the bomb versus bombshell is about to ignite the box office.
Greta Gerwig’s cotton candy-colored “Barbie,” starring Margot Robbie as the plastic, fantastic doll, is expected to generate a huge $95 million to $110 million from 4,200 North American theaters over the weekend. Given the omnipresence of “Barbie” (the marketing is practically inescapable, with enough memes and marketing tie-ins to last a lifetime), initial estimates are all over the place. Warner Bros. is projecting a more conservative $75 million to start, while rivals and exhibitors believe the PG-13 movie could make as much as $140 million between Friday and Sunday.
In any case, “Barbie” will claim the top spot over Christopher Nolan‘s atomic bomb drama “Oppenheimer,” which is aiming to collect a solid $50 million from 3,600 cinemas through Sunday. Universal is backing the R-rated historical biopic, which cost $100 million.
“Oppenheimer” runs at three hours (“Barbie” clocks in at just under two), which may limit the screenings per day. However, Nolan’s epic will benefit from premium large format screens like Imax, which is dedicating its entire footprint to his film for three weeks.
Together, the seemingly different blockbusters with twin release dates are fueling the phenomenon known as “Barbenheimer.” AMC Theatres, the nation’s biggest cinema chain, reported that 40,000 people have already purchased tickets for double features of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” on the same day — up 20,000 from last week.
The National Association of Theatre Owners, the industry’s trade organization, is projecting that more than 200,000 moviegoers will attend same-day viewings of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” at theaters across North America. And that’s “in addition to the millions of worldwide moviegoers who are planning to see both films on different days this weekend,” says Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of NATO.
The $145 million-budgeted “Barbie” stars too many A-listers to name, but we’ll give it a shot: Ryan Gosling, Issa Rae, Dua Lipa, Simu Liu, Helen Mirren, John Cena and Will Ferrell round out the cast of the fantasy comedy, which follows Barbie and Ken as they leave the comfort and familiarity of Barbie-Land on a quest for self-discovery in the real world.
“Oppenheimer,” adapted by Nolan from the Pulitzer Prize-winning book “American Prometheus,” is an equally star-studded character study about theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy plays the man who led the development of the atomic bomb, alongside an ensemble of Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Alden Ehrenreich.
The potent combination of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” as well as last weekend’s champion “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” is expected to fuel one of the biggest box office weekends in ages. Summer season has otherwise produced a string of underperforming options, like “The Flash,” “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” and “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken.”
Tom Cruise’s newest “Mission” looks to add $28 million to $30 million in its second weekend of release, a decline of roughly 50% from its debut. The seventh installment in Paramount and Skydance’s globe-trotting action franchise opened to $56 million in North America and $234 million globally. It cost $291 million before marketing, so Ethan Hunt’s latest death-defying adventure needs to remain a draw throughout the summer to justify that price tag.
Elsewhere, the unlikely box office hit “Sound of Freedom” is imminently crossing the $100 million mark, which will put the film among the top 16 highest grossing of the year. The low-budget, faith-based movie about child sex trafficking has generated a remarkable $85.7 million to date. That’s thanks mostly to the religious and conservative media groups that have rallied behind the film.
Paul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore analyst, calls “Barbenheimer” a “movie marketers dream come true.” He adds that the craze is “creating a rising tide of interest that should also boost the fortunes of ‘MI7’ and ‘Sound of Freedom’ as moviegoers flood the multiplex in search of movies to catch on the big screen.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItb3BlbmluZy13ZWVrZW5kLWVzdGltYXRlLTEyMzU2NzMwMzUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-18 15:54:52+00:00,"In ‘Barbie’ vs. ‘Oppenheimer,’ the Real Winner May Be the Box Office","The toy-based comedy is expected to draw $100 million; the biopic half that. But in an uneven year for movies, the duel seems to be engaging audiences.","Hollywood urgently needs a weekend that exceeds — or even meets — expectations. This was the year when moviegoing was finally supposed to bounce back from the pandemic, which closed many theaters for months on end and sped the growth of streaming services in homes. At last, cinemas would reclaim a position of cultural urgency.
But ticket sales in the United States and Canada for the year to date (about $5 billion) are down by about 20 percent from the same period in 2019, according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. Blips of hope, including strong sales for the innovative “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” and the hyper-violent “John Wick: Chapter 4,” have been blotted out by disappointing results for expensive franchise films like “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” and “Fast X.”
The latest “Mission: Impossible” film arrived last weekend to solid results, but below what Hollywood had been expecting.
Ticket buyers seem to be tiring of new installments in decades-old franchises. What is succeeding? For the most part, characters that have not been onscreen in recent memory (“The Super Mario Bros. Movie”), new chapters in series that are not as well worn (“Creed III”) and movies that cater to audiences ignored by Hollywood (“Sound of Freedom,” which has been promoted by the right).
For all of her world domination, Barbie has never before had her own big-budget movie. “Oppenheimer” is based on the 2005 biography “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. “Both studios went all-in on original films, directed by notable auteurs with an interest in pushing the envelope,” said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore analyst. “These are not the tried-and-true safe bets that are the hallmark of the summer movie season.”
“Barbie” has major movie stars — Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling — while “Oppenheimer” cast the lesser-known Cillian Murphy in the title role. “Barbie” is aimed at women, while “Oppenheimer” has the edge with men. One represents what many cinephiles loathe about Hollywood: movies based on toys. The other was written and directed by one of Hollywood’s most serious cinephiles.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTgvbW92aWVzL2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Seven days after Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" and Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" conspired to set box office records, the two films held unusually strongly in theaters. ""Barbie"" took in a massive $93 million in its second weekend","A week later, the ""Barbenheimer"" boom has not abated.
Seven days after Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" and Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" conspired to set box office records, the two films held unusually strongly in theaters. ""Barbie"" took in a massive $93 million in its second weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. ""Oppenheimer"" stayed in second with a robust $46.2 million. Sales for the two movies dipped 43% and 44%, respectably — well shy of the usual week-two drops.
""Barbenheimer"" has proven to be not a one-weekend phenomenon but an ongoing box-office bonanza. The two movies combined have already surpassed $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore, call it ""a touchstone moment for movies, moviegoers and movie theaters.""
""Having two movies from rival studios linked in this way and both boosting each other's fortunes — both box-office wise and it terms of their profile — I don't know if there's a comp for this in the annals of box-office history,"" said Dergarabedian. ""There's really no comparison for this.""
Following its year-best $162 million opening, the pink-infused pop sensation of ""Barbie"" saw remarkably sustained business through the week and into the weekend. The film outpaced Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" to have the best first 11 days in theaters of any Warner Bros. release ever.
""Barbie"" has rapidly accumulated $351.4 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters, a rate that will soon make it the biggest box-office hit of the summer. Every day it's played, ""Barbie"" has made at least $20 million.
And the ""Barbie"" effect isn't just in North America. The film made $122.2 million internationally over the weekend. Its global tally has reached $775 million. It's the kind of business that astounds even veteran studio executives.
""That's a crazy number,"" said Jeff Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros. ""There's just a built-in audience that wants to be part of the zeitgeist of the moment. Wherever you go, people are wearing pink. Pink is taking over the world.""
Amid the frenzy, ""Barbie"" is already attracting a lot of repeat moviegoers. Goldstein estimates that 12% of sales are people going back with friends or family to see it again.
For a movie industry that has be trying to regain its pre-pandemic footing — and that now finds itself largely shuttered due to actors and screenwriters strikes — the sensations of ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" have showed what's possible when everything lines up just right.
""Post-pandemic, there's no ceiling and there's no floor,"" said Goldstein. ""The movies that miss, really miss big time and the movies that work really work big time.""
Universal Pictures' ""Oppenheimer,"" meanwhile, is performing more like a superhero movie than a three-hour film about scientists talking.
Nolan's drama starring Cillian Murphy as atomic bomb physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer has accrued $174.1 million domestically thus far. With an additional $72.4 million in international cinemas, ""Oppenheimer"" has already surpassed $400 million globally.
Showings in IMAX have typically been sold out. ""Oppenheimer"" has made $80 million worldwide on IMAX. The large-format exhibitor said Sunday that it will extend the film's run through Aug. 13.
The week's top new release, Walt Disney Co.'s ""Haunted Mansion,"" an adaptation of the Disney theme park attraction, was easily overshadowed by the ""Barbenheimer"" blitz. The film, which cost about $150 million, debuted with $24 million domestically and $9 million in overseas sales. ""Haunted Mansion,"" directed by Justin Simien (""Dear White People,"" ""Bad Hair"") and starring an ensemble of LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito and Rosario Dawson, struggled to overcome mediocre reviews.
""Talk to Me,"" the A24 supernatural horror film, fared better. It debuted with $10 million. The film, directed by Australian filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou and starring Sophie Wilde, was a midnight premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January and received terrific reviews from critics (95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). It was made for a modest $4.5 million.
While theaters being flush with moviegoers has been a huge boon to the film industry, it's been tougher sledding for Tom Cruise, the so-called savior of the movies last summer with ""Top Gun: Maverick."" ""Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part I,"" which debuted the week before the arrival of ""Barbenheimer,"" grossed $10.7 million in its third weekend. The film starring Cruise and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, has grossed $139.2 million domestically and $309.3 million oveseas.
Instead, the sleeper hit ""Sound of Freedom"" has been the best performing non-""Barbenheimer"" release in theaters. The Angel Studios' release, which is counting crowdfunding pay-it-forward sales in its box office totals, made $12.4 million in its fourth weekend, bringing its haul thus far to nearly $150 million.

The final month of the summer movie season begins with July releases Barbie and Oppenheimer beginning to stretch their legs for holdover runs that are already well above expectations. Fighting to knock the pair out of the top two spots at the box office are Paramount and Nickelodeon, with their Seth Rogen-produced counter-programmer Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem; and Warner Bros., diving back into the market with Meg 2: The Trench.
Barbie
3rd Weekend Range: $57M-$66M
Oppenheimer
3rd Weekend Range: $28M-$33M
Coming off a historic weekend that saw Greta Gerwig’s Barbie claim the 7th highest ever sophomore frame performance, the film goes into its third weekend largely without competition from male-driven new releases. However, it will shed some screens and its already limited premium auditorium footing to both Turtles and Meg 2.
Oppenheimer just drew the 5th highest second weekend performance ever for an R-rated film. As a male-driven film, it faces slightly more competition than Barbie, though Oppenheimer‘s momentum and adult lean should continue to pad longevity at the box office. It also retains Imax auditoriums in its third weekend as demand for those screenings continue to generate sellouts.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem
Paramount Pictures
August 2, 2023 (WIDE)
3-Day Opening Weekend Range: $27M-$32M
5-Day Opening Weekend Range: $42M-$50M
PROS:
With few animated offerings in late summer, Turtles has a fairly open market to carry it as a counter-programmer to the ongoing “Barbenheimer” phenom—with the multi-generational appeal of the franchise also likely to provide a boost.
From 102 reviews, the film boasts an incredible 95 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The 94 percent early audience score is also encouraging.
Presales are well outpacing those of Elemental and last summer’s DC League of Super-Pets.
CONS:
Though it will claim some premium screen presence, that share will be limited by competition from Meg 2 and Oppenheimer.
As mentioned previously, it’s been a challenging summer at the box office for multi-decade-old IP, even when the film in discussion is strongly reviewed.
Meg 2: The Trench
Warner Bros. Pictures
August 4, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $22M-$27M
PROS:
Riding in the wake of the first film’s sleeper box office run, this sequel could play to those seeking out a relatively light action film in the wake of more serious tentpoles to have opened recently—especially given the return of Meg star Jason Statham.
CONS:
Concerns of direct competition have only escalated with Barbie and Oppenheimer both pulling strong across all four audience quadrants. The first Meg split almost evenly between men (52 percent) and women (48 percent), but 68 percent of its audience was over the age of 25—the wheelhouse of both “Barbenheimer” films.
Again, premium screen space will be limited. That could be negatively impactful for a sequel that already has to shoulder the weight of 46 percent and 43 percent critics’ and audience scores, respectively. Reviews for Meg 2 were not yet published at the time of this writing.
Current projection ranges call for an 11% to 20% decrease from last weekend’s $209.7 million top ten aggregate.

,‘Oppenheimer’ Will Be the Biggest Test of Christopher Nolan’s Box Office Power,"A three-hour film about nukes is a hard sell - unless the director of ""The Dark Knight"" is making it","Christopher Nolan is one of precious few filmmakers whose name is a major box office draw, and Universal is banking on that being the case with his latest film “Oppenheimer,” a three-hour biopic about the man who led the development of the nuclear bomb and, as one person says in the film, gave humanity “the power to destroy themselves.”
A film with that subject matter would be a hard sell if any other director was attached. Since theaters reopened, films that explore serious, real-life issues have often been the domain of limited release, and even there they have struggled. Oscar contenders like Sarah Polley’s “Women Talking” and Martin McDonagh’s “The Banshees of Inisherin” struggled to build much of a theatrical following, while Universal’s “She Said,” based on the New York Times investigation of Harvey Weinstein, had one of the worst wide-release runs in box office history.
It has become clear that audiences have favored films that offer escape from the problems of the real world rather than confronting them, but Nolan’s presence can change how a movie like “Oppenheimer” is perceived.

Whether it is a dramatic reimagining of a legendary hero with “The Dark Knight” trilogy, mind-bending sci-fi originals like “Inception” and “Interstellar” or gripping period pieces like “Dunkirk,” Nolan’s films have been marketed for over a decade as true motion picture events. The filmmaker’s devoted fans have gone the extra mile and paid the extra money to see his work on the biggest screen possible, and in rarely-used formats like 70mm film.
Box office tracking currently points to those devotees turning out in droves to see “Oppenheimer.” While Warner Bros.’ “Barbie” is slated to easily take No. 1, and possibly earn the summer’s biggest opening weekend, “Oppenheimer” is expected to do quite well with an opening weekend of at least $45 million. Exhibition sources who spoke to TheWrap said that based on advance ticket sales the film has a shot to top $50 million this weekend, which would put it above the $50.5 million domestic launch of “Dunkirk” in 2017.
Such a result would be a big win for both Universal and Nolan given the film’s grim tone and subject matter and would put “Oppenheimer” in a position to turn a theatrical profit against its reported $100 million production budget and $100 million marketing campaign.

Can ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Last at the Box Office Against the Power of ‘Barbenheimer’?
At that price tag, “Dunkirk” will be the measure of success not only for opening weekend but for the entire run of “Oppenheimer.” Six years ago, “Dunkirk” grossed $188 million domestically and $525 million worldwide, including $80 million from Great Britain and $50.9 million from China.
Given China’s near-abandonment of Hollywood films, and the extra boost that the U.K. gave to “Dunkirk” on account of it being a WWII film, the totals earned by “Oppenheimer” in those countries probably won’t be as high. It’s also possible that “Oppenheimer” won’t have a release in Japan, as Universal has not scheduled an opening date there given that nuclear weapons are a sensitive subject.
But Nolan’s popularity amongst cinema lovers in the U.S. also extends to Europe. Back in 2020, Warner Bros., at Nolan’s urging, released his sci-fi film “Tenet” during the peak of the pandemic in an effort to provide financial relief for theaters. While the U.S. was suffering through a spike in infections at the time, “Tenet” was able to take advantage of a lull in infections in other countries to gross $306 million internationally, including $20 million-plus runs in the U.K., France and Germany.

“Oppenheimer” is also getting a little extra help from its simultaneous release date with “Barbie,” as the National Association of Theater Owners is claiming that 200,000 people have bought tickets to both films on the same day. That may only be a sliver of this film’s overall grosses, but it’s clear that the “Barbenheimer” craze is attracting moviegoers who may otherwise not have been as interested in “Oppenheimer.”
We won’t know until the second weekend and beyond — after “Barbenheimer” has faded and the hardcore Nolan fans have come out — just how big of an appetite there is among audiences to see Nolan’s darkest film yet. If it can sustain itself and reach $500 million worldwide, that will be a big sign of hope for the film industry that mature fare can still be profitable in wide release.

Barbie
Warner Bros.’ comedy declines only -36% to $21.5M, finally notching the runner-up slot after spending four frames in first place.
All time, Barbie has now earned the:
With $567.2M total through 31 days, it now ranks as the #15 biggest movie of all time, between April’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie with $574.2M and 2019’s The Lion King with $543.6M.
Barbie also ranks #2 of the year so far, behind only Mario. However, it’s running +12% ahead of Mario through the equivalent 31-day point in release: $503.7M.
Oppenheimer
Universal’s historical war drama declines only -43% to $10.6M, falling from second to third place.
All time, Oppenheimer has earned:
Opening weekend outside the top 100: $82.4M
Fifth frame once again falling outside the top 100: $10.6M
With $285.2M total through 31 days, it now stands as the #117 biggest movie of all time domestically, ranking between 1990’s Home Alone with $285.7M and 2015’s The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 with $281.7M.
It also stands as the #7 biggest R-rated movie of all time domestically, between 2018’s Deadpool 2 with $324.5M and 2003’s The Matrix Reloaded with $281.5M.
Depending on how it holds, Oppenheimer stands a shot at finishing among the top five R-rated film, with a small shot at #1. Currently, that mark has been held for 19 years by 2004’s The Passion of the Christ: $370.7M.
Here’s how Oppenheimer compares to the top five R-rated films ever, through the equivalent 31-day point in wide release:
-6% behind 2004’s The Passion of the Christ : $305.6M -13% behind 2016’s Deadpool : $328.2M -13% behind 2014’s American Sniper : also $328.2M -3% behind 2019’s Joker : $299.1M -6% behind 2017’s It : $305.2M
Oppenheimer is also poised to become writer-director Christopher Nolan’s biggest (non-Batman) film. Here’s how Oppenheimer compares to his other biggest original titles:
+14% above 2010’s Inception , through the equivalent point in release: $248.4M / only -2% behind its final total: $292.5M
+51% and counting above the final total for 2014’s Interstellar : $188.0M
+50% and counting above the final total for 2017’s Dunkirk : $190.0M
Last Wednesday, Oppenheimer also set another unusual record: highest-grossing film to never top a weekend box office.
It beat the prior record holder, 2016’s Sing with $270.3M, which peaked at #2 behind Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.
Overseas / global
This weekend, Oppenheimer declined -38% overseas, milder than its -44% domestic drop.
Oppenheimer has earned $432.6M overseas and $717.8M globally.
That beats Dunkirk globally with $530M and Interstellar with $648M, and is right on the verge of surpassing Inception with $728M, likely later this week.
Globally, it’s now the #132 film of all time, ranking between 2021’s F9 with $726.2M and Nolan’s Interstellar with $715.7M.
Top overseas markets totals are:
U.K.: $63.8M Germany: $39.5M France: $31.2M Australia: $22.9M India: $18.4M Spain: $18.3M Mexico: $18.0M Netherlands: $16.1M South Korea: $12.6M Brazil: $12.5M
Later this month, the film will debut in key markets including China and Italy.
IMAX
Oppenheimer has earned $80.8M domestically and $146.4M globally from IMAX, the #4 domestic and #5 global IMAX total of all time.
Globally, it only trails 2009’s Avatar, 2022’s Avatar: The Way of Water, 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and 2019’s Avengers: Endgame.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem
In its third frame, Paramount’s animated action comedy reboot declines -45% to $8.4M, falling from third to fourth place.
After a midweek Wednesday debut, Mayhem has earned $88.1M after 19 days. It’s already outgrossed two of the last three films in the franchise:
+7% and counting above the final total for 2016’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows – $82.0M
+62% and counting above the final total for 2007’s TMNT : $54.1M
However, it’s running below both the franchise’s 2014 installment and another comparable title, through the equivalent 19-day point in release:
-40% below 2014’s hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : $148.4M
-23% below 2018’s similar animation style Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse – $114.3M
Overseas / global
This weekend, Mayhem declined -52% overseas in holdover markets, slightly steeper than its -45% domestic drop.
Mayhem has now earned $30.3M overseas and $118.4M globally.
It looks certain not to reach the $485M global total for 2014’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but could still match the $245M global total for 2016’s Out of the Shadows.
Top overseas markets are:
U.K.: $9.0M Mexico: $5.0M France: $3.2M Germany: $2.0M
Last weekend, the film opened with less than $1M in China, only eighth place in that market.
Later this month and next, the film will debut in key markets including Spain, Brazil, Australia, South Korea, and Japan.

It also opened below some of this year’s other R-rated comedies:
-44% below June’s No Hard Feelings : $15.0M
Even with February’s Magic Mike’s Last Dance : $8.3M
However, it did open +43% above July’s Joy Ride: $5.8M
Audience demographics
Strays earned a “B+” CinemaScore, from an audience estimated at 56% male, 67% ages 25+, and only 46% white.
Overseas / global
Strays opened in a limited 21 overseas markets to $1.9M, for a $10.2M global opening.

,"Even the stars of ‘Barbenheimer’ love the unlikely summer box office rivalry, ‘It’s a perfect double bill,’ says Margot Robbie","Both ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" come out July 21 and an unlikely love/hate relationship is brewing.","The very online showdown between Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” all started with a date: July 21.
It’s not uncommon for studios to counterprogram films in different genres on a big weekend, but the stark differences between an intense, serious-minded picture about the man who oversaw the development of the atomic bomb and a lighthearted, candy-colored anthropomorphizing of a childhood doll quickly became the stuff of viral fodder.
There’s even some disagreement over whether it’s “Barbieheimer” or “Barbenheimer” or “Boppenheimer” or yet another tortured portmanteau — a phenomenon on which the AP Stylebook has yet to offer guidance, but for the purposes of this article will be “Barbenheimer.”
It didn’t hurt that both Nolan and Gerwig have very passionate and very online fandoms eager to join in. Never mind that many of those fans overlap — the memes, allegiances, and T-shirts were just too fun.
Both movies often trend on social media when the other releases a new asset — a trailer, a picture, an interview. On one level, it’s a marketing department’s dream. Awareness could not be higher, the conversation couldn’t be louder, and neither film even has official reviews out yet.
“’Barbenheimer’ is a marketing gift borne out of social media and I think it’s benefiting both films,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for analytics firm Comscore. “You’re certainly aware of both movies in a more profound and compelling way than I think might have otherwise happened had they been released on different weekends.”
AMC Theaters reported that 20,000 of its AMC Stubs members had purchased tickets for a double feature. If you’re counting, that’s 294 minutes of moviewatching. Even Margot Robbie — Barbie herself — and Tom Cruise, the star of another summer blockbuster, have started plotting the ideal “Barbenheimer” day.
“It’s a perfect double bill,” said Robbie at her movie’s London premiere Wednesday. “I think actually start your day with ‘Barbie,’ then go straight into ‘Oppenheimer’ and then a ‘Barbie’ chaser.”
Cruise — whose “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” opened a little over a week before the “Barbenheimer” showdown — said at his premiere he’d plan to see both on their opening day, likely starting with “Oppenheimer,” which seems to be the internet’s preferred viewing order as well.
“Barbie” actor Issa Rae thinks there’s a reason for that.
“I think that there’s a very specific order that if you see them in. If you see ‘Oppenheimer’ last then you might be a bit of a psychopath,” she diagnosed at the London premiere.
The showdown has made armchair marketing experts out of everyone, quick to scrutinize every move by Warner Bros. and Universal — as though it’s possible to compare two extraordinarily different campaigns.
One has infinite opportunities for very pink, sparkly photo opportunities, whimsical brand partnerships for seemingly everything from underwear to pool floats, large-scale fan events with autograph signings and pop stars like Billie Eilish posting about the soundtrack. In other words, the “Barbie” campaign can go nuclear.
“Oppenheimer” has the bomb, the alluring mystery and the big screen hook, but it’s not the kind of movie that lends itself to, say, a frozen yogurt collaboration.
Is the competition real, though, or just a meme? Some in Hollywood wondered if Warner Bros. plopped “Barbie” on the weekend as a slight to Nolan, who had opened many films for the studio in that corridor including “Inception” and “Dunkirk.” He left Warner Bros. amid its controversial decision to send a year’s worth of movies to streaming and made “Oppenheimer” with Universal instead. But a pointed box office war doesn’t exactly make sense for a studio that has talked recently about wanting to lure Nolan back.
There is an unspoken code of conduct: Never badmouth another studio’s film, publicly at least. This is partly decorum, especially when it comes to “box office showdowns” which all will say are a creation of the press and sideline spectators. But it’s also rooted in some truth: The conventional thinking is that having eyes on one movie is good for other movies — you see their posters and trailers and on some level everyone benefits.
And social media has allowed movie stars to get in on the game, too. Following reports that Cruise was irked the latest “Mission: Impossible” was going to lose its IMAX screens to “Oppenheimer” after only a week, Cruise posted photos of himself and director Christopher McQuarrie standing in front of posters for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” holding tickets for each.
“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters. These are just a few that we can’t wait to see on the big screen,” Cruise’s Instagram caption read.
The official accounts for “Indiana Jones,” “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” responded with supportive notes. Gerwig and Robbie even followed with a similar photo series a few days later, which the official “Oppenheimer” Instagram account reposted in its stories. Charged with playing Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy told the AP at his movie’s London premiere that “of course” he’d be seeing “Barbie.” The sporting cross-promotion between four studios — Universal, Warner Bros., Disney and Paramount — is something the film business has not quite seen before.
“Not only is Tom Cruise the biggest box office star in the world, but he’s also an incredible ambassador for the movie theater, for the movie theater experience and boosting other movies,” Dergarabedian said. “And that collegial atmosphere within the framework of what is seen as the very competitive box office derby is kind of a nice thing.”
Still, everyone likes a No. 1 debut, and both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” reportedly carry $100 million production price tags (not including the millions spent on marketing). As far as box office tracking goes, “Barbie” has it in the bag with forecasts showing that it could open above $90 million in North America. “Oppenheimer” meanwhile is tracking in the $40 million range. Then there’s the wild card of “Mission: Impossible 7’s” second weekend, which could snag second place.
Still even with a second- or third-place start, “Oppenheimer” could be destined for a long, steady, profitable run into awards season. Adult audiences for R-rated movies are not often the ones who pack theaters the first weekend.
Back in 2008, in the midst of the recession, Warner Bros. and Universal faced off on the same July weekend with another Nolan film that went up against a lighthearted confection: “The Dark Knight” and “Mamma Mia!” — both of which went on to be enormously profitable (though Nolan did win the first weekend).
The bigger worry is that what’s been heralded as Hollywood’s post-pandemic comeback summer has had more ups and downs than anyone might have hoped. That’s putting quite a bit of pressure on “Barbenheimer” to overperform and boost the lagging summer box office, which pales in comparison to the bigger issues facing the industry as actors join the writers on strike.
But with just over a week to go, it’s still a source of amusement. Even “Barbie” co-star Will Ferrell threw the gauntlet in his winking way at the London premiere.
“I think the world maybe wants to see ‘Barbie’ a little bit more right now,” Ferrell said. “Just saying!”

The Barbenheimer box-office tallies are finally in. Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer split the theatrical moviegoing atom over their opening weekend, unleashing a terrible new knowledge about the fearsome power of unharnessed toy IP and the undersung counter-programing bankability of summertime adult drama. Both movies wildly overshot even the most optimistic prerelease financial expectations: The plastic-fantastic existential-dramedy musical Barbie surpassed 2023’s previous record holder The Super Mario Bros. Movie with a $162 million domestic three-day total to log the year’s biggest opening. And Nolan’s three-hour, R-rated historical drama (largely plotted around scenes of Serious Men in Serious Locations talking and talking) took in $82 million in North America — each title more than doubling its prerelease “tracking” estimate in the process.
At a time when overall ticket sales are down 21 percent from the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, and with some of this summer’s biggest presumed rainmakers like Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One and Fast X basically breaking even at the box office, it all compelled the National Association of Theatre Owners to issue a statement calling the combined, Barbie-Oppenheimer $520.4 million global haul a “truly historic weekend.” Industry observers (well, okay, just me) could be forgiven for paraphrasing the father of the atomic bomb’s famous Bhagavad Gita utterance: I am become Barbenheimer, buster of blocks.
Amid a summer season otherwise saturated with superhero movies (The Flash, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3), sequels (Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Extraction 2, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Insidious: The Red Door), live-action adaptations of beloved animated movies (The Little Mermaid), and reboots (Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, White Men Can’t Jump), Barbenheimer’s robust returns are probably evidence of franchise fatigue — or at least that audiences are still willing to turn out in staggering numbers for alternatives to what they perceive as the same old, same old. Barbie’s numbers stand as the best-ever opening for a movie based on a toy (toppling Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon’s $115.9 million debut), and the second-best theatrical bow in history for a female filmmaker (Captain Marvel, co-directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, took in $455 million worldwide over its first three days in 2019). Oppenheimer, meanwhile, arrives as Nolan’s most successful non-Dark Knight opening to date. The upshot: the most money-earning weekend for movie-theater owners since Avengers: Endgame became an inescapable cultural sensation in April 2019.
Planning for the live-action feature adaptation of Mattel’s 64-year-old fashion-plate doll began back in 2009 with various iterations over the years set to star Anne Hathaway and Amy Schumer. Oscar-winner Diablo Cody took a crack at an early script draft and Wonder Woman filmmaker Patty Jenkins briefly negotiated for the director’s chair before star-producer Margot Robbie brought Oscar-nominated writer-director Gerwig onto the project. But with the March floppage of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, a $150 million fantasy-thriller loosely plotted around Hasbro’s tabletop role-playing game, intellectual properties based on even the most cherished toy lines were hardly hot stuff around Hollywood. Gerwig’s Barbie breakthrough (she also wrote the script with her life partner Noah Baumbach) has now catapulted her into the industry’s top tier of directors and all but guarantees future franchise installments as part of a larger Warner Bros. push to develop movies based on Mattel toys like Hot Wheels, He-Man, Rock ’Em Sock ’Em Robots, and Uno.
As the more adult-skewing offering of the Barbie-Oppenheimer double feature (seen by an estimated 200,000 people who bought tickets to both movies on the same day, according to NATO), Nolan’s prestige biopic was less obviously a smash-in-waiting and, arguably, the harder sell. Hitting 3,610 screens at the apex of popcorn movie season (with mid-to-late July serving as the British auteur’s preferred release corridor for almost all his major movies save for Interstellar and The Dark Knight Rises) the talky, weighty historical drama about the recalcitrant father of nuclear war was more obviously suited to an awards season bow than as a lead-in batter for Meg 2: The Trench.
But beyond drafting off of Barbie’s outsized box-office draw — Puck’s Matt Belloni points out that 6 percent of moviegoers who saw Oppenheimer did so because Barbie was sold out, yielding around $5 million of the biopic’s weekend gross — the film’s $82 million turnout stands as the latest triumph in a hit-strewn 2023 for Universal film group chairman Donna Langley. Langley recruited Nolan to the Uni fold after he became disenchanted with longtime studio home Warner Bros. for bungling the release of his sci-fi mindbender Tenet in 2020 and controversially day-and-date dumping the entirety of its 2021 movie lineup onto HBO Max. And she has been on a Hollywood streak this year, launching a worldwide horror hit with M3gan, scoring a respectable breakthrough with the original (if insane) IP of Cocaine Bear, and following those relatively minor triumphs up with the franchise-kickstarting, blockbuster bona fides of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which similarly seemed to come out of nowhere and strike the Zeitgeist to put more butts in seats than almost anyone inside the industry thirty-mile zone could have ever predicted.
On July 21, Gerwig made a surprise visit to a Barbie screening at Brooklyn’s Alamo Drafthouse. She spoke about her aspirations in making the movie but could have just as easily been describing how Barbenheimer connected with moviegoers. “When we made this movie, we made it with so much hope and joy, and we hoped that people would go back to the movie theater and be together,” the director said. “And this is just fucking extraordinary!”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvYmFyYmllLXZzLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtZXhwbGFpbmVkLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Hollywood's biggest weekend at the box office in years wasn't fueled by superheroes, Jedi or the promise of a sequel. Sure, there were big names: Barbie, the iconic fashion doll; Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb; and, of course, directors Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan. But what set ""Barbenheimer"" weekend apart was fresh storytelling, a fear of missing out on a cultural moment and a desire to experience movies on the biggest screen possible. ""They did a great job of positioning it as a movie that not only needed to be seen in theaters, but needed to be seen with your friends in a theater,"" said Mike Polydoros, CEO at cinema marketing firm PaperAirplane Media.
'At a crossroads'
The historic box office combination of Warner Bros. Discovery's ""Barbie"" and Universal's ""Oppenheimer"" arrived at a time when even the most dependable franchise movies have failed to lure in audiences. Marvel and DC movies aren't pulling in the same ticket sales as they did before the Covid-19 pandemic, nor are new installments in film series such as Mission Impossible, Fast and Furious, Indiana Jones and Transformers. Movie nostalgia is no longer enough to inspire consumers to leave their couches for cinemas. ""The industry is at a crossroads,"" said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. ""The success of 'Oppenheimer' and 'Barbie' shows why studios need to start thinking more outside the box while allowing creative talent the room to do what they do best. Gone are the days when a brand can simply be slapped onto a product and people be expected to show up in droves just because they have before or because an algorithm suggests they will.""
Together, ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" generated $244.5 million during their first three days in theaters — $162 million for ""Barbie"" and $82.5 million for ""Oppenheimer."" Adding ticket sales from Paramount's newest ""Mission: Impossible"" film, Sony's ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" and Angel Studios' ""The Sound of Freedom,"" the weekend box office topped $311 million, the fourth-highest weekend haul in history.

The FOMO effect
""Barbenheimer's"" historic weekend was also fueled by a sense of urgency, which the box office has been lacking in recent months. ""A fear of missing out on such a special moment motivated people to see one or both, perhaps sooner than they ordinarily would have,"" Robbins said. Audiences were drawn to see ""Oppenheimer"" on the biggest screen possible, or in specialty theaters that showed the exclusive 70mm footage of Nolan's biopic. Nolan's films have come to be event cinema, as the director shies away from computer-generated images in favor of practical effects and is known for creating powerful visuals. As for ""Barbie,"" a huge draw for audiences was the communal experience of donning bubblegum pink and going out in large groups, and, of course, Gerwig, who is known for her sharp, witty dialogue and focus on female-driven stories.
Another piece of the appeal was the fact that the two films were so drastically different. ""They compounded one another's success via the Barbenheimer meme, as it organically took over the pop culture consciousness and crossed over into mainstream channels that don't normally include movies in their casual daily discourse,"" Robbins said. He noted that both films would have been box-office hits regardless, but ""the mystique of them opening on the same day elevated their profiles to an entirely new level."" The meme-worthy trend of seeing both in the same day drove hundreds of thousands of people to cinemas over the weekend. Typically, two films arriving on the same weekend from rival studios would lead to cannibalization of ticket sales.

2023-08-02 20:41:40+00:00,"July Domestic Box Office On Fire With $1.37 Billion, Second Best Ever","Barbie, Oppenheimer Fuel July U.S. Box Office To Second Best With $1.37B","Not streaming, nor strikes, nor shell shock from the pandemic kept this July’s domestic box office down with studio tentpoles and a faith-based surprise movie racking up the second-best record for the month with $1.37 billion per Comscore.
Warner Bros’ Barbie and Universal’s Oppenheimer were the No. 1 and 2 movies with $366.4M and $181.4M respectively.
The record July still belongs to 2011 which cashed in $1.39 billion. Get this, Warners also led that month as well with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 which made $318.5M of its $381M gross during July back then.
This July was so great, it was +20% over last July’s $1.14 billion and +6% from pre-pandemic 2019 which minted $1.29 billion.
“July was incredible for people who love going to the movies in cinemas with friends and family,” said NATO’s President and CEO Michael O’Leary in statement.
“This month now ranks as one of the top-performing Julys in the history of motion pictures,” he continued, “Consumer enthusiasm and excitement continues to grow as our partners in the creative community and at the studios continue to release a steady stream of compelling and entertaining movies across multiple genres, while theater owners take showmanship to the next level.
As we also told you, this past weekend’s domestic haul of $217M for all movies was a record for the final session of July.
“This past weekend is also further evidence that the economic impact of high-quality movies cannot be measured simply by the opening weekend box office,” O’Leary added.
“Most importantly, July highlights the special bond between the American public and movie theatres and the unique cultural moments they create that cannot be replicated elsewhere,” said the new NATO Boss.
Shaping out the rest of the top ten pics of July for the period of July 1-31: 3.) Angel Studios’ relentless Sound of Freedom ($151.3M), 4) Disney/Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny ($143.9M), 5) Paramount/Skydance’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning – Part One ($140.4M), 6) Sony/Blumhouse’s Insidious: The Red Door ($78.5M), 7) Disney/Pixar’s Elemental ($64.6M), 8) Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse ($47.1), 9) Disney’s Haunted Mansion ($26.4M) and 10) Sony’s No Hard Feelings ($26.1M).
With the SAG-AFTRA strike already pushing big movies like Kraven the Hunter, Challengers and the next Ghostbusters out of 2023, and exhibition fearing a downturn at the B.O. come October should the actors’ sit-out continue, the guild’s National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland told Deadline yesterday that despite that harsh impact, “we have to take a strong line.”
While a supporter of exhibition, Crabtree-Ireland acknowledged that the sector is “obviously very challenged” however “we can’t allow theatrical exhibition to become a way that the studios are sort of fueling their businesses during our strike.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWp1bHktYm94LW9mZmljZS1yZWNvcmQtMTIzNTQ1Mjg3Ni_SAVZodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4L2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1qdWx5LWJveC1vZmZpY2UtcmVjb3JkLTEyMzU0NTI4NzYvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-29 19:08:57+00:00,‘Barbie’ Glamming Up For $80M-$100M Opening With Presales Bigger Than ‘Little Mermaid’; ‘Oppenheimer’ Has Shot At $50M – Box Office Outlook,"'Barbie' Eyeing $80M-$100M Opening, 'Oppenheimer' $40M-$50M: Box Office","It is quite conceivable that another near-$200M weekend is in store at the box office over the July 21-23 frame.
Warner Bros.’ comedic feature take on girl toy Barbie starring Margot Robbie in the title role and Ryan Gosling as Ken cruised onto tracking today, and hot would be a modest way of describing the box office outlook here. While Warners conservatively is saying $60M, tracking shows that Barbie is bigger than last month’s The Little Mermaid in pulling in general audiences and young women under 25. A weekend start of $80M minimum is what we’re hearing, and that too is a tampered-down expectation because Barbie on paper has all the glitz for a potential $100M start. Little Mermaid‘s 3-day over the Memorial Day holiday weekend was $95.5M.
Barbie’s sweet spot is under-35 females and secondarily 35- to 49-year-olds.
Also, Barbie presales at this point in time are pacing ahead of Little Mermaid. At the Wednesday before its opening Little Mermaid counted $19M in advance ticket sales before grossing a first Friday/previews day of $38.1M. Little Mermaid attracted 68% women and 61% between 18-34, with the largest demo being ages 25-34 at 35%.
Now Christopher Nolan’s three-hour movie about the architect of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer, isn’t looking at leftovers. As one distribution insider describes its wattage, “It’s as much male and older as Barbie is female and younger.” We’re also hearing that one should not discount the female audience here in attending Oppenheimer, and under/over 25 both are strong too this ensemble pic starring Cillian Murphy in the title role, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr. and more.
A $40M-to-possible $50M opening is expected here, with the Universal movie having full control of Imax theaters for three weeks. Nolan’s Dunkirk opened to $50.5M and legged out to $189.7M in 2017. You’ll remember that Nolan’s previous film back in August 2020, Tenet, got shuttered theaters opened in the U.S. during Covid (except for LA, NYC and San Francisco) and posted a $20M 5-day gross over Labor Day weekend, including a pre-release in Canada; that film with its hands tied behind its back.
Filling out the rest of the near-$200M weekend over July 21-23 is the second weekend of Paramount’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One with around $35M. That’s looking at a franchise-best launch, and it wouldn’t be unheard-of if that movie does $100M in five days over July 12-16.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtcHJvamVjdGlvbi0xMjM1NDI3MzcwL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtcHJvamVjdGlvbi0xMjM1NDI3MzcwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
02:34.6,'Barbie' vs. 'Oppenheimer': Who will win the box office battle?,,"It's a big week for Hollywood with the release of two blockbusters that have collectively become known as ""Barbenheimer"": “Barbie,” about the iconic Mattel doll; and “Oppenheimer,” about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man often called the father of the atomic bomb.
One makes the shiny, pink, plastic world of Barbie come to life; the other explores what led to the real-life tragedy unleashed by America’s use of the atomic bomb on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.
The two movies seem like opposites, at least on the surface. But are they?
“I think that it's exciting to have such a dissonant initial impression of the diametrically opposed theatrical experience,” Sarah G. Vincent, who writes about film for Cambridge Day, In Between Drafts and other outlets, told GBH’s Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel on Morning Edition Wednesday. “But I actually think when they go to the theaters, it's not going to feel like that.”
For the uninitiated: In April 2022, studios announced that director Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” would open the same day as director Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer.”
Some of the social media-driven excitement was about the difference in aesthetics: Barbie’s glamorous, shiny and highly-saturated magenta world juxtaposed against Oppenheimer’s darker tones.

People started getting excited about which film would find more commercial success, Vincent said. Nolan has a history of dominating summer box offices with releases like his Batman movies and “Interstellar.”
“This seems like almost a no-brainer, he's going to win. Maybe the odds are in his favor,” Vincent said. “I've been rooting for Greta Gerwig, who's the underdog in this race. But I also think — and this is going to be an unpopular hot take — [Gerwig] is the better filmmaker, because her movies are actually really empathetic and on a human level.”
It’s hard to tell which film will come out on top, she said. Both have definite draws, albeit for different audiences.
But they also may have more in common than meets the eye, Vincent said.
“The movies may deal with similar thorny human issues, and 'Barbie' might be deeper than everyone's expecting. And maybe 'Oppenheimer' will be the lighter movie,” she said. “I don't know how it's going to play out in the actual theaters, but I do think 'Barbie' might surprise. The fan base may not be expecting what they get from Greta Gerwig.”
She emphasized that “Barbie” might be a bit darker than people are expecting.
“I have a feeling it's going to be parents with their kids, in for a bit of a surprise,” she said.
There are also the die-hard film fans embarking on what’s being called ""Barbenheimer"" movie days, seeing both movies, one after the other. GBH’s Morning Edition co-host Jeremy Siegel plans to be among them.
But in the battle of Barbenheimer opening weekend, most people will opt for a third choice: Staying home.
Movie theater attendance is just not what it once was. Some audience members are more comfortable at home, on their own couches with their own reasonably-priced popcorn, and no summer blockbuster will lure them back into a movie theater.
“I don't think this is what's going to tempt them to necessarily come outside,” Vincent said. “But for the people who are reliable Christopher Nolan fans and the people who like Barbie, they're going to come out.”
Further complicating the weekend box office is the fact that the star actors are on strike with the Screen Actors Guild, meaning they cannot promote their projects until major studios reach an agreement with the union.
Still, movie theaters have not had an opening weekend with this much buzz in a long time.
“When I went to 'Barbie,' I wore different shades of pink,” Vincent said. “And I don't usually do that. I'm usually kind of incognito in, like, the grayest, darkest thing. So that was a nice contrast. Maybe I'll continue it for the 'Oppenheimer' screening.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndnYmgub3JnL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy0wNy0xOS9iYXJiaWUtdnMtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItd2hvLXdpbGwtd2luLXRoZS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWJhdHRsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,‘Mission: Impossible’ and Tom Cruise dominate box office but come in shy of industry expectations,"“Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One"" launched with a franchise-best $80 million over five days.","After a globe-trotting publicity blitz by star Tom Cruise, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” launched with a franchise-best $80 million over five days, though it came in shy of industry expectations with a $56.2 million haul over the three-day weekend.
The Paramount Pictures debut was boosted by strong overseas sales of $155 million from 70 markets. But while a $235 million worldwide launch marked one of the best global openings of the year, “Dead Reckoning” couldn’t approach the high-speed velocity of last summer’s top film, “Top Gun: Maverick.”
“Dead Reckoning Part One,” the seventh film in the 27-year-old series, had been forecast to better the franchise high of the previous installment, “Fallout,” which opened with $61 million domestically in 2018. Instead, it also fell short of the $57.8 million “Mission: Impossible II” debuted with in 2000.
That puts the film’s opening-weekend tally very close to the tepid launch of Disney’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which opened in U.S. and Canadian theaters with $82 million over five days and $60 million over the three-day weekend. Paramount and Skydance had higher hopes for the action extravaganza of “Dead Reckoning,” which cost $290 million to make, not counting marketing expenses.
Those costs were inflated, in part, by the pandemic. “Dead Reckoning,” directed by Christopher McQuarrie, was among the first major productions shut down by COVID-19. It was preparing to shoot in Italy in March 2020. When the film got back on track, McQuarrie and Cruise helped lead the industry-wide recovery back to film sets – albeit with some well-publicized friction over protocols along the way.
Still, “Dead Reckoning” was hailed as a high point in the franchise. Critics (96% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and fans (an “A” CinemaScore) alike came away awed by the stunts and chases of the latest “Mission: Impossible” film. Though the coming competition of “Barbenheimer” — the much-anticipated debuts of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” — looms, “Mission: Impossible” should play well for weeks to come.
Cruise, the so-called savior of movie theaters last year, traveled tirelessly to again pump life back into a summer box office that’s been sluggish. After a splashy world premiere in Rome with a red-carpet on the Spanish Steps, Cruise and McQuarrie toured through theaters in Atlanta, Miami, Toronto and Washington D.C. in the days ahead of opening.
“Dead Reckoning” hit theaters at a crucial mid-summer period for Hollywood, and not just because of the SAG-AFTRA strike which began Thursday. “Mission: Impossible” launched a week before one of the biggest box-office showdowns of the year.
Though “Dead Reckoning” and “Oppenheimer” have vied for some of the same IMAX screens, each film has publicly endorsed the idea that a rising tide lifts all blockbusters. Cruise and McQuarrie in early July even bought opening-weekend tickets to both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.” “Barbie” director Greta Gerwig and “Oppenheimer” filmmaker Christopher Nolan returned with their own gestures of support.
However that trio of films performs over the next few weeks will do a lot to determine the fate of the summer box office.
No other new wide release challenged “Mission: Impossible” over the weekend. Second place went to Angel Studios’ faith-based political thriller “Sound of Freedom” which increased 37% in its second with $27 million. Jim Caveziel stars in the child trafficking drama.
Last week’s top film, “ Insidious: The Red Door ” slid to third with $13 million in its second weekend. “Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny” is dropping quickly with $12 million its third weekend, with a domestical total so far of $145.4 million.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8xNi9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtdG9tLWNydWlzZS1kb21pbmF0ZS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWJ1dC1jb21lLWluLXNoeS1vZi1pbmR1c3RyeS1leHBlY3RhdGlvbnMv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly9mb3J0dW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3LzE2L21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS10b20tY3J1aXNlLWRvbWluYXRlLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYnV0LWNvbWUtaW4tc2h5LW9mLWluZHVzdHJ5LWV4cGVjdGF0aW9ucy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-31 19:29:46+00:00,AMC has best week in ticket sales led by Barbie and Oppenheimer box office wins,"AMC Theaters hit a revenue record last week, driven by the overwhelming success of the “Barbenheimer” pop culture craze.","CNN —
AMC Theaters (AMC) hit a revenue record last week, driven by the overwhelming success of the “Barbenheimer” pop culture craze.
In a news release on Sunday, the world’s largest theater chain announced that from July 21-27, it earned its largest single-week admissions revenue since the company’s founding in 1920. AMC attributed this 103-year high to the incredible opening weekend of both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” as well as the strong momentum that continued to carry them along.
“Barbenheimer” had tremendous staying power in its second weekend in theaters, with “Barbie” grossing $93 million and “Oppenheimer” almost $47 million, according to official studio numbers.
Last weekend was AMC’s busiest since the pandemic forced theaters to close in 2020, the company said, and this weekend marked the chain’s third-busiest worldwide since reopening. It reported that 65 AMC locations across 19 states and Washington, DC, set their own box office records this week as well. AMC shares were up about 7% in late-afternoon trading, to about $4.99.
In its opening weekend, Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” had raked in a stunning $162 million domestically, giving the film the biggest debut of 2023. It’s also the largest-ever for a female director. Meanwhile, “Oppenheimer” opened at $82.5 million, according to media analytics company Comscore.
Combined, the movies have made more than a billion dollars globally in just 10 days.

2023-06-30 14:00:00+00:00,Barbie: Impossible and Indiana Oppenheimer: July Box Office Needs a Hero,"Whether it's Tom Cruise, Margot Robbie, or Harrison Ford, July needs a box office hero.","July, the season of fireworks, vacations, and light-hearted blockbusters, represents this summer’s last shot at a $100 million opening. It will also determine if box office has a shot at improving on last year’s $3.4 billion total.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” (Disney) opens tomorrow, “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” (Paramount) is July 12, and “Barbie” (Warner Bros. Discovery) and “Oppenheimer” (Universal) are July 19. All are expected to open to at least $50 million; $100 million is not entirely unrealistic, but it may be unlikely. All told, the month could represent anywhere from $1 billion to as much as $1.4 billion.
Going in, the hope was a $4 billion summer — an 18 percent improvement above the 2022 total of just under $3.4 billion. So far, the improvement is 3.5 percent, on track for $3.5 billion. Even that isn’t guaranteed, although there’s hope that August will represent a significant improvement over a very weak 2022.
The June estimate is slightly over $1 billion, a four percent uptick from last year. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” (Sony) contributed about a third of this, followed at some distance by “The Little Mermaid” (Disney) and “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” (Paramount), both of which grossed over $100 million in June. “The Flash” (WBD) and “Elemental” (Disney) will both reach $100 million, but their sluggish trajectories hurt the month’s performance.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” Jonathan Olley / Lucasfilm Ltd.
Opening-day grosses for “Indiana Jones” will go on the June ledger, with the bulk of its run in July. At this point, opening projections are no better than $70 million. That would be disappointing: Its production budget is $100 million more than “The Flash,” which opened to an underwhelming $55 million.
“Mission: Impossible” should be the month’s best performer as well as the best long-term bet. However, current tracking places its opening under $100 million. At this point, it may not challenge “Spider-Verse” for the summer’s #1 title; it’s headed toward $400 million domestic.
“Oppenheimer” will not open to $100 million and “Barbie” is a longshot, but they’re non-franchise titles without clear multi-quadrant appeal; it’s more important to consider their longer-term prospects.
Both have intense interest, although “Oppenheimer” could suffer from the same premium-screen syndrome that depressed initial grosses for “Avatar: The Way of Water” last December. Marketing emphasizes the superiority of the biggest-possible screens, particularly IMAX. That limits seating, as does three-hour running time.
“Barbie” has particularly strong female appeal, perhaps skewing a bit older. It’s unclear what it will offer other audiences, although its marketing promises that “If you love Barbie, this movie is for you… if you hate Barbie, this movie is for you.” (No word on what it does for those who don’t have strong feelings either way.)
“Barbie” Warner Bros./screenshot
The guess is “Barbie” will have the bigger opening that is more likely to top $50 million. Both films have budgets around $100 million, far below “Mission: Impossible” — yet another pegged around $300 million.
Other wide openings include “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken” (Universal) tomorrow, “Insidious: The Red Door” (Sony) and “Joy Ride” (Lionsgate) July 7, then at the end of the month Disney’s “Haunted Mansion” and A24’s horror title “Talk to Me,” both July 28.
We figure the holdovers will add $225 million to the month’s total; all other new films, perhaps another $75 million. July last year took in $1.133 billion, the best month post-COVID. There’s a strong chance this July won’t improve on that, although the potential should be there for at least $1.2 billion. That would be only six percent over 2022 and raise the season to about five percent ahead.
It’s a tall order to hope that the top titles and other new releases will gross reach $900 million in July. It will take everything working at full tilt for this to happen.
With the prospects of production delays due to the WGA and potential SAG strikes, a summer release schedule that has fallen short, and general concern around the viability of comic-book movies, a lot is at stake. At this point, we know theaters are central to achieving all-platform success; what’s in question is whether the high expense of making and launching these titles makes financial sense.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL2p1bHktYm94LW9mZmljZS1wcmV2aWV3LWJhcmJpZS1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWluZGlhbmEtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItMTIzNDg3OTI2OS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer's grandson has revealed he had an issue with Christopher Nolan's movie portrayal of his grandfather as someone who tried to kill his teacher with a poisoned apple.
In Nolan's box office smash hit, Oppenheimer - played by Cillian Murphy - injects a green apple with potassium cyanide and leaves it on the desk of his university tutor Patrick Blackett (James D'Arcy).
But in the movie, Oppenheimer - known as the 'father of the atom bomb' - has second thoughts and throws the poisoned apple in the bin.
His grandson Charles Oppenheimer, 48, has now revealed he didn't like this part of the movie, telling TIME Magazine: 'There's no record of him trying to kill somebody. That's a really serious accusation and it's historical revision.
'There's not a single enemy or friend of Robert Oppenheimer who heard that during his life and considered it to be true,' Charles added.

Charles said that the poison apple scene in the movie was not the fault of Nolan, as it was already a 'problem' in Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2006 biography American Prometheus, on which the 'Oppenheimer' box office hit is based.
'If you read American Prometheus carefully enough, the authors say, ""We don't really know if it happened"",' Charles said.
He added: 'American Prometheus got it from some references talking about a spring break trip, and all the original reporters of that story - there was only two maybe three - reported that they didn't know what Robert Oppenheimer was talking about.
'Unfortunately, American Prometheus summarizes that as Robert Oppenheimer tried to kill his teacher and then they [acknowledge that] maybe there's doubt.'
But Charles said that in the movie, the poison apple reference is treated 'vaguely' so it 'didn't bother' him as much as the book had.
Nolan's blockbuster hit focuses on Oppenheimer as he led the Manhattan Project, which ultimately built the deadly weapons that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
Amid the dizzying breakthroughs in quantum physics that were coming thick and fast in the 1920s, Oppenheimer shone by publishing 16 papers in three years.
After securing a teaching job at the University of California, Oppenheimer met psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, who was a keen member of the Communist Party.

As their romance blossomed, Oppenheimer absorbed her hard-Left politics, a fact which prompted the FBI to open a file on him in 1941.
However, they would never prove that he had joined the party.
By the autumn of 1941, Oppenheimer was taking part in secret meetings to discuss how the US might become the first country to develop the atomic bomb.
Despite the misgivings about his politics, Oppenheimer was selected to lead the top secret laboratory, which became the nerve centre of the Manhatten Project.
The chosen site was ultimately one spotted by Oppenheimer during horse riding trips in his childhood: an isolated boys' boarding school in Los Alamos, New Mexico.
Once in charge though, Oppenheimer made a crucial slip-up that would ultimately cost him his career.
Having been approached by an old associate to pass nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union, Oppenheimer rightly turned the invitation down.
But, rather than reporting the approach to the authorities, he kept it quiet.

He then compounded his mistake by continuing his relationship with Tatlock despite the fact he was now married with two children.
The FBI had been tapping his phone and reading his mail, meaning they knew he was cavorting with a Communist.
With the bomb race continuing, the US received a huge boost when it became clear the Nazis were nowhere close.
After Hitler's death by suicide at the end of April in 1945, the focus shifted to Japan, who initially refused to surrender.
With help from British scientists sent by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the first bomb detonation took place at 5.29am on July 16, 1945, at the Trinity Nuclear Test site in Alamogordo, New Mexico.
The second part of the Oppenheimer movie focuses on the second half of the physicist's life where he wrestles with the consequences of his colossal, world-altering invention.

2023-07-31 08:46:39.912000+00:00,‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ Box Office Success Isn’t Surprising or Novel,Barbenheads argue that these films—neither sequels nor reboots—deliver the originality moviegoers crave. Is that really why they’re breaking records?,"Like a rose-colored mushroom cloud, Barbie and Oppenheimer have towered over the box office since their debut. Movie theaters, whose crowds have atrophied since COVID-19 wrested filmgoers out of cinemas and onto their couches, are suddenly packed. Guests are showing up in custom T-shirts, decked out in pink, or, best of all, in costumes that switch from black to pink, in honor of summer’s FOMO-fueled double feature.
There’s a distinct sense of nostalgia to Barbenheimer mania—the same feeling you might’ve had when you turned up at your local cinema as a teenager for a midnight premiere with all of your friends. At a time this bleak, when all of us feel so isolated, it’s a relief to feel like part of something—especially something this fun.
Already, however, there’s a concern that studios might read this phenomenon as a sign that the public really craves, say, a Mattel Cinematic Universe. Lena Dunham’s freshly announced Polly Pocket movie with Emily in Paris star Lily Collins has elicited a collective groan, as Barbenheimer-heads worry that studios will walk away from this sensation having learned the “wrong lessons.”
To some, Barbie and Oppenheimer’s record-shattering debuts represent a spark of originality that the industry seems bound to forsake. People are thrilled, the narrative goes, to watch a movie that’s not a reboot or a sequel. As Vanity Fair chief critic Richard Lawson points out, “It was beginning to seem that no non-franchise movie would ever be a blockbuster again.”
As much as I enjoyed watching both films, however, the argument that Barbie or Oppenheimer meaningfully buck current Hollywood trends feels a little dishonest. Are we really going to pretend that a movie about America’s most infamous doll and another about a prominent figure from World War II (a beloved subject for dads across the country) are somehow scrappy success stories?
As accomplished as these films are—and both do pull off some stunning artistic feats—neither one feels like a particularly revolutionary product for an industry that already loves making films based on toys and biopics about famous (often white) historical figures. Rather, they feel like the best-case results one can expect when the industry functions exactly as intended.
Gerwig’s Barbie movie works as far more than a commercial for the iconic doll. In a review of the film for Autostraddle, film critic Juan Barquin noted that even in spite of its dated feminist politics, Barbie does critique the false gender binaries that Mattel and so many other toy companies have peddled for so long. “In fact,” they write, “it’s not a stretch to say that Gerwig is, rather radically, blaming the very company she is working for for enforcing and damning us to a life of this very essentialism.”
It’s also hard to overstate how gorgeous Barbie’s production is. Its practical sets are stunning, and each and every performance (from stars including Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, Issa Rae, America Ferrera, Simu Liu, Hari Nef, Dua Lipa, Michael Cera, and seemingly half of Hollywood) seems to land flawlessly. The gags about Barbie’s tippy-toe feet and her plastic food are clever both in concept and execution. And perhaps most importantly, Barbie herself would kill for those costumes.
And yet, as I sat there on the bus on my way home from the cinema, my buzzkill brain began to nag at me. Was Will Ferrell’s evil CEO just an obvious (and, frankly, unnecessary) knock-off of his role in The Lego Movie? Why are we peddling Barbie creator Ruth Handler’s romantic narrative about creating the doll for her daughter, when Barbara Handler herself has said she’s embarrassed by her association with the doll? And if Barbie really is for everyone now, why do only one or two of the dolls in Barbieland break from her stereotypical hourglass figure? (All of the Kens are still ripped.)
Barbie might be more than a commercial for the dolls, and it might critique the company that made them, but it’s also incredibly effective brand management. Before Barbie even premiered, Mattel had 45 projects in development based on its toys, according to the New Yorker—including that Polly Pocket film that’s now got social media in a tizzy. Gerwig’s film has provided the perfect launchpad, just as intended.
Although Barbie dings Mattel, the details it picks and chooses also help the company self-mythologize. While narrator Helen Mirren tells us at the start of Barbie that little girls had only baby dolls before Barbie, that’s not quite the case. The gap Handler saw in the market apparently had more to do with how Barbie’s alternatives looked.
“Oh, sure, there were so-called fashion dolls,” Handler wrote in her 1994 autobiography, Dream Doll, according to Insider. But she didn’t like their bodies. In Handler’s estimation, the dolls’ “flat chests, big bellies, and squatty legs” made them look “like overweight six- or eight-year-olds.”
During a family trip to Europe, Handler spotted a German doll named Lilli, a popular bachelor party gift that had sprung out of a comic strip about a secretary described by some as a call girl. The toy’s accompanying slogan? “Gentlemen prefer Lilli.”
“ It’s hardly surprising that none of this comes out of Rhea Perlman’s mouth as she plays Handler in Gerwig’s film. ”
In spite of her origins, the Lilli doll had already become popular with children by the time Handler spotted one and decided to rip it off. As Handler wrote, “Here were the breasts, the small waist, the long, tapered legs I had enthusiastically described for the designers all those years ago.”
According to Vanity Fair, Louis Marx and Company, which held the “Lilli” license, sued Mattel over Barbie’s similarities in 1961. The parties settled in 1963, VF reports, and a year after that, Mattel bought the license from its original manufacturer, Greiner & Hausser.
It’s hardly surprising that none of this comes out of Rhea Perlman’s mouth as she plays Handler in Gerwig’s film. That critique—that Barbie’s image of empowerment was also bound up in having a specific kind of body, one that its creator essentially copied for her product—might be a little too honest for Mattel to stomach. Better to stuff a few generic barbs into a grumpy teen’s mouth so that her mother can correct her later with her own monologue, effectively resolving all our reservations and allowing us to join Barbie, Ken, and their pals on the beach.
There’s no shortage of irony to conservatives’ pearl-clutching reaction to Barbie and its feminism, which the Piers Morgans and Ben Shapiros of the world have of course labeled as misandrist. As other critics have pointed out, Nolan’s Oppenheimer feels like a stronger indictment of men—or at least, men with any modicum of power. But that film, too, seems to reinforce old tropes we’ve seen before.
Much has been made of Nolan’s decision not to depict the devastation that Oppenheimer’s creation rained down on Japan. The director has argued that he limited the film to Oppenheimer’s perspective to emphasize how he would have experienced the bombings via radio. During a scene late into the film, Nolan chooses to show Oppeheimer looking away during a debriefing slideshow about the bombs’ destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki—just as the person narrating it says that “virtually everyone in the street for nearly a mile around was instantly burned.”
After the movie ended, I found myself googling that detail to no avail. Did Oppenheimer really turn his head, unable to bear looking at what his creation wrought? Or was this a convenient way for Nolan himself to avert his eyes and focus, instead, on his protagonist—a man that his film calls self-important while also, paradoxically, choosing him as its namesake? (Perhaps it’s time for this moviegoer to actually read the book upon which Oppenheimer was based and find out if the answer lies there.)
Ultimately, the veracity of that detail doesn’t matter; as other critics have noted, Nolan’s film buffs out a lot of details that might’ve complicated its story. Even putting aside the personal details the writer-director has redacted within Oppenheimer’s biography, which speak to a greater capacity for violence than we see on screen, the film also advances a glaring historical inaccuracy: Contrary to what Oppenheimer portrays, Los Alamos was not virtually uninhabited before the military built a company town there for the Manhattan Project. In fact, as a recent piece for Slate notes, many people were displaced—among them, Hispanic homesteaders who received as little as a paltry $7 per acre when they were forced to relocate. (White ranch owners apparently got $43 per acre.)
It’s true that plenty of Japanese art and cinema has unraveled the consequences of the atomic bomb, and in many ways, the artists behind those works are likely more qualified to speak on it than Nolan or any white creator. But the problem with Oppenheimer is more multifaceted than declining to show the bomb’s effects. The film turns its back not just on Japan, but also on countless victims of Oppenheimer’s work, and the nuances that would’ve demanded a more complicated story; in doing so, it upholds the exact kind of culturally enforced, imperialistic denial it attempts to critique.
Only in a creatively impoverished film landscape, where the mid-budget film has been decimated in favor of the latest Marvel installment, could the concept behind Oppenheimer strike anyone as refreshing or novel. Even after the Barbenheimer juggernaut, 2015’s American Sniper—another military-focused biopic—still holds the record of biggest opening in the U.S. for a biographical film.
Barbie and Oppenheimer might seem like a dichotomous duo, they do share some commonalities. Both films seem to weaponize self-awareness to pre-empt critique of their central figures—Barbie, through its overwrought monologues, and Oppenheimer, by emphasizing Oppy’s remorse in its ending, a long-teased conversation with Albert Einstein that Nolan treats like the key to some sort of emotional puzzle. Nolan and Gerwig, meanwhile, are two of our most sought-after directors right now, as the scale of each of these productions reflects.
There’s no shortage of big tentpoles these days, although more and more of them orbit around pre-existing IP. Really, what’s disappeared from Hollywood are mid-budget films—everything from smaller dramas, to romantic comedies, erotic thrillers, and other genre fare. Barbie and Oppenheimer’s success was never going to fix this problem, and it’s not up to Nolan or Gerwig or any other director to compromise their own success in response.
At the same time, heralding these films’ impressive reception as a positive sign for film overall feels like a misdiagnosis of the core problem. If nothing else, it’s telling that as Gerwig seeks to become a “big studio director” (as her agent Jeremy Barber described it to the New Yorker in that Mattel report), she had to direct a film like Barbie.
“Is it a great thing that our great creative actors and filmmakers live in a world where you can only take giant swings around consumer content and mass-produced products?” Barber asked. “I don’t know. But it is the business.”
Wondering aloud whether auteurs like Hal Ashby or Sydney Pollack might be making movies about toys if they were alive today, he added, “It’s also an argument that we’ve lost already.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL29ic2Vzc2VkL2JhcmJpZS1hbmQtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItYm94LW9mZmljZS1zdWNjZXNzLWlzbnQtc3VycHJpc2luZy1vci1ub3ZlbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
7/13/2023 13:33,"In ‘Oppenheimer,’ Christopher Nolan builds a thrilling, serious blockbuster for adults",Christopher Nolan has never been one to take the easy or straightforward route while making a movie.,"NEW YORK (AP) — Christopher Nolan has never been one to take the easy or straightforward route while making a movie.
He shoots on large-format film with large, cumbersome cameras to get the best possible cinematic image. He prefers practical effects over computer-generated ones and real locations over soundstages — even when that means recreating an atomic explosion in the harsh winds of the New Mexico desert in the middle of the night for “Oppenheimer,” out July 21.
Though, despite internet rumors, they did not detonate an actual nuclear weapon.
And as for the biography that inspired his newest film, Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s riveting, linear narrative “American Prometheus” was simply the starting point from which Nolan crafted a beguiling labyrinth of suspense and drama.
It’s why, in his two decades working in Hollywood, Nolan has become a franchise unto himself — the rare auteur writer-director who makes films that are both intellectually stimulating and commercial, accounting for more than $5 billion in box office receipts. That combination is part of the reason why he’s able to attract Oscar winners and movie stars not just to headline his films, but also to turn out for just a scene or two.
“We’ve all been so intoxicated by his films,” said Emily Blunt, who plays J. Robert Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty. “That exploration of huge themes in an entertaining way doesn’t happen. It just doesn’t happen. That depth, the depth of the material, and yet on this massive epic scale.”
In the vast and complex story of the brilliant theoretical physicist who oversaw the Manhattan Project and the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, Nolan saw exciting possibilities to play with genre and form. There was the race to develop it before the Germans did, espionage, romance, domestic turmoil, a courtroom drama, bruised egos, political machinations, communist panic, and the burden of having created something that could destroy the world.
And then there was the man himself, beloved by most but hated by enough, who, after achieving icon status in American society, saw his reputation and sense of self annihilated by the very institutions that built him.
“It’s such an ambitious story to tell,” said Matt Damon, who plays Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. “Reading the script, I had the same feeling I had when I read ‘Interstellar,’ which was: ‘This is great. How the hell is he going to do this?’”
It’s not so disconnected from Nolan’s other films, either. As critic Tom Shone noted in his book about the director, “Looked at one way, Nolan’s films are all allegories of men who first find their salvation in structure only to find themselves betrayed or engulfed by it.”
Nolan turned to Cillian Murphy to take on the gargantuan task of portraying Oppenheimer. Murphy had already acted in five Nolan films, including the Batman trilogy, “Dunkirk” and “Inception,” but this would be his first time as a lead — something he had secretly pined for.
“You feel a responsibility, but then a great hunger and excitement to try and do it, to see where you can get,” said Murphy, who prepped extensively for six months before filming, working closely with Nolan throughout. “It was an awful lot of work, but I loved it. There is this kind of frisson, this energy when you’re on a Chris Nolan set about the potential for what you’re going to achieve.”
It would be an all-consuming role that would require some physical transformation to approximate that famously thin silhouette. A complex, contradictory figure, Oppenheimer emerged from a somewhat awkward youth to become a renaissance man who seemed to carry equal passion for the Bhagavad Gita, Proust, physics, languages, New Mexico, philosophical questions about disarmament and the perfectly mixed martini. But Murphy knew he was in safe hands with Nolan.
“He’s the most natural director I’ve ever worked with. And the notes that he gives to an actor, are quite remarkable. How he can gently bring you to a different place with your performance is quite stunning in such a subtle, low-key, understated way,” Murphy said. “It can have a profound effect on the way you look at a scene from one take to another take.”
Nolan wrote the main timeline of the film in the first person, to represent Oppenheimer’s subjective experience.
“We want to see everything through Oppenheimer’s point of view,” Nolan said. “That’s a huge challenge for an actor to take on because they’re having to worry about the performance, the truth of the performance, but also make sure that that’s always open to the audience.”
The other timeline, filmed in black and white, is more objective and focused on Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a founding member of the Atomic Energy Commission and a supporter of the development of the more destructive hydrogen bomb.
“Oppenheimer” is Nolan’s first R-rated film since 2002’s “Insomnia,” which after years of working exclusively in PG-13, he’s comfortable with. It fits the gravity of the material.
“We’re dealing with the most serious and adult story you could imagine — very important, dramatic events that changed the world and defined the world we live in today,” Nolan said. “You don’t want to compromise in any way.”
Much of the filming took place in New Mexico, including at the real Los Alamos laboratory where thousands of scientists, technicians and their families lived and worked for two years in the effort to develop the bomb. Nolan enlisted many of his frequent behind-the-scenes collaborators, including his wife and producer Emma Thomas, cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, composer Ludwig Göransson and special effects supervisors Scott Fisher and Andrew Jackson, as well as some newcomers like production designer Ruth de Jong and costume designer Ellen Mirojnick to help bring this world to life.
“It was a very focused set — fun set as well, not too serious. But the work was serious, the sweating of the details was serious,” Blunt said. “Everyone needs to kind of match Chris’ excellence, or want to.”
When it came to recreating the Trinity test, Oppenheimer’s chosen name for the first nuclear detonation, art and life blended in a visceral way.
“We wanted to put the audience there in that bunker,” Nolan said. “That meant really trying to make these things as beautiful and frightening and awe inspiring as they would have been to the people at the time.”
Though no real nukes were used, they did stage a lot of real explosions to approximate the blindingly bright atomic fire and mushroom cloud.
“To do those safely in a real environment out in the nighttime desert, there’s a degree of discipline and focus and adrenaline and just executing that for the film that echoes and mirrors what these guys went through on the grandest scale in a really interesting way,” Nolan said. “I felt everybody had that very, very tight sense of tension and focus around all those shooting nights.”
The weather also “did what it needed to do, as per history,” Murphy said, as the wind picked up and whipped around the set.
“I’m rumored to be very lucky with the weather and it’s not the case. It’s just that we decide to shoot whatever the weather,” Nolan said. “In the case of the Trinity test, it was essential, central to the story that this big storm rolls in with tremendous drama. And it did. That really made the sequence come to life.”
He added: “The extremity of it put me very much in the mindset of what it must have been like for these guys. It really felt like we were out in it.”
Then, of course, there is the experience of watching “Oppenheimer.”
“When you’re making a movie, I feel like you’re on the inside looking out,” Blunt said. “It’s really overwhelming to see it reflected back at you, especially one of this magnitude. ... I just felt like my breastplate was going to shatter, it was so intense.”
The hope is that when “Oppenheimer” is unleashed on the world, audiences will be as invested and will seek it out on the biggest screen they can find. The film has a run in IMAX theaters around the country, not something often afforded serious-minded, R-rated movies in the middle of the busy summer season. But this is also the essential Nolan impossibility. As more and more auteurs have had to compromise — to either go smaller or team with streamers to get the kind of budget they might once have had at studios, like even Ridley Scott and Martin Scorsese have had to do this year — Nolan continues to make his movies on the grandest scale.
“Each of his films has been revolutionary in their own way,” Murphy said. “It’s an event every time he releases a film, and rightly so.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLTQ2OWNjODFlMDk4OWY0MTRhMjBkYjU1MDhjNzYzMGEw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-06-26 15:29:18+00:00,"Blockbuster Pileup: Can ‘Oppenheimer,’ ‘Barbie,’ ‘Indiana Jones 5’ and ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ All Survive in the Same Month?",Can several back-to-back blockbusters succeed at once? Or will the glut of big movies cannibalize each other?,"At the end of last summer, Flix Brewhouse faced a dire situation, albeit one that wasn’t unique to the Texas-based movie theater chain. There weren’t any movies to show in August.
“We were going to A24 or Briarcliff Entertainment saying, ‘Does anyone have anything we can put on our screens?” recalls Chris Randleman, the company’s chief revenue officer.
That’s not the case this summer as exhibitors grapple with a different reality. Can several back-to-back blockbusters succeed at once? Or will the glut of big movies cannibalize each other?
Those are the big questions as popcorn season kicks into high gear with the arrivals of Harrison Ford’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” (June 30), Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” (July 12), Greta Gerwig’s neon-coated “Barbie” (July 21) and Christopher Nolan’s atomic bomb drama “Oppenheimer” (also on July 21). All of those films carry big budgets and require outsized ticket sales to turn a profit.
“It’s complete day and night,” Randleman says. “In the last two years, if something failed, we didn’t have anything for six weeks. Now if something tanks, you move onto the next one. That’s the way Hollywood always worked.”
The hope is that all of these films will find their audiences. However, Paul Dergarabedian, a senior analyst at Comscore, calls the month-long stretch between “Indiana Jones 5” through “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” one of the most competitive periods in recent memory.
“This will be a stress test for the theatrical marketplace in the most important moviegoing season of the year,” he says. “The stakes are incredibly high.”
So far, Hollywood’s attempts this year at counter-programming have been disastrous. But that’s because audiences didn’t have an overwhelming desire to watch “The Flash” or Pixar’s “Elemental,” not because those movies were scheduled too close together.
Even as the box office recovers in fits and starts, there are signs that even in the pandemic era, several films can work at the same time. A prime example can be found in last summer’s debut of “Jurassic World Dominion,” which scored a mighty $145 million opening, even as Cruise’s enduring hit “Top Gun: Maverick” pulled in $51.8 million in its third weekend. Another weekend in the middle of 2022, four movies — Baz Luhrmann’s biopic “Elvis” and Blumhouse’s thriller “The Black Phone,” in addition to “Maverick” and “Jurassic World Dominion” — each grossed $20 million or more in the same Friday to Sunday frame. It’s a sign that this summer’s crop of newcomers can co-exist beyond their opening weekends — so long as ticket buyers care to see them.
“It’s all about quality,” says Armand Daiguillon, who owns Paradigm Cinemas in South Florida. “Everything looks good on the horizon. But if the movies aren’t great, people will wait a month until they are available on streaming.”
Movie theater owners believe the range of offerings will appeal to moviegoers of all demographics. “It’s the right mix of movies to not only survive but thrive off one another,” says Randleman. He’s particularly high on “Barbie” because pre-sale tickets at his theaters have already been surging. “I think it’ll be the true breakout of the summer,” he adds. “Everyone can survive. We have enough screens.”
Daiguillon of Paradigm Cinema, however, is cautiously optimistic about a potential pileup. “It would have been better if they separated things a little more,” he says. “We have a whole summer. These movies are all back-to-back in the same month.”
He’s particularly concerned about the space between family offerings, like “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken,” which opens shortly after Pixar’s “Elemental,” and Disney’s “Haunted Mansion,” which arrives just a few weeks later.
“I wish there was at least another week between the kids stuff,” Daiguillon says. “Theaters do a lot of business with summer camps. If all the movies come out at once, there’s nothing for them to see later on.”
At least, Hollywood didn’t forget about August, which is ripe for a sleeper hit. On the calendar, there’s the animated “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” R-rated comedy “Strays” and “Meg 2: The Trench.” Those movies aren’t (yet) part of franchises as big as “Mission: Impossible” or from filmmakers as beloved as Gerwig or Nolan. But “The Trench,” for one, is the sequel to 2018’s disaster epic “The Meg,” which grossed $530 million worldwide. Says Randleman, “Never bet against a shark movie.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvanVseS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJhcmJpZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtNy0xMjM1NjU0MTAwL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvanVseS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJhcmJpZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtNy0xMjM1NjU0MTAwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

""Barbie"" had the biggest opening week in history of any Warner Bros. film, raking in more than half a billion dollars.
“Barbie stands out as one of the very few female-centric, female-targeted blockbusters of the summer,” said Robbins. ""The movie offered something fresh in a summer that’s been jam-packed with franchise sequels.""
Young people are driving a movie-theater comeback
While movie ticket sales and box office numbers are not back to pre-pandemic levels, industry data shows that young people are behind the growing market of moviegoers. About 80% of the ""Barbie"" audience was younger than 35. And 65% of the audience was female, according to data from Box Office Pro.
“The audience driving this rebound has been young.” Robbins said. He pointed to “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” as an example of a film playing well to a younger audience.
The year-to-date domestic box office recently crossed the $6 billion mark. The last time this mark was hit in summer was in early July 2019, according to data shared by Robbins.
But keep in mind, with screenwriters and actors on strike, the movie industry is destined to feel the impact of delayed and or canceled production.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tb3ZpZXMvMjAyMy8wOC8xMC9iYXJiZW5oZWltZXItYnJlYWtzLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtcmVjb3Jkcy1hcmUtdGhlYXRlcnMtbWFraW5nLWNvbWViYWNrLzcwNTYyNjQ0MDA3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-24 03:15:07+00:00,‘Mission: Impossible’ Box Office: Can ‘Dead Reckoning’ Rebound From Barbenheimer?,'Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning' tumbled a series-worst 64 percent as 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' turned into weapons of box office mass destruction.,"Tom Cruise, the star who is credited with saving the box office after Top Gun: Maverick flew to $1.5 billion in global ticket sales, is now facing another kind of reckoning — surviving the Barbenheimer effect.
His Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One tumbled a franchise-worst 64 percent to $19.5 million in its second weekend when going up against Barbie and Oppenheimer, whose dual arrivals transformed into a cultural phenomenon and propelled the domestic box office to historic heights. Revenue for the July 21-23 weekend was the fourth-biggest of all time; in addition, it was the first time ever that one movie opened to $100 million or more and another to $50 million or more. Barbie scored $155 million, followed by $80.5 million for Oppenheimer. No one in Hollywood anticipated such a staggering turnout.
The seventh installment in Paramount and Skydance’s storied Mission: Impossible series, which finished Sunday with a domestic total of $118.8 million, had hoped to earn as much as $25 million in its second outing.
The question now is whether Dead Reckoning Part One can level out and enjoy a long run as other series installments have done, and just as Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick did. Executives across Hollywood, and not just at Paramount, aren’t ruling Dead Reckoning out just yet, especially since it has a better critics’ score on Rotten Tomatoes than Barbie and Oppenheimer, as well as strong audience exit scores.
“I don’t think the story has yet been written,” says one executive at a rival studio.
Mission: Impossible pics have never sported mega-openings, yet expectations were high for Dead Reckoning after Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick opened to $160.5 million over Memorial Day weekend in 2022, including $126.7 million for the three days. Dead Reckoning had been tracking to open to $90 million in its first five days beginning July 12; instead, it took in a franchise-best $78.5 million, not adjusted for inflation.
Titles in the Mission franchise have always drawn a larger percentage of their global gross from the foreign box office. Dead Reckoning Part One is no exception. It earned another $55 million from 72 markets in its second weekend for a foreign tally of $252.1 million and $370.9 million globally through Sunday. It is doing especially well in Asia, where Barbie and Oppenheimer aren’t strong players. And in a number of markets, it is pacing 15 percent or more ahead of 2018’s Mission: Impossible — Fallout. In Japan, it debuted to $7.9 million, 23 percent ahead of Fallout, which earned a franchise-best $571.5 million overseas for a global total of $791.7 million, including $220.2 million in North America.
Mission: Impossible 7 had to contend with losing Imax screens for three weeks to Oppenheimer, in addition to losing premium large-format screens to both Oppenheimer and Barbie. The upcharge for Imax and PLFs is significant and can have a big impact on the bottom line. In early July, Imax screens were dedicated to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
Cruise’s latest movie, directed by Christopher McQuarrie, cost nearly $300 million to produce and saw its release date delayed numerous times because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was initially set to open in summer of 2021, then summer or fall of 2022. Its release date ultimately landed on mid-July of this year, a date dictated by the shooting schedule of Dead Reckoning Part Two and Cruise’s availability to promote Part One (the actor is known for his global marketing efforts).
Adds another observer: “Barbenheimer siphoned off MI7′s potential this weekend, with Oppenheimer drawing older males away from Dead Reckoning. Not only that, Sound of Freedom is an unexpected force to be reckoned with and is presenting competition from an unlikely source.”
Estimates for the U.S. box office show Angel Studios’ faith-based political thriller Sound of Freedom beating Dead Reckoning for the weekend with $20.1 million for a cume of $123.4 million (Sound of Freedom opened July 4), according to Comscore. Paramount and other studios show Dead Reckoning beating Sound of Freedom; Monday actuals will determine the order.
Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part Two is set to open in theaters June 28, 2024. McQuarrie and Cruise have shot much of the movie, but production is now halted because of the SAG-AFTRA strike in another moment of reckoning for the storied action franchise.
Things looked different in late June, when Cruise — Hollywood’s highest-profile advocate for the theatrical experience — urged audiences to see Dial of Destiny. And, yes, two other movies in a surprisingly effective plea. Wrote the actor on Instagram : “I love a double feature, and it doesn’t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiZW5oZWltZXItMTIzNTU0MzYwMi_SAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3MvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYmFyYmVuaGVpbWVyLTEyMzU1NDM2MDIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-01 14:33:50+00:00,‘Barbenheimer’ Juggernaut Continues U.K. Box Office Domination After Second Weekend of Release,'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' continued their domination of the U.K. box office with a combined $27.3 million after their second weekend.,"Warner Bros.’ “Barbie” and Universal’s “Oppenheimer” continued their domination of the U.K. and Ireland box office with a combined £21.4 million ($27.3 million) after their second weekend, per numbers from Comscore.
Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” topped the charts for the second week in a row with £13.2 million, and now has a total of £47.9 million. The film is expected to surpass Universal’s “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” which is the year’s current No. 1 film in the territory with £54.4 million, this week.
Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” was second with £8.2 million and now has a total of £27.6 million. It is currently the fifth highest grossing film of the year and is expected to move beyond “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” (£30 million) into fourth place this week.
In its third weekend, Paramount’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” earned £1.8 million in third place for a total of £20.2 million. Disney’s “Elemental” collected £1.1 million in fourth position in its fourth weekend for a total of £11.8 million.
Rounding off the top five was Altitude’s “Talk to Me,” which debuted with a strong £643,547, a record for the distributor in the territory.
From Bollywood, Moviegoers Entertainment’s “Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani,” by star filmmaker Karan Johar, with a cast awash in A-listers including Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt, Dharmendra, Jaya Bachchan and Shabana Azmi, bowed in seventh position with £370,882.
Compared to recent films starring Singh or Bhatt, the film is performing better, surpassing the first week (seven-day) collections of “Gully Boy” (£366,000) “Gangubai Kathiawadi” (£345,000) “Sooryavanshi” (£334,000) “’83” (£321,000) and “Dil Dhadakne Do” (£312,000).
“Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani” collected £80,000 on Monday, meaning an 80% hold.
The other debut in the top 10 was also from India. Dreamz Ent’s “Bro,” starring Pawan Kalyan and Sai Dharam Tej, bowed in 10th place with 107,494.
This upcoming weekend, new releases will include ocean predator sequel “Meg 2: The Trench” and family-friendly animation “Just Super,” which Warner Bros. and Signature Entertainment are respectively opening across more than 300 locations each.
Picturehouse Entertainment is releasing Cannes and Toronto title “Paris Memories,” which won lead Virginie Efira best actress at France’s Cesar Awards.

2023-07-30 14:50:09+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Haunted Mansion’ Spooked, ‘Barbie’ Scores Record $93M Second Weekend in U.S.","Barbenheimer isn't making life easy for 'Haunted Mansion,' while 'Barbie' soared to a record $93 million second weekend in North America.","Barbie really is a pink unicorn.
The movie earned an estimated $93 million in its sophomore outing at the North American box office — one of the best second weekends of all time and the best second weekend ever for Warner Bros., not adjusted for inflation.
The female-fueled Barbie, which continues to shatter any and all expectations, finished Sunday with a domestic cume of $351.4 million. Detractors had predicted it would fade away quickly after a history-making debut over the July 21-23 weekend, but that isn’t the case. The Greta Gerwig-directed film fell a scant 43 percent, a rare hold for a pic originally opening to such a big number at $162 million.
Barbie continued to paint the overseas box office pink as well. It dropped a mere 32.2 percent to $122.2 million this weekend for a foreign tally of $423.1 million and dreamy global total of $774.5 million through Sunday as it speeds toward the $1 billion mark. It will be only the second pic of 2023 so far to join the billion-dollar box office club after Universal’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which topped out at $1.34 billion worldwide.
The movie has even taken on a life of its own in China, where its cume hit $25 million through Sunday after a soft $8.2 million opening. It could leg out to $40 million, far more than anyone expected, considering Barbie isn’t doing as well in Asian markets as it is elsewhere. Among all international markets, the U.K. leads with $61.6 million, ahead of the final Harry Potter film’s first 10 days, while it is already the biggest Warners movie ever in Brazil with an early total of $33.5 million.
Other stats: Barbie enjoyed the biggest first week in Warner Bros. history at the box office, outpacing Christopher Nolan‘s The Dark Knight.
Not that Nolan needs to fret. His Universal movie Oppenheimer — the other half of the Barbenheimer effect — is also a box office force of nature that is holding up incredibly well in its sophomore outing. The three-hour biographical drama grossed an estimated $46.2 million this weekend, a mere 44 percent drop and the biggest second weekend ever for an R-rated summer pic ahead of Deadpool 2′s $43.5 million, not adjusted for inflation.
Oppenheimer finish the weekend with an estimated global haul of $400.4 million, including $174.6 million domestically and $226.3 million at the foreign box office, to rank as the filmmaker’s sixth-biggest film of all time ahead of Tenet and Batman Begins. Overseas, it is already Nolan’s biggest film ever in 28 markets and his biggest non-superhero title in 39. The weekend’s overseas tally was another $72.4 million.
Nolan’s movie about J. Robert Oppenheimer, considered the father of the atomic bomb, is a boon for Imax (Nolan used special Imax cameras). Oppenheimer is the second-fastest film to hit $80 million in global Imax ticket sales and, on Sunday, the large-format exhibitor announced it is extending the film’s run through the weekend of Aug. 11-13. That’s not the biggest surprise after Sony delayed the nationwide release of Gran Turismo by two weeks because of the SAG-AFTRA strike.
Elsewhere, Haunted Mansion was spooked in its debut in another big-budget summer miss for Disney. The live-action family pic opened to an estimated $24.2 million, one of the lowest starts ever among Disney’s live-action reimaginings of theme park attractions or classic animated films. Heading into the weekend, tracking suggested an already subdued $30 million launch.
In addition to going up against Barbenheimer, Haunted Mansion was also challenged by mediocre reviews and the struggling family marketplace. The star-packed cast was also unable to do publicity and press in the final two weeks before the film’s launch because of the actors strike, including staying away from the movie’s Disneyland premiere on July 15.
Disney is hopeful that good audience exit scores on PostTrak and a B+ CinemaScore will make up for any deficits and provide the film with long legs, just as Pixar’s summer film Elemental has enjoyed an enviable multiple after a soft start. The problem: both films were pricey to make, putting increased pressure on their box office performance. Haunted Mansion cost at least $150 million to produce before marketing. Elemental was $200 million.
Director Justin Simien’s Haunted Mansion, which turns Disneyland’s iconic attraction into a supernatural horror-comedy, stars Rosario Dawson, LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Chase W. Dillon, Daniel Levy, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jared Leto and Danny DeVito.
Overseas, Haunted Mansion grossed $9.1 million from 53 territories representing about 50 percent of the marketplace for a global bow of $33.3 million.
Angel Studios’ sleeper summer hit Sound of Freedom continued to hold at third place behind Barbie and Oppenheimer with another $12.4 million for a stunning domestic sum of $149 million, more than a slew of major studio summer tentpoles.
Paramount’s Tom Cruise tentpole Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, which is losing hope of rebounding from Barbenheimer, placed fifth ahead of A24’s new specialty horror film Talk to Me with $10.7 million for a domestic total of $139.2 million. MI7 continues to hold up better overseas, where it cleared the $300 million mark over the weekend after earning another $31.7 million. The pic’s global total through Sunday is $448.5 million.
From Australian twin brothers and filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou of RackaRacka YouTube channel fame, Talk to Me opened to a better-than-expected $10 million. The indie horror film, acquired out of Sundance, had been eyeing a $4 million to $5 million start. Its early performance is another win for A24, home of Oscar winner Everything Everywhere All at Once, although opening a specialty film nationwide and sustaining momentum is always a challenge.

,Denver-area theaters rode the Barbenheimer box office wave. These are some takeaways from local film professionals,"""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" movies helped the Sie Film Center, AMC Theatres and Alamo Drafthouse Cinema achieve their most successful box office weekends since before the pandemic.","“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” movies helped the Sie Film Center, AMC Theatres and Alamo Drafthouse Cinema achieve their most successful box office weekends since before the pandemic.
If you felt the ground shake recently, it wasn’t an earthquake. It was the cinematic culture clash of a historical retelling of nuclear war and a feminist doll come-to-life. That’s right: “Barbenheimer,” the dual-opening weekend of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” shook the post-pandemic movie industry. Local movie theaters benefited from their most successful opening week in four years.
“Barbie,” co-written and directed by Greta Gerwig, stars Margot Robbie as Stereotypical Barbie, a doll who embarks on a journey of self-discovery when she leaves Barbie Land for the perils of the human world. “Oppenheimer,” co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan, chronicles the life of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his team of scientists who designed and developed the atomic bomb during World War II.
For Denver Film’s Sie Film Center, Barbenheimer gave the theater its most successful box office weekend since the summer of 2019, when films like “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” and “Midsommar” dominated film dialogue.
The nonprofit theater rode the wave and hosted special movie-going experiences such as a Barbenheimer Glitterbomb Lobby Party on opening night, which included limited edition “Barbie” bars from Little Man Ice Cream, a costume contest, a collectible Kodak 35MM filmstrip and “social media ready selfie areas,” as well as an exclusive “Oppenheimer” t-shirt giveaway and specialty cocktails.
“I have no real memory of another similar cinematic moment in time where everybody’s attention was turned towards two particular films, both on opposite ends of the spectrum,” said Keith Garcia, Sie Film Center Artistic Director.
In Arvada, Sonora Cinemas, a multilingual movie theater that took over the old Elvis Cinemas location earlier this year, also saw similar success on opening week, which coincided with its official grand opening party.
“It reminds me of the earlier Shrek releases,” said Louis Sullivan, film buyer and corporate general manager for Sonora Cinemas. “This was something you could tell had good hype around it.”
Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, a theater chain with locations in Littleton, Westminster and Sloan Lake, also had its biggest weekend in recent years.
“Somehow the internet, the world, turned it into this big pop culture event,” said Zach Nix, senior film buyer for Alamo Drafthouse Cinema. “It’s something that could never have been predicted but it’s amazing how that came to be.”
Barbenheimer in numbers.
To date, “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” have grossed a combined $244 million, making this the fourth-biggest box office weekend in cinema history.
At $162 million in weekend sales, the “Barbie” film notched the biggest opening weekend of this year so far, surpassing April’s “Super Mario Bros. Movie” $146 million opening weekend sales and “Oppenheimer’s” $82 million. This also marked the biggest debut ever for a film directed by a woman.
“Invest in the artists, invest in the storytellers,” Nix said. “If they make a good product, the audience will come. Don’t just make products that appease the shareholders or the board at a [major] studio.”
The AMC theater in Hale set its own single-week box office record
AMC Theatres saw “its highest single-week admissions revenue in the Company’s entire 103-year history,” making it its busiest weekend globally since theaters opened from pandemic closures in 2020, according to an AMC Theatres press release.
Across the country, 65 AMC locations set their own single-week box office records, including Congress Park and Hale neighborhood’s AMC 9 + CO 10 location that first opened in 2021. Cherry Creek’s AMC Dine-In Cherry Creek 8 location was not listed.
“The monumental success of ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ has the entire movie and movie theatre industry abuzz,” wrote AMC Chairman and CEO Adam Aron in the press release.
The revenue record was bolstered by other popular films that are currently playing in theaters, including “Haunted Mansion,” “Mission Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” and “Sound of Freedom.”
The financial success of the week “is a testament to the moviegoing audience, who has demonstrated once again that they are ready, willing, and eager to come out to movie theatres in huge numbers,” Aron said.
What this might mean for movies going forward.
“I think they rediscovered a winning formula,” Sullivan said. “It was great to see Warner Brothers and Universal be okay in supporting each other’s product.”
Film buyers like Nix echoed that sentiment.
“A big takeaway that studios could potentially look into is counter programming,” Nix said. “If you release two movies that are exactly the same on the same weekend, you are probably going to pull apart from each other. The Barbenheimer [effect] will be difficult to replicate, but it is a fact that counter-programming is a good thing for the industry.”
Part of this weekend’s winning formula included the original storytelling that both films exemplified. The top three overall weekends in history were led by debuts of sequels in massive franchises: “Avengers: Endgame” in 2019, “Avengers: Infinity War” in 2018 and “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” in 2015.
Neither film in the Barbenheimer storm was a sequel or an installment of a long-running franchise.
“This is two different studios, two wildly different film experiences,” Garcia said. “Water rising lifts all ships. That’s where it takes itself down to a local scene and it really did bring about a lot of fantastic business.”
With Hollywood writers and actors on strike in recent months, Garcia and Nix believe it’s important to trust professional storytellers like Gerwig, Nolan and all others involved, in hopes of having all audiences make a habit of stepping foot inside of a movie theater once again.
“It proved that people love being part of a moment,” Garcia said. “This was a defining, ‘Yes, we are ready to go to the theaters, dress up, be part of sold-out shows, have fun and take in a pop cultural milestone.'”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL2RlbnZlcml0ZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8wMy9kZW52ZXItYXJlYS10aGVhdGVycy1yb2RlLXRoZS1iYXJiZW5oZWltZXItYm94LW9mZmljZS13YXZlLXRoZXNlLWFyZS1zb21lLXRha2Vhd2F5cy1mcm9tLWxvY2FsLWZpbG0tcHJvZmVzc2lvbmFscy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

(WLUC) - Two box office hits have arrived in theaters in Upper Michigan. You may have heard of this phenomenon sweeping our country.
Moviegoers are already filing in to see the package of both movies in Quinnesec, known online as “Barbenheimer.” The “Barbie” movie starring Margot Robbie hits box offices the same weekend as the historical World War II film, “Oppenheimer.”
Thomas Theatre Group staff said in the Quinnesec theatre alone, more than 200 people visited the theatre for mid-day showings of both films.
“Honestly, it is going to be neck and neck, but I think ‘Barbie’ will edge ‘Oppenheimer ‘slightly,” said Jennifer Alwine, Quinnesec Thomas Theatre Group General Manager. “This is because you will get more kids and families. ‘Oppenheimer’ will be a fantastic film too. It will be hard to say, but I think ‘Barbie’ will edge it out just a little bit.”
Staff said they expect Saturday to be extremely busy and they recommend you purchase tickets ahead of time. Next Thursday, the theatre will run a special promotion for “Barbie.” It will offer $5 tickets and $5 combos for girls night.

Barbie jetted across the four-century mark at the domestic box office in day 14. 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Eyes Second With $30M 3-day, $45M 5-day.","Sunday AM Writethrough after Saturday AM update: As the Hollywood labor stoppage continues, the 2023 box office rally rages on, as domestic box office soars past $6 billion, +22% over the same January-August period a year ago. This weekend for all movies stands at an estimated $178M. This is the fourth time in box office history to have four movies cross $25M; the last time was Thanksgiving weekend 2018.
We always knew this weekend would beat the first frame of August a year ago ($92M), and that’s happening at +94%. But the current Friday-Sunday is also kicking the first weekend of August 2019’s $148.99M by +20%, and that’s when Hobbs & Shaw ruled the chart.
Barbie remains box office queen bee with $53M in weekend 3, after a $17M Friday and $20M Saturday. By EOD, Barbie is roughly $40M shy from passing the half billion mark at the domestic box office, with her gross set to stand at $459.4M. A $1 billion running global cume happens today!
That fierce battle for second place we saw yesterday between Paramount’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, Oppenheimer, and The Meg 2: The Trench is settling down.
The second place winner is Meg 2 with $30M, an amazing one-two punch for the weekend by Warner Bros. No one was expecting Meg 2 to rank in second place. Here’s the takeaway with Meg 2 this weekend: For all those studios clutching their pearls and worried about stars not doing press and looking to dynamite the rest of the 2023 calendar. Meg 2‘s opening was achieved off a screening program campaign, with in-theater and online trailers and TV spots. I hear that Jason Statham and the cast didn’t do that much press here in the U.S. Such is the plus of opening a sequel off the gas of its established IP. The first Meg‘s campy comedic marketing campaign five years ago already did the heavy lifting in establishing the brand. The sequel’s trailers just needed to run with it.
Beamed Jeff Goldstein, Domestic Distribution President of Warner Bros, “This is an extraordinary time for Barbie fans, as the blowout parties continue. Meg 2 delivered the one-two punch and scared audiences everywhere.”
Uni’s Oppenheimer is third with $28.7M. Since opening, per EntTelligene, Barbenheimer, has pulled in 55.5M moviegoers. Broken out, that’s 39M for Barbie and another 16.5M for Oppenheimer.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, after a great Saturday of $10.3M, +11% over Friday’s $9.3M, is coming in at $28M over 3-days and $43M, which is still great for this $70M production.
Wow, that was easy. Everyone played nice. Typically, when there’s a tie in an upper ranking, especially No. 1, it’s a game of chicken among the majors on Sunday morning when calling it. More specifically, there’s a delay in reporting, with snarking all around. One of the more notorious fights over first in recent memory was the weekend of Sept. 29-Oct. 1, 2017 when the opening of Tom Cruise’s American Made, the fourth weekend of It, and the second weekend of Kingsman: The Golden Circle were all ranking in the high $16M range. Kingsman won with $16.935M.
Turtles is a huge win for the Brian Robbins Paramount administration, particularly as he builds out and revives franchises.
Said Chris Aronson, Paramount’s domestic distribution boss, “We’re over the moon with this opening. We exceeded pre-release expectations with this movie, which has been a labor of love for a long time.”
The decision to revive Turtles happened back in 2018, when Robbins was at Nickelodeon with Ramsey Naito, current president, Paramount Animation and Nickelodeon Animation, and they sparked to the idea of Seth Rogen’s involvement, as well as filmmaker Jeff Rowe — both lifelong fans — who truly wanted to lean into the ‘teenage’ part of the IP. Paramount, like all their movies this year, has gotten behind promoting the animated pic 200%, having Rogen show off extended footage at CineamCon, and a work-in-progress cut at Annecy back in June. Props to Paramount: They were the only studio who realized that there would be a full-house crowd down at San Diego Comic-Con: fans unfazed by the strikes. So they took Turtles down to Hall H and showed off more footage to fans with Rowe in tow, as well as TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman — the latter who just stoked the crowd. Why skip an opportunity? Very smart on the Melrose lot for being fearless and creative sans stars in their promotion. Rival studios, take note.

The second animated take of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has a Comscore/Screen Engine PostTrak audience score of 88% positive and a 70% recommend, with kids under 12 giving it 94%, and a 69% must-see. That’s enough ooze to keep chugging into the fall. That’s on top of the pic’s already “A” CinemaScore. Men showing up at 60% to women’s 40%, with 56% of the crowd between 18-34. The biggest demo is 18-24 at 34%. Diversity demos are 33% Caucasian, a great 33% Latino and Hispanic, 17% Black, and 16% Asian/other. The South Central and the West are the most robust here for the Nickelodeon/Point Grey production. Oppenheimer still has Imax, but the Turtles have PLFs, which are driving 16% of ticket sales and another 11% from 3D. Adam Aron’s AMC Burbank is the top-grossing movie theater in the nation at $103K-plus so far. Cowabunga.
TMNT:MM saw Canada delivering 5% of the gross with major markets that over-indexed being L.A., Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Austin, while the only major markets that under-indexed were Seattle and Toronto. Top theaters came from L.A., N.Y., Phoenix, Orlando, Dallas, Pharr, Texas, El Paso, Nashville, San Antonio, and Houston.
Social media analytics corp RelishMix says that Turtles’ social media universe is 309.8M across Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok combined. Ahead of release, RelishMix said those stats were under family animated averages. But clearly there’s an appetite here for the movie, as it’s greatly over-performing.

PostTrak audiences gave Meg 2 72% in the top two boxes, with a 55% recommend, and a B- to the first chapter’s B+. South Central and South are the biggest-grossing regions. Note, there’s a lot of walk-up business here, like there was on the first movie, from the Latino and Hispanic moviegoers, who are showing up at 25% to Caucasian 41%, Black 15%, and Asian American at 13%. Warners does have some PLFs for the shark that are shared with the Turtles, accounting for 22.5% of the overall gross with another 18% coming from 3D screens. The Regal Fresno Riverpark is leading the pack with $39K in gross (including early shows) so far.
RelishMix counts a social media universe for the sequel of 350.8M, 14% above genre averages next to action-adventure sci-fi titles, with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom on the high end at 611.3M SMU. “Chatter flows positive on The Meg 2, which makes new waves as the audacious, over-the-top shark sequel being hailed as a high-octane escape into ‘stupid-crazy-fun entertainment’ with endless positive snarky threads. The return of Jason Statham draws a splash as fans gush, ‘Looks amazing, especially with Jason Statham in this epic shark movie.'” reports RelishMix.
Jason Statham, who counts 111M fans on social media, got this modest plug in for the film on Instagram before the SAG-AFTRA strikes began:

Warner Bros
FRIDAY MIDDAY: The third weekend of Warner Bros’ Barbie at $51M (-45%) is higher than the opening of the Brad Pitt action movie, Bullet Train, which did $30M during the first weekend of August. It just goes to show how far we’ve come along at the box office. The Greta Gerwig directed take on the Mattel doll is eyeing a third Friday of $16M at 4,178 theaters, -45% from a week ago. Running total by Sunday will be $457.4M.
Universal’s Oppenheimer will hold on to third place at 3,612 theaters with a $7.8M third Friday (-42%), and third weekend of $27M, -42%, sending its running total by Sunday to $226.8M. Pic is director Christopher Nolan’s fourth highest domestic besting Batman Begins and Dunkirk. It’s also the highest grossing R-rated film of 2023 domestically ahead of John Wick Chapter 4 ($187.1M). Oppenheimer also reps the fastest Universal R-rated release to cross $200M in U.S./Canada, taking 15 days. Previous R-rated $200M Uni champ was 2012’s Ted, which took 37 days to that benchmark.
Third at 3,858 theaters is Paramount/Nickelodeon/Point Grey’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem with a first Friday of $8.5M, 3-day of $27M, and 5-day of $42M, well ahead of its $30M-$40M expectations. Rotten Tomatoes audience score is 94% to go along with that A CinemaScore.
Warner Bros‘ The Meg 2: The Trench at 3,503 theaters is a seeing an $11M Friday, including previews, and a $25M opening — robust for the marketplace. Audiences are so-so on it so far at 66% on Rotten Tomatoes. That’s better than the 43% the first movie notched with RT crowds.
Disney’s second weekend of The Haunted Mansion at 3,740 is seeing a second estimated Friday of $2.8M,-72%, second weekend of $9.5M, -60%, for a running total of $42.5M.
FRIDAY AM: Barbie Crosses $400M, Oppenheimer Nears $200M, Turtles 2-day $15M, Meg 2 Previews $3M+ The spoils of July are spilling over into August as Warner Bros.’ Barbie, after a $11.8M Thursday, jetted across the four-century mark at the domestic box office in her 14th day –faster than Top Gun: Maverick and Super Mario Bros Movie– with a running total of $406.4M at 4,337 locations.
She’s poised to make around $55M in her third weekend, with Oppenheimer ringing in at least another $23M+; all of this spelling for a 3-day box office marketplace that will be exceedingly well north of last year’s $92M for the first weekend of August. The Christopher Nolan-directed movie earned $5.58M yesterday at 3,647 theaters taking its two-week total to $199.86M.
Warner Bros. also has some lagniappe at the weekend box office with The Meg 2: The Trench which is expected to do between $20M-$30M. Last night from previews that began at 3PM, the shark sequel did $3.2M at 3,400 locations. That’s a pretty good result for a sequel that stars a shark: The first Jason Statham movie brought in $4M in previews before churning out a $16.6M Friday, and $45.4M opening off what was a very campy, satirical marketing campaign. The $129M costing Meg 2 has a 50% stake from China’s CMC. Critics on Rotten Tomatoes loathe the sequel at 28% worse than the first movie back in 2018 at 45%. It’s a popcorn film for the masses, not for the tweeds.
Meanwhile, Paramount/Nickelodeon/Point Grey’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem saw its 2-day box office rise to $15M. Thursday was $4.87M at 3,513, -52% from Wednesday, with the Jeff Rowe-directed animated movie ranking third for the day.

Disney’s Haunted Mansion ranked fourth on Thursday with an estimated $1.6M at 3,740, -10% from Wednesday for a first week take of $33M. The previous Eddie Murphy 2003 movie opened on a Wednesday over Thanksgiving and its first seven days grossed $35.4M (unadjusted for inflation).
Angel Studios’ Sound of Freedom booked at 3,411, did $1.47M yesterday, -6%, for a running four week total of $156.4M.
A24’s horror movie Talk to Me at 2,340 theaters did an estimated $1.2M yesterday for a first week of $15.8M. Granted, this title went wide versus A24’s Bodies Bodies Bodies last summer, which platformed, but it’s great to note that this Sundance acquisition has outstripped that Pete Davidson horror comedy’s total stateside cume of $11.4M. Talk to Me‘s first seven days are also 22% ahead of Midsommar‘s which stood at $13M and finaled at $27.4M.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbWVnLTItdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy0xMjM1NDU0ODYwL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbWVnLTItdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy0xMjM1NDU0ODYwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-25 05:01:00+00:00,‘Spider-Verse’ Swinging Ahead Of ‘Elemental’ After Game Of Chicken; ‘Flash’ Edging Out ‘No Hard Feelings’ – Saturday PM Box Office,Sony's mission to return comedy to the big screen with the R-rated Jennifer Lawrence movie No Hard Feelings began Thursday.,"UPDATED Saturday PM: As of tonight, according to industry estimates, Sony Animation’s fourth weekend of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is ahead of Disney/Pixar’s second weekend of Elemental, $19.4 million to $18.3 million. This is after a $7.5M Saturday for Spidey, +32% over Friday, and a $7.1M Saturday for Elemental, +27% over Friday.
Still at a 38% ease, that’s not too shabby for Elemental. The previous Pixar misfire, Onward, didn’t get a full chance at a theatrical life as movie theaters closed down to due to Covid; the pic stalled at $61M stateside and jettisoned onto Disney+. Good Dinosaur, another Pixar dud, had a Thanksgiving launch back in 2015 with a $39.1M 3-day, -61% second weekend of $15.3M, and final domestic take of $123M. Who knows, maybe Elemental goes farther, especially as it looks to get a boost over the July 4th frame. Gross by Sunday looks to be $65.3M. Tonight’s figures don’t come from Disney. Spider-Verse will land at $317.1M.
As of this minute, and again Sunday could change the tables into Monday AM, Warner Bros/DC’s The Flash will take third from Sony’s R-rated Jennifer Lawrence comedy No Hard Feelings, at $15.1M in its second weekend to the latter’s $15M opening. Flash has the edge after an estimated $6M Saturday, +33% over Friday. No Hard Feelings did $4.8M, -26% against Friday/Thursday previews. Very good start here for the Jennifer Lawrence comedy, especially in this marketplace. In its older young woman tending to an even younger kid, it did look creepy — but not as creepy as 1981’s Private Lessons (remember that film?). It works because audiences are clearly getting the joke and the hijinks.
Flash‘s running total by EOD Sunday is expected to be $87.4M. Chew on this: despite the hammering Dwayne Johnson’s fall box office savior, Black Adam, took from the press, that movie’s first 10 days ($110.9M) are 27% ahead of The Flash. Black Adam‘s second weekend was also bigger at $27.4M, -59% to Flash‘s -73%. Was it wise to nix Black Adam 2? Flash‘s running total at 10 days is pacing 2% behind that of Green Lantern‘s ($88.9M). That DC bomb, which starred Ryan Reynolds, posted a second weekend of $18M, -66% (also better than Flash). Black Adam finaled at $168.1M, Green Lantern ended its gross at $116.6M.
Paramount’s Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is fifth this frame with a $4.7M third Saturday, +48% from Friday, for a third weekend of $11.5M, -44% for a $122.8M running total by EOD Sunday.
Focus Features’ expansion of Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City is swell in sixth place, booked at 1,675 locations, with a $2.8M Saturday, -26% from Friday, and second weekend of $8.7M and running total by end of Sunday at $9.9M. The wide break of Asteroid City beats the both the fourth weekend of Anderson’s 2014 title Grand Budapest Hotel which did $8.5M at 977 theaters and its wide expansion at 1,263 theaters in weekend 5 which posted $6.1M. At this pace, Asteroid City has a very good shot at surpassing the final cume of Anderson’s previous movie, The French Dispatch, which ended its stateside run at $16.1M.
UPDATED, Saturday AM: It’s still a close call between Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and Elemental seeing about $18 million each, a fight that will go into matinees and evenings Saturday. There’s also still a fight for third between The Flash and No Hard Feelings, seeing $15M each.
Focus Features’ Asteroid City is coming in with $8.4M for the weekend after a $3.8M Friday.
(L-R) ‘The Flash’, ‘No Hard Feelings’ and ‘Asteroid City’ Everett
Elemental’s ease here, which is expected to be around -39%, bests that of other Pixar movies, i.e., Toy Story 4, which fell 52% in weekend 2, Finding Dory, which eased 46%, and Inside Out, which dipped 42%. The hold for Elemental is also around where Super Mario Bros was at -37%. It’s not a shocker to see this type of hold for Elemental after its near-record low opening for Pixar last weekend. It’s a kids movie, and original at that. It was always going to take moms some time to make it to the theater on this one after reading reviews.
More thoughts on the Flash disaster: First of all, did we really expect this movie to open big, despite the tubthumping of Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav and co-DC boss James Gunn? In regards to the greater ecosystem of the motion picture industry – and this is a hard pill for Warners to swallow — there’s something to be thankful for in The Flash missing its projections, and not even having the potential to open to $100M. What? Why? Because it would have shown that a major studio could open a movie without the full promotional support of its actors and leading star. That would have been firepower for the studios to play hardball and stand firm in current AMPTP and SAG-AFTRA talks (which are ongoing and continuing). But with the reality of Flash’s misfire, it clearly shows the studios can’t open tentpoles without the full fire-breathing support of its cast in all forms.
On another note, the anticipated 75% drop here for The Flash doesn’t entirely boil down to the pic’s lack of proper publicity. What needs to be realized here is that this was a B CinemaScore superhero movie, despite the return of Michael Keaton’s Batman, and at a too-long 2 hours and 20 minutes. Yes, we’ve seen superhero movies make big box office numbers off of lengthy running times, but this studio/filmmaker addiction to two-hour-plus movies post-pandemic has got to stop. Shorter is better, not just critically on a popcorn pic, but for business and the turnover of showtimes. Testing clearly indicates when a movie is a drag, but for some reasons, studios prefer to ignore the tea leaves.
Something else that monkey-wrenched into Flash’s ticket sales: At the DC winter press day, Gunn spoke about how the DC universe has been splintered far too much (and he’s 100% correct) between TV and films, i.e., the Snyderverse vs. the Greg Berlanti CW-verse. It’s Gunn and Peter Safran’s mission going forward to make a cohesive DC universe across all mediums, just like Marvel. That said, it didn’t help that Flash the movie opens within a month after Flash the TV show wrapped a nine-season run. Bad timing on Warner Discovery’s part. Flash the TV show has its fervent fan base, especially for series star Grant Gustin. In their eyes, there’s no other person to play Barry Allen. There’s something to be said about Flash CW fans turning their back on the movie.
If No Hard Feelings hits $15M this weekend, that’s a great start post-pandemic for a rare raunch comedy, one that cost a thrifty $45M. That opening for the Gene Stupnitsky-directed movie is $6M off the $21M start of his previous bawdy comedy The Boys. Don’t bet against Sony: They know how to leg out female-skewing movies to big multiples, i.e., Little Women and Where the Crawdads Sing. This Jennifer Lawrence movie is leaning 51% female, with 64% between 18-34. PostTrak still solid at 84% positive with a 59% recommend from audience.
Convo was tracking mixed on social per RelishMix for the Lawrence comedy heading into the weekend, “with fans of Jennifer Lawrence who will follow her anywhere — to others wondering how the story and score on the ‘comedy meter’ and others who are onboard.” Clearly, those who are leaving the theater have turned a corner. Diversity demos are 54% Caucasian, 24% Latino and Hispanic, 6% Black, & 17% Asian/Other. The R-rated movie played strongest in the South Central, West, and Mid-West. AMC Century City has the best gross in the U.S. with just under $30K (including previews).
Focus Features expansion of Asteroid City lands a B CinemaScore, with PostTrak audiences harder on it at 78% positive, 51% recommend. Guys showing up more here at 57%, and the 18-34 repping 66% of ticket buyers. The largest quad was 25-34 year-olds at 37%. Diversity demos were 62% Caucasian, 18% Latino and Hispanic, 7% Black, & 14% Asian/Other. Best regions of play for the Wes Anderson movie were in the East and West with the Alamo New Mission in San Francisco doing the best business with north of $30K on Friday. The pic is coming in at the higher range of single digits, which for a niche film like this, is good. Asteroid City looks to rank sixth (and a running total by Sunday of $9.6M) behind Paramount’s Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, which is eyeing $11.3M in fifth place, -45% for a running total of $122.7M.
RelishMix reports, “With the push coming off of Cannes in May and a limited drop last week, Asteroid City social awareness stats are running above norms by 2X at 178.5M across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok combined — as superfans of Wes Anderson are in their zone as the film goes wide. Most notable is the movie’s unique Instagram, with 30K fans who are savoring and sharing the many rich visual materials that are posted.”
All films this weekend look to make north of $106M, off 21% from a year ago, when Elvis led the weekend with $31.2M. Hopefully, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny doesn’t pull a Flash and come in under expectations, and thus provides some action of next weekend’s Independence Day stretch.
UPDATED, Friday afternoon: Two animated movies, Disney/Pixar’s Elemental and Sony Animation’s monolith Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, have punked The Flash and are in a fierce fight for No. 1 at the weekend box office with about $18 million apiece after Fridays that are estimated around $5.4M each.
If a bulk of those figures stick, Elemental, which posted one of the lowest openings for a Pixar movie in recent memory at $29.6M (though not as low as the first Toy Story, which did $29.1M), will see a second weekend ease of -39%, which isn’t that bad. That will get its 10-day take to $65M at 4,035 theaters, which is $5M more than the pandemic disaster Onward.
Meanwhile, there’s no such thing as superhero fatigue with Across the Spider-Verse easing 33% in its fourth weekend, swinging its running total by EOD Sunday to $315.8M at 3,785 theaters. By Sunday, Across the Spider-Verse will be pacing 14% ahead of Tom Holland’s Spider-Man: Homecoming (which finaled at $334.2M) and 5% behind Spider-Man: Far From Home (which finaled at $390.5M stateside). Wow, wow, wow.
Meanwhile, Warner Bros/DC’s The Flash is looking at a second Friday of $4.3M and second weekend of $14M, right now down a massive 75%. Should that hold, it will be worse than the 66% second-weekend drop weathered by Warner Bros/DC’s Green Lantern back in 2011. The running total for Flash by Sunday will be around $86.3M at 4,256 theaters.
Flash could lose third to Sony’s new R-rated Jennifer Lawrence comedy No Hard Feelings which has a shot at $14M-$15M after a $5.3M Friday at 3,208 theaters.
Fifth place goes to Paramount’s Transformers: Rise of the Beasts with a third Friday of $3M, a three-day of $10.6M, -49%, and a running total of $121.9M. Yes, the seventh robots-in-disguise film will definitely beat out the domestic gross of the last two Transformers movies: Last Knight at $130.1M and Bumblebee at $127.1M.
And the second weekend of Focus Features’ Wes Anderson title Asteroid City is looking better than the second and third weekend of the filmmaker’s The French Dispatch ($2M+) with $7.5M at 1,675 theaters. That will put the 10-day total for the ensemble comedy at $8.7M.
PREVIOUSLY, Friday AM: Sony’s mission to return comedy to the big screen with the R-rated Jennifer Lawrence movie No Hard Feelings began Thursday, when the film grossed $2.15 million from showtimes that began at 4 p.m. at 2,745 locations. The pic hopes to do around $12M this weekend in what will be second session where Warner Bros’ misfire The Flash hopes not take a -70% tumble. At the low end that’s $16.5M. A good hold will be off 55% to north of $24M.
The Flash grossed $2.8M Thursday at 4,234 theaters, off 9% from Wednesday, putting its first-week gross at $72.3M. That amount of money is what tracking thought the DC pic would do in Weekend 1.
There are no comps post-pandemic really for No Hard Feelings since we haven’t had a raunchy comedy for a while. The pic did best Universal’s female-leaning rom-com Ticket to Paradise, which made $1.1M off Thursday showtimes that began at 5 p.m. (even though that pic is older skewing and PG-13). Ticket to Paradise opened to $16.5M.
For filmmaker Gene Stupnitsky, who helmed No Hard Feelings, his previous R-rated comedy Good Boys was a high point for raunchy fare at the box office, opening to $21.4M in pre-pandemic August 2019 and legging out to $83.1M. God knows if those types of numbers can be achieved anymore since the industry has conditioned audiences to watch comedies in their homes on streaming versus with a group in theaters. But again, it comes down to product. Nothing is possible at the box office until a genre breaks through and changes the course of history; remember how pirate movies were the kiss of death until Pirates of the Caribbean came along?
Critics didn’t get No Hard Feelings at 67% on Rotten Tomatoes, but audiences in early RT reactions seem to at 88%. Out of the gate on Comscore/Screen Engine’s PostTrak, the Lawrence-led comedy is 4 stars, 84% positive — not bad. Last night saw 37% guys over 25, 29% women over 25, 19% women under 25 and 15% men under 25.

Focus Features’ expansion of Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City is off to a great start with $1.1M from 1,400 theaters last night in previews. The film swells from six Los Angeles and New York City locations to 1,675 today. Last weekend, the absurdist comedy ensemble posted the best opening theater average post pandemic with $140,000. The movie is expected to do in the single digits in its second weekend. Anderson’s previous movie, The French Dispatch, released when audiences were still trying to make their way back to theaters in the fall of 2021, grossed north of $2M when it went to a 1,000-plus theater break during its third weekend.
Asteroid City is 74% certified fresh with Rotten Tomatoes critics, which is a notch below where French Dispatch was at 75%. That pic also scored 76% with audiences on RT versus Asteroid City which is currently 69%. Asteroid City’s PostTrak is also 4 stars, but 79% positive. Thursday night attendance was comprised of 42% guys over 25, 28% women over 25, 16% men under 25 and 15% women under 25.

Other activity Thursday: Sony Animation’s Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse led all pics in regular release with $3.6M (-5% from Wednesday) at 3,873 theaters, good for a $45.2M third week and running total of $297.8M. The Marvel pic will cross the three-century mark today.
Disney/Pixar’s Elemental was second at 4,035 theaters with $3.5M, even with Wednesday, for a first week of $46.9M. That’s less than the first week of the pandemic-impacted Pixar movie Onward, which made $49.7M in its first week. Warners/DC’s The Flash was third yesterday.
Paramount’s Transformers: Rise of the Beasts did $1.9M yesterday off 3,680 theaters, -5% from Wednesday, for a second week of $30.7M and a running total of $111.3M.
Disney’s The Little Mermaid at 3,480 theaters made $1.7M, -5%, for a fourth week of $19.5M. Its running total is $261.5M.
The summer box office for the period of May 1-June 19 stands at $1.52 billion from 11 wide releases (north of 2,000 theaters). That’s 2.3% ahead of last summer, which counted $1.49 billion for the frame from six wide releases.

While “Barbie” earned the biggest opening of the summer this past weekend, Universal’s “Oppenheimer” pulled off an equally impressive feat, defying all expectations to gross an $82 million opening.
The perhaps unanswerable question here is how much of this success did the movie achieve on its own, drawing on director Chris Nolan’s reputation as a cinematic auteur, and how much it benefited from the “Barbenheimer” hype around two very different movies opening on the same day. Demographic data suggests its outsized box office haul came in part from younger audiences — those who also powered “Barbie” to the top of the box office — showing up in greater numbers than Universal expected.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYW5hbHlzaXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-28 20:46:47+00:00,‘Barbie’ And ‘Oppenheimer’ Propel UK & Ireland Box Office To Biggest Week Ever,"Barbenheimer has fuelled a new UK box office milestone, propelling sales to £66.4M over one week.","EXCLUSIVE: The UK box office is booming thanks to Barbenheimer.
According to seven-day figures from Comscore, this past week is the highest ever recorded at the UK and Ireland box office, with £66,373,575 clocked from all movies between July 21-27.
The feat has been fueled by the Barbenheimer phenomenon, which has seen Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer catch the public’s attention like few film combos ever before. Both opened last weekend.
To achieve the milestone, this past week has overtaken the frame December 18-24, 2015 when ticket stubs totaled £58,618,154 thanks in large part to Star Wars pic The Force Awakens.
Barbie picked up an estimated £18.5M and Oppenheimer clocked £10.9M over opening weekend, the first time two films had opened to more than £10M each in the UK.
Mission Impossible was the third best performer over the past seven days and took £2.8M over last weekend but the vast majority of the week’s total UK box office came from Barbenheimer.
The stellar return was helped by the popularity of larger format presentations such as IMAX, which attract a higher price point than regular screenings.
Unconfirmed figures from UK cinema advertising organization Digital Cinema Media also suggest admissions for this past week were at a 10-year high, with cinemas on track to clock north of seven million admissions.
The previous record of 7.6M admissions was set in 2012 during the first-week of Sam Mendes’ Bond pic Skyfall. We can expect firm figures on admissions in the coming weeks.
The UK box office has been all Barbenheimer all week, with exhibitors reporting record highs. On Sunday Vue Cinemas said the two films helped the chain to its second-biggest weekend in history as moviegoers flocked in record numbers to catch the double bill. Vue said more than a fifth of all customers at its cinemas booked tickets to see both films. The chain also recorded over 2,000 sold-out sessions of Barbie.
Starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, Barbie has clocked a thumping $528.6M globally through Wednesday, including $291.4M from international, and that’s after only one week of release. The film is now the biggest Warner Bros. offshore opening ever for a non-franchise film. The pic is also the largest-ever opening weekend for an original, non-franchise film at the UK & Ireland market box office.
At the same time, Christopher Nolan’s explosive biopic Oppenheimer has a strong global total of $265.1M through Wednesday. The offshore figure is $147.2M.
Both titles are performing beyond expectations and have been buoyed by strong responses from critics and audiences alike.
Both films also clocked records stateside, with Barbie recording the largest domestic opening of the 2023 year, besting Super Mario Bros.‘s $146.4 3-day weekend. The film is also Warner Bros.’s largest advance sales haul ever at $49.5M.

,"After box office hit, Oppenheimer's grandchildren discuss his atomic legacy",The movie Oppenheimer is sparking interest and debate over the man who developed this country’s first atomic bomb.,"Oppenheimer, the new Christopher Nolan film, made twice its box office projections last weekend. The movie tells the story of nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who developed the world’s first atomic bomb.
He meant for it to be a deterrent to war, but then-President Harry Truman ordered two bombs to be dropped on Japan to end World War II.
The consequences of Oppenheimer’s work have been felt and debated ever since.
We spoke with two of the grandchildren of J. Robert Oppenheimer: Dorothy Oppenheimer Vanderford and Charles Oppenheimer. They’ll headline a discussion Thursday at the Beverly Theater. It’s being hosted by the Atomic Museum.
And of course, they'll talk about the movie. But if you want something of a spoiler... they liked it. ""The movie made sure to have him appear more as a hero and as a person who didn't necessarily prevail, but was the good guy,"" said Vanderford, who lives in Boulder City and works at the Nevada National Security Sites — which is the former Nevada Test Site.
Her brother also saw J. Robert Oppenheimer as a scientist-turned-diplomat. ""He said, if we go on making these weapons, you can't keep it secret from the other side, it will escalate into an arms race and [become] terribly dangerous,"" said Charles, who recently founded The Oppenheimer Project with Dorothy and other family members. ""And the only way to counteract that is to work together with people who we may have previously considered our enemies -- we have to work together in a new way. And that is a really deep message.""
And for those in Southern Nevada that want to complement any screening of Oppenheimer with something more educational and in-the-flesh, the Atomic Museum is suitably prepared to meet this cultural moment — and has, if its rising attendance is any indication.
""We have the only full-sized model replica of what Oppenheimer called the gadget — it's the Trinity bomb,"" says CEO Rob McCoy. ""And we tell the Manhattan Project story, the Oppenheimer story and, of course, [the story behind] Trinity. And then from there, we talk about the use of atomic weaponry. ... And the other thing that we do at the museum [is explore when] we suddenly found ourselves in the atomic age. And this influenced every facet of our life, from popular culture, film, music, writing books and politics. So our lives changed forever.""

2023-07-06 14:24:31.302000+00:00,"Barbie, Bombs, Blockbusters! Box Office Wars Return as a Spectator Sport","This summer, Hollywood needs to make $4 billion from movies like 'Barbie,' 'Mission: Impossible,' and 'Oppenheimer' to be truly in the pink.","Tom Cruise knows how to sell tickets—even to other people’s movies. “This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,” the Mission: Impossible star wrote on Instagram recently, while he and director Christopher McQuarrie posed with tickets in front of posters for rival films. Cruise congratulated Harrison Ford for “creating one of the most iconic characters in cinema history” with Indiana Jones, and identified himself as one of the many people who’d make a double feature out of Oppenheimer and Barbie, which will go head-to-head in theaters as of July 21. His act of goodwill proved to be contagious, as he must have hoped it would. A few days later, Barbie director Greta Gerwig and star Margot Robbie tweeted their own photo shoot, in which they also waved tickets to their rivals: “Mission: Accepted!”

Summer box office used to be the ultimate showbiz blood sport. Now, publicly at least, it’s all kumbaya and collegiality, which says a lot about the industry’s enduring post-pandemic fears. Beneath the gracious social media shoutouts is a pervasive sense that if the public doesn’t fall back in love with in-person moviegoing for good now, the bottom will continue to fall out of the studio system and take stars down in the process. So far, summer 2023 has proven to be a bumpy ride. Sure-things have struggled, surprise sleepers have failed to emerge, and pressure is mounting on a handful of July titles to save the season.

Box office watchers are still predicting that movies like Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One and Barbie can help summer ticket sales in the US and Canada hit $4 billion, which would be taken as a sign that the industry has indeed recovered from an anemic three years. But a trail of early underperformers—including DC’s The Flash, Pixar’s Elemental, and Indy’s fifth and final outing, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny—has only stoked worries. With his cheerleading post, Cruise, the man who “saved Hollywood’s ass” last summer with Top Gun: Maverick, is attempting to stage a rescue mission again. This time he’ll have some help from Barbie and the atomic bomb.

Hollywood power brokers are watching all this closely, to say the least. “I was very excited after Super Mario Bros., and then I got a little more concerned after the last four weeks,” says producer Jason Blum, best known for low-cost horror hits Paranormal Activity, Insidious, and M3GAN. “The movie business has in no way bounced back like the live events business has, but I really think that it’s a matter of time.” Few expect earnings to surpass summer 2019 levels—when 32 films brought in $4.34 billion—but anything close will be a win. The industry is used to absorbing bad news—and hoping for last-minute salvation. “Not everything works,” says another studio executive poring over summer ticket sales, “but that’s just the movie business.”

There are reasons to be at least optimism-adjacent. Moviegoers still want to see spectacle—and they are willing to pay extra to see it on premium large-format screens. “2023 has definitely been a much fuller slate than pre-pandemic times,” says IMAX CEO Richard Gelfond. “And for us, it’s even a little more intense because the audience has shifted more to premium on a global basis. IMAX’s market share went up by 50% in North America and it’s gone up by about 40% globally. So it’s not only more competition within the industry, it’s more competition for IMAX screens. We think our box office will be similar to 2019.”

Similar is the new amazing.

Moviegoers signaled that they were ready to return to theaters last summer when they showed up in droves for Top Gun: Maverick, the top performer of the year with a staggering $719 million in US ticket sales, and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which outperformed 2016’s Doctor Strange. But the robust performance of a handful of titles belied ongoing challenges. Last winter, as one Oscar contender after another died gasping at the box office, a senior awards strategist told Vanity Fair, “the audience is just not there anymore for these sorts of movies.” One obstacle was simply a volume problem: Even though tentpoles like Avatar: The Way of Water were dominating the weekend, there just weren’t enough movies in theaters.

This summer, every weekend offers multiple options, and they’re often aimed at disparate demographics, as with the showdown referred to in some quarters as “Barbenheimer.” Since May 5, when Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 dropped, there’s been a steady beat of new releases, among them The Little Mermaid, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts. The major studios are expected to release 42 films widely across the country by Labor Day weekend. One studio executive moans about all this in a way that sounds almost nostalgic: “It’s such a crowded summer.”

Before Cruise began his goodwill campaign, the actor was involved in a behind-the-scenes fight for IMAX screens, according to Puck. His latest Mission: Impossible outing will play on IMAX screens for about a week, but then must give them up for Oppenheimer, which debuts a week later on July 21 and has all the screens exclusively booked for three weeks. That has little to do with earnings expectations, and everything to do with relationships. Nolan, a longtime IMAX champion, had struck a deal long before with the exhibitor to guarantee that his movie would play on those screens, regardless of who else parachuted into the market on a motorcycle.

IMAX’s Gelfond tells VF that he worked closely with Nolan and Universal on Oppenheimer’s release date more than a year ago. He visited the Mission: Impossible set and is “a huge fan of Tom’s,” he says, but this is the bottom line: “We made a commitment to Chris. Obviously, I think the movie’s going to be great, but irrespective, we honor our commitments.”

Executives worried about a crowded schedule are one sign that movies are back, baby. “We’ve had really big films since reopening from the pandemic, like Avatar and Top Gun and Spider-Man, but now we’re talking about many titles,” says Elizabeth Frank, the executive in charge of programming AMC Entertainment’s more than 10,000 screens. “People are saying, ‘Well, which one do you want to see first?’ And that’s a different level of excitement. In an industry where momentum is really important, it’s an opportunity for us to build back habitual moviegoing.”

In Hollywood, the weekend box office is treated with the same seriousness as the World Series. “I have a group of friends, we get together at the beginning of the year and we have a draft, we pick all the movies for the year, and points are awarded based on Metacritic score, based on box office, based on awards, and based on profitability,” says Blum, whose company, Blumhouse, has Insidious: The Red Door out on July 7. “We text each other every Thursday or Friday. I’m currently in second place.”

Guys like Blum no doubt pay closer attention to movie ticket sales than the average American, but even he has noticed that more people are following the money as they did years ago. “The box office derby is one of those things that everyone can be a part of,” says Paul Dergarabedian, an entertainment industry analyst for Comscore. “Not everyone has played professional sports or ridden a horse professionally or driven a race car, but we can all sit in a movie theater.”

More scrutiny, of course, means more headlines when movies stumble. For every winner like Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (with its $356 million in domestic grosses) or Spider Man: Across the Spider-Verse ($346 million), there’s something like The Flash, which has pulled a meager $102 million in the US in spite of its reported $200 million budget, or Elemental, whose $29.6 million debut was considered a major flop for Disney’s Pixar. Meanwhile, Dial of Destiny, which reportedly cost $295 million, arguably needed to make a lot more over Fourth of July than it did. One bright spot? Studios are focusing more on profitability, which Blum contends, “everyone forgot about for about five years.” Now, he says, there’s more pressure to rein in costs: “The budget conversation was the last conversation when you were introducing new projects to buyers. Now it’s the first, which makes me happy because I think less expensive movies are often better and more interesting.”

Even before June gloom hit the box office, Hollywood had largely put its faith in Mission: Impossible, Barbie, and Oppenheimer to carry ticket sales. Now it’s even more imperative that all three titles find their audiences. Early tracking—which pegs the Mission: Impossible opening at around $90 million, Barbie somewhere north of $70 million, and Oppenheimer around $40 million—suggests that they will. Though Ethan Hunt will likely be the biggest star of the summer, media attention has focused squarely on the matchup between Barbie and Oppenheimer.

“I do think a rising tide lifts all boats,” says a top film agent. “When we have pictures in theaters that start to feel like they’re ‘watercooler’—which I really think the Barbie-Oppenheimer thing is becoming—it’s incredibly healthy for the box office, because what we’re doing is delivering an experience that people feel like was worth their time and money.”

AMC has been preparing for the summer movie season by extending operating hours at its theaters, hiring more staff, and making sure its Icee dispensers are full. “Increasingly, fans of different films are also looking for movie-themed merchandise and movie-themed drinks,” says Frank. “It makes the moviegoing experience that much more engaging and dynamic. It’s a little complicated, though, to be moving in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle cups while you’re figuring out whether you’ve still got a bunch of people who want the Mission: Impossible ones or the Barbie ones.”

Predicting the box office has always been like reading tea leaves or tarot cards. Even IMAX’s Gelfond admits to fixating on the returns—from the first night to the last. “Like a junkie,” he says. “I hate to admit it, but yes. Most of our movies open on Thursday nights because they’re big blockbusters. So by Friday morning, I’m on the phone with our distribution and marketing teams trying to understand what the weekend’s going to look like and what’s working and not working and why and why not.”

In addition to the holdovers, there are two new wide releases competing for eyeballs over the weekend. Sony’s “Gran Turismo” starring David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, Archie Madekwe, Darren Barnet, Geri Halliwell Horner and Djimon Hounsou, and Disney’s “Haunted Mansion,” featuring LaKeith Stanfield, Rosario Dawson, Owen Wilson, Tiffany Haddish and Jamie Lee Curtis, are both opening across more than 300 locations.

Paramount’s animated adventure “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” is projected to pick up $35 million to $45 million in its first five days of release. But those ticket sales won’t be enough to dethrone “Barbie,” which is expected to top the box office for a third weekend in a row.

Greta Gerwig’s colorful fantasy comedy is eyeing $45 million to $50 million between Friday and Sunday, another huge result for the plastic fantastic blockbuster. It’s already the second-highest grossing movie of the year with $381.6 million in North America.

“TMNT” opens nationwide on Wednesday, two days ahead of another newcomer, the Warner Bros. shark sequel “Meg 2: The Trench.” Those films will vie for second place alongside Christopher Nolan’s historical drama “Oppenheimer,” now in its third weekend of release.

“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” already collected $3.85 million from Tuesday’s preview screenings. The PG film cost $70 million, which is less than recent animated offerings such as Pixar’s $200 million-budgeted “Elemental” and Sony’s $100 million-budgeted “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.” Still, “Mutant Mayhem” needs to stick around in theaters beyond opening weekend to justify the production budget. With great reviews and positive word-of-mouth, the movie is hoping to benefit from kids who are out of school for summer vacation.

Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies seem to have faith in the film, since they are already developing a sequel, as well as a two-season Paramount+ series that will serve as a “bridge” between the big screen adventures.

Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the creative team behind “Superbad,” wrote and produced “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.” Jeff Rowe, the filmmaker of the Oscar-nominated “The Mitchells vs. the Machines,” directed the film, which follows the Turtle brothers, who set out to conquer the streets of New York City after spending years sheltered from the human world. The sprawling voice cast includes Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Jackie Chan and Ice Cube.

“Meg 2: The Trench” is targeting $25 million to $30 million in its debut. Those estimates are a significant drop from the first film, which opened to $45 million in the pre-pandemic era. “The Meg” became a surprise smash with $145 million in North America and $530.5 million globally. The follow-up film cost $130 million, so Warner Bros. is banking on another strong turnout at the international box office.

Ben Wheatley directed the sequel, which again stars Jason Statham and centers on a group of scientists who travel to the depths of the ocean and must fend off a 75-foot-long behemoth known as a megalodon — and other terrifying sea creatures.

“Oppenheimer,” meanwhile, looks to add $23 million to $26 million in its third outing. The film has earned $181 million at the domestic box office and $419 million at the global box office, a mammoth result for a three-hour biopic that’s heavy on dialogue and light on action. It has already outperformed the lifetime grosses of two prior Nolan efforts, “Tenet” ($365 million) and “Batman Begins” ($373 million).",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL2JveC1vZmZpY2UtdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1vcGVuaW5nLWVzdGltYXRlLWJhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci0xMjM1Njg1OTMwL9IBhAFodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL2JveC1vZmZpY2UtdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1vcGVuaW5nLWVzdGltYXRlLWJhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci0xMjM1Njg1OTMwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

About Oppenheimer

Oppenheimer is based on Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin's biography American Prometheus, based on the life of American theoretical physicist known as the ‘father of the atomic bomb.’ It stars Cillian Murphy in the titular role and the ensemble cast includes Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon and Florence Pugh.

Opening day box office prediction

As per a report by 123Telugu.com, Oppenheimer is set for a box office collection in the range of ₹10-15 crore on the day of its release in India. Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One had collected around ₹12.50 crore on its opening day in India, so it will be interesting to see whether Oppenheimer can outdo that.

The early sales of Oppenheimer began a week ago in India as the film's advance booking started 10 days ago. It received a tremendous response within the first very few hours. As per the figures posted by a film trade analyst, the film has already amassed 90,000 tickets across all three multiple chains - PVR, INOX and Cinepolis - for the opening day itself. These include IMAX screens as well.

Christopher Nolan on Oppenheimer

Christopher Nolan recently opened up on making Oppenheimer. “I just thought to take the audience there, to be there in that room with these people as they had to make these horrifying decisions that have defined the world we now live in... what a remarkable dramatic event to bring the audience to,” Nolan told Reuters.

On the other hand, Barbie, which has also commenced its advance booking, has shown a good start and has sold around 16,000 tickets across the three multiple chains for the opening day.

About Barbie

Barbie stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, along with a cast that includes names like America Ferrera, Simu Liu, Dua Lipa, Emerald Fennell, Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera and Will Ferrell.

The film's premise reads, “After being expelled from the utopian Barbie Land for being less-than-perfect dolls, Barbie and Ken go on a journey of self-discovery to the real world.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2hvbGx5d29vZC9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLXByZWRpY3Rpb24taW5kaWEtMTAxNjg5NjY0MDgzODY1Lmh0bWzSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9ob2xseXdvb2Qvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItYm94LW9mZmljZS1wcmVkaWN0aW9uLWluZGlhLTEwMTY4OTY2NDA4Mzg2NS1hbXAuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-20 19:09:00+00:00,"‘Oppenheimer’ Rises To $718M Global, ‘Barbie’ Basks In $1.28B, ‘Meg 2’ Chomps Past $300M; ‘Blue Beetle’ Scurries To $18M Overseas Start – International Box Office","This weekend saw milestones for Oppenheimer and Meg 2, continued success for Barbie and local-language movies as well as the entry of Blue Beetle","UPDATED: It’s been another very busy weekend at the international box office with milestones and great holds, as well as a new entry and local-language movies adding to the mix.

Coming off of a record-breaking debut in Korea, Christopher Nolan and Universal’s Oppenheimer led the overseas frame for the studios with a $32M session in 80 markets, pushing the global cume well past $700M, as we noted would be the case yesterday.

Warner Bros, meanwhile, has a lot going on. Barbie added $26.7M in 75 markets to lift worldwide to a high-heeled $1.279B. The studio’s China coproduction Meg 2: The Trench has now crossed $300M global, and its new offering, DC’s Blue Beetle landed within the expected range, bowing to $18M from 63 overseas markets.

At the same time, there is action aplenty for local titles in China and India (see more below).

Starting with the new studio entry this weekend, Warner Bros/DC’s Blue Beetle scurried to an $18M opening in 63 markets, landing within the range we were hearing ahead of the weekend. In those starts, the Xolo Maridueña-starrer was No. 1 in 17. Combined with domestic, the global debut is $43.4M.

Regionally, Blue Beetle, from director Ángel Manuel Soto, was tops in Latin America, surpassing the debuts of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves by 27% and DC comp The Suicide Squad by 26%. The film was also the No. 1 title in many Asia markets, including Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan, Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam. Western Europe was mixed, although France and Italy overperformed.

Breaking it down, Mexico was the top play at $2.7M, a No. 1 launch over the above comps and 478% ahead of the recent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (the market may have been impacted by Hurricane Hilary). Brazil grossed $2.1M at open, No. 1 on par with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and 42% over The Suicide Squad. France and the UK both took $1.5M – the former on par with The Suicide Squad and well ahead of TMNTMM, and the latter in line with Into the Spider-Verse on a weekend impacted by good weather and the women’s World Cup final. Rounding out the Top 5 openers, Indonesia bowed to $1.2M, dominating at 55% share of the market, above Into the Spider-Verse by 50%, The Suicide Squad by 964% and TMNTMM by over 2K%.

There are still 12 markets to come, including the Middle East this week and Australia in September.

Looking at the holdovers, Oppenheimer, as we reported yesterday, crossed $700M globally on Saturday, now with an estimated $717.8M through today. Just five weeks into release, it’s the 4th highest grossing Nolan film ever worldwide, having overtaken Interstellar. Oppenheimer is also the 4th biggest film of 2023 globally behind The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Barbie and Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3

The current international frame is eyed at $32M in 80 markets for a $432.6M offshore cume to date. This is Nolan’s top film of all time at the international box office when restated to today’s dollars and excluding un-released markets.

The Cillian Murphy-led epic is the biggest Nolan film ever in 51 markets.

Korea had a fantastic debut, breaking records on Tuesday as the biggest Nolan launch day and the biggest Hollywood opening day of the year. The 6-day opening weekend of $12.6 million is the second biggest opening weekend for a Nolan film (only behind The Dark Knight Rises), the biggest Hollywood drama opening of all time and the 3rd biggest Hollywood start of the year. The standard 4-day weekend is well above Inception, almost double The Dark Knight and more than double Tenet – and in a competitive environment, to boot. It has already surpassed the lifetime of No Time To Die.

Also notable, the UK is now at $63.9M, performing in line with The Dark Knight Rises and Dunkirk. The $13M IMAX portion of that has exceeded Avatar: The Way of Water to become the No. 2 IMAX title ever in the market, behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

Germany has cumed $39.5M, France is at $31.2M, Australia has grossed $22.9M and Netherlands had a great hold at No. 1 (down just 28%) with a $16.1M cume through Sunday.

The IMAX global cume is $146.4M, now the 5th highest grossing IMAX title ever. For perspective, the Top 4 IMAX movies each earned over $2B in lifetime worldwide box office (Avatar, Avatar: The Way Of Water, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Avengers: Endgame) whereas Oppenheimer is currently at the aforementioned $718M.

Internationally, the IMAX cume is $65.6M, good for Nolan’s best result ever in the format and the No. 7 biggest ever (No. 3 in like-for-like markets behind Avatar 1&2).

Italy and Greece open Oppenheimer this week, with China set for August 30.

The living doll that is Barbie is also continuing to show great strength. The 5th frame added $26.7M from 75 markets for a 42% drop. The overseas cume is now $711.9M with $1.279B global.

Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie have delivered the 2nd biggest movie ever for WB globally and the 5th best internationally. This is the studio’s highest-grosser in 30 markets including the UK, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and Poland.

Barbie’s Top 5 overseas markets through Sunday are the UK ($109.6M), Mexico ($53.2M), Australia ($51.1M), Germany ($47.4M) and Brazil ($43M).

Also from WB, Meg 2: The Trench had a meaty $21.9M third frame in 76 markets. The international running total now stands at $250.1M and the global cume to date is currently $316.6M. China is leading all play with $106.3M thus far, followed by Mexico ($18.3M), the UK ($12.5M), France ($9.9M) and Spain ($9.8M). Japan is still to release on August 25.

Sony’s Gran Turismo: Based on a True Story took a sophomore lap of $6.3M, down a slight 37% in the small first wave of 34 offshore markets as it looks to build word of mouth ahead of wider rollout. The overseas total is $22.7M to date. Notable holds include the UAE (+36%), Kuwait (-12%), Qatar (-16%), Saudi Arabia (-29%) and France (-29%). Still to release are Brazil and Mexico next week, and China, Japan, Italy and Korea in September.

Paramount/Skydance’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One ran up another $6.2M in 67 markets with a 45% drop. The offshore cume on the Tom Cruise-starrer is now $376.4M with $541M globally. Japan continues to race along at No. 1, now with a $31.5M cume, just under the UK which is at $32.3M to date.

Disney/Pixar’s Elemental fired up another $5.9M in 51 markets, lifting the overseas cume to $307.2M and global to $458.3M. The international weekend hold was -37%. Korea leads all play at a total $52.4M, followed by the UK ($20.8M), Mexico ($20.7M), France ($20.7M) and China ($15.9M).

In local titles, after a stellar start last frame, India’s Gadar 2 added an estimated $13.3M (the 2nd best 2nd weekend ever for a Bollywood title), for a $54M cume (448 crore) to date. It’s currently the No. 4 Bollywood movie ever in India, behind Pathaan, Dangal and PK. Also in its sophomore session, Jailer added an estimated $7.25M for a local cume of $40M.

China’s No More Bets anted up another estimated $65M, leading to a local running total of $376M. Maoyan currently has the Super Lion title reaching a final of $520M+. Getting there would make it the No. 3 movie of the year in the market. The IMAX cume is $9.7M. With this weekend, 2023 officially becomes IMAX’s biggest local-language year ever at $184M and with over four months still to go.

2023-07-19 23:25:26+05:30,Stage set for Hollywood’s big box office clash,Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie are set to engage in a theatrical clash,"In what’s shaping up to be the biggest weekend for Hollywood at the box office after many months, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie are set to engage in a theatrical clash, generating immense excitement not only for the viewers in their home market but also among Indian fans.

Nolan’s devoted fan base and the movie’s positioning as a big-screen spectacle shot on IMAX are helping the epic Robert Oppenheimer biographical thriller dominate advance ticket sales in India. Theatres in cities such as Mumbai and Delhi have scheduled IMAX screenings as early as 12 am and 3.30 am on Friday morning.

“These tent-pole films are coming from celebrated filmmakers and the advances have been impressive for both, although Oppenheimer is leading for now,"" Sanjeev Kumar Bijli, executive director of PVR Inox Ltd, said. It has already secured 25% of all advances for Oppenheimer and 20% for Barbie for the opening weekend.

For Oppenheimer’s IMAX shows, 50% of advance bookings have been locked in, and the film is likely to make Rs7-8 crore over the opening weekend in India, while Barbie may ring in Rs4-5 crore. While it is common for south Indian productions to screen early morning shows for big-ticket films on the first day, it is not common for Hollywood films in India, barring blockbusters like Avengers: Endgame.

Moreover, while it is not unusual for Hindi language films to clash at the Indian box office, Bijli said this is the first time that two Hollywood blockbusters will directly compete for attention, especially at a time Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, which was released last week, continues to perform strongly. The Tom Cruise-starrer, which is also being screened in IMAX and ICE formats, earned Rs67.75 crore at last count in India.

Abneesh Roy, executive director, Nuvama Institutional Equities, said both films should do well especially in metros and niche, premium markets. IMAX formats for Oppenheimer are doing particularly well, with the first weekend’s occupancy at over 80%. Tickets too are being priced at a premium with IMAX shows for the thriller at Rs1,000, compared with average ticket prices of Rs700 for Mission: Impossible in cities like Delhi.

Ashish Saksena,chief operating officer, cinema, BookMyShow, said Mission: Impossible has set the tempo, and the box-office clash between Oppenheimer and Barbie is building on it. “While both films are creating a buzz worldwide, Oppenheimer has started off on an impressive note in India as the advance sales opened earlier. Over 360,000 tickets have been sold on BookMyShow since it went live three weeks ago.""

“Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi-NCR and Chennai are leading ticket sales on our platform,"" he said. Around 42% of the tickets booked on the platform for Oppenheimer were for high-end cinematic formats, specifically the IMAX format.

Barbie, for which advance bookings went live during the weekend of 15 July, has crossed 91,000 on BookMyShow with Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi-NCR, Chennai and Kolkata in the lead. “We have observed 8% of transactors for Oppenheimer booking tickets for Barbie as well, with a large chunk opting to watch bo the films on the same day. In fact, we saw 27% of transactors for Oppenheimer having watched Mission: Impossible just recently,"" Saksena said.

To be sure, social media chatter around the two films has made for substantial buzz even in India. Having inspired countless memes, users have pointed out the stark difference between the two films and coined the term ‘Barbieheimer’ to distinguish the serious, intense thriller on a theoretical physicist developing nuclear weapons from the light-hearted comedy based on a fashion doll.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9uZXdzL2luZGlhL3N0YWdlLXNldC1mb3ItaG9sbHl3b29kLXMtYmlnLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtY2xhc2gtMTE2ODk3ODQxNzU1MDkuaHRtbNIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9uZXdzL2luZGlhL3N0YWdlLXNldC1mb3ItaG9sbHl3b29kLXMtYmlnLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtY2xhc2gvYW1wLTExNjg5Nzg0MTc1NTA5Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-17 14:03:39+05:30,Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer must earn at least $200 million at Box Office; here’s why,"Christopher Nolan's upcoming film Oppenheimer, starring Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, and Matt Damon, will be released on the same day, July 21, as the highly-anticipated movie Barbie.","Christopher Nolan's upcoming film Oppenheimer is generating immense anticipation among movie fans. Known for his captivating storytelling, thrilling narratives and visionary cinematography, Nolan's movies consistently deliver a cinematic experience that leaves audiences spellbound.

Starring renowned actors Robert Downey Jr. Cillian Murphy and Matt Damon, Oppenheimer boasts an impressive ensemble cast. Murphy is probably best known for his portrayal of Tommy Shelby in the British crime drama, Peaky Blinders.

With a reputation for pushing the boundaries of imagination and setting new standards in filmmaking, Nolan's films often surpass the wildest expectations of his devoted followers. His previous work, including The Dark Knight Rises, stands as a testament to his ability to create visually stunning masterpieces with substantial budgets.

One of Nolan’s most expensive movies

Oppenheimer, with a budget of $100 million, has secured its place as Christopher Nolan's fourth most expensive film, trailing behind the budgets of Batman Begins ($150 million), Interstellar ($165 million), The Dark Knight ($185 million), Tenet ($200 million) and The Dark Knight Rises ($250 million). With an increased budget, the film now faces the added pressure of performing well at the box office.

Oppenheimer would need to earn a minimum of $200 million to cover its costs and break even, as per a Screen Rant report. The report further explains that to achieve this, the film would require a worldwide haul of $250 million while reaching three times the budget would necessitate a global box office collection of $300 million for ""Oppenheimer.

Oppenheimer vs Barbie

Oppenheimer is set to release on the same day as another highly-anticipated movie, Barbie. While the debate over which film will fare better at the box office continues, the clash has undoubtedly fueled the marketing frenzy surrounding Nolan's creation.

Barbie, a fantasy comedy based on Mattel's iconic fashion dolls, features a star-studded cast, including Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie in the lead roles. The film explores Barbie and Ken's adventure in the real world after they are expelled from ""Barbie Land.""

2023-07-29 15:16:46+00:00,Box Office: ‘Haunted Mansion’ $9.9 Million Opening Day Can’t Scare ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’,"Disney's new ""Haunted Mansion"" earned $9.9 million on its opening day, as ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" look to stay strong at the top of the box office.","“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” ain’t afraid of no ghost.

Disney’s new “Haunted Mansion” is settling for third place behind the formidable pair of blockbusters. The reimagining earned $9.9 million from 3,740 locations on its opening day, a figure that includes $3.1 million in Thursday previews. The family-friendly funhouse feature was projecting an opening between $25 million and $30 million, a range that some rivals predict the debut will end up falling short of.

With a $150 million production budget, “Haunted Mansion” is looking to be another disappointing chapter for Disney’s summer slate. Things kicked off strong with Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” which released in May and tallied up $358 million in North America. But after “The Little Mermaid” failed to make a substantial splash overseas, the studio followed with two costly underperformers in “Elemental” and “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.”

No doubt that a swath of family audiences have kept their attention on “Barbie.” “Haunted Mansion” simply doesn’t have the critical buzz to keep up, turning in a low 27% approval rating from top critics on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences are more friendly with a “B+” grade through research firm Cinema Score, but the Disney remake could certainly use some stronger sentiment than that.

Directed by Justin Simien, who showed teeth with “Dear White People” and the horror satire “Bad Hair,” “Haunted Mansion” draws inspiration from the Disneyland theme park ride of the same name. The attraction spawned a feature starring Eddie Murphy in 2003, which flipped a $90 million production budget for a $180 million global gross. This new entry recruits a substantial cast that includes LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito, Rosario Dawson, Dan Levy, Jamie Lee Curtis and Jared Leto.

Also opening this weekend, A24 is putting its latest horror play “Talk to Me” in 2,340 locations. The Australian ghost story was acquired by the indie banner after a buzzy screening at the Sundance Film Festival. With some positive reviews on its side, the film is projected to open in sixth place with a solid $10.1 million gross.

“Barbie” will remain on top in its second weekend, earning a commanding $29 million on Friday. That’s down 59% from its massive $70.5 opening day, which ranks as the largest of the year. The Warner Bros. release actually added 94 more locations for its sophomore outing, now playing in 4,337 venues.

It’s impressive for a film like “Barbie,” which opened north of $150 million, to be projecting a drop of less than 50%. Most blockbusters with that immediate impact face a sharper tumble in their sophomore outings. It all speaks to the superlative one-two punch behind the Greta Gerwig-directed feature: ubiquitous build-up marketing and the perception of quality that delivered.

The hot-pink fantasia will push its domestic total beyond $350 million this weekend, already making it the fourth-highest grossing North American release of the year in just 10 days. It’ll likely pass “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” ($377 million) and “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” ($358 million) within the next week, only leaving “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” ($574 million) ahead of it on 2023 charts.

Universal’s “Oppenheimer” is maintaining second place, projecting a $46 million haul from 3,647 theaters. That’d notch an impressive 44% drop from its opening and would be enough to rank as the fifth-biggest sophomore outing ever for an R-rated release.

The Christopher Nolan feature would probably have landed an even stronger hold if it wasn’t playing strongly throughout the week. On Thursday, “Oppenheimer” became the first R-rated release to sell more than $10 million in tickets for seven days in a row. A big factor to that is the film’s play in Imax. Audiences believe that a Nolan feature demands a huge screen; that’s left consumers motivated to set aside time during the week to land a ticket for one of those premium large formats.

“Oppenheimer” should push its domestic haul to $173 million through Sunday, enough to slot it as the eighth-highest grossing North American release of the year after 10 days of release. It’s already the biggest non-IP production of the year too.

“Sound of Freedom” looks to take fourth, with rivals projecting another slim drop (-31%) this weekend, for a $13 million gross through the three-day frame. The film was acquired by Angel Studios from 20th Century Studios after the acquisition of Fox by Disney; it’s proven a wise investment. Rolling Stone has deemed “Sound of Freedom” a “QAnon-tinged thriller” that targets “the conscience of a conspiracy-addled boomer” — but controversy has likely only gotten more eyeballs on the film as religious and conservative media groups rally behind it.

With a total domestic gross likely reaching $150 million this weekend, a finish above $200 million and among the top 10 highest-earners of the year does seem to be in the cards. Angel Studios has instituted an unconventional “Pay It Forward” system, allowing people to donate money to the distribution banner so that the studio can purchase tickets for its own movie and distribute them for free. The company touts the initiative as a tool to raise awareness on child trafficking. Regardless of what fraction of those admissions end up redeemed, that’s all still money in the pocket for exhibitors.

Rounding out the top five, “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” is relishing a softer fall in its third weekend, down 44% from its sophomore outing. The Tom Cruise action sequel faced a sharper tumble than expected last week at 64.6% — not an auspicious development for a franchise that has usually enjoyed long runs at the box office.

The Paramount release will hit $139 million through Sunday, still tracking behind what its predecessor “Fallout” earned through the same stretch of time ($161 million). With a production budget skirting $300 million, “Dead Reckoning” has been dealt a tough hand at the box office, facing stiff competition for viewers by contending against “Barbie,” “Oppenheimer” and even “Sound of Freedom.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvaGF1bnRlZC1tYW5zaW9uLW9wZW5pbmctZGF5LWJhcmJpZS1zZWNvbmQtd2Vla2VuZC1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci0xMjM1NjgyODkxL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvaGF1bnRlZC1tYW5zaW9uLW9wZW5pbmctZGF5LWJhcmJpZS1zZWNvbmQtd2Vla2VuZC1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci0xMjM1NjgyODkxL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-02 11:52:32+00:00,Producer Siddharth Roy Kapur on India’s Box Office Boom and ‘Oppenheimer’ Outdoing ‘Barbie’: It’s a ‘Holy Grail of Pure Cinema’ (EXCLUSIVE),Former Disney India head Siddharth Roy Kapur calls 'Oppenheimer' beating 'Barbie' at the box office a 'holy grail of pure cinema.',"Former Disney India head and producer of Sony LIV hit “Rocket Boys,” Siddharth Roy Kapur has hailed the reinvigorated Indian box office and robust streaming space. Nevertheless, he sees challenges ahead.

After Shah Rukh Khan’s “Pathaan” ignited a stagnant post-pandemic box office in January, hits have been sporadic. While there were sparks across India’s various language-specific film industries, including the Hindi-language “The Kerala Story,” “Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar” and “Zara Hatke Zara Bachke,” the Telugu-language “Waltair Veerayya” and “Veera Simha Reddy,” the Malayalam-language “2018” and “Romancham” and the Tamil-language “Ponniyin Selvan: II,” the overall box office remained sluggish for the first five months of 2023.

The Indian box office caught fire in the June-July period with hits including the Hindi-language “Satyaprem Ki Katha,” Marathi-language “Baipan Bhaari Deva,” Punjabi-language “Carry On Jatta 3,” Telugu-language “Bro” and “Baby” and Tamil-language “Maaveeran” keeping the turnstiles ticking over.

Hollywood enjoys a 10% market share in India and, after the success of “Fast X” in May, the twin releases of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” in July saw audiences surging into cinemas. Multihyphenate Karan Johar’s star-studded “Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani” hit cinemas in the wake of the “Barbenheimer” juggernaut and is on its way to becoming a major hit.

“Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani” Dharma Productions/Media House Global

“In the film business, six months is a lifetime, so it felt like a very long time after ‘Pathaan’ where the box office had not really come back other than for a few films,” Roy Kapur tells Variety. “For it all to happen at the same time means that then you’re creating a regularity of habit once again, for people to want to come back to the cinemas on a regular basis, to fall back into the virtuous cycle of considering cinema as their weekend option.”

“‘Rocky Aur Rani’ is wonderful for the industry, it’s a mainstream commercial Karan Johar film that’s going from strength-to-strength day-after-day in its collections. ‘Oppenheimer’ is another very interesting result because for a three-hour drama — a Christopher Nolan very layered and complex film, not a dubbed version — it’s mainly the English business that’s really driving the film, not really any known stars in the Indian market, like Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt, and a narrative and a subject itself that can be pretty dry. For that to be working as spectacularly as it is at the Indian box office gives a lot of hope for genres like drama, which a lot of people had written off and said, ‘This has become a streaming genre.’ That actually gives a lot of hope that if you do drama in a way which is cinematic and compelling, people will still come,” Roy Kapur says.

Roy Kapur says that while “Barbie” and “Rocky Aur Rani” are “cinematic experiences and spectacles,” films like “Zara Hatke Zara Bachke” and “Satyaprem Ki Katha” have worked in the smaller cities and metros respectively. “And then you’ve got an ‘Oppenheimer,’ which breaks all the rules and is non-sequel, non-IP, that holy grail of pure cinema,” he says.

India is the only major market where “Oppenheimer” has outgrossed “Barbie” 3:1, with 3:30 a.m. screenings being sold out. “We should take a lot of pride in that — ‘Oppenheimer’ has reversed the ‘Barbenheimer’ trend of ‘Barbie’ being on top,” Roy Kapur says. “All the signs are very positive and I am very optimistic about the next few months as well.”

Some of the big releases lined up for the second half of the year include Shah Rukh Khan’s “Jawan” and “Dunki,” Rajinikanth’s “Jailer,” Sunny Deol’s “Gadar 2,” Prabhas’ “Salaar,” Ranbir Kapoor’s “Animal,” Dhanush’s “Captain” and Dulquer Salmaan’s “King of Kotha.”

Roy Kapur says that despite Indian streamers gaining a massive amount of eyeballs during the pandemic and being eminently affordable, there is a market for smaller films theatrically if they find new, relevant themes, have great music and provide the laughing, crying all-around experience so dear to Indian audiences. “Even with a more limited budget and with actors who are stars but not superstars, you can actually have a return on investment that is very significant,” Roy Kapur says.

The streamers, meanwhile, have kept pace this year with a slew of hits across services including “Kohrra,” “Scoop,” “Dahaad,” “Rocket Boys” Season 2, “Jubilee,” “The Night Manager,” “The Trial,” “Saas, Bahu Aur Flamingo” and “Farzi,” to name a few.

“Creating premium quality streaming content is not something that India ever did before, say, the last five to seven years,” Roy Kapur says. “So, the learning curve has been quite steep. More and more, all those involved in the process have realized, through trial and error, probably, what works and what doesn’t work and have therefore managed to be able to engage audiences with a varied smorgasbord of content.”

He continued, “Zooming out to the streaming versus cinema debate, the beauty about India is that we’re an ‘and’ market, we’re not an ‘or’ market, which means that all modes of delivery of entertainment can grow at the same time, not necessarily at the expense of the other, because we’ve got so much of our population that has not been covered yet.”

Roy Kapur says that India’s young population is moving from below the poverty line into the middle class, which is fueling more people to consume terrestrial television, tech, cable television, streaming, cinemas, radio and print. “It’s all growing simultaneously, at obviously different rates of growth, which you don’t see in the more developed markets. On a macro basis, that is the beauty of the Indian story at this point of time,” Roy Kapur says.

For the immediate future, Roy Kapur has three observations. The increasingly discerning theatrical audience means that stars alone won’t guarantee box office success, forcing creators to innovate. Secondly, the producer hopes that the recently announced anti-piracy measures come into play and can halt the revenue leakage. Lastly, the producer wants consumers to understand the value of content.

Roy Kapur says that while driving down prices attract larger numbers of consumers, the corollary is that increasing prices becomes that much more difficult. “There could be the danger of value erosion in the market, the way that it happened in telephony, the way that it’s happened in so many other areas where a land grab can actually lead to devaluing of an entire market, and that has a ripple effect on the other streams, because once your consumer is trained to pay less for content, that means your subscription numbers are lower, that means you have less money for creation of content, and therefore the value of the industry shrinks, despite your viewership numbers going up. We should be very wary of eroding value in the industry. And we should give a lot of importance to making sure that the consumer is trained to pay for content. And the consumer will then reward good content and not reward bad content,” Roy Kapur says.

Coming up for Roy Kapur Films are war epic “Pippa,” comedies “Bas Karo Aunty!” and “Woh Ladki Hai Kahaan?” and an untitled thriller. Historical series “The Anarchy” is an international co-production with Wiip, and eight more series with directors including Nagraj Manjule, Vishnuvardhan, Mahesh Narayanan, Hardik Mehta, Abbas Tyrewala, Anubhav Chopra, Bhavesh Kapadia and Arati Kadav, spanning genres from historical action to sci-fi and romance, are in development.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2FzaWEvc2lkZGhhcnRoLXJveS1rYXB1ci1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1iYXJiaWUtaW5kaWEtYm94LW9mZmljZS0xMjM1Njg0NzUxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

This week’s report takes a look at box office prospects for Haunted Mansion, Disney’s next IP reimagining slated for release in late July.

The latest tracking updates for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, Barbie, Oppenheimer, and other upcoming releases are featured in the chart below.

Haunted Mansion

Walt Disney Pictures

July 28, 2023 (WIDE)

Opening Weekend Range: $22M-$37M

Domestic Total Range: $73M-$131M

PROS:

Based on the classic theme park attraction at Walt Disney World, Haunted Mansion will have built-in awareness among families that could prove advantageous. Disney’s prior adaptation, The Haunted Mansion with Eddie Murphy, posted $75.9 million in its 2003 domestic run.

A strong ensemble cast and comedic approach are drivers in positive early buzz, with trailers generating healthy online sentiment.

Pre-sales have only begun and will not truly pop until closer to release, but worth nothing is that’s its first day of activity lagged only 11 percent behind Jungle Cruise‘s first day of sales in sample markets.

Minimal direct competition leading into release could elevate demand among family moviegoers.

CONS:

Disney has struggled to recover its full share of the pre-pandemic theatrical audience, due in large part to the company’s brief-but-impactful focus on streaming launches for family titles during the height of Covid-19.

If Barbie manages to take off with women and families beyond its strongly hyped opening weekend, that may put a ceiling on Haunted Mansion‘s ability to soar. The male-driven Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem will also be a factor when it opens one week later on August 2.

Given the dearth of family-friendly titles on the theatrical slate this fall, the argument could be made that this film would be better positioned with a release in September or October when it could benefit from proximity to Halloween.

2023-07-27 17:12:37+00:00,‘Barbenheimer’ is stimulating the economy,“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” have been such blockbuster movies that their impact appears to be showing up in economic statistics.,"New York CNN Business —

“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” have been such blockbuster movies that their impact appears to be showing up in economic statistics.

Bank of America cardholders increased their non-gasoline spending by 1.9% year over year during the week ending July 22, the bank said Thursday.

While spending in many categories fell — including online electronics, home improvement, furniture and lodging — one area is surging: entertainment.

Bank of America cardholders spent 13.2% more on entertainment than a year ago, easily the most out of any category tracked. That is a significant acceleration from the week of July 15, when entertainment spending was up 4.9%.

Earlier in July, entertainment spending was flat to down compared with the year before, according to Bank of America.

In a research report, Bank of America said the increase in spending on entertainment, as well as at clothing stores, was “likely partially driven by the release of the much-anticipated movies, Barbie and Oppenheimer.”

“Barbie” dominated the box office in its debut weekend, raking in $162 million at the domestic box office. The film, distributed by CNN owner Warner Bros. Discovery, was the biggest-ever debut for a female director.

Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” brought in another $82.5 million.

The blockbuster results show how consumers are still spending aggressively in some areas — even as they pull back on goods and elsewhere.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was even asked on Wednesday about how demand for “Barbie” and Taylor Swift concerts is impacting the broader economy.

Powell said the “overall resilience” of the economy, coupled with cooling inflation and rebounding consumer confidence, is a “good thing.”

However, the Fed chair acknowledged that if the economy heats up too much, it could prove problematic for the central bank.

“At the margin, stronger growth could lead, over time, to higher inflation and that would require an appropriate response for monetary policy,” Powell said. “So we’ll be watching that carefully and seeing how it evolves over time.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8yNy9idXNpbmVzcy9iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbW92aWVzLWVjb25vbXkvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBWGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjMvMDcvMjcvYnVzaW5lc3MvYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLW1vdmllcy1lY29ub215L2luZGV4Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,'Sound of Freedom' Has Now Made More Money in U.S. Than Latest 'Indiana Jones' and 'Mission: Impossible',"'Sound of Freedom' director Alejandro Monteverde admitted that ""no one thought that this movie was going to make the box office it’s making; it’s a complete surprise, including to myself'","Sound of Freedom, despite mixed reactions and controversies, has now earned more at the domestic box office than big-budget sequels in the Indiana Jones and Mission: Impossible franchises.

The movie has so far made $174 million in the U.S. since its July 4 release, according to Deadline. That's more than Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny's $172.9 million (released June 30) and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One‘s $160.8 million (released July 12).

Worldwide, Harrison Ford's Dial of Destiny has earned over $375 million, while Tom Cruise's Dead Reckoning Part One has passed $522 million. Sound of Freedom is set to rollout internationally in different territories over the next few months.

For comparison, Variety reported that Sound of Freedom's budget was about $14.5 million, whereas Dead Reckoning and Dial of Destiny cost closer to $300 million each, before an estimated $100 million for marketing.

Sound of Freedom is loosely based on a true story about a man helping rescue children from a human trafficking operation in Colombia. Its star, Passion of the Christ actor Jim Caviezel, has caused controversy for promoting QAnon conspiracy theories while promoting the film on far-right platforms.

Writer/director Alejandro Monteverde has spoken out about the ""heartbreaking"" backlash, saying his views differ from the actor's standpoints.

Disney, which released Lucasfilm's Indiana Jones sequel, at one point owned Sound of Freedom when it purchased Fox back in 2019.

Eventually, though, its producers ""raised a little bit of money and bought the film back,"" Monteverde told Variety. ""Then we were thinking, ‘Okay, let’s go out [and shop it].’ Then COVID. Boom. People were always telling you even before they saw the film, ‘Right now, people want to see uplifting films.' ""

""Then, the Harmon brothers [who founded Angel Studios] came in, and they just had a completely different way of marketing a film that I’ve never seen.""

Angel Studios crowd-funded money for its marketing budget, which it says has now been paid back to those who contributed. It also included an unusual box office tactic: A video with Caviezel at the end of the credits encourages moviegoers to pay it forward by buying more tickets to the movie.

Director Monteverde indicated that he wasn't fully on board with that campaign at first.

""They told me, ‘We’re going to put a video at the end of where Jim will talk. I was like, ‘Arghhhhh.’ I became a pain. And they told me, ‘Alejandro, let us do our work. You have to trust us.’ And we made a deal,"" he said, claiming that the pay-it-forward method added ""under 10 percent"" to its overall box office haul.

About the post-credit pay-it-forward video, he added to the Los Angeles Times, ""Now, if you ask me, 'Alejandro, if it was your [move], would you have that?' I will say no. But that’s why I’m not a distributor. If I was a distributor, I’d surely collapse the company because I’d be all about the art. So I respect and admire the work that Angel Studios does, because it’s not an easy movie to market.""

Questioned about not having fans donate to an organization working against human-trafficking and instead more movie tickets, the filmmaker argued ""awareness [brought by the movie] creates change more than sending $20 to one [organization].""

Monteverde, who started the project in 2015, admitted he didn't think Sound of Freedom was going to be released. Now, he says it has become a ""phenomenon.""

""Nobody, no one, thought that this movie was going to make the box office it’s making. It’s a complete surprise, including to myself,"" he told the LA Times. ""I thought this movie was never going to see the light of day. So I ended up giving away my points. I’m not going to make $1.""

He said the near-$200-million box office performance means Sound of Freedom has transcended to ""become a bipartisan film."" Monteverde added that how the movie does in other markets will truly demonstrate the film's appeal.

""We’re going to see what happens when [it’s released] internationally, because the politics are here. If internationally, we come back with a big price tag, then you can’t deny that,"" he said. ""These same conspiracy theories do not exist in Mexico, Argentina, France, Italy. I’m going to Colombia for the premiere, so I can’t wait to see what’s going to happen. I want to keep it humble. But I’m feeling excited.""

2023-07-28 14:49:12+05:30,How the wave of 'Oppenheimer' and 'Barbie' impacted Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible 7' at the box-office,"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One opened worldwide on July 12 and Oppenheimer and Barbie came out merely nine days later, thus denting the commercial prospects of Cruise's juggernaut","July was a chaotic and crazy month for fans at the movies. Three massively anticipated and budgeted films came out in a space of just nine days. Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One opened worldwide on July 12 and Oppenheimer and Barbie came out on 21. Cruise was expected to sail through the ticket windows but it seems was suffocated, if not entirely chocked and crushed, by the gargantuan two-way clash.

Budget and box-office

Made at a budget of $290 million, Cruise’s film has raked $376.26 million at the worldwide box-office so far. But the cracks began to show even before the two big names stormed the cinemas.

After a globe-trotting publicity blitz by star Tom Cruise, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” launched with a franchise-best $80 million over five days, though it came in shy of industry expectations with a $56.2 million haul over the three-day weekend, according to studio estimates.

The Paramount Pictures debut was boosted by strong overseas sales of $155 million from 70 markets. But while a $235 million worldwide launch marked one of the best global openings of the year, “Dead Reckoning” couldn’t approach the high-speed velocity of last summer’s top film, “Top Gun: Maverick.”

“Dead Reckoning Part One,” the seventh film in the 27-year-old series, had been forecast to better the franchise high of the previous installment, “Fallout,” which opened with $61 million domestically in 2018. Instead, it also fell short of the $57.8 million “Mission: Impossible II” debuted with in 2000.

Challenges during the pandemic

Those costs were inflated, in part, by the pandemic. “Dead Reckoning,” directed by Christopher McQuarrie, was among the first major productions to shut down by COVID-19. It was preparing to shoot in Italy in March 2020. When the film got back on track, McQuarrie and Cruise helped lead the industry-wide recovery back to film sets – albeit with some well-publicized friction over protocols along the way.

Paramount’s distribution chief speaks up

In a statement that came before the July 21 crisis, Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount, said, “This is a global franchise. It’s going gangbusters and its going to play for a long time. Quality always wins in the end.”

“Dead Reckoning,” Aronson said, met or exceeded the studio’s expectations.

“In international markets, in like-for-like markets, we’re 15% ahead of ‘Fallout,’ and that’s taking China out,” added Aronson. “Domestically, we’re over 3% ahead of ‘Fallout’ for the first five days. To beat its predecessor is phenomenal, especially in this environment.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maXJzdHBvc3QuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvaG93LXRoZS13YXZlLW9mLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWFuZC1iYXJiaWUtaW1wYWN0ZWQtdG9tLWNydWlzZXMtbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLTctYXQtdGhlLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtZXhwbGFpbmVkLTEyOTI4ODUyLmh0bWzSAaYBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmlyc3Rwb3N0LmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2hvdy10aGUtd2F2ZS1vZi1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1hbmQtYmFyYmllLWltcGFjdGVkLXRvbS1jcnVpc2VzLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS03LWF0LXRoZS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWV4cGxhaW5lZC0xMjkyODg1Mi5odG1sL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-11 21:30:00+00:00,"Everyone, Calm Down: Summer’s Next Big Three Movies Deserve a Nuanced Response to Their Initial Grosses","Here are some realistic guideposts for analyzing ""Mission: Impossible,"" ""Barbie,"" and ""Oppenheimer"" openings in our box office preview.","Rarely in recent years has so much public attention been riveted on three films opening over a single two-week period. Just as “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” (Paramount) has arrived, and just ahead of the July 21 openings of “Barbie” (Warner Bros. Discovery) and “Oppenheimer” (Universal), hopes for three distinct films changing the trajectory for the summer are sky-high.

Ahead of the initial reports on “Mission: Impossible” results from pre-Wednesday previews, here’s a film-by-film analysis of the opportunities and challenges for each film, as well as their combined potential for theaters.

“Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One”

Two things to note ahead: The pre-marketing cost on this latest sequel has been reported as $290 million, triple both of the previous two films in the “Mission: Impossible” franchise. And you might have noticed the marketing? Not cheap either.

Then, there are the expectations. Anything less than the biggest film of the summer (“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” is heading to close to $400 million) or even the year (“The Super Mario Bros. Movie” $574 million) might seem disappointing.

That’s unfair and unrealistic. That potential certainly exists, but so do impediments.

The consistent appeal of this franchise since 1996 (as well as its consistent quality) is evident. The first two, ranked #3 for their years, were the high mark. “Fallout,” the most recent, was #8 for 2018, with an adjusted domestic gross of around $250 million.

This summer has consistently shown multiple franchise titles falling short of high-end expectations (“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” being the nadir). “Fast X” was a disappointment. Both “Dial of Destiny” and “Fast X” will end up around $150 million, which is not acceptable for $300 million or higher-cost titles. But could lesser sequel resistance be a factor here?

Though past films have overcome this, “Mission: Impossible” is the first half of a two-part story. That could impact reactions, thanks to an ending that, by all accounts, only whets the appetite for more.

“Mission: Impossible” also faces the issue of limited playtime in premium theaters, as well as second-weekend competition from both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.” A handful of films this summer (“Spider-Verse,” “The Little Mermaid,” “Elemental”) have sustained strong holds, but the norm this year has been quick falloffs.

On the plus side, this is getting initially strong reviews (81 Metacritic score as of now, second best to 86 for “Fallout”) and comes off the goodwill Cruise created with last summer’s smash hit “Top Gun: Maverick.” That alone should help elevate it.

Domestic returns are important, but any response to the film’s grosses should be more on the international side, both because of precedent (the previous two films’ take came from less than 30 percent domestic) but also because foreign share has been cratering recently for some high-budget films (“Dial of Destiny” and “Little Mermaid” were both around 50 percent). Pre-COVID, “normal” was a film like this to do two-thirds or more business overseas.

The good news is “Fast X” was 79 percent. The “Mission: Impossible” films overlap with the “Fast” and James Bond films as established, high-end action series known for spectacular stunts and worldwide settings. “No Time to Die,” similarly, was 79 percent foreign. That means domestic response will be less critical to overall success.

Paramount is pushing all the buttons to maximize the gross. A Wednesday opening, plus three different sets of previews that started more limited (Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday) will produce a higher gross than just the normal Friday start. And the hope is that initial positive response make the weekend bigger.

Margot Robbie as “Barbie” Warner Bros.

“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer”

These are two significant non-franchise titles in the heart of the summer, both costing around $100 million, both from previously acclaimed directors, with both hoping to receive both critical and popular positive response to propel them beyond the pre-release appeal the films already have.

The awareness for “Barbie” has been sky-high since production was announced. That sort of interest is tricky to maintain. The marketing has not faltered through its one-showing premiere last Sunday.

Like “Oppenheimer,” it faces challenges. It’s not what a four-quadrant movie (its appeal initially is skewing more female). It’s a comedy, with a tricky path to find the right balance.

It also has in Greta Gerwig a director whose “Lady Bird” and “Little Women” both surpassed expectations, and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as leads, and of course familiarity with the iconic dolls. And its originality might actually be an asset as audiences get more resistant to retreads.

“Oppenheimer” with Christopher Nolan directing (of course, a huge part of its draw) has likewise been in the spotlight since announced. As a biopic about a scientist, partially in black and white, 180 minutes, it’s not normal summer wide-release fare.

Nolan has smartly positioned the film as a visual experience. His previous films have emphasized premium formats, and the curiosity about how the spectacular power of atomic explosions are conveyed in state-of-the-art technology is high with this one.

“Dunkirk” Warner Bros/Kobal/Shutterstock

His previous World War II-set “Dunkirk,” also released in July, was a success with adjusted grosses of around $200 million domestic/$600 million worldwide. It had the advantage of military action (a draw for older male audiences who rarely go to theaters). The appeal of the subject matter is less clear here. Apart from what promises to be a sensory experience, Nolan’s reputation and the expectation of top-level reviews add interest.

The two films will follow different paths.

“Barbie” might open to double “Oppenheimer” (perhaps $100 million to $50 million), but if those are the figures, that’s parallel success. “Barbie” should have a heavier domestic share, while Nolan has generally approached two-thirds foreign. “Oppenheimer” is handicapped by its length, combined with strong interest in seeing it on premium screens. That will limit seating initially (similar to “Avatar: The Way of Water”), but assuming it sustains interest, it could see a strong multiple. (“Dunkirk” got to $188 million from a $50 million opening weekend, less burdened by initial limitations and competition.)

The Stakes for the Summer and Beyond

Theaters need money into the till and fast. The range of suggested expectations ($300 million domestic for “Mission: Impossible,” $200 million for the other two) should be enough to improve the current situation. Last July saw a domestic gross of $1.134 billion. At those levels, combined with other films, $1.2 billion (best month since 2019) is doable.

Both “Mission: Impossible” and “Barbie” have the strongest upsides during the months above these levels (“Oppenheimer,” again, perhaps more over a longer period). If either or both overperform and push the total higher, it would be a clear win for theaters.

And over-performance by “Mission: Impossible” would provide relief that franchise fatigue can be overcome with a smart production. For “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” success would encourage more non-franchise top-end pictures, as well as deeper trust in proven creative directors like Nolan and Gerwig.

But the risk that one or more of them does less than expected also exists. Four years into the COVID-impact experience, it’s not getting any easier.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItYm94LW9mZmljZS1wcmV2aWV3LTEyMzQ4ODIzMzEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The summer movie season’s final weeks are upon us, with less than a handful of major studio releases remaining on the slate before Labor Day. This weekend, two of them will make a play to temporarily outrank the reigning blockbusters atop the box office.

Blue Beetle

Warner Bros. Pictures

August 18, 2023 (WIDE)

Opening Weekend Range: $22M-$32M

PROS:

The core DC fan base and potential to over-index among Hispanic families could help Blue Beetle come in slightly above what have until recently been bearish tracking ranges. The title character having low prior exposure among audiences means the film should be less front-loaded than the likes of The Flash and Shazam! Fury of the Gods earlier this year.

Strays will counter as an R-rated comedy, with a voice cast lead by Will Ferrell and Jamie Foxx. As the first bona fide comedy to open since Barbie, there remains some sleeper potential a la fellow August openers Good Boys (2019) and Sausage Party (2016).

Barbie and Oppenheimer will remain mostly uncontested for each one’s primary audience in their fifth weekend of release, with some caveats (noted below).

Strays

Universal Pictures

August 18, 2023 (WIDE)

Opening Weekend Range: $11M-$18M

CONS:

Without clear hooks, superhero films are enduring some regression at the box office, and Blue Beetle‘s pre-sales currently trail those of the Shazam! sequel. The staying power of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem could also be a minor factor in limiting family turnout, as could be the start of the school year, with 30 percent of K-12 students back in class as of this Friday (up from 19 percent on August 4).

Strays‘ marketing impact has left something to be desired, perhaps exemplified in pre-sale trends that lag behind fellow R-rated comedies No Hard Feelings and Cocaine Bear.

With a family-friendly film and an adult-centric comedy opening this weekend, Barbie might stand to face slight audience runoff. Oppenheimer, meanwhile, will shed its exclusive Imax footprint to Blue Beetle. The Christopher Nolan film earned an estimated 30 percent of its fourth frame gross from Imax venues alone, meaning week-to-week declines will become slightly inflated for a brief period of time.

Current projection ranges call for a 48% increase from the comparable weekend’s top ten aggregate of $69.3 million in 2022 and a 1% increase from 2019’s $101.9 million.

2023-08-06 19:18:47+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Meg 2’ Swims to $112 Million Overseas, ‘Oppenheimer’ Hits $550 Million Globally","""Meg 2: The Trench"" is swimming to $112 million in its international box office debut, bringing its global total to $142 million.","“Meg 2: The Trench,” the second Jason Statham-led shark thriller, is swimming to $112 million in its international box office debut, bringing its global total to $142 million.

It’s a strong start for the $130 million-budgeted film, which was co-financed by Warner Bros. and China Media Capital. Like the original, 2018’s “The Meg,” which earned nearly 73% of its $530 million worldwide tally from the foreign box office, the sequel will rely on overseas audiences to propel the film to profitability.

China was the top territory for “Meg 2” with $53.3 million, followed by Mexico with $7.6 million and the United Kingdom with $5.1 million. In North America, the poorly reviewed “The Trench” opened in second place with $30 million, a decent opening, albeit one that’s significantly below the original’s domestic debut of $45 million.

Overall, it was a weekend of global box office milestones as “Barbie” crossed the coveted $1 billion mark and “Oppenheimer” glided past $500 million.

Greta Gerwig’s fantasy-comedy “Barbie” joined the billion-dollar club after just 17 days on the big screen. It’s the fastest Warner Bros. release (and eighth in the studio’s 100-year history) to surpass $1 billion, besting the 19 days it took “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.” This also makes Gerwig the first-ever solo female filmmaker with a billion-dollar film.

“Barbie” collected $74 million over the weekend, bringing its international total to a sizable $572 million. The biggest international markets are the U.K. and Ireland ($87.9 million), Mexico ($48.9 million), Australia ($41.1 million) and Brazil ($39.5 million).

Christopher Nolan’s dark historical drama “Oppenheimer,” also in its third weekend of release, has hit $552.9 million worldwide. Imax has accounted for a remarkable $114.2 million (22%) of the film’s worldwide total.

The R-rated movie, which stars Cillian Murphy as the scientist who led development on the atomic bomb that helped to end the second world war, added $52 million from 78 foreign territories over the weekend for an overseas total of $324 million.

Now, it stands as Nolan’s fifth-biggest release ahead of “Dunkirk” ($530 million), as well as the highest-grossing World War II movie of all time. “Oppenheimer” is also one of four biographical films to reach the $500 million mark, according to Universal, joining “Bohemian Rhapsody,” “The Passion of the Christ” and “American Sniper.”

Elsewhere at the box office, Sony and Blumhouse’s “Insidious: The Red Door” has amassed $182.5 million worldwide, including $100 million overseas. It became the highest-grossing horror film of the year, overtaking Universal’s sensation “M3GAN” ($180 million).",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL2JveC1vZmZpY2Utb3BwZW5oZWltZXItNTUwLW1pbGxpb24tbWlsZXN0b25lLW1lZy0yLW9wZW5pbmctd2Vla2VuZC1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLTEyMzU2ODg5Mzgv0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYm94LW9mZmljZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci01NTAtbWlsbGlvbi1taWxlc3RvbmUtbWVnLTItb3BlbmluZy13ZWVrZW5kLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtMTIzNTY4ODkzOC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

With the summer movie season currently in full swing, this week’s update brings us through to August with the releases of Meg 2: The Trench and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.

In addition, this week’s long range forecast offers a significant update on Warner Bros.’ Barbie, listed in the table below. Pre-sales for the highly anticipated adaptation continue to impress, leading The Little Mermaid by a significant margin and comparing favorably to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 at the same point prior to release. Barbie’s head-to-head box office opening with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer continues to drive intense social media engagement for both films.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem

Paramount Pictures

August 2, 2023 (WIDE)

3-Day Opening Weekend Range: $27M-$36M

5-Day Opening Weekend Range: $37M-$49M

Domestic Total Range: $101M-$145M

PROS:

The Turtles brand has been successfully reinvented and reintroduced to modern youngsters a few times since its inception in the 1980s, most recently with the 2014 and 2016 live action box office hits. Nostalgia is also a factor here, as older fans are a key driver of interest in this new entry.

Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, with their production studio Point Grey Pictures, have a solid track record of box office success in recent years, with Good Boys, Sausage Party, and other films. The expectation here is that the creative team will execute a blend of modern and classic sensibilities with an eye towards ensuring the franchise’s endurance.

The absence of any other late summer animated options—or, for that matter, films catering to young males—puts this film in a strong position during the dog days of the season before school starts again. The use of an edgier animation style that embraces 2D and 3D to produce a comic book aesthetic, comparable to Sony’s Spider-Verse films, could further help Mutant Mayhem stand out with fans and young audiences.

CONS:

As seen with last summer’s DC League of Super-Pets, not all animated wide releases based on IP succeed at the box office. Turtles will need to stand out beyond its fan base and generate positive word of mouth to live up to its potential, especially in the wake of several aging franchises underperforming so far this summer.

Premium screen space could still be hard to come by, with other summer releases—like Oppenheimer and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning—hoping to regain some of those auditoriums in their chase weeks.

If Disney’s Haunted Mansion breaks out, Turtles could have more competition than it hoped for.

Meg 2: The Trench

Warner Bros. Pictures

August 4, 2023 (WIDE)

Opening Weekend Range: $26M-$35M

Domestic Total Range: $70M-$105M

PROS:

The first Meg was a sleeper box office hit, opening to $45.4 million and legging out to $145.5 million domestically five summers ago.

The return of Jason Statham should assure the return of both his own fans and those who enjoyed the original.

Meg 2, like its predecessor, is well-positioned in the final weeks of summer movie season. An expected premium screen presence should also give it a boost.

CONS:

Competition could be notable this time around with the aforementioned appeal of Turtles to male audiences of varying ages, plus the potential staying power of other July releases. Titles such as Gran Turismo, The Last Voyage of the Demeter, Blue Beetle, and Strays will aim to get some of Meg 2‘s male moviegoers throughout August.

Historically, and particularly in recent memory, action sequels such as Meg 2 have not always lived up to their predecessors’ box office performances.

,Barbenheimer or Oppenharbie: Twitterati go WILD over upcoming Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan box office showdown,"The upcoming release of Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" and Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" has created a viral stir on social media, with fans taking sides","The box office showdown between Greta Gerwig 's "" Barbie "" and Christopher Nolan 's "" Oppenheimer "" all started with a date: July 21.It's not uncommon for studios to counterprogram films in different genres on a big weekend, but the stark differences between an intense, serious-minded picture about the man who oversaw the development of the atomic bomb and a lighthearted, candy-coloured anthropomorphizing of a childhood doll quickly became the stuff of viral fodder.Twitter has been flooded with fan-art that brings together Margot Robbie and Cillian Murphy in epic fusion posters titled ' Barbenheimer '.There's even some disagreement over whether it's ""Barbieheimer"" or ""Barbenheimer"" or ""Boppenheimer"" or yet another tortured portmanteau - a phenomenon on which the Stylebook has yet to offer guidance, but for the purposes of this article will be ""Barbenheimer.""It didn't hurt that both Nolan and Gerwig have very passionate and very online fandoms eager to join in. Both movies often trend on social media when the other releases a new asset - a trailer, a picture, an interview. On one level, it's a marketing department's dream. Awareness could not be higher, the conversation couldn't be louder, and neither film even has official reviews out yet.""'Barbenheimer' is a marketing gift borne out of social media and I think it's benefiting both films,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for analytics firm Comscore. ""You're certainly aware of both movies in a more profound and compelling way than I think might have otherwise happened had they been released on different weekends.""AMC Theaters reported that 20,000 of its AMC Stubs members had purchased tickets for a double feature. If you're counting, that's 294 minutes of movie watching. Even Margot Robbie - Barbie herself - and Tom Cruise , the star of another summer blockbuster, have started plotting the ideal ""Barbenheimer"" day.""It's a perfect double bill,"" said Robbie at her movie's London premiere Wednesday. ""I think actually start your day with 'Barbie,' then go straight into 'Oppenheimer' and then a 'Barbie' chaser.""Over the past weeks, leading up to the highly anticipated release, fans have not been picking their film to watch over the weekend, but rather, which one to watch first. Some have resolved to watch both movies on the same day, let alone the weekend.""it's only barbenheimer if you're seeing barbie first, otherwise it's oppenharbie,"" a fan debated on Twitter.""F**k astrology are you a Barbenheimer (watching Barbie before Oppenheimer) or an Oppenharbie (watching Barbie after Oppenheimer), it says a lot about a person,"" wrote a fan.Debating on what to watch first, one tweeted, ""You have to see Oppenheimer first. This is because Barbie lives in the world that Oppenheimer built.""""I’m gonna do Oppenheimer first cause I think it’s longer and definitely gonna be more depressing then to wash the sadness and probable stress I will watch Barbie which most likely and hopefully make me feel joy and calmness,"" wrote a fan in a tweet.While another argued, ""If you're watching them on the same day I think Oppenheimer cause it's a more serious and long movie so if you pick it as a second watch you could get bored/tired 😶 and if Barbie is second it will def lighten up your mood after Oppenheimer cause it's more fun.""Cruise - whose ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" opened a little over a week before the ""Barbenheimer"" showdown - said at his premiere he'd plan to see both on their opening day, likely starting with ""Oppenheimer,"" which seems to be the internet's preferred viewing order as well.""Barbie"" actor Issa Rae thinks there's a reason for that. ""I think that there's a very specific order that if you see them in. If you see 'Oppenheimer' last then you might be a bit of a psychopath,"" she diagnosed at the London premiere.The showdown has made armchair marketing experts out of everyone, quick to scrutinize every move by Warner Bros. and Universal - as though it's possible to compare two extraordinarily different campaigns.One has infinite opportunities for very pink, sparkly photo opportunities, whimsical brand partnerships for seemingly everything from underwear to pool floats, large-scale fan events with autograph signings and pop stars like Billie Eilish posting about the soundtrack. In other words, the ""Barbie"" campaign can go nuclear.""Oppenheimer"" has the bomb, the alluring mystery and the big screen hook, but it's not the kind of movie that lends itself to, say, a frozen yogurt collaboration.Is the competition real, though, or just a meme? Some in Hollywood wondered if Warner Bros. plopped ""Barbie"" on the weekend as a slight to Nolan, who had opened many films for the studio in that corridor including ""Inception"" and ""Dunkirk."" He left Warner Bros. amid its controversial decision to send a year's worth of movies to streaming and made ""Oppenheimer"" with Universal instead. But a pointed box office war doesn't exactly make sense for a studio that has talked recently about wanting to lure Nolan back.There is an unspoken code of conduct: Never badmouth another studio's film, publicly at least. This is partly decorum, especially when it comes to ""box office showdowns"" which all will say are a creation of the press and sideline spectators. But it's also rooted in some truth: The conventional thinking is that having eyes on one movie is good for other movies - you see their posters and trailers and on some level everyone benefits.And social media has allowed movie stars to get in on the game, too. Following reports that Cruise was irked the latest ""Mission: Impossible"" was going to lose its IMAX screens to ""Oppenheimer"" after only a week, Cruise posted photos of himself and director Christopher McQuarrie standing in front of posters for ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"" ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer,"" holding tickets for each.""This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theatres. These are just a few that we can't wait to see on the big screen,"" Cruise's Instagram caption read.The official accounts for ""Indiana Jones,"" ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" responded with supportive notes. Gerwig and Robbie even followed with a similar photo series a few days later, which the official ""Oppenheimer"" Instagram account reposted in its stories. Charged with playing Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy told the AP at his movie's London premiere that ""of course"" he'd be seeing ""Barbie."" The sporting cross-promotion between four studios - Universal, Warner Bros., Disney and Paramount - is something the film business has not quite seen before.""Not only is Tom Cruise the biggest box office star in the world, but he's also an incredible ambassador for the movie theatre, for the movie theatre experience and boosting other movies,"" Dergarabedian said. ""And that collegial atmosphere within the framework of what is seen as the very competitive box office derby is kind of a nice thing.""Still, everyone likes a No. 1 debut, and both ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" reportedly carry $100 million production price tags (not including the millions spent on marketing). As far as box office tracking goes, ""Barbie"" has it in the bag with forecasts showing that it could open above $90 million in North America. ""Oppenheimer"" meanwhile is tracking in the $40 million range. Then there's the wild card of ""Mission: Impossible 7's"" second weekend, which could snag second place.Still even with a second- or third-place start, ""Oppenheimer"" could be destined for a long, steady, profitable run into awards season. Adult audiences for R-rated movies are not often the ones who pack theatres the first weekend.Back in 2008, in the midst of the recession, Warner Bros. and Universal faced off on the same July weekend with another Nolan film that went up against a lighthearted confection: ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Mamma Mia!"" - both of which went on to be enormously profitable (though Nolan did win the first weekend).The bigger worry is that what's been heralded as Hollywood's post-pandemic comeback summer has had more ups and downs than anyone might have hoped. That's putting quite a bit of pressure on ""Barbenheimer"" to overperform and boost the lagging summer box office, which pales in comparison to the bigger issues facing the industry as actors join the writers on strike.But with just over a week to go, it's still a source of amusement. Even ""Barbie"" co-star Will Ferrell threw the gauntlet in his winking way at the London premiere. ""I think the world maybe wants to see 'Barbie' a little bit more right now,"" Ferrell said. ""Just saying!""",https://news.google.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?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-19 20:00:00+00:00,‘Barbie’ Will Crown Greta Gerwig as the Newest Box-Office Savior,Gerwig joins Tom Cruise and Christopher Nolan in providing a film that electrifies the public's enthusiasm for movie theaters.,"It would be a a first for this summer — a highly touted #1 opener that greatly exceeds projections.

Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” (Warner Bros. Discovery) is already tracking for a $100 million start and per industry sources it has a chance to reach as high as $150 million initially. That’s based on presales, with the backing of strong reviews and a PR blitzkrieg that’s kickstarted organic interest.

We’re witnessing a unique, two-week confluence of three titles that have been hyped for years with the just-opened “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” (Paramount) and now Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” (Universal) and “Barbie.” It provides theaters with excitement and anticipation more than any other event in recent years. “Mission: Impossible” and “Oppenheimer” speak to presentation’s unique ability to elevate certain films, while “Barbie” is a comedy and a shared celebration of an iconic symbol — a stellar example of the community experience theaters offer.

Combined, the three films (along with the momentum for “Sound of Freedom”) will result in the biggest weekend this year. All credit to Cruise, Gerwig, and Nolan for coming into play just as the summer faced implosion.

Nolan and Cruise are used to the theatrical-savior moniker; to their clan, we can add Gerwig. She’s poised for the best opening of the three, perhaps by some margin, and it will likely be the biggest grosser as well.

“Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning — Part One” Paramount

“Mission: Impossible ” should be close to $100 million IN U.S./Canada through Thursday, after nine days. With the loss of premium theaters to “Oppenheimer” and competition ahead, it should reach at least $200 million. It likely will likely double that in foreign gross. It deserves credit for providing a satisfied, excited audience ahead of two other major releases.

Nolan’s claim to savior status came from his insistence that “Tenet” be released in September 2021 when many theaters were still closed, and then with extended theatrical exclusivity. It eked out $58 million in the U.S./Canada and got to $365 million worldwide. Its $200 million expense before marketing made it a likely loss, but the benefits to struggling theaters were immense.

On paper, “Oppenheimer” is the least commercial of any Nolan film since “Insomnia.” A three-hour, partially black-and-white biopic starring Cillian Murphy is a risk, even before its $100 million pre-marketing budget. Credit to Nolan for making an unlikely original title so interesting to a sizeable public, and for using his technical preferences (70mm IMAX production) to corral most premium screens and convince many viewers to seek out higher-priced locations.

“Oppenheimer” Universal/screenshot

This might be a double-edged sword: the opening-weekend gross might be curbed by the limited seats and fewer showtimes. That means audience reaction, even more than strong reviews, will play a big role in whether this becomes a significant success. Consensus suggests a $50 million opening. “Avatar: The Way of Water,” similarly limited, but not remotely with similar competition, grossed $134 million.

Then there’s “Barbie.” The precedent here is “The Super Mario Bros. Movie.” They are significantly different — “Mario” is animated, aimed at younger audiences, and didn’t get good reviews — but they’re both comedies (a genre that’s lagged in theaters), very famous fantasy figures who have attracted fans for decades, and offer a significant nostalgia factor. Add to this the star duo of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, a rising-star director, and strong reviews.

All of these films may benefit from coming out after a disappointing summer when too many titles fell short in their openings, or fell quicker than expected. What’s been missing is that one film that gets the public really excited.

At least one of these, and possibly more, should fit the bill. That three appear simultaneously ultimately is the best news for theaters.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL2JhcmJpZS1ncmV0YS1nZXJ3aWctbmV3ZXN0LWJveC1vZmZpY2Utc2F2aW9yLTEyMzQ4ODU3NDMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-12 16:49:42+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Last Voyage of the Demeter’ Sinking After $2.6 Million Opening Day, ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ Sail On","The Dracula horror movie ""Last Voyage of the Demeter"" is projecting a meagre $6.5 million opening as ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" stay on top.","“The Last Voyage of the Demeter,” a new period horror film set aboard a merchant ship, is capsizing in its debut at the domestic box office amid the ongoing success of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.”

The Universal release — the studio’s second stab this year at a Dracula film after the action-comedy “Renfield” bombed in the spring — is facing some choppy waters after earning $2.62 million on its opening day from 2,715 locations, a figure that includes $750,000 in Thursday previews. “The Last Voyage of the Demeter” is projecting a fifth-place debut and a mere $6.5 million gross for its three-day opening weekend.

Nothing really says the summer blockbuster season is winding down like an anachronistic genre picture meeting a swift end in its debut. Even with a production budget totaling only $45 million — a moderate figure for a period spectacle — it’ll likely be difficult for “The Last Voyage” to be a theatrical success. Reviews have been meager, turning in a 27% approval rating from top critics on aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences don’t really dig the film either, with Cinema Score’s survey of early ticket buyers leading to a mediocre “B-” grade.

Based on a chapter of Bram Stoker’s “Dracula,” “The Last Voyage of the Demeter” tells the story of a merchant ship and its crew, who find themselves at the mercy of a vampire who has snowed away. Directed by André Øvredal (“Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark”), the film stars Corey Hawkins, Aisling Franciosi, Liam Cunningham and David Dastmalchian.

It’s still a “Barbie” world at the box office, as rivals project the fantasy comedy added $31.4 million from 4,178 locations in its fourth weekend of release, down just 41% from its prior frame. Warner Bros. has yet to send numbers for Friday.

Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” surpassed $1 billion last week at the global box office, making Gerwig the first-ever solo female filmmaker with a billion-dollar movie. Starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the hot-pink comedy crossed the $500 million mark domestically on Friday and is expected to become the top-grossing Warner Bros. release of all time in North America, unadjusted for inflation. “The Dark Knight” currently holds the record at $534 million.

Meanwhile, Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” added $5.1 million from 3,761 theaters on Friday, a decline of 39% from last weekend. The Universal biographical drama is projecting $17.2 million for the weekend, which would be down 41% from its previous outing, bringing domestic ticket sales of $262 million.

In third place, Paramount Pictures’ “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” earned $4 million from 3,950 locations on its second Friday, a decline of 56% from its debut. The animated feature, produced by Nickelodeon Movies and Point Grey Productions, is tracking for a $14.6 million three-day weekend, leading to a domestic total north of $71.6 million.

“Meg 2: The Trench” isn’t making huge waves at the domestic box office, as rivals project only $11.8 million from 3,604 theaters for its second outing. That’d be down a hefty 60% from its $30 million opening weekend, which was already a significant drop from the 2018 original’s $45 million domestic debut.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvbGFzdC12b3lhZ2UtZGVtZXRlci1vcGVuaW5nLWRheS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItMTIzNTY5NDI1OC_SAWtodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL2xhc3Qtdm95YWdlLWRlbWV0ZXItb3BlbmluZy1kYXktYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLTEyMzU2OTQyNTgvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-18 20:03:50+00:00,Summer Box Office Results Show The Movie Business Is Cyclical – Deadline,"Over the past 20 years, much in Hollywood has changed -- but a summer box office comparison between 2003 and 2023 shows some remarkable similarities.","Editor’s note: Dade Hayes and Jonathan Bing are co-authors of Open Wide: How Hollywood Box-Office Became a National Obsession. Hayes is Deadline’s Business Editor and Bing is Chief Communications Officer at Vice Media Group.

The more things change, the more the Hollywood studios stay the same. At least that’s one of the surprising lessons of Barbenheimer, Sound of Freedom, Indiana Jones 5, Mission: Impossible 7, Fast and the Furious 10, and the other big-budget summer box office bets trying to help the movie business pull off a historic comeback.

Twenty years ago, we wrote a book, Open Wide, about a battle at the multiplex on the weekend of July 4, 2003, for the hearts, minds and dollars of the American public. In some respects, nothing has changed. The showdown that July weekend two decades ago pitted pink against black, and a sparkly self-actualized blond heroine against a grim avatar of thermonuclear war. It wasn’t Margot Robbie and Barbie vs. Cillian Murphy and Oppenheimer, though. It was Reese Witherspoon as Elle Woods in Legally Blonde 2 vs. Arnold Schwarzenegger in his last appearance as the Terminator before becoming the governor of California.

Terminator 3 opened at the top of the box office that weekend. But like this year, the summer of 2003 was a summer dominated by sequels – Tomb Raider 2, Charlie’s Angels 2, Spy Kids 3, Dumb and Dumberer, 2 Fast and 2 Furious and The Matrix Revolutions. Most of these failed to catch fire with the public, prompting hand-wringing from media observers (ourselves included) that the theatrical film business was in steep decline. Hollywood was barreling down an unsustainable path, the argument went, as spiraling marketing costs failed to compensate for a lack of original ideas and the pursuit of bigger and bigger opening weekends left little space at the multiplex for any movie that depended on old-fashioned word of mouth to find an audience.

Today, the complaints about the movie business are much the same. “Hollywood has never been known for overestimating the audience’s intelligence,” Inkoo Kang recently wrote in the New Yorker, “but it’s hard not to wonder how it is supposed to be inculcating a love of cinema in children – that is, future moviegoers – when the splashiest films on offer are explicitly buckets of regurgitation.”

As we take stock of the latest summer movie season, it’s hard not to feel a strong sense of déjà vu. This summer, once again, entertainment pundits are scratching their heads about a massive, out-of-nowhere hit, Sound of Freedom, released not by the major studios but by tiny Angel Studios. The film arrived in theaters with a novel marketing twist: In a video that plays over the credits, star Jim Caveziel implores moviegoers to “pay it forward” by purchasing multiple tickets so that other people can see it. “We don’t have big studio money to market this movie,” he says, “but we have you.”

‘Sound Of Freedom’ Everett Collection

But wait, haven’t we seen this movie – also starring Jim Caveziel – before? Nearly 20 years ago, there was The Passion of the Christ, with its unconventional distribution plan outside the mainstream system and fervid following among conservative and religious audiences in America’s heartland. And well before that was Billy Jack – the biggest box office hit of 1973 – a vigilante story about an ass-kicking Green Beret trying to protect kids at a rural school and an unconventional release strategy (its producer, director and star Tom Laughlin sued Warner Bros to get the film back and “four-walled” it in hundreds of theaters backed by a flurry of TV ads, a then-innovative idea that paved the way for today’s saturation marketing plans.

The movie business is cyclical — more than people often like to admit. In writing Open Wide, we discovered that the earliest summer blockbusters weren’t Jaws and Star Wars, as the conventional wisdom has it, but 1950s B-movies that captured the spirit of the early atomic age as radiated monsters in movies like Them! and The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, trouncing across cities on thousands of drive-in and B-movie screens nationwide. The studios today often get criticized for their creative bankruptcy and their “take the money and run” release strategies designed to collect the biggest, fastest box office return before anyone realizes they’re selling a bill of goods. But that strategy is as old as showbiz itself. As Joseph E. Levine, producer of 1958’s Hercules, The Graduate and The Producers, once said, “You can fool the American public all the time if the marketing is right and the budget is big enough.”

The stakes today are higher than ever, between dual strikes, which have paralyzed Hollywood; the digital revolution, which has seen streamers prioritize volume over originality and sent the studios barreling over a cliff trying to charm Wall Street with their own streaming upstarts; and an exhibition industry still reeling from Covid and an increasing abundance of other options for families looking to entertain themselves on the weekend. And how about some original movie ideas? Everybody loves those, sure, but how to fund them when the studio’s parent company is tens of billions in debt and more desperate than ever to cut costs? Under these circumstances, it’s easier than ever to green-light a sequel to a property that has succeeded in the past. As Ted Hope aptly put it at a recent film festival, “You cannot rely on what has worked before, but when you sit down with any buyer of a corporation, that is still 100% what they’re thinking.”

Barbie, which had one of the most profitable opening weekends in the history of the movie business en route to becoming the biggest domestic hit in the 100-year history of Warner Bros, may be the exception that proves the rule. Ultimately, Barbie may be based on a toy but it doesn’t have that much in common with the mostly forgotten sequels of 2003. Perhaps a better analogy is the top summer blockbuster of 2003, Finding Nemo, a wildly imaginative, entirely original story which burst into theaters with a series of ads that riffed on Jaws with images of Bruce the Shark positioning it as the movie to see that summer. It’s certainly a healthy reminder that the cultural watershed that is Barbenheimer, the anti-Hollywood marketing of Sound of Freedom, and the parade of largely disappointing sequels that failed to live up to the hype aren’t exactly new. Next summer (which could play out against an even more consequential sequel – the 2024 presidential race) may well look much the same.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvc3VtbWVyLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWhvbGx5d29vZC1tb3ZpZS1idXNpbmVzcy0xMjM1NTIyNTkyL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvc3VtbWVyLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWhvbGx5d29vZC1tb3ZpZS1idXNpbmVzcy0xMjM1NTIyNTkyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-20 15:04:00+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’ Lands At $25M+; ‘Strays’ Goes To The Dogs With $8M+ – Sunday Box Office Update,Blue Beetle is expected to take the weekend with $28M-$32M and knock off Barbie in its fifth weekend in the No. 1 spot.,"Sunday AM: Writethru after Saturday AM Post Even though this weekend’s new entries – Warner Bros/DC’s Blue Beetle and Universal’s Strays – aren’t coming in at the top of their projections, with respective lower weekends of $25.4M and $8.3M, the overall health of the theatrical business is still in good shape. It’s being further bolstered by the fifth weekends of Barbie ($21.5M) and Oppenheimer ($10.6M), which are fueling an estimated $100.7M weekend that’s +28% over the same August frame a year ago. That was a dry spell, led by CrunchyRoll’s Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero ($21.1M).

It remains to be seen what the toll will be on today’s box office in Los Angeles from the onset of Hurricane Hilary. If it’s heavy rains, no one is going out. Blue Beetle is currently overperforming in LA.

Seriously, this weekend could have seen the subtraction of Blue Beetle because ofthe SAG-AFTRA strike. Warner Bros. kept the movie on track and the marketplace is $25M richer.

‘Blue Beetle’ hits theaters August 18 Warner Bros.

After making $10M on Friday, Blue Beetle eased 15% on Saturday for $8.5M; which indicates front-loading. According to ComScore, more kids returned to school on Friday, with those K-12 off at 46% versus a week prior, which was 70%. EntTelligence reports 2 million admissions for Blue Beetle, repping 23% of the weekend’s foot traffic vs. Barbie, which pulled in 19% of the weekend’s admissions.

Why the under-delivery here on Blue Beetle? Even at $30M, that isn’t a big enough start for this $104M production. The movie gets a B+ CinemaScore overall, which explains it all. Under 18 on CinemaScore gave it an A. Grades were better on Comscore/Screen Engine’s PostTrak, where the movie gets a 90% with Latino and Hispanic moviegoers, who led the charge at 39% to Caucasians’ 27% turnout and 75% grade.

‘Spy Kids,’ 2001 Everett

However, the result here for Blue Beetle isn’t shocking next to other Latino and Hispanic fueled action pics, i.e. Alita: Battle Angel ($28.5M 3-day), Spy Kids ($26.5M), and the R-rated Once Upon a Time in Mexico ($23.4M) — all unadjusted for inflation.

Why wasn’t this movie even strutted at San Diego Comic-Con? In a perfect world, without a SAG-AFTRA strike, it would have been with Cobra Kai star Xolo Maridueña and Blue Beetle‘s cast spreading the gospel on the film, much like Gal Gadot on the first Wonder Woman.

There was buzz that Warners had Hall H cobooked with Legendary for a Blue Beetle-Dune: Part Two combo. But still, even sans stars, how much does it cost for a studio to rent two movie auditoriums, popcorn and soda, and two-night hotel accommodations for a director so that the movie can be shown off to fans and screamed across social media? Warners opted to focus more of their marketing on the Latino and Hispanic marketplace (during early August, iSpot saw that Univision was pulling in a bulk of the ad impressions on Blue Beetle at 11%, with studio spending on such shows as Eternamente amándonos (2.6%).

Social media stat firm RelishMix says that Blue Beetle‘s social media reach of 462.5M across Facebook, Twitter/X, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok are 14% under superhero genre norms. Heck, the social media reach of The Flash was higher at 670.5M. Still, RelishMix says that “the cast has handed over buzz-making duties to fans, who have posted and re-posted materials at a rate of 81:1 on YouTube and 137K fans on official pages.”

In addition, much like what we saw with Shazam: Fury of the Gods, which crashed with a $30M start, the loudspeaker of the new DC Universe under James Gunn and Peter Safran has stolen thunder from the current slate of previously Walter Hamada-hatched DC projects. Hence, the larger set of DC fans aren’t rushing to these movies as must-sees. Still, Gunn has been supportive of Blue Beetle on social, retweeting ads and saying that the protag will be an essential part of the new DC going forward.

Still, you can always tell how much a studio supports a movie when it comes to the number of one-sheets they print up, and Blue Beetle touted 11 next to a paltry four from Universal’s Strays.

Other diagnostics on Blue Beetle: Pic gets an overall 82% positive in the top two boxes, with a 65% recommend for the general audience. Kids under 12 love it at 99% positive and a 61% must-see-right-away. Dude-skewing at 66%, with 58% between 18-34. The biggest demos are currently tied between 18-24 and 25-34 at 29% apiece. Blue Beetle is playing the best in the South, South Central, and West, which is to be expected. All those PLF and Imax screens are working in Warner’s favor and responsible for 42% of the current weekend gross.

Adam Aron’s AMC Burbank is the top-grossing theater in the nation for the DC pic with $91K currently. Other top grossing theaters for Blue Beetle were 2) AMC Empire New York, 3) Harkins Estrella Falls Phoenix, 4) AMC Grove Los Angeles, 5) AMC Century City Los Angeles, 6) AMC Puente Hills Los Angeles, 7) Santikos Casa Blanca San Antonio, 8) Cinemark Tinseltown El Paso, 9) AMC Orange Los Angeles, and 10. AMC Disney Springs Orlando.

EntTelligence shows that the bulk of Blue Beetle‘s were 67% between 1pm-8pm

Still, it doesn’t help that the SAG-AFTRA strike started one month before this pic’s promotion, and the wattage of the cast could have made all the difference for this deep-universe superhero movie.

The availability of actors and late night talk shows could have certainly raised the profile of Strays. However, the marketing campaign and the positioning of the movie was off.

Still, that could have been partially corrected by simply putting Will Ferrell out there on late-night talk shows in a tour with dogs. His bit at CinemaCon with the pup Sophie, one of the canine stars of the film, was one of the few hysterical highlights from the exhibition confab. That alone would have helped sell the message that this talking animal movie is for adults, not kids. While Ferrell was available back in June before the SAG-AFTRA strike, on the old release date for this R-rated comedy on June 9, late night talk shows were not because of the WGA strike.

Part of the problem here is that Universal has released a few family dog movies, read: A Dog’s Journey and A Dog’s Purpose, and the posters here for Strays looked quite similar. Even the trailer appeared kid-friendly.

Compounding problems for Strays is that it didn’t have any on-screen stars, unlike Universal’s other foul-mouthed talking teddy bear movie, Ted, which starred Mark Wahlberg. Stars would have helped break up the whole look of this film, which screams family. Can’t wait to hear stories from this weekend of the parent who bought a ticket to Strays and took their kids, then yelled at theater management, unbeknownst that the movie was really for adults.

Universal was able to pull off a R-rated hit in the foul-mouthed, kid-starring Good Boys, which opened exactly four years ago this weekend to $21.4M. But not this time. However, more to the point: It’s harder to execute comedies than ever since they’ve been cannibalized on streaming menus, and Strays screams streaming in its execution. What works, comedy-wise, on the big-screen? More edgier, far more clever, and more hybrid. Deadpool 3, please don’t move off your first weekend of May summer 2024 start date.

The few who bought tickets to Strays were 56% guys, 53% 18-34, 67% over 25 and 46% Caucasian, 30% Hispanic and Latino, 13% Black and 6% Asian.

There’s another wide release in Luminosity Entertainment/GVN/5120’s R-rated comedy, Back on the Strip, directed by Chris Spencer and starring Tiffany Haddish, JB Smoove, Bill Bellamy, Gary Owen, Kevin Hart and Faizon Love. It did $170K last night for an estimated $461K opening at 1,317 theaters. At the last minute, the indie pic got a SAG-AFTRA interim agreement to have its cast promote. However, the pic’s marketing had to get more creative because of the strike, with stunts like the Laugh Factory’s “Stand Up for Strikers” fundraiser, Martha’s Vineyard African American Film Festival, and the EssenceFest Trailer Launch After Hours party. Pic wasn’t received well by critics at 27% Rotten, nor moviegoers on RT at 40%.

Back on the Strip did get 78% in PostTrak exits, pulling in 57% women, 43% between 18-34, with 40% over 35. The diversity mix was 38% Caucasian, 30% Black, 15% Hispanic and Latino, and 17% Asian/other. Best results were in the South and Midwest. The iPic in Atlanta was the highest- grossing theater so far in the U.S. with close to $2K.

Other highlights on the specialty side this weekend:

Friday Midday: Early numbers show Warner Bros/DC’s Blue Beetle with $9.8M today and a $25M opening at 3,871. This is higher than what others are showing given the expectation that Latino and Hispanic audiences will show up tonight and during matinees. Remember that Blue Beetle has all the PLFs, Imax and premium upcharges working in its favor.

Warners can boast second place in the fifth weekend of Barbie at 4,003 theaters with a $6M Friday, -40% from a week ago, and a $20M-$21M 3-day, -39%. On the high end, Barbie gets to $566.7M by EOD Sunday.

Third and fourth respectively go to Universal with Oppenheimer and Strays. Oppenheimer at 3,321 theaters will see $3M in its fifth Friday, -40%, for $10.9M 3-day, -42% and running total of $285.5M — the Christopher Nolan film will soon overtake Inception‘s domestic of $293M. Bad news, the $46M production, R-rated Strays, is coming in at $8.5M at 3,223 after a $3.5M Friday.

Blue Beetle has an audience score on RT of 93%, while Strays isn’t currently registering one.

RelishMix says about the online chatter that it’s “mainly positive as fans welcome a fresh superhero face — with Xolo Maridueña, a beloved figure from Cobra Kai bringing heat. While many are comping iconic characters like Spider-Man and Iron Man, they’re also praising the film’s cultural depth with some drawing young parallels to Spy Kids and Power Rangers.”

On Strays, RelishMix notes “Audiences are barking about Strays as the convo tracks raucous and mixed — comping to Sausage Party with nods for the film’s originality featuring foul-mouthed live-action dogs. Enthusiasts argue that it’s about time the genre takes bold strides, pushing boundaries and redefining comedic tastes. Snarks question the nuances, debating whether it’s genuine innovation or just a fleeting experiment. Regardless of its ultimate place amidst comedies, Strays has sparked a passionate debate.”

Paramount’s third weekend of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is at $2.2M for Friday, -45% from a week ago, a $8.4M 3-day, -45%, for a running total of $88.1M by EOD Sunday.

Friday AM: Even though kids are heading back to school, the summer box office isn’t giving up yet, and there’s a chance we could near $4 billion thanks to the final act power of Barbie and Oppenheimer. Warner Bros is hoping the first Latino superhero movie, Blue Beetle, will stoke its core moviegoers; that DC title seeing $3.3M last night in previews that began at 2PM from 3,400 locations, while Universal is looking to give guys something to laugh at after Oppenheimer with the R-rated bawdy doggy comedy, Strays, grossing $1.1M from showtimes that began at 5PM at 2,700 theaters.

Blue Beetle is expected to take the weekend with $28M-$32M, the hope being that Latino and Hispanic moviegoers fuel it with walk-up business. The Angel Manuel Soto directed movie is expected to take No. 1 away from Warner Bros.’ Barbie in her fifth weekend, that Mattel doll expected to stay beautiful with $22M-$24M.

Blue Beetle‘s previews aren’t that far from Shazam: Fury of the Gods which did $3.4M before making $11.7M on its first Friday, $30.1M over three-days. That DC sequel, which cost $125M, was a major disappointment, its wattage deafened by the news of the new DC universe that James Gunn and Peter Safran are building. While a $30M start for Blue Beetle would be notable for a Latino-Hispanic movie –a great comp here is Alita: Battle Angel which opened to $28.5M ($37.2M over 4)–that opening for this DC superhero likely won’t trigger a sequel. Blue Beetle cost a reported net of $104M, and was originally conceived for HBO Max, but then the studio pivoted to theatrical after a solid test screening. Reviews haven’t been shabby for Blue Beetle at 79% certified fresh, higher than Shazam 2‘s 49% Rotten, but lower than Shazam‘s 90%. Shazam received an A CinemaScore, the sequel a B+. Shazam Fury of the Gods died at the domestic box office back in the spring with a $57.6M final.

Strays is expected to do in the teens; critics hate the comedy already at 56% Rotten (vs. Uni’s pre-pandemic August 2019 Good Boys which had 80% fresh). Strays‘ preview figure is under that of Good Boy’ $2.1M which turned into an $8.3M Friday, and $21.4M 3-day.

Among titles in regular release, Barbie made $3.8M yesterday at 4,178 theaters, -15% from Wednesday, for a running total through four weeks of $545.7M.

Uni’s Oppenheimer was second with $2M on Thursday at 3,761, -20%, for a four-week running total of $$274.6M. The Christopher Nolan-directed 3-hour drama looks to do another $12M.

2023-07-17 13:59:54+00:00,"No Stars, No Red Carpets: How Hollywood Strikes Could Disrupt the Summer Box Office","Without actors to promote upcoming blockbusters, will the SAG strike affect summer movie season?","For Tom Cruise, one of the most effective ways to sell tickets to blockbusters like “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Mission: Impossible” sequels has been recounting the horrors and headaches of performing his own death-defying stunts.

In the lead-up to “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” however, Cruise hasn’t been able to talk up the antics of hanging off a runaway train or jumping out of airplanes on late-night shows due to the ongoing writers strike. And now, as the actors join the picket lines against Hollywood film and TV companies, the realm of promotion for upcoming projects is getting a lot narrower.

According to SAG-AFTRA guidelines, stars aren’t allowed to appear on daytime shows like “Good Morning America” or “Today,” attend premieres, participate in interviews for completed work or even post about projects on social media while the strike is in effect. Talent is also unable to go to conventions such as San Diego Comic-Con, which is held at the end of July.

All of these restrictions are colliding with summer movie season, which is the biggest and busiest time of year for multiplexes. Without actors to promote their upcoming blockbusters, will the box office take a hit?

“It’s never a good thing to have stars unable to promote their films,” says Paul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore analyst. “It’s difficult to quantify the exact impact that brings to the box office, but there’s no question it raises awareness.”

Analysts believe that depends on the duration of the strike. Imminent releases, like “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” which opened days before film and TV actors hit the picket lines, as well Greta Gerwig’s cotton candy-colored “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s dark atomic bomb drama “Oppenheimer,” which debut on July 21, will not be affected by the strike. They are best positioned because those films were able to effectively roll out their marketing campaigns before the beginning of the strike, with splashy magazine covers, viral interviews and more.

“By this point, moviegoers are aware of these films,” says Dergarabedian. “The timing of the actors strike, while never advantageous but certainly understandable, isn’t as big of a factor.”

But that could change in the coming weeks as the animated “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” (Aug. 2), the disaster thriller “Meg 2: The Trench” (Aug. 4), sports drama “Gran Turismo” (Aug. 11), the DC comic book adaptation “Blue Beetle” (Aug. 18) and Denzel Washington’s “Equalizer 3” (Sept. 1) race to theaters.

“August [movies] are less dependent on personal appearances, and hopefully they can compensate with advertising and other marketing activities,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research.

For those films, the directors may play a larger part in talking up their movies and raising awareness with viewers at home. And studios will ramp up spending on other promotional efforts, like trailers and TV spots. Some of those upcoming films, in preparation of the strike, banked interviews and other marketing materials before the actors began to picket.

Hollywood companies have canceled events and pivoted plans for others, including Disney’s “Haunted Mansion” remake, which opens theatrically July 28. Without the film’s stars LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson and Danny DeVito to walk the red carpet for interviews, last weekend’s world premiere was refashioned into a fan event. Disney characters, including Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Maleficent, and Cruella De Vil, were on hand to pose for photos and greet the moviegoers in attendance.

In the case of “Oppenheimer,” there won’t be a red carpet for Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. and Matt Damon, who aren’t expected to attend the film’s New York premiere on Monday. Instead, the studio is turning the night into a screening to “celebrate the crew and craftspeople who contributed to making this landmark film,” according to a spokesperson.

Deeper into the fall, there’s the antihero adventure “Kraven the Hunter” (Oct. 6), Martin Scorsese’s crime epic “Killers of the Flower Moon” (also Oct. 6), director Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune Part II” (Nov. 3), Disney’s superhero sequel “The Marvels” (Nov. 10) and “Hunger Games” prequel “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” (Nov. 17).

If SAG-AFTRA and film companies remain at odds by the end of the summer, movies may start to move back on the calendar, according to studio insiders. And with productions on hold indefinitely, several major titles set for 2024 and beyond could miss their release dates.

“If there is no resolution, the fall awards movies, the big Thanksgiving films, and the year-end titles are going to be impacted and the marketing is going to suffer,” Gross says. “None of this is good for the movies, in any way.”
