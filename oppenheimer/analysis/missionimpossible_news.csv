2023-07-16 15:05:05+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Falls Short of Expectations With $56 Million Debut, Collects $80 Million Over Five Days","""Mission: Impossible 7"" topped the box office but stopped short of setting a new franchise record.","“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” topped domestic box office charts while falling short of initial expectations. Tom Cruise‘s latest blockbuster collected $56.2 million between Friday and Sunday, a lackluster start for a movie that cost nearly $300 million before marketing.
Heading into the weekend, Paramount and Skydance’s action-adventure was hoping to establish a new franchise record with $60 million or more. Instead, ticket sales landed behind 2018’s “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” ($61 million) and 2000’s “Mission: Impossible II” ($57.8 million), which remain as the top openings in the 27-year-old series.
Comparisons aren’t exact because “Dead Reckoning Part One” opened on Wednesday rather than Friday. The seventh installment has generated an estimated $80 million in its first five days of release, which is more than “Fallout” ($77.5 million) and “Mission: Impossible II” ($78.8 million) earned in their first five days in theaters. With a stellar 96% on Rotten Tomatoes and a glowing “A” CinemaScore, though, “Dead Reckoning” is likely to remain a force at the box office throughout the summer.
But right now, it’s pulling in similar numbers to Disney’s $300 million-budgeted “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which debuted to $60 million over the traditional weekend and pulled in $84 million through the five-day Fourth of July holiday frame. “Indiana Jones 5,” which doesn’t have the benefit of great reviews or very positive audience scores, hasn’t shown endurance; ticket sales stand at $136 million domestically and $302 million worldwide.
To avoid a similar fate, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” needs to have a box office run as long and unwieldy as the film’s title. The movie, which finds Cruise’s teflon operative Ethan Hunt defying death as he flies off a mountain on his motorcycle, scales a runaway train and maneuvers a tiny car through the bustling streets of Rome, was incredibly expensive due to COVID-related starts and stops and other pandemic-era safety measures. So there’s a chance that next summer’s sequel, “Dead Reckoning Part Two,” also directed and co-written by Christopher McQuarrie, will be less expensive.
Repeat business, as well as global box office returns, will be key in saving Cruise’s latest mission. Already, the seventh “Mission: Impossible” is showing strength at the international box office with $155 million, even with its weak $25.4 million debut in China. That brings its worldwide tally to a respectable $235 million, the biggest global start for the franchise.
“This [domestic] opening is roughly average for an action thriller at this point in its series,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “The foreign markets are where action movies excel and the overseas openings are strong.”
“Mission: Impossible” films tend to attract an older audience, which doesn’t always show up in force on opening weekend. With good word-of-mouth, ticket buyers could continue to find the film, as was the case with Cruise’s enduring smash “Top Gun: Maverick,” which powered to $1.4 billion last summer.
In the past, “Mission” installments have demonstrated remarkable box office longevity even with smaller opening weekends. “Fallout,” for example, collected $61 million to start and ended up setting a series record with $791 million globally. Plus, “Mission” movies tend to earn roughly 70% of overall ticket sales at the international box office. That should help offset any potential shortcomings in North America.
That’s good news because Ethan Hunt is gearing up to face the phenomenon known as “Barbenheimer.” Next weekend, the latest “Mission” will compete for attention against Christopher Nolan’s dark historical drama “Oppenheimer” and Greta Gerwig’s hot pink romp “Barbie,” both of which open on July 21. The unlikely showdown between the two very different films has become an online craze, one that has carried into the real world with tens of thousands of moviegoers booking double features of “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie.”
“‘MI7’ could also benefit by being in the epicenter of that box office storm as a hugely appealing alternative to the other two films,” says senior Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian. “‘Cruisenheimer’ anyone?”
Elsewhere, the unlikely box office hit “Sound of Freedom” climbed to second place in its sophomore outing with $25 million from 3,265 theaters, up 25% from last weekend. The faith-based movie about child sex trafficking has collected a remarkable $83 million after two weeks of release. It’s a reminder in the power of religious audiences, who have turned out in force and look to propel the low-budget movie past $100 million.
Sony’s horror sequel “Insidious: The Red Door,” which led the box office last weekend, dropped to No. 3 with $13 million from 3,188 venues. So far, the movie has collected a strong $58 million on its $16 million budget.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” took fourth place in its third weekend of release, adding $12 million from 3,865 venues. To date, the Harrison Ford-led tentpole has grossed $145 million in North America and $302 million globally.
Disney and Pixar’s “Elemental” rounded out the top five, generating $8.7 million from 3,235 theaters in its fifth weekend on the big screen. The animated family film, which cost $200 million, has managed to stick around with $125.3 million domestically and $311.7 million worldwide. But, like “Indy 5,” the massive production budget means it has ways to go to really climb out of the red in its theatrical run.
In limited release, Searchlight’s mockumentary “Theater Camp” opened to $270,000 from six theaters in New York and Los Angeles — averaging a healthy $45,000 per location. The film, which stars Ben Platt and Molly Gordon as kooky drama instructors who attempt to keep their beloved summer camp in business, premiered at Sundance Film Festival to enthusiastic reviews. Moviegoers were also complimentary, awarding the film an “A” CinemaScore. Next weekend, “Theater Camp” will continue its slow expansion to Austin, Chicago, Boston, Denver and San Francisco, among other cities.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLTctYm94LW9mZmljZS1vcGVuaW5nLXdlZWtlbmQtZmFsbHMtc2hvcnQtMTIzNTY3MTMwMC_SAXRodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS03LWJveC1vZmZpY2Utb3BlbmluZy13ZWVrZW5kLWZhbGxzLXNob3J0LTEyMzU2NzEzMDAvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-17 10:11:25.443000+00:00,"‘Mission: Impossible 7’ scores $235M global opening, but underperforms in US",,"NEW YORK (AP) — After a globe-trotting publicity blitz by Syracuse-born star Tom Cruise, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” launched with a franchise-best $80 million over five days, though it came in shy of industry expectations with a $56.2 million haul over the three-day weekend, according to studio estimates.
The Paramount Pictures debut was boosted by strong overseas sales of $155 million from 70 markets. But while a $235 million worldwide launch marked one of the best global openings of the year, “Dead Reckoning” couldn’t approach the high-speed velocity of last summer’s top film, “Top Gun: Maverick.”
“Dead Reckoning Part One,” the seventh film in the 27-year-old series, had been forecast to better the franchise high of the previous installment, “Fallout,” which opened with $61 million domestically in 2018. Instead, it also fell short of the $57.8 million “Mission: Impossible II” debuted with in 2000.
That puts the film’s opening-weekend tally very close to the tepid launch of Disney’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which opened in U.S. and Canadian theaters with $82 million over five days and $60 million over the three-day weekend. Paramount and Skydance had higher hopes for the action extravaganza of “Dead Reckoning,” which cost $290 million to make, not counting marketing expenses.
Those costs were inflated, in part, by the pandemic. “Dead Reckoning,” directed by Christopher McQuarrie, was among the first major productions shut down by COVID-19. It was preparing to shoot in Italy in March 2020. When the film got back on track, McQuarrie and Cruise helped lead the industry-wide recovery back to film sets – albeit with some well-publicized friction over protocols along the way.
Still, “Dead Reckoning” was hailed as a high point in the franchise. Critics (96% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and fans (an “A” CinemaScore) alike came away awed by the stunts and chases of the latest “Mission: Impossible” film. Though the coming competition of “Barbenheimer” — the much-anticipated debuts of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” — looms, “Mission: Impossible” should play well for weeks to come.
“This is a global franchise. It’s going gangbusters and its going to play for a long time. Quality always wins in the end,” said Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount.
“Dead Reckoning,” Aronson said, met or exceeded the studio’s expectations.
“In international markets, in like-for-like markets, we’re 15% ahead of ‘Fallout,’ and that’s taking China out,” added Aronson. “Domestically, we’re over 3% ahead of ‘Fallout’ for the first five days. To beat its predecessor is phenomenal, especially in this environment.”
Cruise, the so-called savior of movie theaters last year, traveled tirelessly to again pump life back into a summer box office that’s been sluggish. After a splashy world premiere in Rome with a red-carpet on the Spanish Steps, Cruise and McQuarrie surprised theaters in Atlanta, Miami, Toronto and Washington D.C. in the days ahead of opening.
“Dead Reckoning” hit theaters at a crucial mid-summer period for Hollywood, and not just because of the SAG-AFTRA strike which began Thursday. “Mission: Impossible” launched a week before one of the biggest box-office showdowns of the year.
Though “Dead Reckoning” and “Oppenheimer” have vied for some of the same IMAX screens, each film has publicly endorsed the idea that a rising tide lifts all blockbusters. Cruise and McQuarrie in early July even bought opening-weekend tickets to both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.” “Barbie” director Greta Gerwig and “Oppenheimer” filmmaker Christopher Nolan reciprocated with their own gestures of support.
However that trio of films performs over the next few weeks will do a lot to determine the fate of the summer box office.
“These are a crucial couple of weeks for the industry starting this weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. “I think it’s going to be a fun reinvigoration of the box office because we have had a few films underperforming. Really, the summer movie season restarts this week with ‘Mission’ leading into ‘Barbenheimer.’”
No other new wide release challenged “Mission: Impossible” over the weekend. Second place went to Angel Studios’ faith-based political thriller “Sound of Freedom” which increased 37% in its second with $27 million. Jim Caveziel stars in the child trafficking drama.
Last week’s top film, “Insidious: The Red Door "" slid to third with $13 million in its second weekend. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is dropping quickly with $12 million its third weekend, with a domestical total so far of $145.4 million.
In limited release, the Searchlight Pictures’ mockumentary “Theater Camp” opened to $270,000 from six theaters in New York and Los Angeles.

2023-06-19 16:03:20+00:00,Tom Cruise Vows to ‘Always Fight for Big Theaters’ From Rome’s Spanish Steps at ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ World Premiere,Tom Cruise made an impassioned speech about cinema-going from Rome’s Spanish Steps at the world premiere of 'Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning.',"Tom Cruise made an impassioned speech about cinemagoing from Rome’s Spanish Steps at the world premiere of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.”
“There is a community that we are all part of — different cultures and ways of life, we all join together to enjoy cinema,” said Cruise, dressed in a crisp blue suit and wearing aviator shades. “It’s something that I grew up with, that made me and inspired me to dream and want to travel the world.
“My goal since I was little was to make movies and travel. And not just be a tourist, but work in that world and understand their culture. Through my movies, I’ve been able to have that because everyone here has allowed me to entertain them. It’s a privilege that I have never taken for granted. It’s my passion to entertain you, and I will always fight for big theaters and that kind of experience for everyone.”
Cruise also paid tribute to his “Mission: Impossible” director Christopher McQuarrie, calling the helmer his “creative brother.”
“He’s had a hand in every single film I’ve made over the past 16 years,” Cruise declared. “Uncredited, he wrote ‘Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.” He’s had a hand in editing and writing every single I’ve ever done. He is my creative brother and an exceptional human being.”
Tom Cruise (left) paid tribute to director Christopher McQuarrie (right) from the Spanish Steps red carpet in Rome.
Cruise, who reprises his role as Ethan Hunt in Paramount’s latest tentpole, added: “I want to thank Rome and the city. And also we got to film in Venice, which was extraordinary, during some very difficult times in this country. I dreamed to be coming here and [sharing] it with all of you.”
The seventh installment of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise was partly filmed in the Italian capital, where the cobblestoned streets provided the perfect pavement for drifting cars burning rubber in numerous hair-raising chases that are likely to go down in action film history. The Spanish Steps, by the Piazza di Spagna, is the setting of a wild car chase involving a massive Hummer chasing a tiny vintage yellow Fiat 500 driven by Cruise and Hayley Atwell, who are handcuffed.
On those very steps, Cruise — who spent the weekend in Rome ahead of the premiere — wooed crowds screaming “Tom! Tom!” on the sunny Monday afternoon.
Cruise came to Italy with director McQuarrie and an ensemble cast of returning talents including Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby on the red carpet. Franchise newcomers Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis were also among those who made the trek to the Eternal City for the launch.
Atwell, who plays thief and agent of chaos Grace, told Variety during a weekend junket that she trained for months on a race track with stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood for her Rome chase. Only after her hardcore training did she arrive in Rome to work alongside Cruise, who was determined to keep the stunts as real as possible.
Hayley Atwell (right) joined Cruise for the world premiere of “Mission: Impossible 7.”
“I was handcuffed to Tom Cruise, who is in the passenger seat,” Atwell recalled. “Both Wade and Tom said: ‘We want you to go in front of this monument, do some 360 doughnuts, drift in, drift out, dodge cars and keep going.'”
During this feat, Atwell was told that “Tom’s going to be suggesting lines to you [while] he’s going to be acting as Ethan. But he also might give you moments of direction, too. Like: ‘turn left’ or ‘slow down,’” she said.
So Atwell’s challenge, as she was drifting, was to work out: “Is Tom as a producer telling me as Hayley to slow down because something is unsafe? Or is he as Ethan telling Grace to slow down?”
“It was an amazing day,” Atwell noted. After it was over, McQuarrie took her out to lunch and said: ‘Tom put his life in your hands today. That was no small thing,’” she added.
By contrast, Pom Klementieff – who plays the psychopathic villain Paris – didn’t train at all for scenes in which she drives the Hummer in pursuit of the yellow Fiat as it comes darting down the ancient staircase filled with screaming people who are jumping and running.
For Klementieff, the hard part was “not having too much fun doing it,” she said during the junket. “I was trying not to laugh the whole time, because for me it was so funny to be chasing a Fiat [500] … in this crazy Hummer.”
“ I had to tone it down a bit. I had to remember that I’m a villain,” she laughed. But Klementieff also noted “that some of that [irony] is in the movie, of course!”
The entire “Mission: Impossible 7” cast gathered in Rome for the movie’s long-awaited world premiere.
Paramount’s July 12 U.S. release of “Mission: Impossible 7” – which also shot in England, Abu Dhabi and Norway – was pushed back several times from its original planned 2021 launch date due to pandemic-related setbacks.
In February 2021, the movie was forced to halt production in Italy, days before its planned shoot in Venice, as the country contended with one of the highest COVID death rates in Europe.
“It was an absolute miracle this movie was made in the height of COVID,” said Vanessa Kirby, who in the film reprises her role as the powerful arms dealer White Widow.
“In every city we were in across the world, it was the middle of COVID,” she added. “So it was amazing that they got the system [COVID production protocol] in place — and Tom drove it.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2dsb2JhbC90b20tY3J1aXNlLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS03LXdvcmxkLXByZW1pZXJlLTEyMzU2NDc5MzIv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vZ2xvYmFsL3RvbS1jcnVpc2UtbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLTctd29ybGQtcHJlbWllcmUtMTIzNTY0NzkzMi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One movie review (2023),"A ridiculously good time, the kind of movie that people should see large and loud.","At the airport, Ethan also crosses paths with a pickpocket named Grace (Hayley Atwell), who gets stuck in the middle of all of this world-changing insanity, along with a few agents trying to hunt down the rogue Ethan and are played by a wonderfully exasperated Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis. A silent assassin, memorably sketched by Pom Klementieff, is also essential to a few action scenes. And Vanessa Kirby returns as the arms dealer White Widow, and, well, if the ensemble has a weakness, it's Kirby's kind of lost performance. She has never quite been able to convey ""power player"" in these films as she should.
But that doesn't matter because people aren't here for the White Widow's backstory. They want to see Tom Cruise run. The image most people associate with “Mission: Impossible” is probably Mr. Cruise stretching those legs and swinging those arms. He does that more than once here, but it seems like the momentum of that image was the artistic force behind this entire film. “Dead Reckoning Part One” prioritizes movement—trains, cars, Ethan’s legs. It’s an action film that's about speed and urgency, something that has been so lost in the era of CGI’s diminished stakes. Runaway trains will always have more inherent visceral power than waves of animated bad guys, and McQuarrie knows how to use it sparingly to make an action film that both feels modern and old-fashioned at the same time. These films don’t over-rely on CGI, ensuring we know that it’s really Mr. Cruise jumping off that motorcycle. When punches connect, bodies fly, and cars crash into each other—we feel it instead of just passively observing it. The action here is so wonderfully choreographed that only “John Wick: Chapter 4” compares for the best in the genre this year.
There’s also something fascinating thematically here about a movie star battling A.I. and questioning the purpose of his job. Blockbusters have been cautionary tech tales for generations but think about the meta aspect of a spy movie in which the world could collapse if the espionage game is overtaken by a sentient computer that stars an actor who has been at the center of controversy regarding his own deepfakes. There’s also a definite edge to the plotting here that plays into the actor’s age in that Ethan is forced to answer questions about what matters to him regarding his very unusual work/life balance, a reflection of what a performer like Cruise must face as he reaches the end of an action movie rope that’s been much longer than anyone could have even optimistically expected. Cruise may or may not intend that reading—although I suspect he does—but it adds another layer to the action.
Of course, the most important thing is this: “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is just incredibly fun. It feels half its length and contains enough memorable action sequences for some entire franchises. Will Cruise save the blockbuster experience again? Maybe. And he might do it again next summer too.

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” co-star Pom Klementieff said she practically begged him to kick her in the stomach for real while they were filming a fight scene. Cruise refused to do so.
“I kept telling him to just kick me here,” Klementieff said while pointing to her stomach. “I was squeezing abs. [I said], ‘You can just go for it.’ He was like ‘No, no, no, no, no.’ I was like, ‘But it’s going to help me!’ But he wouldn’t do it.”
Klementieff, best known for playing Mantis in James Gunn’s “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies and the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, is joining the “Mission: Impossible” franchise in its seventh installment as Paris, a dangerous hench-woman with ties to the film’s villain, played by Esai Morales. The actor described Paris as “very, very, very much a chaotic element in the story.”
“It doesn’t matter how deep in the background she is, you’re going to be watching her at all times and wondering what she’s going to do,” Klementieff said. “[She] destroys everything in her path. She’s a rebel, she’s a killer, she’s extremely skilled and quite lonely too.”
While Cruise refused to kick Klementieff in the stomach, he did start filming “Dead Reckoning” by riding a motorcycle off the edge of a cliff. The stunt marked the most dangerous one of Cruise’s career thus far. The actor recently told Entertainment Tonight that he wanted to film the stunt on the first day of filming so that his cast and crew would know if rewrites were in order because he didn’t survive.
“Well we know either we will continue with the film or we’re not. Let’s know day one!” Cruise said. “Let us know day one what is going to happen: Do we all continue or is it a major rewrite?”
“I was training and I was ready,” Cruise added. “You have to be razor sharp when you’re doing something like that. It was very important as we were prepping the film that it was actually the first thing. I don’t want to drop that and go shoot other things and have my mind somewhere else. Everyone was prepped. Let’s just get it done.”

How wrong he was.
“He does everything himself. He really does,” Whigham told me at the “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” premiere.
Whigham had to get in on the action too – although nothing was as drastic as Cruise’s already iconic motorcycle drive off a mountain in Iceland. “I do all my own driving in it,” he said. “There’s no stunt driving. We went hard in Rome. We also chased Tom on foot a lot in Venice. I pulled muscles left and right. I’m still recovering.”
Cruise recently told Entertainment Tonight that he insisted on shooting the motorcycle-mountain stunt on day one of filming. “Well, we know either we will continue with the film or we’re not. Let’s know day one! Let us know day one what is going to happen: Do we all continue or is it a major rewrite?”
He continued, “I was training and I was ready. You have to be razor sharp when you’re doing something like that.

Co-star Vanessa Kirby recalled watching Cruise complete the stunt when we talked at the Met Gala in May. “He did it many times in one day,” recalls Kirby. “He did it consecutively … and repeatedly so he could capture all the different angles and sides of it.”
Cruise also showed no signs of being nervous. “He was just so calm,” Kirby says. “He had no fear. He just found it exhilarating. That kind of belief in cinema and what one could achieve and his passion for it is so inspiring. He kind of believes he can do the impossible and then he does…I love being a part of the franchise.

,'Mission: Impossible 7' Director Says He Considered Casting Julia Roberts for Flashback Sequence with Tom Cruise,Christopher McQuarrie said on Empire's 'Spoiler Special Film' podcast that he briefly considered whether he could recruit Julia Roberts to act alongside Tom Cruise for a flashback sequence in the latest 'Mission: Impossible' movie that would have required both stars to be digitally de-aged,"Christopher McQuarrie says he briefly considered casting a major actress for what would have been a small role in the latest Mission: Impossible movie.
As Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One filmmaker McQuarrie, 54, appeared on Empire magazine's Spoiler Special Film podcast recently, the director recalled that as the production considered de-aging Tom Cruise for a flashback sequence in the new movie, he briefly wondered whether he could book Julia Roberts to act alongside the actor.
""I said, 'OK, if I were doing this sequence, it would be Tom in, say, 1989,' "" McQuarrie recalled on the podcast, noting that he believed the late Tony Scott (True Romance) would have been a good pick to direct a late '80s Mission: Impossible movie.
""We looked at Days of Thunder and we looked at the style of it, and we started thinking what would it look like if Tony Scott had shot this, and who would it have been?"" the director continued, according to a /Film transcription of the podcast appearance. ""I looked back at who was the ingenue, who was the breakout star in 1989? And right around then was Mystic Pizza. And I was like, 'Oh my God. Julia Roberts, a then-pre-Pretty Woman Julia Roberts, as this young woman.' ""
McQuarrie continued to note that he decided he only would want to de-age Cruise for the flashback if he could ""somehow convince Julia Roberts to come in and be this small role at the beginning of this story.""

As McQuarrie considered his options, though, he decided seeking out digital de-aging — and the fees the production would incur from casting an A-list star like Roberts — were not worth what he envisioned for the scene.
""As you're conceptually going through it, you're like, 'Now all anybody's going to be doing is thinking about the de-aging of Julia Roberts, and Esai [Morales], and Tom, and Henry Czerny,' "" the director said. ""And then I got the bill for de-aging those people before their salaries were even factored into it.""

""And if you put two of them in a shot together, or three of them in a shot together, it would have been as expensive as the train by the time we were done,"" he added.
Rather than spend time and money on de-aging all the actors involved, the latest Mission: Impossible movie kept the flashback sequence simple and avoided showing the faces of 61-year-old Cruise or 60-year-old Morales, who plays a villain named Gabriel. Mariela Garriga plays Marie in those flashbacks; she's expected to return in the role for the film's forthcoming sequel Dead Reckoning Part Two.

While the new film did not include any digital de-aging of its principal star, Cruise did perform what McQuarrie once called ""by far the most dangerous stunt we've ever done"" with his now-famous motorbike jump off a cliff for the movie.
Aside from Cruise, Morales and Garriga, the latest entry in Cruise's decades-long action series also stars Hayley Atwell, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Pom Klementieff, Ving Rhames, Henry Czerny, Shea Whigham, Greg Tarzan Davis, Charles Parnell, Frederick Schmidt, Cary Elwes, Mark Gatiss, Indira Varma and Rob Delaney.

2023-06-30 14:21:17+00:00,Tom Cruise Speed-Flying at Over 50 Miles per Hour Left ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Crew in ‘Absolute Terror’: One of the World’s ‘Most Dangerous Sports’,Tom Cruise learned to speed-fly at over 50 miles per hour for one stunt in “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.”,"Riding a motorcycle off the edge of a cliff is not the only death-defying stunt Tom Cruise pulls off in the upcoming “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.” A new featurette on the making of the Paramount action tentpole reveals Cruise learned how to speed-fly, which director Christopher McQuarrie calls “one of the most dangerous sports in the world.”
“While it may look similar, speed-flying is not skydiving,” the filmmaker said. “Skydiving is fairly predictable. Speed-flying is very unpredictable.”
Speed-flying is more akin to paragliding, although the flyer is meant to stay closer to the slope as to pick up more speed. Staying closer to the slope increases the chance of collision with land, which is why the sport is so dangerous. Flyers race down mountains with their feet closer to the ground.
“It’s a very beautiful and delicate sport,” Cruise said of speed-flying. “We’re gonna do spirals, and we’re landing at an incredibly high speed, over 80 kilometers an hour.”
While McQuarrie agreed that speed-flying looks beautiful, he added, “Behind the scenes we were all in absolute terror.”
While Cruise risked his life racing down the sides of mountains while speed-flying, the infamous motorcycle stunt remains the most death-defying act in “Dead Reckoning Part One.” Cruise rode a motorcycle off the edge of a cliff and parachuted to safety on the first day of filming. The actor wanted it that way, as his survival would’ve determined the rest of filming on the $200 million tentpole.
“Well we know either we will continue with the film or we’re not. Let’s know day one!” Cruise recently told Entertainment Tonight about filming the stunt at the very start of production. “Let us know day one what is going to happen: Do we all continue or is it a major rewrite?”
“I was training and I was ready,” Cruise added. “You have to be razor sharp when you’re doing something like that. It was very important as we were prepping the film that it was actually the first thing. I don’t want to drop that and go shoot other things and have my mind somewhere else. Everyone was prepped. Let’s just get it done.”

2023-07-17 20:33:14+00:00,Vanessa Kirby and Hayley Atwell Explain How ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning’ Pulled Off That Thrilling Mask Sequence,'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning' stars Vanessa Kirby and Hayley Atwell and editor Eddie Hamilton explain the franchise's thrilling mask reveal.,"SPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” now playing in theaters.
The “Mission: Impossible” movies have no shortage of death-defying stunts, but the Tom Cruise-starring action franchise is known for another iconic magic trick: its mask reveals.
“Dead Reckoning Part One” features two mask reveals — in the first, Cruise’s Ethan Hunt uses a mask to infiltrate a meeting between CIA director Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny) and officials from various intelligence agencies about a rogue artificial intelligence system, known as the Entity. The other is a face swap between Hayley Atwell’s Grace, a pickpocket who becomes embroiled in IMF’s hunt for the Entity, and Vanessa Kirby’s black-market arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis, aka the White Widow.
“It was so much fun. It was the first time two women have got to do that,” Kirby told Variety on the red carpet at the film’s New York premiere.
“It was such an amazing gift — because I love Hayley — to channel her and get to play her for a bit, and to get to play somebody that was totally out of control,” she continued. “My character is usually so restrained and composed and in control; it was really, really fun to play someone a bit scrappier and a bit messier. I’m naturally more messy in real life, so I felt more at home in that sense.”
In a separate interview, Atwell echoed Kirby’s excitement, sharing that the two became particularly close while training together for the film amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “We both have a background in theater, and we’re both British, and we had mutual friends,” Atwell said.
There’s something so satisfying about watching Ethan or another character (i.e. Simon Pegg’s IMF field agent Benji or the villainous Dougray Scott posing as Ethan) rip off their prosthetic disguise to reveal themselves to a shocked party. But pulling off those scenes requires as much technical skill from the filmmakers as it showcases the actor’s versatility. (The late Philip Seymour Hoffman’s take on Cruise’s super spy persona Ethan Hunt when they pull a switcheroo during “Mission: Impossible III” is an absolute master class.)
“We’re always trying to come up with new and original ways of doing it because it’s a signature ‘Mission: Impossible’ move,” said Oscar-winning film editor Eddie Hamilton, who boarded the franchise with 2015’s “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation” and continued on with 2018’s “Fallout” and the two-part “Dead Reckoning.”
Hamilton teased that there was a third mask reveal which landed on the cutting room floor “because it no longer had relevance” in the larger story. The scene was near the beginning of the movie and got nixed because it undercut the significance of Ethan’s big moment.
“It was the right decision, ultimately,” Hamilton said of scrapping the scene. “There are quite a lot of people who’ve never seen a ‘Mission: Impossible’ movie who might be coming to see this because of the goodwill of ‘Top Gun: Maverick,’ so that [first scene] is a great moment to have a mask reveal, because you’re like ‘What the hell is going on?’”

The mask moment between Grace and Alanna comes as part of “Dead Reckoning’s” complex final scheme, where Ethan and Grace must infiltrate a meeting between the White Widow and her mysterious buyer on board the Orient Express as a last ditch-effort to obtain the key to access the Entity’s source code.
The plan — Grace will go to the meeting disguised as Alanna, while Ethan assumes the identity of her brother, Zola. To do that, they must board the train without being recognized, tranquilize Alanna and Zola, meet the buyer, acquire the completed key and get off the train undetected. It’s a ruse that’d require everything to go perfectly to succeed, but when the mask machine breaks, the team must improvise, with Grace going in alone and Ethan boarding while the train is in motion.
Accomplishing the scene required some moviemaking tricks. The reason why Alanna’s face looks so perfect when being created by the mask machine is because it’s actually Kirby’s face, with her body hidden out of frame.
“Her body’s down there,” Hamilton said, motioning below the frame of his Zoom camera. “She’s keeping her eyes sharp, and the VFX team put the edge of the briefcase in across her neck and painted her out of the shot.”
Then there’s a hidden wipe between Atwell putting on the White Widow mask and Kirby standing in the mirror as “The Gray Widow” (the nickname filmmakers gave to the in-disguise character).
“What’s so elegant about it is there’s two stitches,” Hamilton said. “But you don’t realize what you’re seeing until [Grace] walks up to the mirror, and you’re like ‘Wait, what? How did that happen? That was completely seamless.'”
The trickery of the scene, Hamilton explained, is to make moviegoers feel like they’re starting their journey into the third act of the movie, but it’s a ruse. “We’re having fun with the audience’s expectations of how these films play out, which is great,” he adds.
Beyond the mechanics of the sequence, the White Widow mask moment allowed Kirby to flex her acting chops. When discussing the scene, Atwell heaped praise on Kirby’s mimicry of her mannerisms and pointed to a small tell in her co-star’s performance that distinguished the transition from Alanna to Grace.
“There’s an echo gesture that she does: when I fall backwards on the tracks in the little Fiat 500, I sort of blow hair out of my face, [Vanessa] then does it as she comes out of the cabin as Grace playing the White Widow,” Atwell explained. “She sees her brother there and she does it as well, and there’s a different kind of manic energy in her eyes. That’s all Vanessa studying me a little bit and having a great time. It is remarkable.”
In addition to being a fun visual gag, the sequence also serves as part of Grace’s redemption arc. (Originally, there was a version of this scene where Grace tranquilized Ethan, Luther [Ving Rhames] and Benji and boarded the train on her own to “try to get money from the buyer and maybe bargain her way out of the situation she’s in,” Hamilton said. “But the test audience didn’t really like that idea, so we came up with this idea.”)
Grace’s decision not to take the money was “her moment of reckoning,” Atwell said, crediting Kirby with pulling off that pivotal turn, which sets up the character’s future in part two. “I love that moment,” Atwell said of the way her fellow actor played the scene. “That’s Vanessa being brilliant and being able to show off her range.”
And the mask itself was also a helpful prop for Atwell to demonstrate Grace’s new state of mind. In fact, the way Grace strips off the Gray Widow mask at the end of the sequence was intended to feel a bit like “an exorcism.”
“It’s like I’m throwing [it] away. Like I just don’t like the version of myself I was when I had the mask on, and I’m getting it out of my system,” Atwell explained. “I’m taking off the old identity of who Grace was from the first half of the movie, when she realizes, ‘If I had taken the money, it would have been more than the key I was giving away.’”

2023-07-06 15:25:26+00:00,Tom Cruise Fought His ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Co-Star on Top of a Speeding Train at 60 Miles per Hour: ‘Trial By Fire’ Is ‘How Tom Likes to Do Things’,"Fighting on top of a speeding train is just another day on the ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" set.","Riding a motorcycle off a cliff and learning the dangerous sport of speed-flying weren’t the only requirements for acting in “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.” Tom Cruise also had to fight co-star Esai Morales on the roof of a train moving at 60 miles per hour. The latest “Dead Reckoning” behind-the-scenes featurette confirms that Cruise and Morales, the latter of whom plays the film’s villain, shot the fight scene practically, meaning they were literally strapped to the top of a train as it sped through a valley in Norway.
“When we started talking about this movie in the terms of a sense of adventure, an action sequence on a train is something we always wanted to do,” writer-director Christopher McQuarrie said. “We wanted to build upon the previous films and apply that knowledge to something practical and real and bring this train sequence to another level.”
“There was not a surplus of trains available to be wrecked,” he added. “We had to build the train if we wanted to destroy it. To shoot it practically was extremely challenging. Not just to execute it, but to design all of the different train carts that could function on a real train track.”
The train’s speed hit the 60 miles per hour mark during filming. That might seem crazy to film on, but for Cruise it’s just another day on the set of a “Mission: Impossible” movie.
“I’ve done fight scenes, but to do them on a moving train is trial by fire,” Morales said. “But that’s how Tom like to do things.”
A previous featurette revealed Cruise hit speeds of up to 50 miles per hour while speed-flying during one sequence of the movie. Speed-flying, which McQuarrie described as “one of the most dangerous sports in the world,” is similar to paragliding, although the flyer stays closer to the slope as to pick up more speed. Staying closer to the slope increases the chance of collision with land.
“It’s a very beautiful and delicate sport,” Cruise said of speed-flying. “We’re gonna do spirals, and we’re landing at an incredibly high speed, over 80 kilometers an hour.”
While speed-flying and fighting atop a speeding train present their own risk factors, the most death-defying stunt in “Dead Reckoning” is Cruise riding a motorcycle off the edge of a cliff. The stunt was performed on the first day of filming. Cruise preferred it that way, as his survival would determine the rest of filming on the $200 million tentpole.
“Well we know either we will continue with the film or we’re not. Let’s know day one!” Cruise recently told Entertainment Tonight about filming the stunt at the very start of production. “Let us know day one what is going to happen: Do we all continue or is it a major rewrite?”

,How Tom Cruise Performed Wild Stunt in 'Mission: Impossible 7',"For 'Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One', Cruise performed one of his most death-defying stunts yet which involved driving a motorbike off a cliff.","Tom Cruise turned up the action for Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One.
While the film marks the seventh installment in the highly successful franchise, Cruise, 61, made the occasion even more special by challenging himself to perform one of his most dangerous stunts yet.
The death-defying moment involved Cruise driving a motorbike off a cliff, fly off the bike, and parachute to the ground. While fans got a glimpse of the stunt through the film's action-packed trailer in May, Cruise, along with writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, first teased the big moment in 2021 at CinemaCon.
The pair explained in a special behind-the-scenes video at the event that the stunt took 500 hours of skydiving training and 13,000 motorbike jumps to get it just right. The stunt involved Cruise being attached to a set of wires as he rides a speeding motorcycle off of a large ramp before he throws himself from the bike, backed by the safety wires attached to his back.
Speaking about its execution, McQuarrie, 54, explained in the video that it was ""by far the most dangerous stunt we've ever done."" The clip then ended with Cruise performing the stunt himself, with a crew member saying, ""Tom Cruise rode a motorcycle off a cliff six times today.""
McQuarrie ""tried to kill me,"" joked Cruise at the New York City premiere.

The film's long-awaited release comes after multiple delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to an official synopsis, it finds Cruise's Ethan Hunt as he and his team are tasked with tracking down ""a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity before it falls into the wrong hands.""
During its world premiere in June, Cruise gave a speech about his passion for the franchise and filmmaking. He said in part, ""It’s something that I grew up with, that made me and inspired me to dream and want to travel the world. My goal since I was little was to make movies and travel. And not just be a tourist but work in that world and understand their culture.""
""Through my movies, I’ve been able to have that because everyone here has allowed me to entertain them,"" he continued. ""It’s a privilege that I have never taken for granted.""

2023-07-17 16:24:08+00:00,Mission Impossible 7 (no real spoilers),,"Eh. It has some good scenes, but there was no movie in the movie, as they say. I do understand this is a film and also a visual event, but the evil AI should have been kept abstract, rather than visualized in such a corny, stupid fashion. That reminded me of Hitchcock’s Spellbound, which is also too visually literal. This installation of the MI series uses a bunch of Hitchcock tricks, some expected James Bond, and then a bunch of LOTR moral and “power corrupts” themes, which don’t fit the kinetic emphasis in the on-screen action. Most of all, I am struck by the great lengths they go to in order to portray lone individuals as decisive over the final outcomes. In a Bond movie there is a wire to be cut, a button to be pressed, and a specific villain to be vanquished in a remote island lair, with a stomach punch-invulnerable henchman along the way. OK enough, but here they have to work far harder. They even solve for the strategic game between the AI and the good guys, and it still isn’t clear who is a decisive agent in the action.
And so the movie ends with “part I and uncertainty,” as even 2 hours 40 minutes was not enough to get a single individual to matter.

2023-07-12 20:45:00+00:00,‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Star Hayley Atwell Talks Hanging Off a Train With Tom Cruise and Female Representation in Action Movies,"Hayley Atwell talks joining the 'Mission: Impossible' franchise as Grace, a pickpocket who becomes integral to Tom Cruise's latest mission.","It’s 10 a.m. in Sydney, where Hayley Atwell is preparing to walk the red carpet as the “Mission: Impossible” crew’s newest member, joining producer and star Tom Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie’s ensemble of battle-hardened actors.
“This is a pure cinematic experience. It’s unadulterated entertainment, and of a huge scale,” Atwell says to Variety about “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” which finally hit theaters on July 12 following a two-year delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Flashy events like the Australia premiere (which featured a fireworks spectacle in honor of Cruise’s 61st birthday on July 3) mark the end of a four-year odyssey that pushed Atwell’s limits physically — leaving her hanging inside a train car that’s gone from horizontal to vertical, gripping anything nailed to the floor/wall/ceiling lest she fall to her death (or at least the safety rigging below) — and saw her creating a cunning character within the “M:I” universe.
“I’m aware that this is entertainment,” Atwell adds. “But I’m also aware that my responsibility as an actor is to contribute in my own small way to the kind of characters I want to see represented.”
Atwell plays Grace, a professional thief who becomes embroiled in Ethan Hunt’s (Cruise) latest impossible mission — tracking down a rogue artificial intelligence system. Among its various plotlines, “Dead Reckoning Part One” chronicles Grace’s origins, explaining how the pickpocket becomes an integral part of the narrative.
She’s seen the movie four times, the first at a screening for the cast and crew, with her mother as her plus one (and Cruise watching her mum instead of the screen to gauge her enjoyment.) So, what did mum make of the movie?
“She’s very vocal and effusive when it comes to the big action sequences. She’s like, ‘Oh my God, why didn’t you tell me you’re doing that?’” says Atwell, who quipped: “Because you would have been really nervous for me.”
The death-defying stunt work aside, Atwell’s mother also shared a poignant takeaway. “She recognizes the grounding that I’ve done with Grace, of giving her emotional depth,” Atwell shares. “She could see that I was able to hold my own with my own experience of being in this industry and bringing truth to the role.”

The British American actor joins the IMF from the MCU, where she played Margaret “Peggy” Carter for more than a decade. Over the course of six movies and the ABC series “Agent Carter,” Peggy rose through the ranks to lead the government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. — challenging misogyny in the workplace with the same verve she nabbed supervillains. Plus, Peggy represents one half of the multiverse’s most enduring romance, as the first love of Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America (Chris Evans).
There’s really no comparison between Marvel and “Mission,” Atwell says. It’s really apples and oranges — or more specifically akin to performing Kenneth Lonergan’s adaptation of “Howards End” versus starring in Henrik Ibsen’s “Rosmersholm” on the West End.
“They’re just so distinctively themselves — a different group of filmmakers, different tastes, different character, different worlds,” she explains. “They just happen to be things that have become global phenomena.”
Yet there’s a bridge that carries Atwell from one franchise to the other: the way she personified both women.
“What I tried to do with Peggy — and I think it’s the reason I got the part in ‘Mission’ — I didn’t play her like I was in a superhero film. And with Grace, I’m not playing her like I’m in an action film,” Atwell notes. “Peggy taught me that I can be distinctively grounded in a character that’s going to stand out, rather than get consumed by the machine of something.”
A “Mission” movie is not your typical Hollywood machine. For starters, there’s no set script, so Atwell developed Grace from the ground up alongside Cruise and McQuarrie. “I didn’t feel like I was having to fit into a character that they’d created,” she explains, “because they hadn’t actually created one.”
Each scene offered an opportunity to add nuance and subvert any action movie stereotypes about “strong” women. “I thought, well, it’s an opportunity here to do many different takes” on the character, Atwell says. “I didn’t want her to seem that she was just trying to look cool, or femme fatale, or a sex object.”
She sees Grace’s motivation as one driven by some deep wound that’s caused the character to be distrustful of others and retreat from society. “Something’s got to have happened to her to interrupt the very deep human need that we all have to belong — whether it’s to our family, our social group, or some sort of tribe, or workforce that gives us a sense of identity,” she reasons, pinpointing why Grace can be “unpredictable, untrustworthy and inconsistent.”
In a recent interview with The Telegraph, Atwell revealed that at age 13 she wrote letters to her 40-year-old self — Atwell is 41 — questioning what her life would be like. She shared that teenage Hayley would’ve been thrilled to learn she’d booked a “M:I” movie. But the teen would’ve had a big question: “Were you able to push the conversation forward about female representation in a franchise of this size?’”
The answer to that query is “Yes,” Atwell tells Variety, explaining that the mission she undertook with Grace was “to allow her and give her the platform to be more than one thing.”
“Dead Reckoning” features an abundance of female characters: Rebecca Ferguson plays Ilsa Faust, a former MI6 agent turned IMF ally; Vanessa Kirby as black-market arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis, a.k.a the White Widow; and fellow franchise-newcomer Pom Klementieff as the sociopathic assassin Paris.
“All the characters are so distinctive, and that’s what’s great,” Atwell says. “They’re never all one thing — they all come in with their own agendas and their own ideas about who they are and what they want to be and what they want to do to affect people in the scene. Any one of them could have a spin-off and collectively, too.”
It’s striking to see all four share the screen in one particularly tense scene — further demonstrating that their roles are additive, not competitive.
“Women in this franchise aren’t pitted against each other,” Atwell notes, adding that, “It’s a false assumption that that’s how it has to be, and probably more to do with a comment on the culture of celebrity that does seem to pit women against each other in a ‘Who wore it best?’ situation. But that mindset is not a creative act.”

On the topic of female representation, Atwell often recalls a line from art critic John Berger’s “Ways of Seeing”: “Men act, and women appear. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at.” Those words, Atwell says, have been true to her experience as an actor, and what she believes to be true for many women in the public eye. She wanted “Mission” to be different.
“I don’t want to feel that Grace is aware that she’s being looked at. I want to see what Grace is looking at,” Atwell says. “She’s in a world that’s over her head, but she’s in a hypervigilant state of trying to work out how to navigate it, and how to survive through it.”
Thus, Grace employs her sense of humor and other tactics like flirtation to get where she needs to go. “She can duck, dive and disappear, or she can call Ethan Hunt a ‘pervert’ publicly in order to escape him,” Atwell says, giggling at the character’s cheekiness in one key moment.
And since physical prowess is a prerequisite for the franchise, Atwell also underwent five months of stunt training, so she was ready to improvise whenever a scene required it. She experimented with different disciplines of mixed martial arts, worked on sleight of hand tricks and pickpocketing (the latter which she’s “terrible” at because she’s “an awful liar”) and learned to drift in a race car.
One day, while training, stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood handed her two knives to hold while practicing a trapping and grappling sequence. Turns out, Atwell could do her moves faster with the addition of the prop weapons.
“I think it comes from theater – I love working with props on a stage because you can convey so much and they’re an extension of your character,” she says, letting her inner theater nerd geek out. “The way that you stir a cup of tea can tell how much you hate someone you’re talking to, or that you’re trying to seduce them.”
Training for a “M:I” movie is like a boot camp, but it’s not about the aesthetics. It’s about building a different kind of strength and Hayley has the bruises to prove it. “At the time that I came to set, my body was fit for purpose,” Atwell says.
Part of that purpose was developing the shorthand between herself and Cruise so that Grace and Ethan could create an “elegant physicality” when handcuffed together. The duo also brushed up on their classic cinema, watching 70s heist movies like “Paper Moon” and “The Sting,” as well as “The Thomas Crown Affair,” “To Catch a Thief” and “Bringing Up Baby” to build a library of references to pull from tonally.

“When they’re sort of do-si-doing around the car with each other, there is this sense that these two people who are exasperated by each other share an origin story and are naturally working together whether they realize it or not,” Atwell explains.
During the car chase scene, Atwell was not only tasked with drifting the car while handcuffed to Cruise, but also taking performance notes from McQuarrie about adjusting Grace’s reaction to the circumstances. Add onto that the reality of filming with a swarm of fans and paparazzi watching the production speed through the streets. Here, her theater training again paid dividends.
“Live performance is a huge tool for a movie like ‘Mission,’ because when the curtain goes up, you can’t get a retake, and the audience are going to be there to watch if you fall flat on your face, or your downward inflections bore the audience to tears,” she explains. “You get feedback by picking up the atmosphere that that you’re helping to create in that auditorium.”
Atwell compares the atmosphere on set to becoming the eye of the storm, with Cruise leading the charge by maintaining his composure at its absolute center and her following suit. “You’re very calm in the midst of all this noise and stimulation and equipment and changes and locations, and COVID and paparazzi, and journalists and all that stuff,” she says.
The Rome chase takes place in two vehicles — a BMW M5 and a Fiat 500, affectionately nicknamed “Trixie,” for the way the tiny automobile whipped through the Italian streets and accidentally bamboozled Cruise.
“She had sort of a character of herself, which added so much kind of levity to it,” Atwell says of the automobile. “When you see Ethan finally being able to turn it on, and then immediately crash the car — that was real. That hadn’t been intended, and then we used it.”

Embracing those kinds of spontaneous moments are what made production fun. “The plot tends to be a metaphor for the making of a ‘Mission: Impossible’ film,” she explains. “McQ and Tom just go, ‘OK, well, this is what we’ve got today, so let’s actually find a way to use it for the movie.’”
And the idea of borrowing from reality works both ways. You see, when you’re so deeply immersed in a character for the length of time a “M:I” movie takes to make, it stands to reason that some of the skills will transfer. In Atwell’s case, it’s the driving, and now, her fiancé, music producer Ned “Wolfgang” Kelly really doesn’t like riding in the car with her.
“He’s like, ‘Please slow down. It’s quite erratic,’” Atwell says, laughing loudly at a memory of her panicked passenger’s reminder that she’s not in an action film. It’s just that the feeling of your adrenaline rising when you’re behind the wheel can be a little addictive. “It does sort of rub off on you,” she adds. “I have to rein it in a little bit and go, ‘I’m just going to the shop.’”
The training also paid off when Atwell returned to Marvel in 2022’s “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” for an action-packed cameo as Captain Carter. “Because I was so fit at that point, and I’d had such an education about how to move anatomically correctly and making sure that I was safe to do it, I wanted to do all the fighting,” she says. “I wanted it to go on much longer than it did.”
With “Mission,” her “scariest” stunt was the train sequence; it took nearly a year to complete because each car had to be built and filmed separately, with Atwell and Cruise shooting and re-shooting portions of the sequence to find the right tone.
“I’d see on the call sheet a year later that we’re going to spend the afternoon on that vertical train carriage again and be like, ‘Oh God, no, I’m so tired from that,’” she says. “So when you see Ethan going, ‘Do you trust me?’ and Grace just shakes her head — that’s me going, ‘Not anymore. I don’t want to do this anymore. It’s really scary.’ They loved it. They were like, ‘That’s going in.’”
Atwell notes that Cruise, too, gets a case of the nerves when risking his life for stunts. “Tom says it’s not that he doesn’t get nervous and scared, but that fear is OK for him. He accepts the feeling,” she says. “They don’t stop him from doing what he wants or needs to do.”
As for Atwell’s next mission — that’s territory unknown. “One thing at a time,” she says with a bright laugh, noting that “Dead Reckoning Part Two” is barely two-thirds through its shoot. “Jet lag is telling me the thing I want next is a little nap.”

Contrary to common assumptions, the scene was not achieved through CGI wizardry; every heart-pounding moment was captured in real-time. Remarkably, this pulse-pounding sequence was filmed on the very first day of production, setting an adrenaline-fueled tone for the entire film.
To prepare for this death-defying feat, Cruise underwent an intensive and grueling training regimen. His preparation involved an astonishing 500 skydives and over 13,000 motocross jumps. Such dedication and meticulous practice ensured that he was ready to execute the stunt flawlessly.
Astoundingly, Cruise didn't settle for a single take. He filmed the scene an astonishing six times, requiring extensive efforts to restore the location after each take.

Christopher McQuarrie, the writer-director of 2015’s “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation” and the 2018 franchise high point, “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” was working with Cruise on “Top Gun: Maverick ” (which McQuarrie co-wrote and co-produced) when they started talking about their ambitions for the next iteration of “Mission: Impossible.”
Their plan was to make not one but two sequels: Back-to-back blockbusters that would feature even bigger stunts — Cruise envisioned a motorcycle jump-slash-skydive — and a massive train sequence that McQuarrie pined to realize. The heady experience on “Maverick,” a pop-culture juggernaut that grossed nearly $1.5 billion worldwide, only further ratcheted up their aspirations.

2023-07-11 23:29:30+00:00,I did my PhD in Hollywood action films – here’s why Mission: Impossible is the best,The series has come to be characterised largely by Tom Cruise’s spectacular stunts – but what sets them apart are Ethan Hunt’s very human qualities,"Everyone knows Leo Tolstoy’s line about unhappy families, but few are familiar with his lesser known first draft: every insane PhD student goes insane in their own special way.
In my case, this involved watching about 15 different Hollywood action movies over and over again; by the final fortnight before submission, I had the same films playing in a separate tab while I wrote, like background music. A major aspect of my PhD (explaining my exact thesis would take longer than this particular mission briefing has time for) involved exploring the different ways in which Hollywood action films convey emotion through spectacle. Among the films I watched and rewatched were the Mission: Impossible films, which ended up being perhaps the key-est of my key works – for no other Hollywood franchise does action, or emotion, better.
What sets the Mission: Impossible series apart from other action franchises is that behind the explosions – and during them – is a very human story about connection. IMF agent Ethan Hunt may be one of the world’s greatest spies, but he’s also a man with a job that makes it hard to maintain a relationship. Tom Cruise’s performance as Hunt has come to be characterised largely by his stunts, but the Mission: Impossible films are also, at their heart, something closer to domestic drama.
This is occasionally overt: in John Woo’s gloriously melodramatic (and wildly underrated) Mission: Impossible II, many tears are shed over the enigmatic thief Nyah (Thandiwe Newton, with whom it is entirely believable to take five seconds to fall completely in love). In JJ Abrams’ course-correcting Mission: Impossible III (2006), Ethan’s attempts to enjoy married life are undone by the usual challenges (biological warfare, Philip Seymour Hoffman).
Cruise and McQuarrie’s symbiotic creative relationship has revitalised action, stripping away the brain-numbing, physics-defying CGI in favour of making movies the old fashioned way
Action films are often about finding a chosen family and Mission: Impossible is no different: Ethan’s fellow IMF agents Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) are not just his co-workers but his friends. The tension between his willingness to protect them and his desire to save the world is, by now, stretched to breaking point. And Ethan meets his match in the form of MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) in the fifth film Rogue Nation (2015). Their meet-cute – kicking the shit out of a room full of terrorists – is one for the ages. Their relationship has deepened from Howard Hawks-esque screwball caper to something more complex: a true meeting of equals.

The Mission: Impossible films helmed by writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (Rogue Nation, Fallout and Dead Reckoning Part One, so far) have been met with critical acclaim and box office glory. Cruise and McQuarrie’s symbiotic creative relationship has revitalised action, stripping away the brain-numbing, physics-defying CGI seen in many blockbusters in favour of making movies the old-fashioned way: strapping a big star to a fast-moving object and praying you don’t capture a snuff film.
But the ongoing Cruise-McQuarrie collaboration is also notable for its focus on the emotional stakes of Ethan and his team’s adventures. Key to this is its star’s generosity in sharing the spotlight. One gets the sense that he won’t rest until the franchise has been taken over by women, making the series an outlier in a masculine milieu. (By comparison, Fast and Furious’ female stars have reported their frustration over their characters being sidelined.) These women are complex and morally ambiguous, more like Joan Crawford’s Vienna in Nicholas Ray’s Johnny Guitar than any of the interchangeable girlfriends of 21st century action. The camp charge of Vanessa Kirby’s arms dealer White Widow, cut through with knowing pain; or Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff’s debut turns in Dead Reckoning Part One, delivering performances so captivating that I now regret not pushing my submission date back a month.

Over the last four years, I have seen more of Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby than some members of my family. When I sat down at my desk each morning, I felt I was clocking on for another day with particularly beloved co-workers. And as I reached the finish line, a carrot dangled: a new Mission: Impossible movie, premiering mere moments after I was due to submit.

I travelled to Sydney for the premiere of Dead Reckoning Part One, and dressed the only way I know how: by paying tribute to Ethan’s best look (his all-black ensemble in Mission: Impossible II) with my PhD dangling from my ear on a thumb drive. (There’s always a USB stick in a Mission: Impossible movie.)
If Top Gun: Maverick was a metatextual ode to making movies like they used to, Dead Reckoning Part One has a lot to say, allegorically, about the rise of algorithm-powered streaming and misinformation. The fact it was filmed during Covid-19 lends its quieter moments (and some of its louder ones) an eerie quality that recalls the paranoia of Brian de Palma’s early-80s thrillers; many nods are given to De Palma’s Mission: Impossible (1996), including one throwback line of dialogue that nobody else in my giant cinema laughed at. There is a thrilling sword fight almost operatic in its intensity. And, yes, that motorcycle stunt, the stress of which will age you 15 years. It’s everything you could want from a blockbuster.
The PhD’s reputation for psychic damage precedes it. When you respond to polite inquiries about your day job with, “I’m actually doing a PhD”, people say things like “Oh no” and “God, I’m sorry”. My PhD “journey” began in 2019, weathered a global catastrophe and a 7.1-magnitude earthquake, and ended in the most perfect way possible: being blasted back in my seat and hanging on with a white-knuckle grip while Ethan Hunt and his team try to save the world.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjMvanVsLzEyL2Jlc3QtYWN0aW9uLW1vdmllLWZyYW5jaGlzZXMtbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxl0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2ZpbG0vMjAyMy9qdWwvMTIvYmVzdC1hY3Rpb24tbW92aWUtZnJhbmNoaXNlcy1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGU?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-13 00:00:00+00:00,Kittridge Is Back: Henry Czerny Talks ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ and How He Almost Returned to the Franchise Earlier,'Mission: Impossible 7' actor Henry Czerny talks his return as Kittridge to the franchise.,"Henry Czerny received a mission from filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie and chose to accept it.
That mission? Return as former IMF chief Eugene Kittridge in “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” 27 years after he first appeared in the original “Mission: Impossible” in 1996.
At the “Dead Reckoning” premiere in New York, Czerny said when he first got the call about returning to the “Mission: Impossible” world, he didn’t believe it.
“I think it’s a joke at first because my reps called me and said they want to bring Kittridge back and I’m in the middle of doing my errands in Los Angeles and fighting traffic or shredding old tax documents,” he told Variety. “I think, ‘Okay, what’s going on really?’ They say, ‘Chris McQuarrie wants to talk to you about bringing Kittridge back,’ and I take it seriously. Two days later, I’m on a call with Chris McQuarrie.”
Czerny revealed that that McQuarrie, who began writing and directing the series with 2015’s “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation,” originally wanted Kittridge back “a couple of installments ago.” In “Rogue Nation,” Alec Baldwin came onboard as Alan Hunley, the director of the CIA, who became Secretary of the Impossible Missions Force in 2018’s “Fallout.” Czerny wouldn’t reveal any of the previous plans for Kittridge’s original return, but said, “I’m thrilled that Alec came and did Hunley, that’s for sure. That was great, I love that.”
In “Dead Reckoning,” Kittridge is back, but this time as the new CIA director. He’s taking over from Angela Bassett’s Erika Sloane, who appears in a photograph in the opening scene with all the heads of national security. (Bassett was unavailable to return due to the COVID-19 production delays, and McQuarrie teased that she, like Czerny, might return: “Angela is too fabulous, you could never ever let Angela get away, so there’s always a plan in the future.”)
Just like the original “Mission: Impossible,” Kittridge is still causing problems for Tom Cruise‘s IMF agent Ethan Hunt. In that film, Kittridge believed Hunt, as the lone survivor of a setup that killed his entire IMF team, was the mole that the agency had been trying to track down and attempted to bring him in. Disavowed by the agency and with Kittridge on his heels, Hunt spends the duration of the film trying to complete the mission and clear his name.
In “Dead Reckoning,” Kittridge wants to control the “Entity,” an all-powerful AI algorithm that could bring the world to its knees, and orders Hunt to secure two halves of a key that will unlock it. But Hunt realizes the Entity is too much for one government organization to handle, so he disobeys commands and crosses the globe to retrieve the keys to secure it himself.
The chase for the keys brings Hunt, Kittridge and the rest of the “Dead Reckoning” cast aboard a train in a thrillingly destructive third act. Fans of the original “Mission: Impossible” will remember the finale of the first movie also took place on a train (and one ill-fated helicopter).
“There are a whole bunch of Easter eggs for people if they’re interested,” Czerny said. “The last time you see him in the first one, he’s on a train, and this one you see him on a train as well with another Vanessa, Redgrave and Vanessa Kirby.”
In the first “Mission: Impossible,” Vanessa Redgrave played Max Mitsopolis, a black-market arms dealer who gave information to Hunt and was later apprehended by Kittridge. In “Fallout” and “Dead Reckoning,” Vanessa Kirby plays Alanna, Max’s daughter, who continues the family business.
In the 27 years between his “Mission: Impossible,” appearances, Czerny says the outrageous stunts have only gotten better and better.
“They’ve honed it down to what you have here, which is incredibly delicious,” he said. “Nothing is extraneous, and they know the craft so well. They know the franchise so very well. What you experience is a very tight, action-packed, heartfelt movie about friendship and what to do when you’re stuck between a rock and a hard place.”
Despite appearing in the start to the epic film franchise, Czerny revealed “Dead Reckoning Part One” is his new favorite entry. “Previous to this one, ‘Fallout’ was my favorite,” he said. “And, due respect to everyone in ‘Fallout,’ this eclipses it. It’s great.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvaGVucnktY3plcm55LW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1ldWdlbmUta2l0dHJpZGdlLTEyMzU2Njg0NzEv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9oZW5yeS1jemVybnktbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWV1Z2VuZS1raXR0cmlkZ2UtMTIzNTY2ODQ3MS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-11 16:00:00+00:00,Mission: Impossible 7 resolves mystery about Vanessa Kirby's White Widow,"White Widow explained - Vanessa Kirby returns as the White Widow in Mission: Impossible 7, but which previous character is she related to?","Vanessa Kirby returns as Alanna Mitsopolis, aka the White Widow, in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, and you might have forgotten about her link to the series' past.
Mission: Impossible – Fallout revealed that Alanna is the daughter of arms dealer Max, played by Vanessa Redgrave in the first Mission: Impossible movie. She's continued the family business and moved into philanthropy funded by her illegal activities.
Fallout also established that Alanna works with the CIA now and then as a broker, such as when she helps to return Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) to MI6 to exonerate Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson).
But given that her mother almost sold the list of the US government's most secret agents and their true identities to many bad guys, it never made sense how Alanna was openly allowed to continue her business.
Mission: Impossible 7 solves that mystery by revealing something about Max's past.
Mild spoilers ahead if you haven't seen the new movie yet.
Paramount
During Dead Reckoning Part One's action-packed climax, Alanna meets up with new CIA director Kittridge (Henry Czerny), planning to sell him the key that will grant him access to the Entity so that he can control it for the US's benefit.
(It's not really Alanna, though — it's Hayley Atwell's Grace in a White Widow mask. But that doesn't affect what's revealed.)
Before Alanna and Kittridge get down to the business of controlling the world, he remarks that he knew her ""late mother"". When Alanna makes further demands (well, really, when Grace tries to make a deal for herself), Kittridge says it's only because of Max that Alanna has been allowed to carry on the family business.
It appears that after she was captured, Max made a deal with the US government to give them intel on the various bad guys she was dealing with. In return, they left her alone to carry on her business and, in turn, allowed her daughter the same luxury.
Paramount
Given the various dodgy dealings we've seen in the US government during the Mission: Impossible series, it's perhaps not a surprise that instead of punishing a fairly serious crime, Kittridge used it as an opportunity to gain more knowledge.
He'd originally been doing it for the IMF, but it appears that no matter where he moved in the US government agencies, he kept his link open to Max and then Alanna whenever he had to get his hands dirty. It's certainly done him no harm for his career, even if he doesn't get his hands on the Entity key this time.
Alanna's link to the series' past certainly isn't lost on Vanessa Kirby, as she told Digital Spy she rewatched a key scene between Ethan Hunt and Max in the first movie for her role.
""It's so strange to think that Vanessa Redgrave played my mother and [Tom Cruise] did that incredible scene with her in the car where she's really playing with him. I watched it a thousand times to try and remotely emulate what she did,"" she recalled.

It’s going to exceed Paramount’s 90-day theatrical window. The power of Tom Cruise! Expect something similar for Christopher Nolan and “Oppenheimer,” which has a 100-day window and might only be made available on VOD in November.
It’s no secret that movie theaters are currently in a desperate predicament. As studios are hysterically looking for answers to their underperforming summer blockbusters, it’s quite obvious that VOD has become a major source of income for them.
The pandemic forced studios to stream much of their new content. Many moviegoers realized just how much more comfortable, and less headache-inducing, it was to stream at home than to go to their local cineplex.
You can now just stay in, save parking money, and not endure any of the annoyances that come with watching a movie in public — who wants someone texting and talking right next to them during a movie? It’s become an epidemic at the local multiplex.
I get it, nobody wants a person pulling out their stupid bright phone out and scrolling during a movie. Moviegoers are rude now. You even see it infiltrating film festivals, including Cannes.
Nowadays, If I want to buy a movie ticket I make sure that it’s a showtime that won’t be too busy and I try to sit as far away from a crowd or pack of people, to save myself from having to tell them to shut up or put that goddamn phone down.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndvcmxkb2ZyZWVsLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjMvNy9ubjhrcXZmNTJrNmcxZDVycjdrbTdzOTkwMmVhNG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,Tom Cruise and Hayley Atwell Spotted Leaving London Screening of 'Mission: Impossible 7',Tom Cruise and Hayley Atwell rocked monochrome looks as they left a London venue separately after a Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One screening,"Tom Cruise and Hayley Atwell are celebrating their new film across the pond!
The Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One stars were photographed leaving a screening of the action movie separately at the Dolby Screening Room London Soho on Wednesday evening.
Both Cruise, 60, and Atwell, 41, looked stylish for the event, with the latter rocking a monochrome ensemble consisting of a white button-up shirt tucked into a pair of cream-colored trousers. She finished the look in a pair of orange peep-toe heeled sandals and carried a large red bag.
Cruise, meanwhile, looked both casual and sleek in all black, wearing a polo shirt, slacks and matching shoes. The actor topped off the look not entirely unlike the way his Top Gun: Maverick character might — in a pair of aviator sunglasses — as he smiled and waved to photographers.

While Cruise and Atwell have been seen out and about together multiple times over the years — including at the 2021 Wimbledon women's singles finals, alongside costar Pom Klementieff — a source told PEOPLE in December 2020 that they were not dating.
""Not true at all!"" the insider said.
Cruise hasn't dated anyone publicly since his 2012 divorce from Katie Holmes. The two welcomed daughter Suri, now 17, during their six-year marriage.
The actor was also married to Nicole Kidman from 1990 to 2001. They share daughter Isabella, 30, and son Connor, 28.

Cruise reprises his role as Ethan Hunt in the upcoming seventh Mission: Impossible movie, the franchise's first entry since 2018.
In the film, Hunt and his team are tasked with tracking down ""a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity before it falls into the wrong hands,"" according to an official synopsis for the film. Additionally, the plot promises ""a deadly race around the globe"" throughout the movie.
""Confronted by a mysterious, all-powerful enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than his mission — not even the lives of those he cares about most,"" the synopsis adds.
Cruise, Atwell and Klementieff, 37, are joined by a large ensemble cast for the latest Mission: Impossible film, including Ving Rhames, Esai Morales, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Mariela Garriga, Henry Czerny, Shea Whigham, Greg Tarzan Davis, Charles Parnell, Frederick Schmidt, Cary Elwes, Mark Gatiss, Indira Varma and Rob Delaney.
The movie is written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, a longtime collaborator of Cruise's, who directed the previous two Mission: Impossible films and wrote Top Gun: Maverick. McQuarrie, 54, is also making the upcoming sequel Dead Reckoning Part Two, which is expected in 2024.

,Mission: Impossible 7 director says next entry will fix past problem that left Tom Cruise ‘dissatisfied’,‘Dead Reckoning Part Two’ is currently in production,"Christopher McQuarrie, the director of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, has claimed that the forthcoming sequel will address a regret from a previous film.
The filmmaker, who has directed the last four entries in the popular Mission: Impossible action franchise, spoke in a new interview about him and Cruise being “dissatisfied” with aspects of the fifth instalment, 2015’s Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation.
The sequence in question was set underwater.
“Tom and I are constantly re-evaluating our own work and asking ourselves how we could have done it better,” McQuarrie said, in an interview with Collider.
McQuarrie and Cruise previously worked together on films including the 2014 sci-fi thriller Edge of Tomorrow, which McQuarrie co-wrote and produced.
“We’ve done underwater sequences previously. We’ve worked underwater in Edge of Tomorrow, and we worked underwater in Rogue Nation, and we left very dissatisfied with those sequences,” McQuarrie continued.
“And we analyse why we were dissatisfied. What were all the factors working against us? The biggest being, not having real knowledge in that area. Everything you’re looking at in Dead Reckoning is the application of knowledge from previous sequences.”
McQuarrie revealed that Dead Reckoning Part Two will feature ambitious underwater sequences, which required Tom Cruise to hold his breath for long periods of time.

According to the director, Cruise was able to hold his breath underwater for up to six and a half minutes. However, McQuarrie said that doing so was “physically punishing”, adding that he wouldn’t “recommend it to anybody who doesn’t want to make a lifestyle out of it”.
In a four-star review of Dead Reckoning Part One for The Independent, Clarisse Loughrey wrote: “Mission: Impossible is exactly the sort of franchise in which people simply roll their eyes when the bomb they’re trying to detonate turns out (of course!) to be a nuclear one. That lack of ponderousness is embedded bone-deep into Dead Reckoning, and how returning director Christopher McQuarrie chooses to operate.
“The action sequences are consistently dynamic, and always adapted to their environment: a shoot-out in a sandstorm focuses on stealth and precision, while a Vespa chase down Rome’s many staircases is all cartoon chaos. It all culminates in an absolutely insane stunt in which Cruise drives a motorcycle off a cliff and then parachutes down onto a moving train. You will leave Dead Reckoning the same way you always do: wondering how Cruise could possibly outdo himself in the next one – until, inevitably, he does.”

2023-06-26 15:29:18+00:00,"Blockbuster Pileup: Can ‘Oppenheimer,’ ‘Barbie,’ ‘Indiana Jones 5’ and ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ All Survive in the Same Month?",Can several back-to-back blockbusters succeed at once? Or will the glut of big movies cannibalize each other?,"At the end of last summer, Flix Brewhouse faced a dire situation, albeit one that wasn’t unique to the Texas-based movie theater chain. There weren’t any movies to show in August.
“We were going to A24 or Briarcliff Entertainment saying, ‘Does anyone have anything we can put on our screens?” recalls Chris Randleman, the company’s chief revenue officer.
That’s not the case this summer as exhibitors grapple with a different reality. Can several back-to-back blockbusters succeed at once? Or will the glut of big movies cannibalize each other?
Those are the big questions as popcorn season kicks into high gear with the arrivals of Harrison Ford’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” (June 30), Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” (July 12), Greta Gerwig’s neon-coated “Barbie” (July 21) and Christopher Nolan’s atomic bomb drama “Oppenheimer” (also on July 21). All of those films carry big budgets and require outsized ticket sales to turn a profit.
“It’s complete day and night,” Randleman says. “In the last two years, if something failed, we didn’t have anything for six weeks. Now if something tanks, you move onto the next one. That’s the way Hollywood always worked.”
The hope is that all of these films will find their audiences. However, Paul Dergarabedian, a senior analyst at Comscore, calls the month-long stretch between “Indiana Jones 5” through “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” one of the most competitive periods in recent memory.
“This will be a stress test for the theatrical marketplace in the most important moviegoing season of the year,” he says. “The stakes are incredibly high.”
So far, Hollywood’s attempts this year at counter-programming have been disastrous. But that’s because audiences didn’t have an overwhelming desire to watch “The Flash” or Pixar’s “Elemental,” not because those movies were scheduled too close together.
Even as the box office recovers in fits and starts, there are signs that even in the pandemic era, several films can work at the same time. A prime example can be found in last summer’s debut of “Jurassic World Dominion,” which scored a mighty $145 million opening, even as Cruise’s enduring hit “Top Gun: Maverick” pulled in $51.8 million in its third weekend. Another weekend in the middle of 2022, four movies — Baz Luhrmann’s biopic “Elvis” and Blumhouse’s thriller “The Black Phone,” in addition to “Maverick” and “Jurassic World Dominion” — each grossed $20 million or more in the same Friday to Sunday frame. It’s a sign that this summer’s crop of newcomers can co-exist beyond their opening weekends — so long as ticket buyers care to see them.
“It’s all about quality,” says Armand Daiguillon, who owns Paradigm Cinemas in South Florida. “Everything looks good on the horizon. But if the movies aren’t great, people will wait a month until they are available on streaming.”
Movie theater owners believe the range of offerings will appeal to moviegoers of all demographics. “It’s the right mix of movies to not only survive but thrive off one another,” says Randleman. He’s particularly high on “Barbie” because pre-sale tickets at his theaters have already been surging. “I think it’ll be the true breakout of the summer,” he adds. “Everyone can survive. We have enough screens.”
Daiguillon of Paradigm Cinema, however, is cautiously optimistic about a potential pileup. “It would have been better if they separated things a little more,” he says. “We have a whole summer. These movies are all back-to-back in the same month.”
He’s particularly concerned about the space between family offerings, like “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken,” which opens shortly after Pixar’s “Elemental,” and Disney’s “Haunted Mansion,” which arrives just a few weeks later.
“I wish there was at least another week between the kids stuff,” Daiguillon says. “Theaters do a lot of business with summer camps. If all the movies come out at once, there’s nothing for them to see later on.”
At least, Hollywood didn’t forget about August, which is ripe for a sleeper hit. On the calendar, there’s the animated “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” R-rated comedy “Strays” and “Meg 2: The Trench.” Those movies aren’t (yet) part of franchises as big as “Mission: Impossible” or from filmmakers as beloved as Gerwig or Nolan. But “The Trench,” for one, is the sequel to 2018’s disaster epic “The Meg,” which grossed $530 million worldwide. Says Randleman, “Never bet against a shark movie.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvanVseS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJhcmJpZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtNy0xMjM1NjU0MTAwL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvanVseS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJhcmJpZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtNy0xMjM1NjU0MTAwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-06-30 21:22:49+00:00,Hayley Atwell’s ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Screen Test Was ‘Two Hours of Stunt Choreography’ So the Team Could ‘See My Natural Abilities’,"Haley Atwell spent two hours in stunt training for her ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" screen test.","Everything is supercharged when it comes to the long-running “Mission: Impossible” franchise, and that extends to the movie’s audition process. In a recent interview with The Telegraph, Hayley Atwell revealed that her screen test for the mysterious role of Grace in the two-part “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning” required a two-hour screen test that was essentially a stunt training course. Some actors screen test with dialogue, but not “Mission: Impossible” actors.
“Who the character has become is a byproduct of the process,” the film’s writer-director Christopher McQuarrie said. “So when we went into the screen test, we’ve not written a character that we’re trying to find someone to fit with. Rather, we’re looking for an actress who we want to work with and we’ll fit the character to her.”’
Atwell’s screen test was with stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood and was made up of “two hours of stunt choreography just to see where my natural abilities lay,” she said.
“We did an unarmed combat sequence and mixed martial arts to see if I was someone who could grapple and trap or someone who was more into high kicks,” Atwell added. “[It’s to] ascertain my natural style.”
Once McQuarrie and Cruise decided Atwell was the perfect actor to bring Grace to life, they went about constructing the character to fit Atwell’s stunt capabilities. She went through an additional five months of stunt training after accepting the role.
“From the physical training we discovered that I was a quick learner through sleight-of-hand tricks and using a prop – so my character is an opportunist who can take an inanimate object and make a weapon out of it, rather than someone who is slick and skilled and formally trained,” Atlwell said about the process. “From that, this inconsistent character emerged: someone who is spontaneous, quite unpredictable, but not calculating.”
Atwell added of her character, “Tom and McQuarrie were interested in finding a different kind of tone for this film than we’d seen before – and a character who had a relationship with Tom that felt more cat and mouse, two people who through circumstances and pressure find themselves in each other’s company but they’re exasperated by each other. So therein will lie the chemistry between them, but also some of the comedic elements in the film.”

Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One has become the new owner of an unwanted box office record.
Tom Cruise reprises his role as the iconic superspy Ethan Hunt, but the movie suffered the biggest second-weekend box office drop in the series' history.
There was an estimated 64% drop in gross earnings after it took $19.5 million domestically.
Over its opening weekend, Dead Reckoning earned $56.2 million domestically and $80 million over its five-day opening week.

Mission Impossible 2, the previous franchise record holder for a second-weekend drop, saw a 53.3% dip in box office revenue during its theatrical run in 2000.
Dead Reckoning's drop comes on the same weekend that box office juggernauts Barbie and Oppenheimer both opened to great success in cinemas, with Oppenheimer specifically pulling Mission Impossible off premium format screens (IMAX) because of an exhibitor agreement with director Christopher Nolan.
Barbie, in particular, achieved the best preview numbers of the year, grossing $22.3 million in Thursday previews, while over the weekend it earned $337 million globally. Oppenheimer's opening weekend figures currently stand at $174.2 million globally.

6/26/2023 21:20,Still Cruising: Tom premieres new ‘Mission Impossible’ adventure in Abu Dhabi,Tom Cruise has graced the red carpet in Abu Dhabi for the Middle Eastern premiere of “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.”,"ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The red carpet unfurled Monday in Abu Dhabi for Hollywood action megastar Tom Cruise, who was on hand for the Middle Eastern premiere of “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.”
Cruise was met by an enthusiastic crowd of fans and movie buffs eager to catch a glimpse of the star at the Emirates Palace Hotel in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.
Dressed in a tailored tuxedo and flashing his signature smile, Cruise appeared moved by the exuberant reception, stopping to speak with many attendees. The evening’s buzz was punctuated by the “Mission: Impossible” theme, its familiar chords adding a layer of cinematic nostalgia to the night.
“I’m a cinephile, I love movies and the history of cinema and how this art form develops,” Cruise told The Associated Press on the red carpet. “I didn’t know whether the audience was going to embrace (the first Mission: Impossible movie), it was the first film I ever produced and I did it because I wanted to challenge myself in many ways as an actor, as a producer, as a storyteller.”
“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is the seventh installment of the blockbuster $3.5 billion grossing franchise famed for jam-packed action and ever-daring stunts performed by the 60-year-old Cruise himself.
“We’ve had a lot of fun coming up with these moments,” said Cruise.
The Mission: Impossible series follows the globe-trotting adventures of Ethan Hunt, a secret agent of the Impossible Missions Force, or IMF, as he undertakes high-risk covert operations. Picture heart-racing action, sophisticated gadgets, and Cruise’s Hunt executing death-defying stunts at every turn.
Matching the topic of the moment, Hunt and his IMF team are tasked with tracking down a potent new artificial intelligence weapon in “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.” Scenes include base-jumping off a cliff on a motorcycle, hurling a steam train off an exploded bridge, and drifting a yellow Fiat 500 through Rome’s winding streets.
In a nod to the locale, the film incorporates several action sequences in Abu Dhabi. The desert landscapes of Liwa, known as the Empty Quarter, set the stage for intense horseback chases and firearm confrontations. Cruise runs across the dune-shaped roof of Abu Dhabi International Airport’s new Midfield Terminal in another scene.
“When you see us shooting a sequence in Abu Dhabi, it’s about that culture, it’s about that country, and that’s why we keep coming back here,” said Christopher McQuarrie, who is returning for the third time as director of the high-octane spy series.
McQuarrie joined Cruise on the red carpet along with other Mission: Impossible co-stars, both new and returning. Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff made their franchise debut, while Simon Pegg reprised his role as Benji Dunn, a character known for infusing comedic relief into the franchise’s most tense scenes.
“When you have a film which is high-tension you need that to occasionally be injected in order to make it a little bit more enjoyable,” said Pegg.
Following pandemic delays, the production companies behind the franchise, Paramount Pictures and Skydance, pushed the film’s release from September of 2022 to July of 2023. A leaked video from the set featured Cruise launching an expletive-laden rant at colleagues after he reportedly spotted two crew members failing to respect social distancing rules. The star expressed his concern about the potential consequences, which included shutting down production and jeopardizing the then-struggling movie industry and the jobs it supports.
“We just had to write the rulebook on how to make a film during a pandemic,” said Pegg. “Make sure everything was super safe, that was Tom’s biggest challenge in a way was to make us all feel safe and be safe, somehow we muddle through.”
Cruise was praised by many for his role in revitalizing Hollywood following the industry’s pandemic-induced stagnation. This recognition came on the heels of his blockbuster film, “Top Gun: Maverick,” which not only marked Cruise’s first $100 million debut but also signified the return of blockbuster movies to theaters as the most significant movie debut since the onset of the pandemic.

2023-07-15 16:15:00+00:00,"Pom Klementieff’s ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Villain Was Inspired by Bruce Lee, Clint Eastwood, ‘Kill Bill’ … and a Shoebill Stork",The star of 'Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' reveals how she 'manifested' her role as villain Paris.,"Named after a word that sounds similar in Korean to both “spring” and “tiger,” Pom Klementieff has appropriately showcased ebullience and viciousness throughout her career — and especially in the past few months. In May, she reprised her role as Mantis in “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” empathetically shepherding her fellow outcasts through an adventure to save Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) from unapologetic MCU villain the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). She also appears in “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” as Paris, a ruthless assassin who will stop at nothing to kill Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and anyone else who gets in her way.
Ahead of “Dead Reckoning Part One,” Klementieff spoke to Variety about her character in the film, whose backstory she worked closely with Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie to develop. In addition to talking about how she “manifested” the opportunity to be a part of the franchise, she revealed the panorama of influences — from Jean-Paul Belmondo to animal videos on YouTube — she enlisted to ensure that audiences never forget Paris.
“She’s a pretty mysterious character that doesn’t speak much, but the beauty of it is that when she speaks, everyone listens,” says Klementieff.
Paris possesses an almost sociopathic glee as she works for Gabriel [Esai Morales]. What was her backstory?
My character, I think, is on a path of destruction and she’s a very skilled fighter, and she enjoys to fight and to kill people. But there is also an underlying feeling of betrayal and of loneliness from being an orphan, so there’s a deep wound underneath. There’s a lot of things that I came up with myself, because what Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise do is cast the actors, and then they build the character around the actor’s abilities.
Tom Cruise is famous for performing his own stunts. Which of your own stunts did you request to do?
We trained very hard with [stunt coordinator] Wade Eastwood. But I had been training for years with a martial artist who taught me how to punch, how to kick, so I had been doing kickboxing, boxing, taekwondo. It was my dream to be part of “Mission: Impossible.” When I was training years ago, sometimes in my schedule, instead of writing “martial arts” or “stunt training,” I would write “Mission: Impossible,” because I wanted to manifest it.
What films did you watch for inspiration ahead of being in an action scene?
Quentin Tarantino is one of my favorite directors, so of course I always watch “Kill Bill.” I watched movies with Bruce Lee, with Jackie Chan and some French movies as well, because it was not just about the fight and the physicality — it was also the way the character walks. I was inspired by movies with Jean-Paul Belmondo to find a cockiness to the character. And movies with Clint Eastwood, Takeshi Kitano, all these beautiful characters that barely speak but convey so many emotions as well.
There’s a physicality to so many of your roles. How intentional has that been?
I think it just happened. I’m not a Method actor. It comes naturally. For this movie, I would watch videos of animals, and I was inspired by a bird — the shoebill stork — for the physicality of the character, [the way it] turns slowly and stares, and I thought that it looked like me a little bit.
How much do you want action to be a cornerstone of your career going forward?
I’m dying to do more action, but it has to be the right project and the right director. That’s the beauty of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise — it’s not just an action movie. It’s beautiful storytelling with incredible filmmakers. Recently I shot something that I’m really proud of, a short movie with BMW called “The Calm.” Sam Hargrave, who did “Extraction,” directed it, and I was shooting this fight scene inside a car. I love doing very intricate things. And when there’s limitations, it’s even more exciting.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLXBvbS1rbGVtZW50aWVmZi10b20tY3J1aXNlLTEyMzU2Njg3NTUv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctcG9tLWtsZW1lbnRpZWZmLXRvbS1jcnVpc2UtMTIzNTY2ODc1NS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-15 15:22:48+00:00,Box Office: ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One’ Now Cruising to Projected $78 Million Five-Day Debut,"Tom Cruise's ""Mission: Impossible 7"" is coming in below its $90 million projections, while ticket sales for ""Sound of Freedom"" are up 17%.","Paramount’s “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” is defusing a bit at the domestic box office, readjusting for an estimated $78 million gross over its five-day opening. That’d be a substantial chunk behind projections headed into the weekend, which had the Tom Cruise action sequel hoping for $90 million.
Some in the industry were expecting a “Top Gun: Maverick” halo effect for “Dead Reckoning” after last year’s legacy sequel positively ignited movie theaters, rocketing through the summer to become the fifth-highest grossing domestic release of all-time. That doesn’t seem to be the case though, as “Mission” isn’t exactly transcending the numbers typical for its franchise.
The last entry, 2018’s “Fallout,” launched with a then-franchise record $61 million over three days. “Dead Reckoning” opened on Wednesday, plus previews on Tuesday evening — a bump-up in the calendar that the industry suspects was implemented to take advantage of premium ticket prices for Imax. Universal and director Christopher Nolan take over those auditoriums next weekend with their sweeping historical drama “Oppenheimer.”
Tom Cruise may have fostered a reputation as the global vanguard for movie theaters over the past few years — “I love my popcorn,” he declared in a new video this week — but it’s worth a reminder that his films aren’t the biggest openers on the block. Instead, they tend to draw older audiences, who are less inclined to roll out for a new release in the first few days. “Top Gun: Maverick” is the star’s superlative multiplier, taking its $126 million three-day debut to a $718 million finish, but “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” more than tripled its opening weekend, as did the 2015 entry “Rogue Nation.”
As “Dead Reckoning” falls behind opening estimates, the franchise will need to find those kinds of legs again. This seventh franchise entry is the most expensive yet — with a production budget that ballooned to $290 million, not only due to its high-octane set pieces but also a series of COVID-related production delays and safety measures. (“We are the gold standard!” Cruise shouted at crew members he caught breaking protocols in 2020.) That’s more than $100 million higher than the price tag for “Fallout.”
Strong word-of-mouth should be helpful. The “Mission” series is now a favorite among critics for its daredevil stunts, intricate set pieces and wry humor. Variety chief film critic Peter Debruge filed a rave for “Dead Reckoning,” writing that it “delivers a formidable concept and several hall-of-fame set-pieces while somehow managing to tie the storylines back into these movies’ core mythology.” He’s far from an outlier, as the film stands with a 92% approval rating from top critics on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences are also exhilarated, as indicated by the “A” Cinema Score grade determined by surveying ticket buyers.
“Mission: Impossible” will also look to register strongly overseas, where the franchise has become a strong draw. Both “Fallout” and “Rogue Nation” earned more than 70% of their ticket sales in foreign markets. So far, “Dead Reckoning” has earned $82.1 million across 70 international territories through its first three days of release.
“Dead Reckoning” sees Tom Cruise back as secret agent Ethan Hunt, recruiting his crew of super-spies to take on a very scary and very topical enemy: an all-powerful artificial intelligence called the Entity. Christopher McQuarrie returns to direct after helming the last two entries. Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby and Henry Czerny make series returns, while newcomers Hayley Atwell, Esai Morales, Pom Klementieff, Cary Elwes and Rob Delaney join the fray.
Even with Cruise driving motorcycles off cliffs and chasing criminals around Europe, there is perhaps a more remarkable box office narrative continuing to unfold this weekend. Angel Studios’ “Sound of Freedom” continues to show strength as a bona fide word-of-mouth monster. Major studios are projecting a $23 million haul through the weekend — which would mark a sizable 17% uptick from its gross last weekend.
Wide releases hardly ever see week-to-week rises in ticket sales, but “Sound of Freedom” isn’t a typical wide release. After being shelved by Disney during the shuffle of the 21st Century Fox acquisition, the Jim Caviezel thriller was eventually taken on by Angel Studios. The Utah-based banner has employed a “Pay It Forward” system, encouraging viewers to donate money to the company so that it can purchase and distribute tickets to other prospective audience members looking to see the film at no cost. But a release doesn’t go up in ticket sales just based on an untraditional system — with its glowing “A+” grade on Cinema Score and lots of chatter on social media, “Sound of Freedom” is a phenomenon, particularly among conservative audiences.
The film, which has been scrutinized by anti-trafficking experts, tells the story of real-life ex-fed Tim Ballard, who left the government to take on human trafficking through his own means. Ballard founded the non-profit Operation Underground Railroad, though he has reportedly parted ways with the organization more recently.
Sony’s “Insidious: The Red Door” looks to take third place, projecting a $12.6 million haul through Sunday. That would mark a sizable 62% tumble from its opening last weekend, when the horror sequel debuted on top of domestic charts. The Screen Gems, Stage 6 Films and Blumhouse co-production carries a modest $17 million production budget — a figure that its $54 million domestic gross has already far surpassed.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is facing a 59%-or-so drop in its third weekend. The Harrison Ford finale added $3.3 million on Friday, pushing its domestic total to $136 million. The Disney release will soon surpass “Fast X” ($145 million) to become one of the top 10 domestic releases of the year; it’d be more remarkable if it weren’t for the film’s whopping $300 million production budget.
Disney also looks to round out the top five with the Pixar romance “Elemental.” The animated feature added $2.6 million on Friday, stretching its domestic haul to $119 million. “Elemental” bombed upon release, landing Pixar’s lowest opening in history ($29 million), but it has held remarkably well in the weeks since, continuing to draw family crowds. While it won’t recoup its $200 million production budget in North America, things seemed far bleaker just a few weeks ago.
Opening in limited release, Disney is putting out the ensemble comedy “Theater Camp” out under its Searchlight Pictures banner. The indie release, starring Molly Gordon and Ben Platt, looks to capitalize on strong notices out of the Sundance Film Festival. The film is opening in six theaters in Los Angeles and New York, earning $109,000 on Friday.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLTctcHJvamVjdGVkLW9wZW5pbmctd2Vla2VuZC10b20tY3J1aXNlLTEyMzU2NzA4NDAv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vYm94LW9mZmljZS9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtNy1wcm9qZWN0ZWQtb3BlbmluZy13ZWVrZW5kLXRvbS1jcnVpc2UtMTIzNTY3MDg0MC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-17 05:27:30+00:00,China Box Office: ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Opens Soft in Third Place,Box office data for the first half of 2023 has made Hollywood's new normal in China painfully clear: much smaller hits and far more flops.,"Tom Cruise failed to do the seemingly impossible in China over the weekend: revive Hollywood’s former box office muscle at the world’s second-biggest theatrical movie market.
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One badly lost its opening weekend in China, debuting in third place behind a pair of holdover Chinese hits.
The Paramount and Skydance sequel opened to just $25.9 million from Friday to Sunday, a steep tumble from Mission: Impossible Fallout‘s $76 million opening back in 2018. Chinese martial arts drama Never Say Never, meanwhile, earned $46.1 million, followed by local animation hit Chang An with $43.9 million.
Never Say Never, written and directed by local comedy favorite Wang Baoqiang (Lost in Thailand, Detective Chinatown), has brought in a healthy $211.5 million since its July 6 opening. Chang An, the latest release from pioneering Beijing-based animation studio Light Chaser, launched July 8 and has a current total of $96.1 million.
Ticketing app Maoyan forecasts Mission: Impossible 7 to finish its China run with just $60 million, down from M:I 6‘s $181 million total in 2018 and M:I 5‘s $136.7 million haul in 2015.
Local reviews for Cruise’s latest turn as Ethan Hunt have been notably strong. The film scored 9.4 on Maoyan, 9.5 on Alibaba’s Tao Piao Piao and 7.9 on Douban — very healthy numbers. But Chinese filmgoers just aren’t coming out for American movies the way they once did.
China’s theatrical box office results for the first half of 2023 became available earlier this month — and the numbers are pretty grim for Hollywood.
After abruptly lifting its strict COVID-19 lockdowns late last year, China has resumed importing U.S. movies at pre-pandemic levels in 2023, one of Beijing’s many moves intended to signal to the world that it is back open for business. In the first half of 2023, 24 U.S. titles were released in Chinese cinemas, just two fewer than during the same stretch in 2019, according to Artisan Gateway.
Overall, China’s theatrical market has staged a strong recovery recently. Total movie ticket revenue reached $3.8 billion (RMB 26.3 billion) in the first six months of the year, down just 16 percent from 2019 (and an improvement of 54 percent compared to last year, when Chinese cinemas were still hobbled by mass lockdowns).
Local Chinese movies, meanwhile — again evidenced this weekend by Never Say Never and Chang An‘s strong holds — are doing bigger business than ever. In the first half of 2023, thanks to a booming Chinese New Year release season, total sales for Chinese titles surged to $2.8 billion, up 27 percent from the equivalent period in the year before the pandemic.
The earnings shortfall that remains is almost entirely due to the plummeting earnings of U.S. movies in China, analysts have noted. Despite Hollywood tentpoles resuming their flow into China at a healthy rate, total ticket sales for U.S. movies clocked in at just $592 million for the first six months of the year, a steep slide from the $1.9 billion earned during the same stretch in 2019.
Hopes are relatively high for the earnings potential of Greta Gerwig and Warner Bros’ Barbie, which opens in China on Friday. But the U.S. film will face some extremely tough local competition. The first installment of Chinese director Wuershan’s Fengshen Trilogy, dubbed “China’s answer to Lord of the Rings,” opens Thursday, boasting a star-packed cast and the biggest production budget of any film in Chinese moviemaking history.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9jaGluYS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS03LW9wZW5zLXRoaXJkLXBsYWNlLTEyMzU1Mzc5ODQv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy9tb3ZpZS1uZXdzL2NoaW5hLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLTctb3BlbnMtdGhpcmQtcGxhY2UtMTIzNTUzNzk4NC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

How do celebrities get through lengthy movie premieres and red-carpet events in fancy, sometimes uncomfortable clothes?
For ""Mission: Impossible"" star Rebecca Ferguson, the answer is simple: leggings.
The Swedish actor attended the ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" premiere in Rome, Italy, on Monday, and wore a sleeveless, black-velvet gown designed by Emporio Armani.
The dress was simple, but stood out thanks to its twisted straps, scooped neckline, and floor-length pleated skirt.

Ferguson's look evoked glamour on the red carpet, but was hiding a casual secret. In a video shared by journalist Courtney Howard on Twitter, the actor is seen lifting the skirt of her gown to reveal gray, rolled-up leggings underneath.
It's unclear why Ferguson chose to wear the athleisure garment beneath her dress, but she seemed comfortable in the outfit, dancing for fans before stepping onto the red carpet. Tom Eerebout, her stylist for the evening, did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.
On Twitter, fans loved Ferguson's commitment to staying casual.
""I mean, she might have to chase someone across a roof at a moment's notice. That's just practical,"" one person joked.

""The best way to get dressed, up and down at the same time,"" another wrote alongside a cartoon meme.
Ferguson wore the gown — which also had pockets — with platform sandals, silver bangles, matching rings, and a statement necklace. For makeup, she wore burgundy lipstick and black-dot makeup in place of eyeliner.

2023-07-07 10:28:56.053000+00:00,How Tom Cruise and Simon Pegg got in shape for Mission Impossible 7,"Celebrity PT Nick Lower shares his experiences of training Simon Pegg for Mission Impossible 7, watching the stunt team do their thing, and absorbing all he can from Tom Cruise's workouts.","This off-screen transformation mirrored Pegg’s Mission: Impossible role. First appearing as IT guy Benji Dunn in the third entry, Pegg’s character has become an action star in his own right. With the seventh (and penultimate) entry in the franchise out soon, Lower shares his experiences of training Pegg, watching the stunt team do their thing, and absorbing all he can from Tom Cruise.
The Mission
For the latest M:I flick, Lower’s mission (should he choose to accept it) was to help Pegg build on a foundation of fitness, even as he entered his fifties. “Simon keeps in good shape, even between filming he’ll be training with me Monday to Friday,” Lower says. “He’s very much into his fitness and he eats well.”
Known as a franchise that throws everything at the wall, the latest M:I entry was no exception. That translated to a greater emphasis on injury prevention – especially so given Tom Cruise famously broke his ankle while jumping across a London rooftop in the previous film (watch closely and you can pinpoint the moment in the finished film, should you so wish).
“We are all getting older, so in the last 18 months we've really drilled down on mobility, flexibility, and recovery,” says Lower, pointing to Reformer Pilates as a great way of remaining limber as part of a holistic approach to overall wellbeing.
With COVID restrictions making filming a bit stop-start, Lower often had to adapt. Sometimes, he would Zoom Pegg and they’d run through the session remotely. If he was in a hotel room with no equipment available, Pegg would improvise, using the equipment to hand.
“I seem to remember, he actually grabbed a marble tabletop and used it as a weight,” laughs Lower. “If you’re stuck in a hotel room and you can’t use the gym, that’s what you have to do.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdxLW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLTctd29ya291dNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

IGN's Stella Chung had the chance to speak to McQuarrie at Dead Reckoning's press junket in Rome about Cruise's stunts and she asked which one has scared him the most.
""It's coming,"" McQuarrie said. ""You haven't seen it yet. I mean, everything we do... In terms of this movie, definitely the motorcycle jump. But we have continued and we've pushed ourselves even further in Part Two, and you'll see. It's terrifying.""
For those unfamiliar and not worried about stunt spoilers, the motorcycle jump, which you can watch the making of below, sees Cruise actually riding a motorcycle off an extremely tall cliff in Norway before jumping off it and deploying a parachute. Oh, and Cruise did say back in 2021 that this was the most dangerous thing he's ever done.

While McQuarrie wasn't ready to reveal any more about this ""terrifying"" stunt, he did talk with us a bit further at the film's red carpet premiere about stunts in general, if they scare him anymore, and how one gets the green light.
""Oh, they all do,"" McQuarrie said of these stunts. ""They're all terrible ideas. We have a motto on this movie now: 'This is a terrible idea - when do we start?' It never starts with awesome. It starts with, 'That's very ill-advised.' That's how you know you're on to something.""
Can't wait to see those terrible ideas in IMAX. #MissionImpossible pic.twitter.com/Wcw9U1p6CV — IGN (@IGN) June 24, 2023
Speaking of ill-advised, Cruise himself understands the risks these stunts bring with them and even said he wanted to perform the motorcycle jump stunt on day one just in case it killed him.

Director Christopher McQuarrie revealed to Total Film (via Games Radar) that the latest installment in the decades-running franchise about CIA agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) changed dramatically after Wright viewed the film.
“Edgar came to one of the later screenings [of the film] and asked one simple question about a specific sound — kind of an audio cue — and I thought I’d addressed that note. It was so obvious to me,” McQuarrie said. “But it wasn’t obvious to Edgar.”
He continued, “And when I asked the audience, it wasn’t obvious to them either. Nobody thought to bring it up until Edgar did. And that changed the entire movie. It changed the entire movie for the better.”
McQuarrie added, “You just need honesty and clarity and awareness. No one person, Tom [Cruise] included, can really sit there, and look at the movie 24 hours a day, objectively. Tom and I will just look one another in the eye, and say, ‘Do we want to change this? Or is this what we prefer?'”
The production for “Dead Reckoning” included death-defying stunts amid multiple COVID delays. McQuarrie admitted that actress Hayley Atwell was on set for “over 100 days before she had her first dialog scene, owing to the chaotic nature of the production.” The budget reportedly ballooned to upwards of $290 million, while lead star Cruise allegedly pushed production company Paramount via legal action to guarantee a longer theatrical window before PVOD streaming.
“That all took place during a very complicated and a very uncertain time,” McQuarrie said of Cruise’s infamous on-set COVID-related outburst that went viral. “Obviously, we’re grateful that people took it the way that it was intended. We were fighting to keep the industry alive, we were fighting to keep people employed, we were fighting for the studio, we were fighting for cinemas, and we still are. We’re still there doing that. I’m just glad people understood the intention behind it.”

Tom Cruise has no plans to stop playing Ethan Hunt anytime soon.
The actor, 61, has said that he wants to keep making Mission: Impossible films until he is Harrison Ford’s age, comparing his franchise with Ford’s Indiana Jones.
Cruise told the Sydney Morning Herald: “Harrison Ford is a legend. I hope to still be going. I’ve got 20 years to catch up with him.”
He continued: “I hope to keep making Mission: Impossible films until I’m his age.”
Cruise was 34 years old when he first played super spy Ethan Hunt in 1996’s Mission: Impossible. The character was two years younger than the actor.
In the years since, he has starred in seven sequels, the most recent of which – titled Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One – is out later this week.
In comparison, Ford was 38 when he played Indiana Jones for the first time in 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark.
He was 80 years old in the fifth and most recent addition to the franchise, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which was released on 28 June.

Cruise now appears to have ruled out any notion that the forthcoming sequel, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two – which is due for release sometime next year – will be his last outing in the role.
At 61 years old, Cruise appears to be in superb health. He continues to perform his own extreme stunts for the action franchise and does so also in Mission Impossible 7.
In the new film, Cruise is seen speed flying – a sport in which participants use a small paraglider wing to rapidly descend great heights, such as mountains.

Cruise spent years training for the sequence, which is described as one of the most dangerous the actor has ever undertaken. The crew were said to have watched him speed fly in “absolute terror”.
Elsewhere in the interview with Sydney Herald, Cruise addressed his recent social media post urging cinemagoers to watch two of his summer box office rivals: Barbie and Oppenheimer.

The two films – directed by Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan, respectively – are due for release on the same day (21 July).
“I want to see both Barbie and Oppenheimer,” he said. “I’ll see them opening weekend. Friday, I’ll see Oppenheimer first and then Barbie on Saturday.
“I grew up seeing movies on the big screen. That’s how I make them, and I like that experience; it’s immersive, and to have that as a community and an industry, it’s important.”
Initial reviews for Dead Reckoning are overwhelmingly positive. In a four-star review of the film, The Independent’s film critic Clarisse Loughrey writes: “The film is a mirror image of its star – a muscular, extravagant, thoroughly old-school work of ingenuity and craft.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL2FydHMtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9maWxtcy9uZXdzL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1tb3ZpZXMtdG9tLWNydWlzZS1iMjM3MDg4MS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Earlier Tom Cruise was found yelling at crew
Earlier in December 2020, an audio clip of Tom yelling at crew members on set of Mission Impossible 7 had been leaked. It happened after he saw two crew members standing too close to one another in front of a computer screen and shouted at them for not adhering to the safety protocols on set.
Tom Cruise showers love on crew
Now, in an interview with Metro.co.uk ahead of the release of the highly awaited film, Tom said, ""Listen, we had to do it and I’m very proud of my crew. We presented it to them last night, them and their families, and it was lovely because I got an opportunity to really thank them all personally. It’s something that we can all be proud of, what we accomplished to keep people working and keep people going during that very challenging time. And I say, ‘Look at what we have, look at what we all did together.' You know, I always make my movies for an audience, and you always want them to work – but even more so now.”
Mission Impossible 7 was in production when the pandemic hit. It was one of the first major films to resume with the filming when some of the restrictions were eased by governments. The action thriller has been shot in Italy, Norway, and the U.K. Helmed by Christopher McQuarrie, it also stars Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell, Vaness Kirby and Pom Klementieff.

The road to get ""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 1"" into theaters has been a long and treacherous one. There were multiple delays due to COVID-19 and the budget reportedly ballooned to upwards of $290 million. Writer and director Christopher McQuarrie and star Tom Cruise have been working and re-working the story for years, and they've been living with the project, thinking about little to nothing else to ensure that fans are going to be blown out of the back of the theater. Audiences may return more than once to watch the new action blockbuster, but McQuarrie and Cruise have already watched it countless times. As a comparison, when Keanu Reeves and director Chad Stahelski were perfecting ""John Wick 4"" they watched it nearly 100 times over the course of filming.
Trying to fine-tune and perfect a movie of this size requires constant attention and care that can sometimes result in being a little too close to the material. That's why it's crucial to get a fresh pair of eyes every once in a while, especially if another filmmaker can take an objective look that may help a crucial point in the story make a little more sense to the masses. The tiniest tweak can make a big difference, and it appears that one minor suggestion from one of the UK's brightest directors pointed out something that McQuarrie and Cruise might have missed.

Director Christopher McQuarrie, who first joined the franchise with 2015's Rogue Nation, shared this anecdote during a recent appearance on The Empire Spoiler Special Film Podcast
McQuarrie recalled he faced a challenge with how to present Marie (Mariela Garriga)'s backstory in the movie, with test screening audiences failing to understand her storyline.

""That entire [mission briefing] scene came together in the course of a week and was shot in a day,"" he explained. ""Except for the inserts, which we shot in Tom's garage in Florida because there was a missing element.
""First, we raced to shoot the inserts and anything you race to shoot just looks like shit. It was the longest day on the movie, it was the last day on the movie. I realised when putting the scene together that I had the key, I had Ilsa, I had the bounty hunters, and we had been struggling with what those flashbacks to Marie meant.
""I was in the editing room. I cut in the Marie footage and went, '30 years ago you were given a choice.' I just laid it out. Stop trying to ask the audience to figure it out and just effing tell them, they want to know.""

The filmmaker then added he phoned Cruise and confessed to mucking up the sequence – telling him that they'd need to add a mugshot to keep the audience gripped by the storyline.
""That triggered – once I was shooting one photograph, well, might as well reshoot them all,"" he added.
""So we brought a desk and some flooring and that bag and some photos and a gun, all the basic props, and went to Tom's garage in Florida. We had a splinter crew go and reshot everything.""
Paramount
McQuarrie previously revealed that a 'cold open' scene featuring a digitally de-aged version of Cruise's character Ethan Hunt was considered, but they decided not to go ahead with it because the director thought it would be too distracting.
Story continues
He added that when the scene was seriously being considered, there had even been talk of trying to cast Julia Roberts to play a digitally de-aged love interest for Ethan.
""I got the bill for de-ageing those people before their salaries were even factored into it,"" he further explained.
""And if you put two of them in a shot together, or three of them in a shot together, it would have been as expensive as the train by the time we were done.""

The poster features the Forger family, including superspy Loid, master assassin Yor, and the adorable telepath Anya recreating poses from Dead Reckoning's poster. Eagle-eyed fans even spotted Anya and spy dog Bond in the background, falling through the air like Ethan Hunt and his motorbike.

,10 Spoiler Facts We Learned About Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One From Christopher McQuarrie,Christopher McQuarrie sat down with Empire for an epic spoiler conversation on his latest mission with Tom Cruise. Here are some gems we learned along the way.,"Contains spoilers for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One
It’s finally here. No, not just Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One – though its arrival once again confirms that Tom Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie are an absolute force to be reckoned with when delivering breath-taking cinematic spectacle. No, the completion of (part one of) another Mission also means another dizzying deep-dive into the dramatic making of a Hollywood blockbuster like no other on the Empire Spoiler Special Podcast. Following in the footsteps of Fallout and Rogue Nation, McQuarrie – or, McQ – sat down with Empire’s Chris Hewitt for a lengthy, no-holds-barred, spoiler-filled conversation about his experiences of making Dead Reckoning Part One – from its lengthy production through COVID, to its narrative twists and turns, astonishing action sequences, and excised material.
The first part of that epic (and ongoing) spoiler conversation has now dropped on the Spoiler Special Podcast feed – a three-and-a-half-hour exploration of Ethan Hunt’s latest thunderous IMF mission. And believe us, this is only the beginning. There are hundreds of gems to be found in this instalment alone – be sure to listen to the full episode for a deeply incisive, honest, in-depth conversation. And here you’ll find just a smattering of the diamonds McQuarrie dropped along the way – delve into 10 fascinating facts from that first part here.
1) The actors ‘risked their lives’ for a sequence that was cut from the film
One of the most astonishing things about McQuarrie’s Mission movies is that, for all the incredible stuff you see on screen, you know that there was equally impressive stuff that hit the cutting room floor. Take, for instance, an entire sequence from the thunderous steam-train finale that was edited out. “It was supposed to be something we did with a resettable rig where everything could be very predictable, and nothing we did worked, and ultimately the actors had to risk their lives and do it practically,” McQ explains.
But when test notes came back with feedback on the pace and length of the movie, it had to go. “The train was a little bit like the car chase in Jack Reacher, where we couldn’t understand why we kept getting this note about length,” he says. “Finally, there was one shot in the Jack Reacher chase I pulled out, and it taught me everything about shooting action.” He had a sense a similar thing was affecting Dead Reckoning Part One’s finale. “With the train, I kept thinking, ‘Is this the shot?’ And we kept pulling and we kept getting the note, and eventually we identified what it was.” It was a shame to lose it, though. “The work that went into what was holding back the sequence was extraordinary – it was days, and it was a struggle, and it was very, very risky,” he says. “We took it out, and the scene just sang.”
2) The flashback Marie could have been a de-aged Julia Roberts
A key sequence in Dead Reckoning Part One has Ethan looking back to his own past, before the first Mission: Impossible film – in which Esai Morales’ villain Gabriel kills Ethan’s partner Marie. The role (originally due to be a bigger part of Part One, and set to be expanded in Part Two) went to Mariela Garriga. But, given the time-period there were thoughts of casting a de-aged actor appropriate to the late-‘80s, early-‘90s time period. “We started thinking, ‘What would it look like if Tony Scott had shot this, and who would it have been? Who was the ingénue, who was the breakout star in 1989?’,” recalls McQ. “And right around then was Mystic Pizza, and I was like, ‘Oh my god, Julia Roberts – a then pre-Pretty Woman Julia Roberts.” Ultimately, it didn’t come to pass – not only because of the expense (and distraction) of de-ageing everybody for the scene, but because McQ would have “to somehow convince Julia Roberts to come in and be this small role at the beginning of this story”.
3) Young Ethan Hunt’s file photo is Mission: Impossible-era Cruise with Days Of Thunder hair
Speaking of Ethan’s past, this time we see the picture in his IMF folder, hinting at some kind of troubled history that he’s been working to erase. And the image of the young Hunt was a simple combination of two historic Tom Cruise eras. “It just so happens Tom has one sensational photo of him looking directly at the camera and that happens to be in his dossier in Mission: Impossible,” says McQuarrie. It needed some tweaks, though, to fit the 1989 time period. “I had found a picture of Tom from Days Of Thunder, with that hair. And we took his Days Of Thunder hair and stuck it on his Mission: Impossible dossier photo, put some vertical lines behind it and created it in about 15 minutes. We made young Ethan Hunt without any kind of de-aging or special effects or anything else.” Mission complete.
4) McQ fixed the movie after a ‘brutal’ post-screening email
As ever, test screenings and bits of feedback from filmmaker friends were a vital part of bringing Dead Reckoning Part One together – with the likes of Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, and Alfonso Cuaron offering notes. And one bit of feedback, from a friend of editor Eddie Hamilton, was especially helpful for not holding back. “He wrote the most brutal email I've ever read – not hostile, but just both barrels right to the chin, things that were not working for him in the movie, things that were really bugging him, and that he was not a big franchise action movie guy to begin with. He was not a huge fan of Mission: Impossible,” explains McQ. “And I woke up that morning and read this email and just wanted to vomit. It was so brutal.” As it turned out, it was exactly what the filmmaker needed to hear – and led to the removal of scenes, some involving Marie, that were holding the film back. “It just forced me to look at things through another person's eyes, which is really what the value of testing is,” he says. As for Eddie’s friend? He got his credit. “He's in the special thanks.”
5) Tom Cruise decided where the title sequence should drop
There’s a specific thrill when a film drops its title sequence surprisingly late into the runtime – almost at the point you’d assumed it wouldn’t even have any opening credits. Dead Reckoning Part One holds out 28 minutes before running that iconic theme music, as decreed by Cruise – who knew exactly when the sequence would work best.
It felt odd coming straight from the submarine opener, and played a bit subdued when positioned after the desert shootout too. “You went into the credits with a very down note,” says McQ. “[Tom] just said, ‘The credits are in the wrong place’. He looked at the whole first act and said, ‘The first act is great, it’s the best it’s ever been, you’ve fixed all those issues. But the credits are in the wrong place – they’ve got to go after the scene with Kittridge.’” As skeptical as McQuarrie was, when he tried it the filmmaker agreed with Cruise that it was “just the right place” for them to be. “So they go 28 minutes into the movie – who cares! It’s the right vibe. You go into the credits with a win. He was right.”
6) McQ and Cruise lived together while shooting during COVID
How’s this for a sitcom set-up: one of the biggest movie stars in the world and his long-time director, holed up together while shooting a behemoth action blockbuster. While you can imagine the laugh-track and slap-bass now, that’s exactly the position Cruise and McQuarrie found themselves in here, thanks to the intervention of COVID. “We’d wake up in the morning, we'd meet in the living room for breakfast, we'd talk about the movie, we would drive to work in the car together, we’d work all day, we’d drive back to the apartment together at the end of the night. And that was our life.” It’s the material the 22-minute network formula was made for.
7) Tom Cruise was adamant not to end Part One on a cliffhanger
Dead Reckoning is one of several summer movies in 2023 that’s actually just ‘Part One’ of a bigger story – see also Across The Spider-Verse, and Fast X. And while there’s plenty more story to come in Part Two of Mission, it was Cruise who was particularly adamant that this film have its own ending. “Tom was fixated day and night on the ending of the movie,” says McQuarrie. “He had great anxiety about the end of the film – that the end of a ‘Part One’ was going to be a cliffhanger, and that cliffhangers by their very nature tend to be deeply, deeply unsatisfying. You feel like the camera just stopped and you're not there. You're not given that release. ‘I have to wait a year? I have to wait two years, for whatever that release is?’” Cue the reveal that Ethan has the key (Mission: Accomplished!), and that Part Two will be all about heading to the very thing it unlocks. “He said, ‘We gotta give them that sense of completion, and yet the story has to feel like it needs a place to go.’”
8) The title Dead Reckoning didn’t arrive until after Part Two had started shooting
One of the benefits, though, of having a Part Two? It gave them time to, er, come up with the title of the film. It wasn’t until work began on the next film that Dead Reckoning emerged as the title for Ethan’s latest mission. “Somewhere along the line, the title of this movie – which did not exist until we were in Africa shooting Part Two – became both fitting for the story, and the making of the story itself,” muses McQuarrie. “We were quite literally navigating via dead reckoning for most of the production, it's the most aptly named [movie].”
9) Tom Cruise is basically like Gromit in The Wrong Trousers
You wouldn’t necessarily expect to compare Tom Cruise – the most American of all-American action stars – to Aardman’s Lancashire legends Wallace and Gromit. And yet, the process of making a Mission movie – where the action literally comes first, and the rest of the film is built around it, with Ethan’s arc coming into place right at the very end – brings to mind an iconic scene from The Wrong Trousers. “[Tom] is a train in front of which you must lay track,” McQ explains. “There's that little GIF of Wallace And Gromit, and Gromit is putting the track in front of the train. That's very much what making Mission: Impossible is.” Did he watch a version of The Wrong Trousers where the train crashes down a ravine?
10) Cruise and McQ are still working on ‘The Gnarly Movie’
Back in 2020, in an interview looking back on Jack Reacher, McQuarrie told Empire that he and Cruise had been looking to make a hard-R movie together with “a very un-Tom character” in it. And while the two-part Mission has taken precedent, they’re still planning to make that together, under the codename ‘The Gnarly Movie’. “There's a movie that Cruise and I are talking about doing next or in some probable next, that Erik [Jendresen, writer] and I developed together – what has been referred to on the internet as ‘The Gnarly Movie’,” McQ teases. “It's that movie that they're all asking for, and that we want to do.” First, they just have to get through the gnarliest movie of all: Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtcGlyZW9ubGluZS5jb20vbW92aWVzL2ZlYXR1cmVzL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1wYXJ0LW9uZS0xMC1zcG9pbGVyLWZhY3RzLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW1jcXVhcnJpZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Why isn't Jeremy Renner in Mission: Impossible 7?
Following Jeremy Renner's appearances in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation, he did not appear in its sequels Fallout and Dead Reckoning Part One.
According to director Christopher McQuarrie, Renner was not able to film the franchise's later sequels because of the latter's commitment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
""It was just an unfortunate case of bad timing,"" McQuarrie revealed.
He told Digital Spy: ""At the time, when the movie started, we didn't really have a screenplay, so it was very difficult for us to say who would be in the movie for how long and on what days, and he had a commitment to Marvel.
""So there was just simply no predicting. If we had a finished script, we would have been able to say, 'Yes, this will work and we can let you go for this time.'
""But there was just no predicting what those roles were going to turn out to.""
While filming went underway for both projects, Renner was scheduled to shoot Avengers: Endgame and Hawkeye.
The Golden Globe nominee also went on to star in the Paramount+ series Mayor of Kingstown.

In ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning,"" Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) returns out of the shadows to take on another world-saving task — but this time, he's fighting a digital threat along with a physical one.
A rogue A.I. that can seemingly predict anybody's future is to blame here, but writer and director Christopher McQuarrie has also thrown in plenty of physical problems for Hunt to take on.
While Esai Morales' Gabriel is the big bad that the IMF has to stop, his henchwoman Paris, played by Pom Klementieff, is ""completely insane.""
The ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" star told Insider that creating Paris was a collaboration between herself, Cruise, and McQuarrie after she joined the film.

Klementieff recalled: ""So, I wanted to bring something completely insane that was really scary for Ethan. So it was just ongoing conversations with Christopher McQuarrie and Tom on how to create the character.""

She also noted that she gave input on Paris' costumes because she wanted to do her own stunts in ""Dead Reckoning Part One.""
""We were thinking about how the character moves, how the clothes move, and then I wanted to do some kicks too because I've been training for years,"" Klementieff said. ""And high kicks, what to wear with that? So a skirt to not be limited in the movements. It took time to create the character and make something like this little monster.""
That collaborative spirit was spread across the film. Klementieff's fellow Marvel alumni, Hayley Atwell, later told Insider that she didn't even have a character when she signed on for the sequel. She explained that McQuarrie and Cruise were just looking for the ""right person"" to join the cast.

""McQ and Tom, during the screen test, said we don't have a character that we're looking for someone to fit into. We find the person that we want to work with,"" Atwell said. ""And then the three of us in real time create that character as we go along and then also seeing what the camera ends up wanting.""

The ""Doctor Strange"" star went on to say that there was plenty of improvisation on set, but her charismatic thief wasn't given a name for quite a while.
""So we're always kind of throwing out ideas, and then certain bits would be improvised,"" she said. ""I remember when McQ finally christened me and went, 'She's called Grace.'""
""I was like, 'Oh!' and he said, 'It was partly because it was ironic because of who she is,'"" Atwell continued. ""But he was like, 'It's because you've graciously taken anything we've thrown at you, and you've delivered or are willing to kind of be part of this process.'""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXIuY29tL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1wb20ta2xlbWVudGllZmYtaGF5bGV5LWF0d2VsbC1oZWxwZWQtY3JlYXRlLXJvbGVzLTIwMjMtNtIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXIuY29tL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1wb20ta2xlbWVudGllZmYtaGF5bGV5LWF0d2VsbC1oZWxwZWQtY3JlYXRlLXJvbGVzLTIwMjMtNj9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,5 awesome things in Mission Impossible 7,"Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning: Part One hits cinemas next week. Having watched it already, here are 5 things to look forward to.","When T3 said that my mission, should I choose to accept it, was to go an early Leicester Square screening of Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One I knew what I had to do. I gathered my elite team (my mum, as a late Mother's Day present) my gadgets (a notebook) and set out on my most daring mission yet.
My Endeavours were next to nothing compared to Tom Cruise and co, so let's get your mouth watering for the seventh instalment in the Mission Impossible franchise. Here are five unadulteratedly awesome things about the seventh movie.
1. TC still has it
Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1
61 years old. Tom Cruise has no right to be putting his body through this kind of thing at 61, but he shows absolutely no sign of slowing down. At 27, I often struggle to get out of my cosy office chair and here Ethan Hunt is doing that signature arm-pumping run through the streets of Venice, parkouring off walls mid-fight.
With Harrison Ford recently enjoying his Indiana Jones swansong at 80, we're clearly in the era of the golden oldies but what makes Cruise's turn even more impressive is we all know he loves doing his own stunts. It's in the trailer so no spoilers, but watching Cruise ride a motorbike off of a mountain like Steve Mcqueen and then parachute away is a genuine heartstopper.
2. The sound
Tom Cruise flying through the air in Mission Impossible 7
As my first visit to the Odeon Luxe at Leicester Square (with the UK's first Dolby Cinema) I wasn't sure what the difference would be from a standard cinema aside from comfier seats. It only took a few minutes for the first few notes of that iconic Mission Impossible theme for me to realise the biggest selling point. Everything sounds incredible.
Dolby Atmos meant that even sitting on the balcony near the back, the movie sounded like I was in the front row. I'm someone who often struggles with muddled movie dialogue (I still don't really know what happened in Tenet) but had no such problems here. The aforementioned parachuting scene was perhaps the most intense and immersive audio moment I've ever had watching a movie.
3. Hayley Atwell and the badass women
Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning
As she's a newcomer to the franchise, I was surprised to see Hayley Atwell's name appear second in the opening titles ahead of some regulars, but by the closing credits, it made complete sense.
Atwell plays professional thief Grace with a standout cheekiness and charm, her baggy sleeves and sleight-of-hand skills give her an almost magician-like vibe (but much more likeable don't worry). At the same time, however, it's clear that Grace is also in over her head and she often just wants a payday and to escape. She even gets one over Ethan Hunt a few times.
It's a nice contrast to the other goody two shoes characters but come the end of the movie, Grace is very much on board to save the world. In fairness this is a movie full of excellent female characters (not often the case in spy movies), be it Grace, Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa, Vanessa Kirby's returning arms dealer the White Widow or Pom Klementieff as villainous assassin Paris.
4. A yellow Fiat 500
Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning
This was not something you were expecting to see on this list right? While on the run in Rome, Ethan and Grace find themselves handcuffed together behind the wheel of an old yellow Fiat 500 (reminiscent of the car from The Inbetweeners). I won't go into too much detail but a scene near the Trevi Fountain in this little car is one of the funniest and most exhilarating in the movie. It's also great to see a step away from the traditional glamour of spy dramas every now and then.
If you're looking for some more impressive automobiles then don't worry, Simon Pegg's Benji has a very impressive self-driving BMW SUV.
5. ChatGPT is the bad guy
Mission Impossile Dead Reckoning
Ok so, it's not actually specifically the AI chatbot but this time the Mission Impossible team aren't up against a warlord, an arms dealer or even a state. They're facing off with the most powerful sentient AI that the world has ever seen. Maybe it's for fear of losing my job to an AI but it's nice to see us fleshy old humans take on the ones and zeroes.
It's also not too far from being believable, some of The Entity's (as it's called) behaviours seem pretty plausible, like mimicking Benji's voice to provide Ethan with duff directions during a crucial mission.

The actor is also boarded as a co-producer.,"At 61, Tom Cruise is enjoying his career's best phase. After reviving the box office with Top Gun: Maverick (2022), Cruise has returned with Mission Impossible 7. Titled Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, the seventh installment of the Mission Impossible franchise, has finally arrived in cinemas, and it proves why the Hollywood superstar is one of the highest-paid actors in the world right now.
While many franchises fail to live up to the expectations of the audience, Cruise and the team of Mission Impossible have managed to take the excitement to a whole new level. The actor even admitted to attempting his career's most dangerous stunt in Mission Impossible 7 as he drove a motorcycle off a cliff. ""This is far and away the most dangerous thing I’ve attempted. I wanted to do it since I was a little kid,"" he told Variety.
Find out how many Crores Tom Cruise charged for 'Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One'
While the last Mission Impossible installment, Mission: Impossible — Fallout (2018), was made with a total budget of $190 million (approximately Rs 1,562 crore), the pandemic restrictions and Cruise's willingness to dial up the action factor propelled the budget of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One to $290 million (approximately Rs 2,385 crore), according to Variety, almost tens time more of what the makers have initially planned for.
Billed as one of the most expensive Mission Impossible movies, Mission Impossible 7 features Cruise reprising his role as IMF agent Ethan Hunt. According to The Sun, the 61-year-old actor, who has earned around $100 million (approximately Rs 822 crore) from previous Mission Impossible movies, has charged $12-14 million (about Rs 98 - 115 crore) upfront for the seventh part. Furthermore, the report also stated that Cruise's salary includes a percentage of the box office profits, and with the actor coming on board as a co-producer, he will take home credits for that too.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdxaW5kaWEuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvZmluZC1vdXQtaG93LW1hbnktY3JvcmVzLXRvbS1jcnVpc2UtY2hhcmdlZC1mb3ItbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLTfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-12 11:00:00+00:00,"With ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ and ‘Fast X,’ Rome Is Becoming a Hollywood Hot Spot for Production and Premieres","Since May, Rome has hosted the world premieres of 'Fast X' and 'M:I 7,' two blockbusters that burned rubber on its cobblestoned streets.","Rome’s iconic monuments are getting lots of mileage in Hollywood movies this summer.
Since May, the Eternal City has hosted the world premieres of “Fast X” and “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” two blockbusters that burned rubber and wreaked havoc on its cobblestoned streets.
Universal held its “Fast X” red carpet in the Roman Forum’s Temple of Venus, with the Colosseum as a backdrop, in early May. Weeks later, Paramount descended for the June premiere of “M:I 7,” with Tom Cruise prancing down the same Spanish Steps that serve as the setting for spectacular car chases in both movies.
“We’ve done car chases in ‘Mission: Impossible’ movies before, but nothing like this one,” boasted Cruise on the red carpet. The wild “M:I 7” sequence follows a massive Hummer in hot pursuit of a vintage pint-sized yellow Fiat 500. The latter is driven by Cruise and Hayley Atwell, who, in true “Mission: Impossible” fashion, are handcuffed together as the Fiat darts down the ancient staircase.
Vin Diesel was similarly amazed by the access granted for “Fast X”: “I could not believe that there was a [Dodge] Charger and we were shouting ‘Action!’ in front of the Colosseum,” he said to Variety. “I never would have dreamed of that happening 20 years ago.”
Neither would the Rome Film Commission, which is taking major strides to make the Italian capital friendlier to film crews as it looks to lure Hollywood shoots.
“These Rome premieres are the crowning moment of a journey that has made Italy much more attractive as a shooting destination in recent years,” says Cristina Priarone, who heads the Rome commission and also presides over the Italian Film Commissions Assn.
The game changer, Priarone underlines, is Italy’s generous 40% tax rebates for international film and TV series, which were introduced in 2008 and are among the highest in Europe (topping those of France, the U.K., Germany, Hungary and Romania). In addition, her team has been working closely with local authorities to cut red tape, so the Rome municipal permits office is now “a well-oiled machine.” Meanwhile, Rome’s storied Cinecittà Studios, which has housed productions from “Ben-Hur” to “Gangs of New York,” is undergoing a significant revamp, further boosting the city’s standing as a moviemaking magnet.
Priarone notes that “M:I 7” began production in Italy in early 2020 at the start of the pandemic: “We all worked together with regional authorities and the unions to create the conditions for this shoot to take place.”
At the packed premiere in the Auditorium della Conciliazione, a stone’s throw from the Vatican, Cruise said solemnly onstage, “Everyone knows what was going on in the world when we shot this film here.”
“Had it not been for every person in the entire [Rome] community who worked with us, from the restaurants in the streets, to the police, to everyone on the roads, to the government and medical staff — all making sure that we’re all safe — we would not have been able to create what we’re going to see this evening,” he added.
As for Cruise, the movie star arrived more than 90 minutes late for the gala, having been sidelined by an impromptu meeting with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.
According to sources, he wanted to personally thank the Italian premier for making the “M:I 7” event on the Spanish Steps possible. Meloni is believed to have overridden pushback from some local authorities, who were against holding the launch at the 18th-century landmark due to concerns over wear and tear.
Those concerns are indeed well founded.
Roughly a year ago, a 37-year-old Saudi national drove a rented Maserati down the storied staircase, causing damage. He was caught at Milan’s Malpensa airport after being identified by police from images of the vehicle that were caught on surveillance cameras.

What was Mission: Impossible 7's budget?
When Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One concluded filming in September 2021, the movie's budget reached $290million.
The production costs are a lot higher than what Paramount Pictures and Skydance Media projected the total expenses to be.
A factor that contributed to the $290million filming costs was the movie's amount of rescheduling in the midst of the pandemic.
In February 2020, the action flick was slated to begin principal photography in Venice.
However, production was halted because Italy's Covid-19 lockdown was put into place the same week filming was supposed to begin.
The studios attempted to regroup and shoot the movie in Rome.
The effort proved futile when Mission: Impossible 7's cast and crew were forced to stop shooting when cases spiked in the city and its surrounding region.
According to Variety, the project had to reschedule seven different times.
Insiders with the film also say principal photography faced difficult circumstances brought on by:
Public health restrictions
Housing its cast and crew during extended quarantine periods
Global supply chain shortages
Repeated re-closes and reopens of shooting locations
What is the most expensive Mission: Impossible movie?
With the budget listed above, Dead Reckoning Part One is the most expensive Mission: Impossible film.
Produced on a budget of $190million, Fallout is listed as the franchise's second most costly movie.

With a worldwide box office gross of over $791million, Fallout recuperated its budget.
Both Rogue Nation and M: I3 are tied for the third most expensive; both sequels were capped at $150million.
How much did Tom Cruise get paid for Mission: Impossible 7?
According to the above-mentioned outlet, Tom Cruise's upfront pay for Mission: Impossible 7 is somewhere between $12million and $14million.
It is also believed he was paid the same amount for the franchise's eighth sequel.
The Oscar nominee's salary from the movie series includes a percentage of Mission: Impossible's box office bonuses.
Previously, Tom's earnings have reached $100million for each of the franchise's six preceding films.
Celebrity Net Worth lists his fortune to be an estimated $600million and his yearly salary is reported to be $50million.

2023-07-20 16:18:06+00:00,12 of Tom Cruise’s Most Jaw-Dropping Stunts,"From scaling a skyscraper to hanging on to the outside of an airplane as it takes off, THR has compiled a list of some of Tom Cruise's wildest stunts.","Tom Cruise has never steered away from challenging himself in his roles for projects. Especially since 1986’s Top Gun, he has continued to push the limits of his body and acting, taking on his own stunts in most of his top films, including Mission: Impossible, The Last Samurai and Jack Reacher.
Most recently, Cruise took on several death-defying stunts in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, including speed-flying down a mountainside as well as driving a motorcycle off a cliff and parachuting to safety.
The actor has previously said during an appearance on The Graham Norton Show that he has been “doing different stunts” since he was a child and that once he got into acting, he wanted to keep doing it to help with the “storytelling.”
“I feel that [when] acting you’re bringing everything, you know, physically and emotionally, to a character in a story,” he explained at the time. “And I’m able to do it [stunts], and I’ve trained for 30 years doing things like this that it allows us to put cameras in places where you normally are not able to.”
More recently, during a conversation at Cannes in 2022, Cruise reiterated that he enjoys performing his own stunts despite the danger, only this time he referenced one of the best athletes of Hollywood’s golden era.
“No one asked Gene Kelly, ‘Why do you dance?’” the actor said. “Why do you do your own dancing?’”

2023-07-14 22:59:13+00:00,Does Jeremy Renner's William Brandt Return For Mission Impossible 7?,"Here's a look at whether Jeremy Renner returns to his role as William Brandt in ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I.""","The first ""Mission: Impossible"" film Jeremy Renner missed was ""Fallout"" in 2018. Though they don't outright justify or otherwise make some mention of his disappearance in the narrative, director Christopher McQuarrie revealed that his departure came down to an unfortunate scheduling conflict. According to him, Renner was under contract with Marvel Studios at the time, almost definitely for work on ""Avengers: Endgame."" Based on McQaurrie's comments, it seems as though Renner would be welcome to rejoin in the future at the time.
So why isn't he in ""Dead Reckoning Part One?"" The reasoning may be quite similar. Due largely in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, the seventh ""Mission: Impossible"" film wound up shooting in late 2020 — the exact same timeframe when Renner was filming his Disney+ series Hawkeye. In fact, when the audio recording of Tom Cruise yelling at two crew members in London, England for not following COVID protocols was leaked online from December of that year, Renner was in snowy New York City practicing his archery.
No official word has come down if Renner is out for Part Two, but it's probably safe to say he won't be involved in any extensive capacity. As our readers are likely aware, Renner suffered a scary snow plow accident earlier this year, and might not be ready for a stunt-heavy project like a ""Mission: Impossible"" film. Then again, if the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes continue long enough, schedules may align for Renner to return to the IMF once more.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvb3Blci5jb20vMTM0MDI0MC9qZXJlbXktcmVubmVyLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS03L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Five screens and 14 mostly wonderful hours later, I’ll you the best way to see Tom Cruise risk his life in Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One.","Mostly wonderful. Photo: Paramount Pictures.
In 2011, the Mission: Impossible films shifted from action story vehicles of varying quality and narrative coherence to unapologetic stunt spectaculars with one clear reason to see them: Tom Cruise risking his life to entertain you. But Ghost Protocol and its antecedents — 2015’s Rogue Nation and 2018’s Fallout, the fifth and sixth entries into the franchise, respectively — didn’t just propose audiences watch the savior of cinema dangle from various extremely high things on any screens, they suggested audiences do so on the biggest, most dynamic screens they could possibly find. A decade ago, that meant IMAX. Today, with the seventh M:I movie upon us, there are myriad options: you can see Dead Reckoning Part One on a big screen (Standard Digital Projection), on a gigantic screen (IMAX), on a really big screen (RPX), on a stretched (ScreenX), or in pure chaos (4DX). To help you avoid choice paralysis, I spent the better part of one week watching Dead Reckoning in every format available to me in New York City. Here’s what I learned, five screens and 14 mostly wonderful hours later.

What Is Standard Digital Projection?
You know when it’s Saturday afternoon and you go to a movie, one in which Tom Cruise isn’t running through a city on the other side of the world to stop a baddie from blowing something up? Or, how about this, you know when you buy a ticket for whatever’s playing and the price is what you expect it to be and the experience feels like a movie has always felt, only with significantly less film grain than you remember from your childhood? That’s standard digital projection.
Why Should I See Dead Reckoning in Standard Digital Projection?
Because the price is what you expect it to be and the experience feels like a movie has always felt, only with significantly less film grain than you remember from your childhood. There are no upcharges and no surprises when you use your Regal Unlimited Pass to see Mission: Impossible on a regular big screen. The rate of failure on this mission is low. It’s like asking Ethan Hunt to build an IKEA bookshelf. No crew needed, no threat of mass death, and you’re lowkey impressed when he does the part recommended for two people … all by himself.
Why Shouldn’t I See Dead Reckoning in Standard Digital Projection?
Because a Premium Large Format (PLF) screen like IMAX, RPX, or Dolby Cinema is nearby.
.
If you must spend roughly twice the amount of a standard movie ticket, this is the best way to experience Dead Reckoning. Photo: Paramount Pictures.
What Is IMAX?
IMAX standing for Image Maximum is as ridiculous as the IMF standing for Impossible Mission Force. IMAX was primarily used for short documentary films until Christopher Nolan decided to shoot roughly half an hour of 2008’s The Dark Knight on large, loud, unwieldy, and expensive IMAX cameras. The resulting images aren’t just clearer, thanks to the film stock (65mm, as opposed to traditional 35mm film), they are taller (IMAX screens take up a more square-like 4:3 ratio, as opposed to a wider, more typical 2.39:1).
So which M:I movies were intended to be experienced in IMAX? Some, but not all, of Ghost Protocol and Fallout, was shot on 65mm film and so the movie is described as “filmed for IMAX.” Dead Reckoning used IMAX-certified cameras, but not 65mm film, and is therefore described as “shot for IMAX.” Rogue Nation was only “digitally re-mastered into the image and sound quality of an IMAX Experience.” It’s all a bit confusing. (Just take a look at this press release explaining Dune’s two very different IMAX experiences or this interview in which Christopher Nolan details the many ways to see Oppenheimer!) The catch: only films shot on IMAX’s 65mm film were actually meant to fill that very tall IMAX screen.
Why Should I See Dead Reckoning in IMAX?
None of Tom Cruise’s death defying acts in Dead Reckoning were filmed to fill a several-story screen, but there’s another selling point to the IMAX experience: the sound quality. An acoustically refined IMAX theater absolutely envelops audiences in dialogue, sound effects, and score. If you must spend roughly twice the amount of a standard movie ticket, this is the best way to experience Dead Reckoning. So just let that IMAX propaganda pour over you. By the time you’ve gone from the box office to the ticket taker to the concession stand to the actual auditorium, you’ll have passed so many IMAX logos and IMAX movie posters that you’ll never watch an Image Minimum movie again.
Why Shouldn’t I See Dead Reckoning in IMAX?
Consider your bladder. The bigger the screen, the longer the rows of seats; so if you’re feeling the repercussions of that Cherry Coke Zero after Ethan Hunt feels the repercussions of that first meeting with Kittridge some thirty years ago, keep in mind that you’ll be stepping over more unmoving knees than you ever thought possible while making your way to the aisle.

What Is RPX?
RPX, Regal’s premium large format brand, stands for “Regal Premium Experience.” They describe the system as “a giant immersive screen… illuminated by high-quality digital projectors and completed with a state-of-the-art sound system.” Yes, it’s an opportunity to charge a premium on an already-high movie ticket, and an acronym like RPX sounds like some kind of scam, but this (like IMAX and AMC’s Dolby Cinema), isn’t a gimmick. The difference between RPX and standard projection is apparent not long after sitting down — even trailers you’ve seen countless times before are given new life.
Why Should I See Dead Reckoning in RPX?
Because it really does look, sound, and feel that much better than Standard Digital Projection. I’m not sure if there are actual rumbling devices in the seats or if the subwoofers are simply that powerful, but I find the kind of subtle grumble during Dead Reckoning to be perfectly immersive in this format. And I can’t stress this enough: know your bladder. This movie is two hours and forty-five minutes. Getting up and sneaking out isn’t treacherous when your auditorium has generous walking space. If you’re seeing Dead Reckoning in RPX, feel free to make your Pepsi Zero a large.
Why Shouldn’t I See Dead Reckoning in RPX?
Because one of the few remaining IMAX screens is nearby. If you can get to one of those, it simply trumps RPX. Though most PLF screens — be it RPX (Regal), Dolby Cinema (AMC), or those retrofitted “LIEMAX” screens — are better than Standard.

What is ScreenX?
ScreenX is the funniest thing to happen to the movies since Buster Keaton. A con artist really convinced hundreds of theaters to chop their films into three pieces and call the whole thing a “premium experience.” Because this isn’t the gentle roundness of a planetarium or domed IMAX screen — it’s a movie projected across three white walls connected at 90-degree angles. There’s nothing graceful about ScreenX! This piece referred to the experience as “IMAX but sideways.” Which is to say… it’s disorienting. You’re constantly tempted to look at the side screens but never rewarded for the effort. I’ve seen two movies in this format, both of which were visually spectacular — Elvis and Dead Reckoning — and can confidently say the peculiar cropping and jarring stretching of the frame’s edges was at best a distraction, and at worst just plain ugly.
Why Should I See Dead Reckoninge in ScreenX?
I don’t know, because you subscribe to Variety, listen to The Town, or are just really into the wackadoo business of Hollywood? Because the other screenings sold out and this is the last possible showing at the last possible theater on the last possible day that you can see it? Ethan Hunt himself would find it impossible to enjoy a movie like this.
Why Shouldn’t I See Dead Reckoning in ScreenX?
The ScreenX projection of Dead Reckoning reminded me of an HFR (High Frame Rate) projection, which tends to make things uncomfortably smooth and textureless. Chase scenes that looked stunning in all the other formats had an uncanny veneer in ScreenX, as if I could make out every individual layer of CGI. What felt like a true blockbuster in other formats felt more like an expensive episode of television projected in someone’s basement in ScreenX. Even worse, the sound seemed to be coming exclusively from the front of the auditorium, as if the surround mix had been condensed into simple stereo. A common plea from action movie marketers these days is to “SEE OUR MOVIE ON THE BIGGEST SCREEN POSSIBLE.” They’re right, and that’s a good line. You know what isn’t a good line? “SEE OUR MOVIE ON THE LONGEST SCREEN POSSIBLE, PROJECTED FROM THREE PROJECTORS ONTO THREE WALLS, TWO OF WHICH ARE BASKING IN RED GLOW OF ‘EXIT’ SIGNS BECAUSE NOT EVEN THE MAGIC OF CINEMA CAN OVERRIDE FIRE CODE.”

What Is 4DX?
There’s a scene in Fallout when an IMF courier delivers a message to Ethan in his safehouse. Their authenticating call and response goes like this:
Courier: Fate whispers to the warrior… Ethan: A storm is coming. Courier: And the warrior whispers back… Ethan: I am the storm.
4DX is that storm.
There’s a scene in Dead Reckoning when Jasper Biggs (Shea Whigam) prepares his unit for the difficulty of capturing Ethan Hunt by calling him a “mind-reading, shape-shifting incarnation of chaos.”
4DX is that mind-reading, shape-shifting incarnation of chaos.
It combines the very basic act of watching a movie (sitting, looking, listening) with the sense overload of an amusement park ride that’s overdue for inspection (swaying, shaking, wetness, chill, desperation for it all to end). Large seats with retractable footrests are synchronized to the action on screen, creating a distressing ballet of three primary experiences: movement (the chairs rock from side to side and front to back and the seat backs are like roided-out massage devices, prodding you in the general area where a character is receiving a punch or kick onscreen), wind (if there’s wind in a scene, it will be windy in the theater), and mist (if someone gets wet in a scene, you will be sprayed in the face like a misbehaving cat). A handful of other auditorium-wide effects — like flashing lights, scent infusions, and fog — are less overwhelming and, honestly, sort of nice.
A story: When I was a teenager, my family stopped in Las Vegas for one night on the way to Yosemite National Park from central Texas. We stayed at the Excalibur, a casino designed with children in mind. While my parents gambled, the casino allowed my sister and I to rent one (1) Pay-Per-View movie in the hotel and gave us some cash to spend in the Excalibur arcade. We watched Beautician and the Beast in the room, laughed our asses off, and then proceeded to the games, where I spent like $15 of my $20 on a machine that strapped me into a moving seat and screened a 10-minute movie action sequence. At the time I thought, “It would be so amazing to watch a full-length film like this.” But, like children often are, I was totally wrong.
Why Should I See Dead Reckoning in 4DX?
If you’ve (1) already seen Dead Reckoning in a reasonable format, and (2), after having reading this, understand that I wholeheartedly do not recommend it. If at this point you remain morbidly curious and incapable of getting the idea of 4DX out of your twisted little mind, there’s nothing I can do to save you. Go for it, freak.
Why Shouldn’t I See Dead Reckoning in 4DX?
I spilled an ounce or so of Pepsi Zero on myself during one of the first seat rumblings, leaving me afraid of my Pepsi Zero for the next two and a half hours. Imagine being afraid of your Pepsi Zero! The nonstop wind effect during a scene in the Arabian desert was so cold it numbed my fingertips for the remainder of the movie. Because the screening was nearly empty, the intermittent bangs of dozens and dozens of retractable footrests falling was jarring. During a relentless chase sequence in Rome, it almost felt like Regal Union Square was going to collapse right into the N/Q/R/W line. 4DX is fantastic for horror movies, where the jolts and jostles only add to the surprise of a jumpscare. I could see it being sort of fun for a more typical action movie that takes occasional breaks from the insanity. But for a movie like this, one that almost never gives its characters time to breathe, 4DX is a stomach issue waiting to happen.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvd2hpY2gtc2NyZWVuLXNob3VsZC1pLXNlZS1tLWk3LW9uLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,'Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning' ending: You won't believe who dies (Spoilers!),"Tom Cruise saves the world again but his superspy Ethan Hunt suffers a major loss in the action-packed finale of ""Mission: Impossible 7."" (Spoilers!)","Spoiler alert! The following post discusses important plot points and the ending of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” so beware if you haven’t seen it yet.
In the latest “Mission: Impossible” movie, Tom Cruise’s superspy Ethan Hunt keeps the world safe yet again – at least for now, and things aren’t looking great! – but also gets put through the emotional wringer more than usual.
Director Chris McQuarrie’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” (in theaters now), the seventh outing in the action franchise, teams Ethan and his loyal friends Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) with skilled thief Grace (Hayley Atwell) to stop a rogue artificial intelligence called The Entity. Two halves of a key are integral to either destroying or controlling the AI, and Ethan’s mission – which he totally chooses to accept – is not only to get it but also find out what it unlocks.
Let’s break down the action-packed finale, plus who’s joining the team and who’s out of the picture permanently:
What happens at the end of the new ‘Mission: Impossible’ movie?
A race between Ethan’s team and the mysterious Gabriel (Esai Morales) – The Entity’s right-hand man in the real world and a guy from Ethan’s past – leads to a showdown on the runaway Orient Express, where a business deal to obtain the key goes down. Gabriel winds up with the key but during a nasty fight on the top of the speeding transport, Gabriel escapes and jumps to safety before detonating a bridge that the train is quickly approaching.
Good news is Ethan secretly swiped the key from Gabriel but bad news is they have to navigate train cars falling to their doom before ultimately being saved by Gabriel’s assassin henchwoman Paris (Pom Klementieff), left wounded after her boss tried to kill her. Paris tells Ethan that the key is to The Entity’s source code on a Russian submarine sitting at the bottom of the icy Bering Sea, Ethan parachutes out before the authorities can grab him, and meets up with Benji because they have an underwater mission in their near future.
Who’s the newest member of the team in ‘Dead Reckoning’?
Grace was hired by black marketeer White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) to obtain one of the key halves, but surviving a bonkers cars chase in Rome, almost dying in Venice and being embraced by the good guys leads the criminal to (somewhat reluctantly) put her faith and safety in Ethan’s hands. He recruits her to his Impossible Mission Force crew and at the end, when Ethan bolts and she’s face to face with CIA Director Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny), Grace accepts this new role and he recognizes her skills that he can use.
She doesn’t become a hero as much as “she just grows a conscience,” Atwell tells USA TODAY. “She wants to believe that (these) are the right people to trust and for her to actually be part of something that's more than just self-serving. And it's now sacrificial because the cost of caring about someone is the risk of losing them now is greater. It's like her heart thaws and she becomes more humane.”

Does anyone important die in ‘Mission: Impossible 7’?
Well, the American director of national intelligence (played by Cary Elwes) is assassinated by Gabriel, though he was a bad guy who wanted The Entity. But longtime fans of the franchise get a major gut punch in “Dead Reckoning”: Because he’s all about making Ethan suffer, Gabriel promises that either Grace or ex-MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), a love interest and helpful ally to Ethan, will die. Ilsa saves Grace and confronts Gabriel in Venice, taking out her sword to face the knife-wielding villain, but he fatally sinks his blade into her chest. Ethan sprints along the canals though he doesn’t get to Ilsa in time to save her.
Ilsa’s death was “a really tough decision,” McQuarrie says. “But it was one we knew we had to make for the movie to have stakes and for the movie to remain ‘Mission.’ 'Mission' is primarily Ethan's journey (and) there is this continuum that the people closest to him, he tends to lose them. It was a really tricky conversation for us to have, and we knew that there would be some reactions to that, but we also knew this is the reality of the world that's been created over seven movies.”

Is there a ‘Dead Reckoning’ post-credits scene?
Nope! Unlike superhero movies and other blockbusters, the “Mission: Impossible” films have avoided teases and stingers and that tradition continues with the new adventure. But an action-packed climax and a lingering shot of a sunken sub are really all you need to get psyched for “Dead Reckoning Part Two” (out June 28, 2024).",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tb3ZpZXMvMjAyMy8wNy8xNC9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtNy1zcG9pbGVycy10b20tY3J1aXNlLWVuZGluZy1leHBsYWluZWQvNzA0MDk5NjQwMDcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-06-19 20:46:00+00:00,"‘Mission: Impossible 7’ First Reactions: Tom Cruise Conquers Critics With ‘Impeccably Made,’ ‘Exhilarating’ Action Film","The first reactions for ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" are in after the Tom Cruise blockbuster's world premiere in Rome.","“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” was finally unveiled at a starry world premiere in Rome on Monday evening, drawing a packed gala screening in the Auditorium della Conciliazione, a stone’s throw from the Vatican.
The gala screening was delayed by more than 90 minutes as Tom Cruise was holding an apparently impromptu meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at the Palazzo Chigi, seat of the Italian government.
The crowd in the auditorium grew increasingly annoyed with having to watch interviews from the red carpet held earlier on the Spanish Steps in what started seeming like an endless loop on the venue’s screen, equipped with a Dolby Atmos sound system for the special occasion.
However there was warm applause when Cruise, director Christopher McQuarrie, and a large contingent of the film’s ensemble – including Hayley Atwell; Rebecca Ferguson; Simon Pegg; Vanessa Kirby; Pom Klementieff, Esai Morales, Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis – finally arrived.
And as soon as Rome appeared on screen the audience started breaking into cheers and shouting out: “Bravo Tom!” which happened quite frequently through the screening.
The event was held in tandem with the Rome Film Festival’s independently run Alice in the City section, dedicated to films for youth audiences. The film’s local distributor is Eagle Pictures, which has a local distribution partnership with Paramount. A substantial amount of the hotly anticipated action film was shot in the Italian capital.
“Dead Reckoning Part One” follows the events of “Fallout,” where Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt and his crew of secret agents saved the world from a nuclear apocalypse amid a series of double-crosses. The 2018 release was the highest-grossing entry in the franchise yet, earning nearly $800 million at the global box office.
The new film stars Cruise once again, alongside returning franchise players Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Henry Czerny and Vanessa Kirby. Series newcomers include Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, Cary Elwes, Rob Delaney, Indira Varma, Shea Whigham, Mark Gatiss, Esai Morales and Charles Parnell.
As expected, the film drew strong notices out of its premiere for its impressive stunts. One of the most prominent death-defying acts pushed in the marketing features Cruise actually riding a motorcycle off the edge of a cliff.
Simon Pegg, who returns for “Dead Reckoning” after featuring in the previous five installments told Variety that the film’s core is the rapport between Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie, which began in 2011 with “Ghost Protocol” on which McQuarrie served as an uncredited writer.
“It’s become a kind of self-perpetuating evolving relationship where they’ve just egged each other on and challenged each other to move the story forward; to increase the scale; increase the ambition,” Pegg pointed out.
The seventh “Mission: Impossible” entry will be released by Paramount on July 12. See reactions to the film below.
Collider’s Perri Nemiroff said it was “another winner for the franchise” with production values “through the roof” and “well-defined and exhilarating set pieces.”
Uproxx writer Mike Ryan said “‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’ works as Christopher McQuarrie’s ambitious examination of/meditation on AI and the dangerous path we might be on.”

,Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One movie review (2023),A ridiculously good time"," the kind of movie that people should see large and loud.""","At the airport, Ethan also crosses paths with a pickpocket named Grace (Hayley Atwell), who gets stuck in the middle of all of this world-changing insanity, along with a few agents trying to hunt down the rogue Ethan and are played by a wonderfully exasperated Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis. A silent assassin, memorably sketched by Pom Klementieff, is also essential to a few action scenes. And Vanessa Kirby returns as the arms dealer White Widow, and, well, if the ensemble has a weakness, it's Kirby's kind of lost performance. She has never quite been able to convey ""power player"" in these films as she should.
But that doesn't matter because people aren't here for the White Widow's backstory. They want to see Tom Cruise run. The image most people associate with “Mission: Impossible” is probably Mr. Cruise stretching those legs and swinging those arms. He does that more than once here, but it seems like the momentum of that image was the artistic force behind this entire film. “Dead Reckoning Part One” prioritizes movement—trains, cars, Ethan’s legs. It’s an action film that's about speed and urgency, something that has been so lost in the era of CGI’s diminished stakes. Runaway trains will always have more inherent visceral power than waves of animated bad guys, and McQuarrie knows how to use it sparingly to make an action film that both feels modern and old-fashioned at the same time. These films don’t over-rely on CGI, ensuring we know that it’s really Mr. Cruise jumping off that motorcycle. When punches connect, bodies fly, and cars crash into each other—we feel it instead of just passively observing it. The action here is so wonderfully choreographed that only “John Wick: Chapter 4” compares for the best in the genre this year.
There’s also something fascinating thematically here about a movie star battling A.I. and questioning the purpose of his job. Blockbusters have been cautionary tech tales for generations but think about the meta aspect of a spy movie in which the world could collapse if the espionage game is overtaken by a sentient computer that stars an actor who has been at the center of controversy regarding his own deepfakes. There’s also a definite edge to the plotting here that plays into the actor’s age in that Ethan is forced to answer questions about what matters to him regarding his very unusual work/life balance, a reflection of what a performer like Cruise must face as he reaches the end of an action movie rope that’s been much longer than anyone could have even optimistically expected. Cruise may or may not intend that reading—although I suspect he does—but it adds another layer to the action.
Of course, the most important thing is this: “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is just incredibly fun. It feels half its length and contains enough memorable action sequences for some entire franchises. Will Cruise save the blockbuster experience again? Maybe. And he might do it again next summer too.

2023-07-27 17:44:50+00:00,A De-Aged Julia Roberts Was Considered for ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Axed Cold Open: The VFX Bill ‘Would’ve Been as Expensive’ as the Train Stunt,"The director of ""Dead Reckoning"" considering reaching out to Julia Roberts to de-age her.","“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” director Christopher McQuarrie revealed before the film opened in theaters that he rejected de-aging Tom Cruise for a 1989-set opening scene. Now on a new episode of “The Empire Spoiler Special Film Podcast” (via /Film), the filmmaker dropped that he considered reaching out to Julia Roberts to de-age her as well for the scene that never happened as planned.
The scene that made it into the film is a brief flashback that is interspersed throughout the movie. It depicts a young Ethan Hunt (Cruise) watching the villainous Gabriel (Esai Morales) murder his girlfriend, played by Mariela Garriga. McQuarrie looked into de-aging VFX in order to open the film with a more extended scene set around this fateful encounter.
“I said, ‘Ok, if I were doing this sequence, it would be Tom in, say, 1989. It would be Tony Scott’s ‘Mission: Impossible.’ That’s who would have been directing the movie before Brian De Palma, you know, in that era,” McQuarrie said on the Empire podcast. “We looked at ‘Days of Thunder’ and we looked at the style of it, and we started thinking what would it look like if Tony Scott had shot this, and who would it have been? I looked back at who was the ingenue, who was the breakout star in 1989? And right around then was ‘Mystic Pizza.’ And I was like, ‘Oh my God. Julia Roberts, a then-pre-‘Pretty Woman’ Julia Roberts, as this young woman.’”
McQuarrie continued, “The only way I could have seen doing the sequence justice [using de-aging] was to somehow convince Julia Roberts to come in and be this small role at the beginning of this story. And of course, as you’re conceptually going through it, you’re like, ‘Now all anybody’s going to be doing is thinking about the de-aging of Julia Roberts, and Esai, and Tom, and Henry Czerny.’”
De-aging effects are still quite polarizing, as evidenced by the divisive response to de-aging Harrison Ford for the 25-minute scene that opens “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.” While McQuarrie was impressed with the de-aging technology he researched for the scrapped “Dead Reckoning” opening, he still thought it was too distracting to see a familiar star like Tom Cruise look so much younger. It would take viewers out of the movie, he argued. That and also the price tag to de-age actors is so huge.
“I got the bill for de-aging those people before their salaries were even factored into it,” McQuarre told Empire. “And if you put two of them in a shot together, or three of them in a shot together, it would have been as expensive as the train by the time we were done.”
McQuarrie is referring to the film’s climactic set piece, which is set on a speeding train. The production built the train carts from scratch and actually crashed the train, which is no small price tag.

2023-07-01 06:19:18+00:00,‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Director Says Filming Tom Cruise Speed-Flying Left Crew in “Absolute Terror”,Tom Cruise and the 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One' crew are detailing what went into filming the Speed-flying scene for the movie.,"Tom Cruise and the Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One crew are detailing what went into filming the epic speed-flying scene for the upcoming film.
The actor, known for going above and beyond with his stunts, learned how to do what director Christopher McQuarrie called “one of the most dangerous sports in the world” for the latest installment in the action franchise.
In a recent video giving a behind-the-scenes look at the movie, the filmmaker explained that since “there are no limits” with Cruise, “we become a little bit more adventurous every time.” And this time, the actor decided to do a “sport very few people on this planet do.”
McQuarrie went on to explain that “while it may look similar, speed-flying is not skydiving. Skydiving is fairly predictable. Speed-flying is incredibly unpredictable.”
The air sport, similar to paragliding, combines elements of parachute swooping to allow people to fly at high speeds down mountainsides while maintaining close to the slope.
In the footage, Cruise said of the stunt, “We’re gonna do spirals, and we’re landing at an incredibly high speed, over 80 kilometers an hour.”
McQuarrie added that although it “looks quite beautiful” when “flying very close to rocks,” the crew was in “absolute terror” behind the cameras. Especially since they had to overcome several technical challenges, including coming up with the stunt and finding the most dynastic way to shoot it.
The director called the whole experience a “one-of-a-kind adventure.”
Taking on death-defying stunts is nothing new to Cruise. Throughout his decades-long career, the actor has continued to look for ways to push the limits for projects, from scaling a skyscraper to dangling on the outside of a plane. In his upcoming film, he also drove a motorcycle off a cliff and parachuted to safety on the first day of filming.

Tom Cruise has always been known to do his own stunts, especially when it comes to the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise.
Each movie follows Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and a team of agents who are tasked with stopping nefarious forces, and this usually involves a death-defying act by Cruise.
And ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" sees the star undertake his biggest stunt yet in a literal leap of faith, as he rides a motorcycle off the edge of a cliff before opening his parachute and gliding down to reach a train.
Speaking to Insider on the red carpet at the film's UK premiere on Thursday, director Christopher McQuarrie said that the ambitious stunt was something of a surprise to the film's studio, Paramount, as well as fans.

""Well, fortunately, we were in one country, they were in another country, and communication was pretty fuzzy at that time in the world,"" McQuarrie said of pitching the stunt during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""I don't think they really knew what they were getting involved in until we sent it to them, which is kind of the case,"" the director added.
""We talk about things in the abstract, but until they really see it… I don't think any of us fully grasped what we were getting ourselves into until we did it.""
It's a jaw-dropping moment, and Paramount previously released a making-of featurette detailing what went into the stunt, with Cruise practicing the scene numerous times before production started in Norway.
But the stunt sets the bar quite high for 2024's ""Dead Reckoning Part Two."" However, Cruise told Insider that he's more than up for the challenge.

""I'm always pushing. I just remember, every time they say, 'Can you top it? Can you not top it?' we're always pushing,"" the actor told Insider. ""Every film I do, whatever genre it's in, I want to make it as entertaining as possible for that audience. I know I can do things better.""
Cruise's costar Pom Klementieff also spoke to Insider about the challenge of filming a brutal fight scene in a confined alleyway in Venice.

""It was incredible. It was very hard to shoot because it was very challenging and very narrow. So we had to think of where to place the camera, where to place the lighting, because we were also shooting at night time, you know?"" said the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" star.
Klementieff added: ""But at the same time, there was not a better person to do it with than Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie, so I felt really lucky to be able to do that.""

2023-07-11 18:17:08+00:00,Tom Cruise ‘Working Diligently’ on His Next Movie Shot in Space: ‘We’ll See Where We Go’,Tom Cruise teases his next movie set in space and 'Dead Reckoning Part Two.',"Tom Cruise is still preparing to boldly go where no actor has gone before.
He and his “Edge of Tomorrow” director Doug Liman are set to film a movie in space and make Cruise the first civilian to perform a spacewalk. Universal is backing the film, which has a budget of around $200 million.
When asked about his space-set movie at the “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” premiere in New York on Monday, Cruise said he didn’t have a production start date set, but, “We’ve been working on it diligently and we’ll see where we go.”
Of course, Cruise still needs to finish making “Dead Reckoning Part Two,” the potential finale of his “Mission: Impossible” series, before he can plot his next movie. Writer and director Christopher McQuarrie, who’s overseeing both “Dead Reckoning” movies, said he and Cruise are getting right back to work on “Part Two” as soon as the “Part One” press tour ends.
“We finish this tour, and on our way back to the U.K. we stop to scout along the way. We hit the ground running as soon as we get back,” McQuarrie told Variety. “I get two days of vacation between here and Tokyo and I’m back on.”
The latest “Mission: Impossible” film, which opens in theaters Wednesday, pits Cruise’s IMF agent Ethan Hunt against a mysterious villain from his past, and reunites him with allies Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson).
But the greatest draw of any “Mission: Impossible” movie is, of course, the stunts, and “Dead Reckoning Part One” doesn’t disappoint. In the film, Cruise drives a motorcycle off a massive cliff and parachutes safely down to the ground. When asked about that morning on set, Cruise said it was just a “usual day.”
“I keep things pretty calm, nothing unusual. The usual day for me,” he told Variety. “We wake up, and I remember that morning McQuarrie and I came to set, and normally we’re talking about story and the characters, just keep it real casual — as casual as possible. We know what’s happening. I remember getting there in the morning and the ramp was ice. You can see in the EPK as I’m jumping out of the helicopter to test the wind down there, they’re cleaning the ramp of ice. You just go through it nice and easy, no changes.”
Pegg, who has starred opposite Cruise in five “Mission: Impossible” films so far, said the one-of-a-kind action star carried “cinema itself” on his shoulders while making “Dead Reckoning Part One” during the pandemic.
“I’m very driven, I am ambitious, I care deeply about my job, but I don’t have cinema itself on my shoulders,” Pegg told Variety. “I feel like Tom, particularly during the making of this movie, felt like that. I felt like he was facing an existential crisis in the form of the pandemic, and he just wouldn’t be cared by it. I don’t know if I have it in me to do what he does, I literally don’t. There’s a reason why he’s the only one who does this stuff. There isn’t an actor working who does what he does.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvdG9tLWNydWlzZS1zcGFjZS1tb3ZpZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy0xMjM1NjY2ODA3L9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvdG9tLWNydWlzZS1zcGFjZS1tb3ZpZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy0xMjM1NjY2ODA3L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,'Mission Impossible 7' director explains why major character had to die,'Mission: Impossible 7' director Christopher McQuarrie explains the thinking behind the death of that major character: 'It was one of the earliest conversations.'x,"Warning: This article contains spoilers for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.
The most shocking event which occurs in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is arguably not the sight of Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt riding a motorbike off a cliff, but rather the death of Hunt's friend and fellow spy Ilsa Faust, a major part of the franchise since 2015's Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation. Portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson, Faust is killed on a Venice bridge by Esai Morales' villainous Gabriel while Hunt runs (of course!) through the Italian city, arriving too late to help her.
In a new podcast interview with Empire, the film's director and co-writer Christopher McQuarrie discusses why he and Cruise, who produced the movie with McQuarrie, felt the need to kill off Ferguson's character.

""It was one of the earliest conversations. We were on the set of Top Gun, we were already talking about it,"" says the filmmaker, referring to last year's Joseph Kosinski-directed Top Gun: Maverick, which McQuarrie co-wrote. ""We knew that that emotional arc was of a certain emotional tone... Ilsa is a wonderful character, and a character of which I am enormously proud, and Rebecca is an actor of such unmitigated power and presence.""
He continued, ""And yet, where we had gone with the character from Rogue to Fallout...[the] place you took that character would either make less of her, it would suddenly become frivolous... or she would just become a romantic interest, and it was never about creating a character who was defined by her love story with Ethan Hunt. Their relationship transcends a traditional loving story... They're doomed to be together and yet doomed never to be together... It felt like that story was looking for its resolution and so we said this has got to happen.""
McQuarrie goes on to explain that his and Cruise's decision to conclude Faust's story dovetailed with their desire to give a sense of genuine stakes to the movie.
""What really needs to happen in the story is the stakes have to be real, they can't be implied,"" says the director. ""We have to have the courage to let [Ethan] fail and it has to cost, the mission has to cost, and without that, the villain simply will not have a threat…what you're seeing in the escalation of the story is what it costs Ethan personally in Venice.""
When asked if the pair had considered the possibility of killing off Simon Pegg's Benji Dunn or Ving Rhames' Luther Stickell, the director said ""we explored them all"" before ominously pointing out that the recent film is, after all, just Part One of the tale.

2023-06-28 17:01:22+00:00,Tom Cruise Urges Fans to See Rival Summer Movies ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’,"Tom Cruise, star of 'Mission Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One' is urging fans to see rival movies 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' this summer.","Tom Cruise really wants you to go see Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. And Barbie. And Oppenheimer.
Despite his own blockbuster opening in a few weeks (that would be Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One), Cruise is urging his fans to check out the summer movie competition.
“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,” Cruise wrote on Instagram post (below) that showed him standing with his Dead Reckoning writer-director Christopher McQuarrie in front of posters for Indy 5. “These are just a few that we can’t wait to see on the big screen.”
“Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indiana Jones and creating one of the most iconic characters in cinema history,” he continued. “You have given us countless hours of joy.”
“I love a double feature, and it doesn’t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie.”
The messaging suggests Cruise is once again hoping to save the summer box office — this time by bringing along a few other titles.
Last year, the massive success of Top Gun: Maverick (which made $1.5 billion globally) was credited as “saving Hollywood’s ass” by no less than Steven Spielberg himself.
This year, a few films have struggled to gain box office traction — such as The Flash and Elemental — though Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse successfully popped.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is facing headwinds with modest reviews, yet is tracking to open with a solid $60 million to $70 million over the June 30-July 2 weekend.
Meanwhile, Dead Reckoning is headed toward a franchise-best $90 million opening for its extended weekend, which gets underway Wednesday, July 12.
There’s no tracking yet for Barbie or Oppenheimer, which open head-to-head July 21, but both are considered highly anticipated — though, with respect to Cruise, would likely make for a rather odd back-to-back viewing experience.
The move follows a viral report from Puck that a “pissed” Cruise was had loudly complained to Paramount executives about the impact of Oppenheimer’s IMAX deal. Cruise was reportedly upset that IMAX was going to boot Dead Reckoning from its large-format screens after just one week in order to make room for its prior commitment to run Oppenheimer — which was entirely shot in the IMAX format – for three weeks.

2023-06-17 13:00:00+00:00,Tom Cruise Drives an Electric Fiat in New 'Mission Impossible' Film,"With a nod to anime and plenty of tire smoke, Cruise gives us an epic car chase in the newest installment of the series, which comes out in July.","The unexpected start of Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One is an electric-powered Fiat 500.
The seventh film in the Mission: Impossible franchise opens on July 12. Here's a teaser showing the behind-the-scenes filming of the car chases.
The unusual hero car is a vintage Fiat 500, built specially with electric power to be faster and wilder, and it's shot for visceral thrills with real, practical stunts rather than CGI effects.
Opening next month, Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One looks to replicate the box office success of Top Gun: Maverick. Top Gun was all about real stunts over CGI, and this latest entrant in Tom Cruise's long-running thriller series looks to also have genuine vehicular carnage. The latest teaser goes behind the scenes of the centerpiece car chase set in Rome, and it also shines a light on the unlikely hero car: a cheeky little vintage Fiat 500.
Powered by a two-cylinder engine that never got a displacement bigger than a bottle of wine, even in the hottest Abarth-tuned models, the average 500 moves slower than a four-course Italian lunch. But in the world of Mission: Impossible, there's a trick up every sleeve. We first encounter the little yellow Fiat parked up beside a gray Ferrari F12 TdF. Having ditched a battered 5-series, Tom Cruise and Haley Atwell—handcuffed together for greater drama—head straight for the Ferrari as a potential getaway car. Ah, but wait, here comes the Fiat.
Gone is the clattery two-cylinder engine, and based on the whir of acceleration, it seems to be powered by an electric motor. Judging by the tire-roasting antics as the Fiat 500 drifts over the cobblestones of Rome, there's significantly more power on tap here. The thing sounds like an enraged hand blender and goes like a wasp. In the teaser, Cruise describes the 500 as ""wild.""
Paramount Pictures | Car and Driver
It's not the first time a Fiat 500 has starred in a wild car chase. We see the choice of the 500 as a nod to one of the best animated car chases of all time. The 1979 film The Castle of Cagliostro marked the directorial debut of Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, who would go on to co-found Studio Ghibli. Notable for films like Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro, Miyazaki is as beloved in Japan as Disney is here.
Stellantis | Car and Driver
The central character in Cagliostro is the rascally master thief Arsène Lupin III, grandson of the character originally created by a French writer in 1905. Miyazaki dials down the original menace of Lupin by plonking him in a yellow Fiat 500, which he uses to chase down the bad guys.
The pairing was so successful that Fiat actually made a series of Lupin-themed modern Fiat 500s, including a 165-hp Abarth 595. Appearing together in some 20 movies, Lupin III and his yellow Fiat are inseparably linked.

Back in Rome, with one wrist handcuffed, Cruise has to one-hand-drift the car around corners in non-animated real life. Director Christopher McQuarrie, who collaborated with Cruise on both previous Mission: Impossible movies and Top Gun: Maverick, says in the trailer, ""Everything we shot is completely practical.""
""We built this Fiat 500 so that it would be faster—some would even say the car is possessed.""

2023-07-05 14:36:40+00:00,"Tom Cruise Wants to Keep Making ‘Mission: Impossible’ Movies Until He’s 80, Just Like Harrison Ford and Indiana Jones: ‘I Hope to Still Be Going’",Tom Cruise wants to play Ethan Hunt for as long as Harrison Ford played Indiana Jones.,"Harrison Ford just wrapped up his tenure as Indiana Jones in the franchise’s fifth installment, “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which opened in theaters just a few weeks before the actor’s 81st birthday. Tom Cruise hopes to have the same longevity when it comes to playing Ethan Hunt in Paramount’s long-running “Mission: Impossible” franchise.
Speaking to The Sydney Morning Herald at the Australian premiere of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” Cruise said he wants to keep making “Mission: Impossible” movies until he is Ford’s age. Cruise just turned 61 years old on July 3, 2023.
“Harrison Ford is a legend; I hope to be still going. I’ve got 20 years to catch up with him,” Cruise said. “I hope to keep making ‘Mission: Impossible’ films until I’m his age.”
Although Ford has ended his run as Indiana Jones at 80, he has no plans to give up acting at this time. “I don’t do well when I don’t have work,” he said in June when announcing he will not retire from acting. “I love to work. I love to feel useful. It’s my jones. I want to be helpful… and it’s the people you get to work with. The intensity and the intimacy of collaboration.”
Cruise also weighed in on the viral photos of him holding up movie tickets to summer tentpoles “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.” The actor admitted that hasn’t actually seen either tentpole just yet, but he is planning to do so on opening weekend.
“I grew up seeing movies on the big screen,” Cruise said. “That’s how I make them, and I like that experience; it’s immersive, and to have that as a community and an industry, it’s important. I still go the movies.”
“I want to see both ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer,” he added. “I’ll see them opening weekend. Friday I’ll see ‘Oppenheimer’ first and then ‘Barbie’ on Saturday.”

2023-06-16 13:15:00+00:00,"The Fight for Imax: How Studios Beg and Barter to Get ‘Mission: Impossible,’ ‘Oppenheimer’ and More Blockbusters on Premium Screens","At the movies, there are tense negotiations between studios and Imax to secure all-important premium screens.","There’s been a battle brewing between two of Hollywood’s blockbuster talents.
In one corner, Tom Cruise is gearing to take a victory lap from the behemoth success of “Top Gun: Maverick” with a sequel to his other big action franchise, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.” It’s expected to be one of the biggest movies of the summer when it opens on July 12. In the other corner, Christopher Nolan, one of the few directors so famous that his name alone can draw crowds, is readying to release his highly anticipated “Oppenheimer.” The big-budget drama about the creation of the atomic bomb launches just a week later on July 21.
At the center of the drama is access to Imax, and how the company’s 401 North American screens will be divided between the two box office draws.
Except, in this case, there wasn’t much to negotiate. Paramount’s “Mission: Impossible 7” is only playing on Imax screens for one week, as first reported by Puck, a newsletter that covers the media business, before it has to relinquish all of its showtimes to “Oppenheimer.” That’s despite Cruise making a few calls around town to remind everyone that not even a year ago, “Maverick” earned more than $100 million from Imax alone. By shorting the Imax run of “Dead Reckoning,” he suggests, all involved parties risk losing out on serious coinage.
But long before the oft-delayed “MI” sequel moved to mid-July, Universal had already ironed out a rare agreement for “Oppenehimer” to control Imax’s entire North American footprint for three full weeks. (Directors like Nolan, who use Imax cameras to film their movies, are typically granted a two-week exclusive window.) Greta Gerwig’s star-studded “Barbie,” which also opens on July 21, isn’t playing in Imax at all as a result.
“I feel sad in a way we can’t accommodate all of them. I know ‘Mission: Impossible’ is going to be a really big movie,” Imax CEO Rich Gelfond tells Variety. “Nolan has a special place in Imax’s heart because he uses our cameras and promotes us. It’s not a matter of us saying which we can make more money on. I would hope after ‘Oppenheimer’s’ run, we can bring back ‘Mission.'”
There may be more of these fights brewing in the future. Here’s why: Attendance hasn’t rebounded in pandemic times, but the demand to watch certain movies on the biggest and brightest screens, known in the industry as premium large formats (PLF), has grown exponentially. Lest that sound like spin from PLF operators, there are stats to back up the idea that audiences are buying what they’re selling. Moviegoing is down 33% from 2019, but the market share for Imax, one of the art’s more recognizable forms, is up 50% without adding any new screens, according to the company. On a big-budget tentpole, those enhanced viewing experiences can account for as much as 30-40% of overall box office returns even though there are only about 900 PLF screens in the country. As a result, studios have more at stake in the battle for access to the finite number of screens that can generate outsized ticket sales.
To pluck a recent example of Imax’s box office heft, take Sony’s “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.” The animated comic book adventure opened to a mighty $120 million from 4,313 North American locations, and averaged $19,736 per location on standard 2D screens. In contrast, it brought in an average of $25,159 per location on PLF screens; and $34,214 per location on Imax screens.
Those figures defy conventional wisdom that price deters people from going to the movies. Tickets for PLF are significantly more expensive, costing up to $28 in major cities like New York City and Los Angeles compared to $18 for regular 2D seats. And yet, those formats are usually the first to sell out for visual effects-heavy movies like “Oppenheimer” and “Mission: Impossible,” with dazzling graphics, crazy stunts and talent that says – nay, insists – it’s not just the best, but the only, way to experience their films.
So how do studios ensure their movies are playing on as many premium large format screens as possible? They fight over them, of course. For distribution chiefs, who handle the theatrical rollout of a movie, an important part of the job is haggling and calling in favors with movie theater owners to guarantee their upcoming box office draw has more prime showtimes than rival offerings.
Imax operates differently than other PLF operators because it doesn’t take as much input from studios when scheduling showtimes. Studios, of course, set the release dates for their own movies. But when there’s a pileup of blockbusters, like the one-two-three punch of “Indiana Jones,” “Mission: Impossible” and “Oppenheimer” in late June and into July, it’s Imax who gets to dictate which of those it’ll be offering its patrons beyond opening weekend.
That’s not how it works for Dolby, ScreenX, 4DX and essentially any other premium large format. Bargaining for those screens is similar to the standard 2D operation, which is a more flexible arrangement that factors in the popularity of a movie as well as the rapport between exhibitors and studios or filmmakers.
Most movie theaters have at least one auditorium with PLF capabilities, with larger multiplexes housing two or three with those special projectors. After a film’s opening weekend, it typically cedes many, if not most, of its premium screens to whatever movie launches on the following weekend. However, if a film is an outsized success story, it stands a better chance at retaining more of those PLF auditoriums in subsequent weeks. And that’s, of course, assuming the movie has the right scale and scope to get people excited. No offense to “80 for Brady” or “Book Club: The Next Chapter,” but very little about those films require its audience to watch it in 3D. So even if “Oppenheimer” is rolling in to town, the latest “Mission: Impossible” movie will still be available in many theaters with enhanced sound and wider screens in its second, third, and even forth weekend.
This is where negotiations can effectively come into play. Studios can’t outright withhold or promise access to one blockbuster in exchange for another that may be riskier in terms of commercial appeal. But they can certainly remind the exhibitors of past successes in hopes that they will want to reward the studio or creative talent with more screens on future projects. This is where Paramount will get to leverage the enduring appeal of “Top Gun: Maverick” as “Dead Reckoning” makes its way to theaters. Ditto Disney with “Avatar: The Way of Water” as it books “Indiana Jones” and Universal with “Super Mario Bros. Movie” as “Oppenheimer” gears up to release. The problem, some insiders lament, is that exhibitors can have short memories. One executive with knowledge of these conversations says it’s a game of “what have you done for me lately?”
There’s a reason that Imax has more control, and it’s not necessarily its ubiquity in the exhibition space. The company uses a proprietary technology to create a film print that’s specifically designed to fit the aspect ratio of its screens. Alternatively, the rest of the country’s PLF operators can project the same version of a movie that they would play on 2D screens, which the studio’s provide. They don’t need to commission specific prints for their high-definition or XD auditoriums. It gives them more scheduling flexibility compared to Imax, which also can’t pivot as quickly in the event that a movie isn’t selling tickets. Since Imax isn’t planning to offer “Barbie,” it won’t have a version of the movie to play even if the company later decided it wanted to slot a few showtimes.
Complicating the matter is that Imax has a vested interest in certain movies like the Marvel installment “Eternals,” Jordan Peele’s “Us” and “Oppenheimer” that use its patented technology. That leaves the company eager to prioritize those films when it comes to deciding who gets its limited screens. Relationships that Imax has fostered with certain directors, like Nolan and Denis Villeneuve (“Dune”), sometimes appearl to trump the demand for popular franchises and long-running series that would otherwise be hugely important to theater operators, insiders say.
“In a situation where there’s an unavoidable conflict,” Gelfond says, “we’ll look at a number of factors: how the franchise has performed before, visuals, and our relationship to the filmmaker.”
Nolan, for his part, is known to breathlessly evangelize about the singular of experience of Imax, going as far as branding it “the best film format that was ever invented.” As he promoted 2012’s “The Dark Knight” he told the masses that “it’s the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion.”
That kind of publicity makes it worth going all in on Nolan, even at the expense of Cruise.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWJhdHRsZS1pbWF4LXNjcmVlbnMtMTIzNTYzMzUzNy_SAWVodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9uZXdzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1iYXR0bGUtaW1heC1zY3JlZW5zLTEyMzU2MzM1MzcvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Christopher McQuarrie, the director of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, has claimed that the forthcoming sequel will address a regret from a previous film.
The filmmaker, who has directed the last four entries in the popular Mission: Impossible action franchise, spoke in a new interview about him and Cruise being “dissatisfied” with aspects of the fifth instalment, 2015’s Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation.
The sequence in question was set underwater.
“Tom and I are constantly re-evaluating our own work and asking ourselves how we could have done it better,” McQuarrie said, in an interview with Collider.
McQuarrie and Cruise previously worked together on films including the 2014 sci-fi thriller Edge of Tomorrow, which McQuarrie co-wrote and produced.
“We’ve done underwater sequences previously. We’ve worked underwater in Edge of Tomorrow, and we worked underwater in Rogue Nation, and we left very dissatisfied with those sequences,” McQuarrie continued.
“And we analyse why we were dissatisfied. What were all the factors working against us? The biggest being, not having real knowledge in that area. Everything you’re looking at in Dead Reckoning is the application of knowledge from previous sequences.”
McQuarrie revealed that Dead Reckoning Part Two will feature ambitious underwater sequences, which required Tom Cruise to hold his breath for long periods of time.

According to the director, Cruise was able to hold his breath underwater for up to six and a half minutes. However, McQuarrie said that doing so was “physically punishing”, adding that he wouldn’t “recommend it to anybody who doesn’t want to make a lifestyle out of it”.
In a four-star review of Dead Reckoning Part One for The Independent, Clarisse Loughrey wrote: “Mission: Impossible is exactly the sort of franchise in which people simply roll their eyes when the bomb they’re trying to detonate turns out (of course!) to be a nuclear one. That lack of ponderousness is embedded bone-deep into Dead Reckoning, and how returning director Christopher McQuarrie chooses to operate.
“The action sequences are consistently dynamic, and always adapted to their environment: a shoot-out in a sandstorm focuses on stealth and precision, while a Vespa chase down Rome’s many staircases is all cartoon chaos. It all culminates in an absolutely insane stunt in which Cruise drives a motorcycle off a cliff and then parachutes down onto a moving train. You will leave Dead Reckoning the same way you always do: wondering how Cruise could possibly outdo himself in the next one – until, inevitably, he does.”

2023-07-10 07:00:00+00:00,"Yes, Mission: Impossible 7 Has Tom Cruise Stunt Fighting On Top Of A Real Train Going 60mph",'You could go f***ing blind.',"Apparently, the production had to settle with half of that speed or less, but it's worth noting that even at 60 miles per hour, that means Tom Cruise and other actors are working atop a vehicle going as fast as a car on the freeway — which we all know can do a lot of damage if something goes wrong. In the end, Cruise, Esai Morales, and co-star Hayley Atwell walked away unscathed, but the same can't be said for the train.
As the behind-the-scenes footage reveals, it ended up wrecked after being driven off a cliff in a shot that had to be accomplished in just one take. Christopher McQuarrie explained that the team had been thinking about doing a train sequence for a long time, and ""wanted to build upon the previous films and apply that knowledge to something practical and real and bring this train sequence to another level.""
McQuarrie is also quoted in the featurette saying something that at this point seems to be undeniably true: ""No one else in the world is doing this practical level of filmmaking, and it may never be done again."" Cruise's work on the ""Mission: Impossible"" movies calls to mind the days of early cinema, when Charlie Chaplin walked a tightrope with monkeys, Buster Keaton tried not to get flattened by a barn wall, and Harold Lloyd dangled from the hands of a giant clock. Back then, Hollywood didn't have the framework in place to tell these death-defying performers, ""No."" Now it does, yet somehow adrenaline junkie Cruise is still able to orchestrate a symphony of wild, dangerous action with each new film.
Hopefully, the train scene in ""Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One"" will be worth the risk and hassle. You can see for yourself if it pays off: The film premieres theaters on July 12, 2023.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTMzMjk1Ny9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtNy10b20tY3J1aXNlLXN0dW50LWZpZ2h0aW5nLXJlYWwtdHJhaW4tZ29pbmctNjBtcGgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

,"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One and Part Two: Release Date, Trailers, Cast & More","We break down the characters, the voice cast, the plot, the release date, and more.","Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to watch Tom Cruise drive a motorcycle off a cliff. The seventh movie in the Mission: Impossible franchise will hit theaters this July, and it looks as though it will continue Cruise’s tradition of putting increasingly jaw-dropping, death defying stunts into each one of these action flicks. But, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One will just be the first half of a two-part story, as the title suggests.

When Do Parts One and Two Come Out?

Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One, the seventh film in the Crusie-led film adaptation of the ’60s and ’70s espionage TV series, hits theaters soon, on July 12, 2023. Fans won’t have to wait (that) long for the conclusion, as Part Two is set to premiere slightly under a year later, on June 28, 2024. However, filming on Part Two is currently paused due to the Writers Strike, so it’s quite possible that the release date will be delayed again.
Both movies will be exclusive theatrical releases — and if they’re anything like Top Gun: Maverick, another Cruise movie from Paramount Pictures, the same studio behind Mission: Impossible, they won’t be streaming for a while. Maverick hit Paramount+ more than 200 days after its theatrical premiere.
Were it not for the COVID-19 pandemic, Dead Reckoning would have already been released, as Part One was originally slated for a July 2021 premiere. Delays due to the pandemic and subsequent COVID filming protocols (this is where Cruise’s viral, uh, virus rant originated) pushed the release back to 2022, then eventually to 2023.
Though it’s rare that any franchise ever truly ends, Dead Reckoning Part Two is expected to be the end of the franchise — at least as it currently exists.
Who’s Directing It?

Christopher McQuarrie, the director who took Mission: Impossible to new heights starting with Rogue Nation, the fifth film in the franchise, returns for both Part One and Part Two of Dead Reckoning. McQuarrie also co-wrote both installments with Erik Jendresen.
Who’s In It?

Tom Cruise first played IMF agent extraordinaire Ethan Hunt in 1996 when the original Mission: Impossible hit theaters. He’ll have just turned 61 when Dead Reckoning Part One premieres, and Part Two will supposedly be his final appearance as the character, some 28 years later.
He’ll be joined by several returning cast members, including Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames as his fellow IMF agents Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, respectively. Rebecca Ferguson returns as ex-MI6 agent Ilsa Faust, and Henry Czerny returns as former IMF director Eugene Kittridge, a character who hasn’t been seen since the original ‘96 franchise-starter. Vanessa Kirby returns as Alanna Mitsopolis, the black market arms dealer-turned-uneasy ally to Ethan Hunt, as does Frederick Schmidt, playing her brother Zola Mitsopolis.

There are lots of new additions to the franchise as well. Hayley Atwell, best known for playing Peggy Carter in the MCU, joins as Grace, a character McQuarrie described as a “destructive force of nature” with “somewhat ambiguous loyalties” on the franchise-focused Light the Fuse podcast. Ozark’s Esai Morales plays the film’s primary villain, Gabriel (Morales took over for Renfield star Nicholas Hoult, who dropped out due to scheduling issues), while Guardians of the Galaxy’s Pom Klementieff plays an assassin who works for Gabriel.

Shea Whigham, recently seen in HBO’s Perry Mason, plays Jasper Briggs, an enforcer in a mysterious group known as “The Community” who is attempting to track Ethan Hunt down along with his partner, played by Greg Tarzan Davis. Charles Parnell (Top Gun: Maverick), Rob Delaney (Deadpool 2), Indira Varma (Obi-Wan Kenobi), and Mark Gatiss (Sherlock) also star, as does The Princess Bride’s Cary Elwes in an as-yet undisclosed role.
Recent Oscar-winner Angela Bassett, who played CIA director Erika Sloane, was originally supposed to reprise her role but couldn’t due to COVID travel restrictions.
The cast for Part Two hasn’t fully been revealed, though it’s probably safe to assume that most of the major actors from Part One will appear once more, assuming they survive the first movie. We do know, however, that Ted Lasso star Hannah Waddingham will join the ensemble, as will Parks & Rec’s Nick Offerman, who plays Sydney, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
What Is Dead Reckoning About?
(Photo by Christian Black/©Paramount Pictures)
Candidly speaking, the plots of the Mission: Impossible movies aren’t really their main appeal. They tend to be slick, serviceable MacGuffin chases that are an entertaining framework for banter and Tom Cruise’s insane stunts. But we do have some idea of what to expect from Dead Reckoning Part One. Here’s the official synopsis from Paramount:
“In Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, Ethan Hunt and his IMF team embark on their most dangerous mission yet: To track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity before it falls into the wrong hands. With control of the future and the fate of the world at stake, and dark forces from Ethan’s past closing in, a deadly race around the globe begins. Confronted by a mysterious, all-powerful enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than his mission — not even the lives of those he cares about most.”
Tracking down a weapon that threatens humanity before the bad guys get it? Dark forces from Ethan’s past? A deadly race around the globe, and a mysterious enemy? This is, in other words, pretty standard spy movie stuff, but few franchises are capable of pulling it off with as much style as Mission: Impossible. No specifics for the plot for Part Two have been revealed, so as not to spoil Part One, but it’s probably safe to say it won’t deviate too far from the tried and true formula, even as it serves to wrap up loose ends from Part One.
How Long Will It Be?
(Photo by Christian Black/©Paramount Pictures)
Part One is on the longer side. Without credits, it boasts a runtime of 2 hours and 36 minutes. The length of Part Two, of course, is TBD.
How Many Trailers Are There?
While there have been no trailers for Part Two yet, naturally, there have been a few for Part One. The first, which was light on dialogue, came out in May of 2022, more than a year before the film’s release. The full trailer came out a year later.
While they’re not quite trailers, Paramount also released a trio of behind-the-scenes featurettes, one of which centers on Cruise’s most dangerous and ambitious stunt yet — driving a motorcycle off a cliff and parachuting to safety. It’s wild, and it certainly inspires a deeper appreciation for the work that went into the stunt, but if you don’t want to spoil the majesty of it all, it’s probably best to check it out after you’ve seen the film.

2023-07-28 16:30:00.071000+00:00,Is the godlike AI in ‘Mission: Impossible’ realistic? I asked an expert.,All-powerful and murderous artificial intelligence is just fiction...right?,"Listen 7 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save
This article is a preview of The Tech Friend newsletter. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Tuesday and Friday. The latest “Mission: Impossible” movie features a villainous artificial intelligence called the Entity. Spooky, right? Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight Like many fictional AI including Skynet in the Terminator films and HAL 9000 from “2001: A Space Odyssey,” the Entity is up to no good.
There’s a race between the good guys and the bad guys to take command of this all-knowing, out-of-control AI before it destroys the world in some unspecified way.
Sure, sure, sure, the new “Mission: Impossible” has amazing stunts and action sequences. I had fun watching it.
But my technology-obsessed brain wondered: How plausible is the Entity? How does it stack up against other supercomputer baddies in popular culture? And how seriously should we take fake AI in movies, anyway?
Advertisement
To explore these questions, I spoke with Alex Hanna, director of research at the Distributed AI Research Institute and co-host of the ""Mystery AI Hype Theater 3000″ podcast. (An edited and condensed version of our chat is below.)
Maybe it seems silly to have deep conversations about movie AI villains, but fiction matters. Made-up artificial life forms going back to “Frankenstein,” Isaac Asimov’s robot novels and Iron Man comics have influenced our beliefs about real world AI.
This piece comes with an obligatory spoiler alert: It discusses some plot details of “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One.”
But reading this won’t ruin the movie for you. The plot is not the point. (The Washington Post’s Ann Hornaday gave it three out of four stars.)
Q: Does the Entity accurately portray the real capabilities of AI?
Advertisement
Hanna: No. It's absurd.
Q: Why? What's implausible about the Entity?
The idea that the Entity can hack into basically any electronic system — that it can listen and see everything happening in the world and learn from it — is pretty ridiculous. None of the current AI technologies can do this autonomously.
The Entity has such foresight that it can predict who is going to do what in the future down to the second, and game every possibility with humanlike ingenuity. That’s not possible.
The Entity also has intent. [Tom Cruise’s character] Ethan Hunt wants to shut down or control the Entity, and it is like the robots from Isaac Asimov’s fiction in that it’s trying to protect itself.
My colleague Emily M. Bender says that these machines don’t understand anything. Understanding is exclusive to sentient beings.
Q: Are there more realistic AI technologies in this movie?
Advertisement
Yes. Facial recognition is so commonplace in this movie that it's not even seen as AI. It's used by the American intelligence agencies, by the Italian police and by Hunt's team.
The depictions track with a lot of representations of facial recognition in popular media — that the software has true sight and can identify who is a terrorist. But this technology in the real world messes up all the time.
There’s also a moment in this “Mission: Impossible” movie in which [a character named Benji Dunn] is in a self-driving car and he hops over to the passenger seat. He puts on his seat belt as if to say, I don’t trust this thing.
That’s an existing AI that’s still questionable, and the movie makers had enough thought to make a character insecure about it. That was great.
Q: Are there examples of other AI in popular media that you think are accurate?
Advertisement
No.
The perennial problem is that technology and computing are portrayed in popular media as magic.
Share this article Share
Even in this “Mission: Impossible” movie, the idea is once the good guys get a key to access the Entity’s source code, the AI can be controlled. That’s a misunderstanding. Even if you had the actual source code of an AI, it wouldn’t tell you what you need to know.
You’d also need the model weights in a neutral network to be able to replicate any of its decision-making. You would need to know which data it has access to.
[Here’s a glossary of artificial intelligence terminology]
Q: Do you like any technology-related entertainment?!
I love [the android character] Data in “Star Trek” because he aims to be more human to improve his relationships with his crew mates — as opposed to his evil twin, Lore, who wants to kill humans and accrue power.
The movie “Hackers” isn’t realistic, but I love it for the motley crew of people who are trying to take down a mega corporation. Plus a young Jonny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie are fun.
Q: This is all fictional. Why do fake depictions of AI matter?
Advertisement
Science and science fiction co-create each other.
Representations of AI can influence how we think about real-world AI because they can assign those real-life models too much agency or power.
But real-world AI is much more narrow, and destroys lives with much less public carnage — for example, facial recognition and predictive policing software.
Q: Do you believe that some technologists’ current fears of AI triggering human extinction are influenced by fictional killer machines?
I don’t know. Fears of out-of-control artificial entities have a long history. Frankenstein’s monster is a cautionary tale about man’s hubris.
Q: If you were writing a fictional AI villain for a movie, what would it be?
It might be AI systems used as a cudgel by bosses to break the backs of workers. Those are the kinds of AI uses that Hollywood writers’ and actors’ unions are talking about now.
Those depictions would be more like labor movies than “Mission: Impossible.”‘ But I’d watch that.
One tiny win
If you have an Android phone, you will soon be notified if someone is stalking you with Apple’s AirTags location-tracking devices.

Relatively inexpensive Bluetooth trackers such as AirTags can be useful for keeping tabs on your keys and luggage, but they have also been abused by stalkers to covertly track their victims.
Apple’s iPhones have added notifications when unknown AirTags are moving along with you, but the notifications weren’t built into Android phones. (Apple has an Android app to scan for AirTags nearby. It’s a good bet that not many people use that app.)
Google said on Thursday that most Android phones over the next few weeks will update automatically to include anti-stalker notifications for AirTags. The notifications don’t work for other brands of Bluetooth trackers.
Once you have the updated Android software, you’ll be able to tap on the phone notifications for more information and advice on what you might do.

These automated alerts work for the majority of Android devices dating back to 2015, Google said.
Google also included a feature to manually scan for Bluetooth trackers that are near you.
Go to Settings → Safety & emergency → Unknown tracker alerts and tap the “Scan Now” button. (This feature wasn’t available for my Android phone as of Friday morning.)
Google and Apple are working on a separate technology that could automatically detect major brands of Bluetooth trackers near you including AirTags, Tile, Chipolo and eufy Security.

2023-06-27 12:51:49+00:00,"7 best movies to watch in July 2023: Mission Impossible, Barbie, Oppenheimer and more","July 2023 is packed with must-see movies including Barbie, Oppenheimer and the latest entry in the Mission: Impossible franchise.","The summer movie season is officially underway and over the last few weeks, we’ve seen a slew of blockbusters land in theaters, including Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, The Flash and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. And the heavy hitters don’t stop as we move into July as the next 30 days will see a string of highly-anticipated films hit cinemas nationwide.
July’s highlights include the latest flick from legendary filmmaker Christopher Nolan and a little movie featuring a real-life Barbie girl living in a Barbie world. There’s also a pair of sure-fire horror hits and Tom Cruise will be returning as Ethan Hunt in the latest entry in the beloved Mission Impossible franchise. There really is something for everyone in the weeks ahead, so here are the seven movies that you need to watch in July 2023.
Insidious: The Red Door
After a pair of so-so prequels, the enduring Insidious franchise is finally returning to its root as we catch up with the perennially-haunted Lambert family. The fifth film in the franchise overall, Insidious: The Red Door is a sequel to 2013’s Insidious Chapter 2 and is set 10 years after the events of its predecessor. Both Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne make their return to the franchise and Lin Shaye, ever-present in the Insidious movies, will also appear once again as paranormal expert and psychic Elise Rainier. Expect lots of jump scares, and to be honest, don't be shocked if there's an ambiguous ending that sets up the almost inevitable sixth Insidious flick.
Watch in theaters from July 7
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One
Tom Cruise is arguably Hollywood’s last remaining larger-than-life movie star and the Mission: Impossible franchise is a true rarity in that it’s actually gotten better with each new installment. Topping 2018’s Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a tall order, but we’d not bet against Cruise and writer/director Christopher McQuarrie. In rather predictable fashion for the long-running series, the plot in Dead Reckoning will see superspy Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his team attempt to track down a deadly weapon that could threaten all of humanity before it ends up in the wrong hands. Cue a globetrotting adventure packed full of espionage and breathtaking stuntwork from Cruise himself. As the name suggests this is the first chapter of a two-parter, so a cliffhanger ending seems almost guaranteed.
Watch in theaters from July 12
Bird Box Barcelona
The best movies to watch in July aren’t exclusively coming to theatres, Bird Box Barcelona will arrive on Netflix on July 14 and certainly looks worthy of a spot in your watchlist. A Spanish-language spin-off/sequel to 2018’s wildly-success Netflix movie Bird Box, the horror-thriller follows a father’s desperate attempts to ensure the safety of his daughter in a world that has been invaded by entities that cause people who look directly at them to commit suicide. The original Bird Box was a huge hit for Netflix, and this follow-up looks to pack all the same thrills as its predecessor. It could make a strong case for inclusion in our list of the best Netflix movies once its lands on the streaming service in just a couple of weeks.
Watch on Netflix from July 14
Barbie
Barbie is probably the most anticipated movie on this list with social media already in a frenzy over the impending release of the Greta Gerwig-directed comedy. Margot Robbie will play the eponymous doll while Ryan Gosling plays Ken, in a movie that sees Barbie venture from her plastic playland and into the real world in search of true happiness. Expect original musical numbers (Plus, Ice Spice and Nicki Minaj have done a remix of Aqua’s classic earworm Barbie World), just about everything to be pink and some knowing winks to the ridiculousness of the entire premise. With so much buzz surrounding this one, don’t be surprised if Barbie ends up being the film that dominates the summer movie conversation.
Watch in theaters from July 21
Oppenheimer
Releasing the same day as Barbie is a very different kind of movie from acclaimed director Christopher Nolan. Oppenheimer is a biographical thriller about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man largely credited with the creation of the first nuclear weapon. This three-hour epic will explore the Manhattan Project and its impact on Oppenheimer as well as his legacy as “the father of the atomic bomb.” As usual with Nolan’s movie, the director has assembled an all-star cast that includes Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer alongside the likes of Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Kenneth Branagh.
Watch in theaters from July 21
Talk to Me
Distributed by cult favorite entertainment company A24, Talk to Me looks like another horror winner from the same distributor that brought us Hereditary, The Witch and Pearl. This Australian-made movie already premiered back in January at the Sundance Film Festival and earned rave reviews (it’s currently got 97% on Rotten Tomatoes ). It sees a group of friends accidentally unleash sinister supernatural forces after using an embalmed hand to conjure spirits. The film has earned praise for its “gripping story” and use of practical effects, and if the trailer is any indication it’s pretty darn spooky to boot. This one finally lands in U.S. theaters on July 28, and we can’t wait to have nightmares for weeks afterward.
Watch in theaters from July 28
Haunted Mansion
Disney’s first Haunted Mansion movie was released in 2003 and is a nostalgic favorite for many (including yours truly). Now the House of Mouse is taking a second stab at adapting the iconic theme park attraction of the same name into a feature film. This new spin on the Haunted Mansion sees a single mom (Rosario Dawson) and her son move into a massive mansion, only to discover it's infested with spooky spirits. To help combat these paranormal pests they recruit a paranormal investigator, a priest, a psychic and even a history professor played by Danny DeVito. This family-friendly horror-comedy should be the ideal crowd-pleaser to bring July to a close.

Director Christopher McQuarrie revealed to Total Film (via Games Radar) that the latest installment in the decades-running franchise about CIA agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) changed dramatically after Wright viewed the film.
“Edgar came to one of the later screenings [of the film] and asked one simple question about a specific sound — kind of an audio cue — and I thought I’d addressed that note. It was so obvious to me,” McQuarrie said. “But it wasn’t obvious to Edgar.”
He continued, “And when I asked the audience, it wasn’t obvious to them either. Nobody thought to bring it up until Edgar did. And that changed the entire movie. It changed the entire movie for the better.”
McQuarrie added, “You just need honesty and clarity and awareness. No one person, Tom [Cruise] included, can really sit there, and look at the movie 24 hours a day, objectively. Tom and I will just look one another in the eye, and say, ‘Do we want to change this? Or is this what we prefer?'”
The production for “Dead Reckoning” included death-defying stunts amid multiple COVID delays. McQuarrie admitted that actress Hayley Atwell was on set for “over 100 days before she had her first dialog scene, owing to the chaotic nature of the production.” The budget reportedly ballooned to upwards of $290 million, while lead star Cruise allegedly pushed production company Paramount via legal action to guarantee a longer theatrical window before PVOD streaming.
“That all took place during a very complicated and a very uncertain time,” McQuarrie said of Cruise’s infamous on-set COVID-related outburst that went viral. “Obviously, we’re grateful that people took it the way that it was intended. We were fighting to keep the industry alive, we were fighting to keep people employed, we were fighting for the studio, we were fighting for cinemas, and we still are. We’re still there doing that. I’m just glad people understood the intention behind it.”
The film is set for an IMAX release on July 12, with “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” both opening soon after on July 21.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9icmVha2luZy1uZXdzL2VkZ2FyLXdyaWdodC1hZHZpY2UtbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLTctMTIzNDg3NjQ5OS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Speaking to Variety, McQuarrie teased that there is still a future for her in the franchise.

2023-07-13 10:27:44+05:30,Mission Impossible 7: Did you know Tom Cruise charged MINIMAL amount for this movie? Here's why,"Mission Impossible 7 starring Tom Cruise released in theatres on July 12, 2023. Read to know what the actor charged for the film and how he's set to earn from it.","Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One has been one of the most awaited films and the response it has been getting since its theatrical release on July 12, 2023, is proof that the Mission Impossible franchise is still managing to win the hearts of netizens. The spy action film stars Tom Cruise who is considered one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood. Here's how much the 61-year-old earned from the recently released seventh installment.
How much did Tom Cruise charge for Mission Impossible 7?
Cruise has been on a career high after back-to-back successes and it does not seem like he has any plans to slow down. The popular action star, who made history with the release of his 2022 blockbuster film Top Gun: Maverick, has been enjoying the fruits of his hard work with the earnings he receives from his movies. Cruise charged around $12 to $14 million for his portrayal of Ethan Hunt in the next two Mission Impossible films, as per Variety.

The fee is reportedly a lot less than he usually tends to charge but this decision came after the coronavirus pandemic racked the budget of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One to $290 million, which is almost tens times more than what the makers had planned for. This led to Cruise's decision to lower his fees. This doesn't mean the actor will face any kind of major loss because his set of profits are guaranteed and will in fact multiply with the success of the film.
How will Tom Cruise earn from Mission Impossible 7?
Cruise reportedly earned more than $100 million from ticket sales, his salary, and his cut of home entertainment rentals and streaming revenue from Top Gun: Maverick. Since the actor is obligated to receive a significant percentage of Mission Impossible 7's first-dollar gross, he is all set to earn box office bonuses long before the studio breaks even. ""I would never bet against Tom Cruise. Most actors aren't worth what you pay them, but Cruise and maybe Dwayne Johnson justify their salaries,"" a studio executive told the portal.
Since he is also the producer of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, he will also receive a cut for that. Cruise, who is one of the highest-paid actors in the world, is known for doing the majority of his stunts on his own no matter how scary or deadly they might be. The latest installment in the Mission Impossible franchise movie needs to earn at least $800 million globally to recover its budget. Apart from Cruise, the film stars Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, and Esai Morales.

The trailer showcases Hunt engaging in a knife fight atop a speeding train that eventually plunges into the water. From forests to deserts, the film promises a whirlwind tour of the world for the fearless super-agent.
Alongside Cruise, the movie features an impressive ensemble cast comprising both familiar faces and new additions. Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Henry Czerny, Vanessa Kirby, Frederick Schmidt, Hayley Atwell, Mark Gatiss, Charles Parnell, Esai Morales, Pom Klementieff, Cary Elwes, Rob Delaney, Indira Varma, and Shea Whigham are among the talented actors appearing in Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One. With such a star-studded lineup, the film guarantees an unforgettable cinematic experience.

,"Film Critic Harlan Jacobson reviews ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One""",WBGO Film Critic Harlan Jacobson reviews Oppenheimer and Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One,"DD: Not just one Mission Impossible, but two, the latest Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One with Tom Cruise returning as agent Ethan Hunt in the 7th installment in the series, and Oppenheimer, with Cillian Murphy in Christopher Nolan’s large-screen epic about the race to beat Germany to the atomic bomb in WWII. Our film critic, Harlan Jacobson, ties them together and jumps.
HJ: The film universe is atwitter – you should pardon the expression--with Barbieheimer, the race between two mass market films, Barbie and Oppenheimer, that are both opening this weekend to chase big numbers at the box office like the old days, pre-everything. At least as interesting is the performance test between Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning and Oppenheimer. Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer are in their way similar and what the industry needs—fresh auteurist visions where one is light satire with a feminist intent, and the other a dark mea culpa on the use and abuse of male power. But Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning represents the continued uninspired retooling of past franchises – Bond, Bat, Super and Spiderman, Marvels that are no longer marvels -- that are the default position of risk-averse corporate filmmaking. This is the cancer that was eating away at theatrical attendance 30 years before the pandemic landed theaters in the ICU.
Harlan Jacobson Tom Cruise stars as ""Ethan Hunt"" in Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One
Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie’s Dead Reckoning with Tom Cruise hopping from planes to trains and at least one clown car, and Oppenheimer with the lesser-known Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man who birthed the atom bomb and regretted it even before the fallout rained down, however, are both about missions impossible—to save the planet for good or ill. Oppenheimer, however, is the bet made by visionary filmmaking associated with the great American indie explosion of the early 70s in Marty Scorsese and especially Francis Ford Coppola that the way forward is by investigating the American character, in fiction or in history, to take the pulse of the culture in which we now live.
Dead Reckoning did well in its first week out. And given that everyone in the industry, specially during these strike months, is watching the vital signs of both theatres and distributors, that’s a cheering sign if you care about the biz. But the health of the art — meaningful, fresh character narrative that has Tolstoy’s aspirations to paint the broader moment and David Lean’s imperative to make it big – lies with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, lensed by his cameraman on Tenet, Dunkirk and Interstellar, Hoyte Van Hoytema. It's spirit may lie with American indie filmmaking, but Oppenheimer was made using the elite and expensive cutting edge tech tools of film, crafted by people at the top of their art, with limitless resources backed by a studio, Universal, releasing it in standard film, digital IMAX, and in its best iteration that matches how it was shot on a 70-millimeter IMAX film camera – shown at a premium price of $26.99 at Loews 68th Street in NYC, one of 19 theaters in the US and 30 worldwide equipped to show it.
Nolan’s 12th film – you may remember his Memento back in 2000 about what we need to remember -- has two principal concerns on its mind: 1) the moral no-man’s land entered by Oppy, the scientist given a sports team nickname when he led the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos to build the atomic bombs dropped on Japan to end the war, and 2) the ensuing security driven fascism of the Communist witch hunt in Congress less than a decade later that destroyed Oppenheimer’s reputation and his career. At three hours and distilled from the 2006 Pulitzer Prize winning 700 -page book, American Prometheus, The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by former Nation columnist Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film’s arc follows Oppenheimer from his days as a university student who was a lab klutz but a good theoretical physics thinker, through his selection to bring the bomb to bear on the war effort, and the multiple layers of tragedy that ensue.
There are the overlapping politics of university life, military protocols, the war, the post war madness, and the personal dynamics, from marriage to professional egos, that must be threaded and orchestrated on a metronome keyed at first to the German head start on developing a bomb, led by Werner Heisenberg, he of the already famous Heisenberg principle that if you can see it, you’ve altered its nature. Then the metronome of The Red Scare takes over, and we watch Murphy’s 60-foot face trying to reconcile his heartsickness with the inexorable political buzzsaw of petit tyrants coming at him that Sean Connery’s James Bond or Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt routinely escape.
The film is peopled by front rank actors at the top of their power – Murphy as Oppy, Emily Blunt as his wife Kitty, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr. in a standout turn as Oppy’s Brutus, Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh (as Niels Bohr), David Krumholtz, Bennie Safdie (Edward Teller), Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Florence Pugh and Gary Oldman as a chameleon Harry Truman. Nolan returns to the screen 80s British leading man Tom Conti as Albert Einstein and Josh Peck, lost since Nickelodeon’s 2004 series, Drake & Josh, as the nervous wreck here who pushes the button at Los Alamos.
Nolan’s film positions Oppenheimer to understand the necessity of the project, even as the swirl historically pondered how, especially where and whether to use it. Oppenheimer in Nolan is divided against himself. Even on a screen as large as a football field, there’s a lot of one-on-one ruminations before and after the countdown to the Trinity test blast, which Nolan creates in a fireball, and the ultimate bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki delivered more demurely here over a radio report and newsreel aftermath. Oppenheimer is ultimately ruined as a Communist security risk by Senate investigations shown here that drop out to IMAX in black and white. But how we see him hinges on one line, when he responds to a colleague’s private suggestion that the bomb is so terrible they really ought to keep the Soviets in the loop. The film stops for a beat. “That would be treason,” Oppenheimer says here, and he’s having none of that. Ergo, chalk up Oppy as another wronged patriot and a man so traumatized by doubt he’s incapable of defending himself in the face of the fascist McCarthy period.
Everything in America always does come down to how Walt Kelly summarized it in Pogo long ago: “We have met the enemy, and they is us.” This Oppenheimer is brave, ambitious, magnificently accomplished in its filmmaking and on point.
This 7th in the series of Mission Impossibles, Dead Reckoning, begins in a super stealth Russian sub that yields a lot of dead Russians bobbing up beneath the Arctic ice cap and a two-part, interlocking brass key vital to defeat the enemy and save the planet. The hunt is on! Through two hours and 43 minutes, I never did figure out who the enemy is that Cruise as the returning rogue agent Ethan Hunt is battling. He’s got it going on two fronts: his own CIA on the one hand and on the other what?, who? huh?
It helps if the times you live in afford an enemy that corresponds to the real world, but here it’s abstracted into a metaphor called The Entity. (How’s that for a screenwriter hedge?) After all the high tech stuff the CIA uses and Cruise abuses in this film, I never did get how the fate of the planet hinges on finding a brass key? I kept thinking that key sure looks like the one my parents used to open a Chinese dry bar (with pearl inlays) that my father bought for our living room in 1958 at the LS Ayres Dept store in Indianapolis and which my brother transferred from my pile to his pile when we closed up the house in Toledo. “Ethan, don’t kill yourself, my brother has a key like that on Fullerton Ave in Chicago,” I wanted to shout.
No worries, as Cruise, Hayley Atwell as hot female agent Grace, Ving Rhames as the sidekick and Simon Pegg as the techie, engage in a millisecond by millisecond never-ending pitched battle with The Entity, transversing the globe to do chop-socky stunts on the roof of a speeding train, a slap-stick shift tear through Rome in a circus yellow Fiat 500, and leaps of faith over rooftops in Venice and the Swiss Alps and across the sands of Abu Dhabi in a mission that plays out as really quite possible after all to save the world. Yes, Tom Cruise is a Unicorn, as my son calls him. And as with all franchise victories, Carvel Cone afterwards.

,"MOVIE REVIEW: Mission Impossible 7 most exciting summer blockbuster, nears $500 million in global box office sales",,"Over the past two months, as Lynn and I have traveled through the U.S., Canada and Mexico, we have seen five of the big, new, summer movies made for grown-ups.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny
Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning, Part 1
Barbie
The Sound of Freedom
and Oppenheimer
Indiana Jones was fun and better than I’d expected, given the terrible reviews and my low expectations after the horrible Crystal Skull installment.
Barbie was bizarre, woke and confused in every possible way.
The Sound of Freedom was by far the most moving and most important movie of the summer, and one I’ll post a video review of soon.
Oppenheimer was dark, fascinating, and earned its R rating, but history I found worth revisiting. More on that in another review.
But hands down, the seventh installment of Mission Impossible was the most fun and most exciting movie we saw this summer.
It’s the only one of the five that we’ve seen twice.
Not surprisingly, it’s about to hit a half-billion dollars in global ticket sales.
Domestically in the U.S., the Tom Cruise-led franchise has raked in just over $153 million so far.
Internationally, it’s raked in more than $342 million.
All told, MI-7 has earned $496,135,000.
To be sure, it’s being blown away by Barbie, which has already topped $1 billion in worldwide box office sales, even though the politically correct pink picture was released several weeks after MI-7.
Still, Mission Impossible is the far more entertaining flick and one of the most fun of the entire series.
In this video, I explain why.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL2FsbGlzcmFlbC5jb20vbW92aWUtcmV2aWV3LW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS03LW1vc3QtZXhjaXRpbmctc3VtbWVyLWJsb2NrYnVzdGVyLW5lYXJzLXVzZDUwMC1taWxsaW9uLWluLWdsb2JhbC1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLXNhbGVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Director Christopher McQuarrie, who first joined the franchise with 2015's Rogue Nation, shared this anecdote during a recent appearance on The Empire Spoiler Special Film Podcast.
McQuarrie recalled he faced a challenge with how to present Marie (Mariela Garriga)'s backstory in the movie, with test screening audiences failing to understand her storyline.

""That entire [mission briefing] scene came together in the course of a week and was shot in a day,"" he explained. ""Except for the inserts, which we shot in Tom's garage in Florida because there was a missing element.
""First, we raced to shoot the inserts and anything you race to shoot just looks like shit. It was the longest day on the movie, it was the last day on the movie.
""I realised when putting the scene together that I had the key, I had Ilsa, I had the bounty hunters, and we had been struggling with what those flashbacks to Marie meant.
""I was in the editing room. I cut in the Marie footage and went, '30 years ago you were given a choice.' I just laid it out. Stop trying to ask the audience to figure it out and just effing tell them, they want to know.""

The filmmaker then added he phoned Cruise and confessed to mucking up the sequence – telling him that they'd need to add a mugshot to keep the audience gripped by the storyline.
""That triggered – once I was shooting one photograph, well, might as well reshoot them all,"" he added.
""So we brought a desk and some flooring and that bag and some photos and a gun, all the basic props, and went to Tom's garage in Florida. We had a splinter crew go and reshot everything.""
Paramount
McQuarrie previously revealed that a 'cold open' or flashback scene featuring a digitally de-aged version of Cruise's character Ethan Hunt was considered, but they decided not to go ahead with it because the director thought it would be too distracting.
He added that when the scene was seriously being considered, there had even been talk of trying to cast Julia Roberts to play a digitally de-aged love interest for Ethan.
""I got the bill for de-ageing those people before their salaries were even factored into it,"" he further explained.
""And if you put two of them in a shot together, or three of them in a shot together, it would have been as expensive as the train by the time we were done.""

The upcoming action spy film Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One will star Tom Cruise as his iconic character IMF Agent Ethan Hunt. It will feature many of the characters we know and love for their most dangerous mission yet. This movie will only be the first part of a two-part film where the IMF team faces off against Gabriel (Esai Morales).
“I knew I wanted to expand the cast, and I knew I wanted to give each one of those characters more to do, so I knew the movie was going to be bigger and longer than Fallout,” McQuarrie told Collider.
“And at which point I said, ‘Why are we fighting this? Why are we going to try to jam this into two hours? Let’s just break it in half and make it two movies.’ That really was the rationale behind it being a two-part movie. It just it wasn’t just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie,” he continued.

Tom Cruise checks in to promote latest Mission Impossible movie
Hollywood star Tom Cruise is visiting Korea for the 11th time and said Thursday that he went to grab Korean barbeque as soon as he arrived the night before.Since his first visit to Korea in 1994 for “Interview with the Vampire,” Cruise has paid a visit almost every time his film premiered, such as in 2001 for “Vanilla Sky,"" 2008 for “Valkyrie,"" 2013 for “Jack Reacher” and last year for “Top Gun: Maverick."" Cruise said he is so comfortable and well-received in the country that this time, he ""got to meet and talk to people on the streets of Seoul."" He also added that he is ""happy to be able to show Korea to his colleagues here today.""Cruise is not just here to enjoy Korean food with his friends, but to promote his latest film “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One."" On Thursday, he attended the press conference for the film at Lotte Cinema's World Tower branch in Songpa District, southern Seoul and talked about how traveling around the world and making movies is his dream come true.“I was very passionate about storytelling from when I was very young,” Cruise said. “I wanted to make movies and travel the world from when I was four, and started auditioning at age 18.”Reflecting on his three-decade-long career, Cruise said that a passion for acting was what made him the globally famous actor today. “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” tells the story of Ethan Hunt, played by Cruise, who must track down a new weapon that threatens to wipe out all of humanity.“I lived in hotels and worked part-time jobs to get through auditions,” Cruise said. “One of those jobs was sweeping snow off of someone’s lawn. I didn’t study acting professionally and had my share of struggles. A strong passion for acting was what made me the actor I am today.”Cruise famously does all of his stunts in his action films, and “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” was no exception. In this new installment, there is one particular scene where Cruise falls off of a cliff in Norway that is exceptional.“When I do those stunts, I focus on the story first,” Cruise said. “I talk to the director and see what needs to be done to elevate the story that we are trying to tell. I drive my own planes, helicopters and jets, and do my own parachuting too. For this movie, I trained again for parachuting and biking.”Watching Cruise do his own stunts is terrifying yet at the same time gratifying to watch, said Simon Pegg, who has played the supporting character Benji Dunn in the Mission: Impossible series.“Preparations for the stunts are done extensively, so it’s not something you’d call reckless – nevertheless it’s terrifying to watch Tom do all those things,” Pegg said during the press conference. “We film with the best experts from around the world and train with the best for the most amazing shots. Of course, unexpected things happen during filming and everyone is on edge, but I have got some great shots of Tom performing stunts on my phone that I will post on social media once the film is out.”“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” opens in local theaters on July 12.BY LIM JEONG-WON [lim.jeongwon@joongang.co.kr]",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8va29yZWFqb29uZ2FuZ2RhaWx5LmpvaW5zLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2LzI5L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbW92aWVzL0tvcmVhLVRvbS1DcnVpc2UtTWlzc2lvbi1JbXBvc3NpYmxlLzIwMjMwNjI5MTcyNjQwODM4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

This isn’t always the case with actors or even movie stars, some of whom may be good at faking it but really are more interested in fame and fortune than they are the cinematic experience. And while Cruise may be one of our last, true movie stars, it’s pretty hard to question that his feelings for the art of moviemaking are real.
I mean, Steven Spielberg himself gave Cruise credit for saving “Hollywood’s ass” after the pandemic.
In that particular case, Spielberg was talking about Cruise’s insistence on releasing Top Gun: Maverick in theaters during a time of great uncertainty in the industry. A billion and a half dollars later, Cruise clearly made the right call there. But there’s another key ingredient to the once and future Ethan Hunt’s strategy to keeping cinema alive – and that’s his frankly insane stunt work. So with Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One hitting theaters, let’s look at how Tom Cruise approaches stunts in the Mission: Impossible movies, and how his lifelong love of film has fueled that methodology.
Ranking Tom Cruise's Mission: Impossible Team From Worst to Best 21 Images
Tom Cruise has been making movies since 1981, and became a star within two years of that with the release of Risky Business. He’s had his ups and downs over the decades of course, but one thing that audiences have come to expect from the actor in recent years is him doing his own stunts. And not just that, but one-upping himself with each subsequent Mission: Impossible movie.
Director Christopher McQuarrie, who is currently on his third film in the series, with a fourth in the works, says that there’s a simple reason why Cruise does these huge stunts himself.
“Immersion, plain and simple,” McQuarrie told IGN. “It connects you to the characters and to the story in a way that you couldn't do otherwise. The challenge of that obviously is putting the camera in a place where you can see that the actor is actually doing it. For us, it's really important not that you are watching a stunt, but that you are experiencing that stunt with the protagonist.”
But where does this dedication to the art of the stunt come from? In Dead Reckoning, we see Ethan Hunt’s oath to the IMF, so we asked Cruise what his personal oath to Hollywood would be. He had thoughts.
“I'm first and foremost the audience. The audience,” Cruise responded. “So when you look at the films that I have, it's not about me. It's about us. It's about that experience together. … That's why Top Gun: Maverick, I was like, no, this movie's coming out in the theaters. And when we were going through that time period, I kept calling the distributors and the theaters. I said, no, it's coming. And I showed them the movie and I said this will be in the theaters. I want you to have that experience. And, you know, in the ’80s I was the first guy, again in modern cinema, to shoot 65 mm [film] for Far and Away. I want that big-screen experience for an audience. I want it for myself to watch. I want other filmmakers, and also I want actors to have that opportunity where their movies come out in the cinemas. And I want to show them how to do it.”
“ I want that big-screen experience for an audience. I want it for myself to watch.
And that comes back to the stunts, whether he’s hanging from the side of a plane or climbing the side of a building or pulling off a HALO skydive. Cruise, and McQuarrie with him, are looking for ways to make the cinema the way to experience these films.
“We're finding ways to immerse an audience into a movie,” Cruise told IGN. “Everything, my whole training, and when I watch movies, I want to feel connected with that character. And how do we do it? That's one way. You know, I enjoy doing it. I enjoy the challenges of it, but it all comes down to story. How do we invest the audience in the story?”
In the case of Dead Reckoning Part One, the big – capital B – stunt to get that investment involved a motorcycle jump off a cliff which then leads into a base jump. Easy-peasy, right? But Cruise figured the best plan was to film it on day one of production… just in case he got killed doing it.
“Either we will continue with the film or we’re not,” he laughed in an interview with ET . “Let’s know day one! Let us know day one what is going to happen. Do we all continue or is it a major rewrite?”

Of course, that doesn’t include all the prep that Cruise and the team did to get the stunt right – and to make sure the actor didn’t get killed in the process. This meant Cruise did over 500 skydives and over 13,000 motocross jumps just during rehearsals and while planning the stunt. 500 skydives! And then when the actual shoot came, Cruise rode a motorcycle off a cliff six times that day. Or rather, six motorcycles, since they didn’t have parachutes like he did.
McQuarrie admits that this was the scariest stunt to execute… for this movie anyway. But Dead Reckoning Part Two isn’t done yet, either.
“In terms of this movie, definitely the motorcycle jump,” McQuarrie said when asked about the scariest stunt they’ve shot. “But we have continued and we've pushed ourselves even further in Part Two. And you'll see. It's terrifying.”
It all goes back to Tom Cruise’s Hollywood oath, doesn’t it?
“I love this industry, and I've been blessed to be able to live my dreams since I was a kid,” Cruise said. “I was four years old and I wanted to travel the world, make movies. I wanted to go to different cultures and not just visit as a tourist. I wanted to work there. I wanted to be there. And this has given me my dream and afforded me to be able to share it and put it on screen. And I've dedicated my life to this art form. … I make movies for audiences. I don't really think about awards either. For me, it's about the audience. It's not about all of that other stuff. When I'm making movies, I'm not thinking about that. I'm literally thinking about that family that are going out to the theater. For them to have that experience. That's what's important.”

2023-07-12 14:15:12+00:00,Henry Czerny Is Back as Kittridge in Mission Impossible,"Henry Czerny, who appeared in the first M:I movie in 1996 is reprising his role as the director of the IMF in Dead Reckoning Part One.","A character from Ethan Hunt’s past is back in Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One. Actor Henry Czerny is reprising his role as Eugene Kittridge, director of the Impossible Mission Force, also known as the IMF. Czerny appeared in the very first Mission: Impossible movie in 1996 as Ethan’s boss and foe, if not outright bad guy.
Czerny has been conspicuously missing from the franchise for the past 27 years as several other actors have taken on the role of IMF director. But he’s back now, tracking Ethan’s whereabouts and lecturing our hero about how he’s going to have to “choose a side” in some great battle to come. Here’s everything you need to know about what Kittridge was up to in that first film, where he’s been, and why he’s back for the seventh movie.
Read More: Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One Changed a Major Part of Ethan Hunt’s Backstory
Who is Eugene Kittridge?
Agent Eugene Kittridge is a sort-of antagonist from the first Mission: Impossible movie. The head of the super-secret government organization wrongfully accused Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) of being a mole. Ethan proved him wrong (as he so often does). Presumably, Kittridge left the IMF after the events of that film since by Mission: Impossible III, Lawrence Fishburne’s Theodore Brassel has taken on the role of IMF Director.
Who else has been head of the IMF?
We never find out what happens to Brassel. He probably died considering the fates of future IMF leaders.
Read More: The 30 Most Anticipated Movies of Summer 2023
Tom Wilkinson briefly plays the head of the organization in the fourth movie, Mission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol, but dies in a targeted attack by the Russians early in that film. In Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, Alec Baldwin’s Alan Hunley takes over the IMF, but he tragically dies during a shootout just one movie later in Mission: Impossible—Fallout.
That leaves the position open for Kittridge to make an ignominious return in Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One. Typically, misidentifying a mole might mean permanent retirement in the spy business. But the abysmal survival rate for IMF heads might explain why the government had no choice but to bring back an old director like Kittridge.
Is Kittridge a good guy or a bad guy in Dead Reckoning?
It’s hard to say. Kittridge certainly hasn’t changed his world philosophy in the last quarter century. He still sees the world in stark terms, telling Ethan in the trailer for Dead Reckoning Part One that he needs to “pick a side.” Ethan has always put the greater good above allegiance to any one government, so these two will likely clash (again) over their differing viewpoints.

But it’s Esai Morales’ Gabriel who is being billed as the main antagonist in the film. Maybe Ethan and Kittridge will have to put their differences aside to defeat a greater foe—or maybe Ethan will have to wage a battle on two fronts at once.

,Choose to accept this ‘Mission’,Tom Cruise takes “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” to new heights.,"“Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” (henceforth “M:I—DR1″) arrives just in time to save this season from unsatisfying actioners. Unlike “ Fast X ” and “ Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse ,” this movie tells you before you spend your money that its story will not be resolved by the closing credits. Even better, its cliffhanger is narratively satisfying as a standalone ending, something those other films failed to achieve.
“Mission” opens Wednesday. “Part Two″ arrives in 2024.
Despite its 163-minute runtime — longer than “Fast X,” “Spidey,” or “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” — this film moves faster than its 2023 summer movie predecessors. I would wager that the script by director Christopher McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen has more scenes of exposition as well. In fact, there’s as much action as there is explanation of the plot, yet somehow that doesn’t slow down the story.

“M:I—DR1″ is the seventh installment of the series where Tom Cruise trolls Father Time by doing crazy stunts while working the espionage missions that give the series its title. In this one, he drives a motorcycle off a cliff, a death-defying stunt the filmmakers shot on the first day of production in case Cruise pulled a Wile E. Coyote.

Cruise made it, of course, and the production averted the need for “a major rewrite.” The stunt itself is not only spectacular; it’s also a very funny comic punchline.
Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg also return as Luther Stickell and Benji Dunn, respectively. They’re Hunt’s righthand men, the guys who provide the cool disguises he uses to impersonate other people to get information. Luther and Benji are also Hunt’s eyes in the sky, unlocking doors for him through their computers and keeping him aware of his surroundings at all times.

As always, Rhames and Pegg are a lot of fun. The two actors play off each other well in this series, and it’s amusing to see the physically imposing Rhames as a computer geek. The rapport between them and Hunt is similar to the chemistry among the crew of the “Fast & Furious” series, but Hunt appears even more concerned about “fammm’ly” as Vin Diesel’s Dom Toretto. With his moist eyes and his face a mask of perpetual worry, Cruise makes his devotion even more cloying than Diesel does.
But I digress. Ethan Hunt’s latest mission, should he choose to accept it, is to discover what’s going on with an AI program gone rogue. “M:I—DR1″ opens in the Bering Sea where a submarine called the Sevastopol is a victim of that artificial intelligence. It takes over the sub’s computer systems and makes the crew think they’re under attack. Considering the Sevastopol has been designed to avoid detection, its members are rightfully rattled.
Turns out, it’s a false alarm, but tragedy ensues as the crew accidentally blow themselves up. As their bodies float to the surface, we get a glimpse of this film’s MacGuffin, a two-part key on a necklace that is literally the key to solving Hunt’s mission.
Back on land, Hunt sees a ghost from his past while navigating an airport with Luther and Benji’s help. We meet Gabriel (Esai Morales), who shows up for a split second, glimpsed through Hunt’s surveillance spectacles, then disappears. Benji will later describe this phenomenon as a “ghost in the machine,” an indication that the team’s hardware has been infected by the AI, which the film constantly refers to as “The Entity.”

The Entity has the power to confuse and shut down entire systems. Whatever country controls it will become the most powerful government in the world.
Apparently, Gabriel is the representative for The Entity; that is, in addition to being the reason Hunt joined the Impossible Missions Force. Morales is more than a formidable foe. He gives a smooth but intimidating performance, cutting a striking figure as a silver fox who’s as easy on the eyes as he is rough on our protagonists.
Gabriel appears to be everywhere and nowhere at once, making him unpredictable. In doing The Entity’s bidding outside the technological realm, his mission is to kill everyone Hunt cares about, forcing Hunt into a showdown that’s a major Catch-22.
Characters from previous installments have supporting roles here. Vanessa Kirby returns (as the deadly arms dealer White Widow), as does Rebecca Ferguson (as M16 agent Ilsa Faust). Newcomer Hayley Atwell gets in on the fun as Grace, a master pickpocket who is in way over her head.

Everyone’s gunning for that two-part key, which we’re told is the only thing that can stop and destroy The Entity. The techie in me had some serious questions about the dialogue involving The Entity’s source code; he was overruled by the part of me that loves when movie dialogue devolves into scientific mumbo jumbo.

As if mocking the latest “Indiana Jones” film, “M:I—DR1″ climaxes with an extended sequence aboard a runaway train. Cruise, without any need for the de-aging techniques that marred Indy, battles Gabriel on top of the train while multiple dramas occur within it. Kirby is especially good here, as is Atwell. While the two men battle for the title of quién es más macho?, the two women are engaged in an equally exciting battle of wits.

Mercifully, you won't have to sit through the film a second longer after the credits roll, as Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One doesn't feature a post-credits scene. It's an entire film designed to set up its successor—we don't need a thirty-second teaser! Sure, Fast X used that time to tease some character returns, but Spider-Verse dealt away with the post-credits scene entirely.
Regardless, we won't have to wait long before the eighth Mission: Impossible movie arrives in theaters.

2023-07-16 19:47:30+00:00,‘Mission: Impossible’ for Tom Cruise: Meeting Hollywood Expectations,"The seventh film in the 27-year-old movie franchise was No. 1 at the box office, taking in $80 million over its first five days. But the movie industry was hoping for more.","Analysts that track moviegoer interest and use complex formulas to forecast ticket sales had predicted that “Dead Reckoning Part One” would generate about $250 million worldwide over its first five days, with the United States and Canada contributing at least $85 million. “The industry was looking for bigger here,” said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers.
“This opening is roughly average for an action thriller at this point in its series,” Mr. Gross said about the ultraexpensive “Dead Reckoning Part One,” which received sensational reviews. “Of course, there’s nothing average about this film.”
Mr. Cruise, considered white hot as a box office draw after last year’s “Top Gun: Maverick,” promoted “Dead Reckoning Part One” with his usual globe-trotting, walking red carpets for premieres in Rome, London, Abu Dhabi, Seoul, Sydney and New York. Early last week, he made surprise appearances in movie theaters at preview screenings in cities like Toronto, Atlanta and Miami.
The blistering promotional campaign for “Dead Reckoning Part One” will be Hollywood’s last until a consortium of studios can come to terms with SAG-AFTRA, as the powerful actors’ union is known. On Friday, the union went on strike for the first time in 43 years, saying it was fed up with exorbitant pay for entertainment moguls and worried about not receiving a fair share of the spoils of a streaming-dominated future.
In the coming weeks, studios like Universal, Sony and Disney have movies set for release that will have to do without the promotional star power of people like Denzel Washington (“The Equalizer 3”), Owen Wilson and Tiffany Haddish (“Haunted Mansion”) and Will Ferrell and Jamie Foxx (“Strays”).",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTYvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVkaWEvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLXRvbS1jcnVpc2UtYm94LW9mZmljZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-06 14:34:00+00:00,How Tom Cruise Trained for the 'Biggest Stunt in Cinema History',Here's how movie star Tom Cruise prepared for a hugely ambitious action sequence in 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning.',"Tom Cruise is known for committing fully to the part in each of his movies, including doing much of his own flying in Top Gun: Maverick and throwing himself into doing his own stunt work on the increasingly explosive action sequences in the Mission: Impossible franchise. The latest installment in the spy thriller series, due to be released on July 12, features the actor's most ambitious stunt yet, and has been dubbed the ""biggest stunt in cinema history.""
A mini-documentary released on YouTube by Paramount Pictures follows the months of preparation that went into planning and executing a heart-stopping chase scene in Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One, in which Cruise's character, secret agent Ethan Hunt, rides a motorcycle off the edge of a cliff and goes into a base jump, free-falling towards the earth before pulling his parachute cord.
""There's a lot going into this stunt,"" says director Christopher McQuarrie. ""So Tom put together this master plan to coordinate all of these experts in each of the particular disciplines involved, to make this whole thing happen.
Prior to the shoot in Hellesylt, Norway in 2020, Cruise undertook a year of training to master motocross, base jumping and advanced skydiving, including working on his strength and stability to ensure he can control his own position mid-air, and manoeuver the parachute canopy in the right way.
""You train and drill every little aspect over and over and over and over again,"" says Cruise.
When the prep for the shoot was at its most intense, Cruise was doing 30 jumps per day, and he racked up more than 500 skydives and 13,000 motocross jumps over the course of rehearsal. Throughout this entire process, Cruise also wore a GPS chip so that they were able to track his speed and location in three-dimensional space at every stage of the stunt, which then enabled them to plan exactly where the drone cameras needed to be for the shoot.
""The key is me hitting certain speeds and being consistent with that,"" says Cruise. ""There's no speedometer, so I do it by sound and feel of the bike. And then as I depart the bike, I'm using the wind that's hitting me, I'm pumping my chest, that will give me lift.""
On the day of the shoot, all conditions have to be perfect for Cruise to pull off the staggering feat, and things are tense behind the camera as the actor shoots off the edge of the precipice and plummets into the valley below... a total of six times.
""We've been working on this for years,"" says Cruise. ""I've wanted to do it since I was a little kid.""

,"Film Critic Harlan Jacobson reviews ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One""",WBGO Film Critic Harlan Jacobson reviews Oppenheimer and Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One,"DD: Not just one Mission Impossible, but two, the latest Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One with Tom Cruise returning as agent Ethan Hunt in the 7th installment in the series, and Oppenheimer, with Cillian Murphy in Christopher Nolan’s large-screen epic about the race to beat Germany to the atomic bomb in WWII. Our film critic, Harlan Jacobson, ties them together and jumps.
HJ: The film universe is atwitter – you should pardon the expression--with Barbieheimer, the race between two mass market films, Barbie and Oppenheimer, that are both opening this weekend to chase big numbers at the box office like the old days, pre-everything. At least as interesting is the performance test between Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning and Oppenheimer. Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer are in their way similar and what the industry needs—fresh auteurist visions where one is light satire with a feminist intent, and the other a dark mea culpa on the use and abuse of male power. But Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning represents the continued uninspired retooling of past franchises – Bond, Bat, Super and Spiderman, Marvels that are no longer marvels -- that are the default position of risk-averse corporate filmmaking. This is the cancer that was eating away at theatrical attendance 30 years before the pandemic landed theaters in the ICU.
Harlan Jacobson Tom Cruise stars as ""Ethan Hunt"" in Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One
Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie’s Dead Reckoning with Tom Cruise hopping from planes to trains and at least one clown car, and Oppenheimer with the lesser-known Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man who birthed the atom bomb and regretted it even before the fallout rained down, however, are both about missions impossible—to save the planet for good or ill. Oppenheimer, however, is the bet made by visionary filmmaking associated with the great American indie explosion of the early 70s in Marty Scorsese and especially Francis Ford Coppola that the way forward is by investigating the American character, in fiction or in history, to take the pulse of the culture in which we now live.
Dead Reckoning did well in its first week out. And given that everyone in the industry, specially during these strike months, is watching the vital signs of both theatres and distributors, that’s a cheering sign if you care about the biz. But the health of the art — meaningful, fresh character narrative that has Tolstoy’s aspirations to paint the broader moment and David Lean’s imperative to make it big – lies with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, lensed by his cameraman on Tenet, Dunkirk and Interstellar, Hoyte Van Hoytema. It's spirit may lie with American indie filmmaking, but Oppenheimer was made using the elite and expensive cutting edge tech tools of film, crafted by people at the top of their art, with limitless resources backed by a studio, Universal, releasing it in standard film, digital IMAX, and in its best iteration that matches how it was shot on a 70-millimeter IMAX film camera – shown at a premium price of $26.99 at Loews 68th Street in NYC, one of 19 theaters in the US and 30 worldwide equipped to show it.
Nolan’s 12th film – you may remember his Memento back in 2000 about what we need to remember -- has two principal concerns on its mind: 1) the moral no-man’s land entered by Oppy, the scientist given a sports team nickname when he led the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos to build the atomic bombs dropped on Japan to end the war, and 2) the ensuing security driven fascism of the Communist witch hunt in Congress less than a decade later that destroyed Oppenheimer’s reputation and his career. At three hours and distilled from the 2006 Pulitzer Prize winning 700 -page book, American Prometheus, The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by former Nation columnist Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film’s arc follows Oppenheimer from his days as a university student who was a lab klutz but a good theoretical physics thinker, through his selection to bring the bomb to bear on the war effort, and the multiple layers of tragedy that ensue.
There are the overlapping politics of university life, military protocols, the war, the post war madness, and the personal dynamics, from marriage to professional egos, that must be threaded and orchestrated on a metronome keyed at first to the German head start on developing a bomb, led by Werner Heisenberg, he of the already famous Heisenberg principle that if you can see it, you’ve altered its nature. Then the metronome of The Red Scare takes over, and we watch Murphy’s 60-foot face trying to reconcile his heartsickness with the inexorable political buzzsaw of petit tyrants coming at him that Sean Connery’s James Bond or Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt routinely escape.
The film is peopled by front rank actors at the top of their power – Murphy as Oppy, Emily Blunt as his wife Kitty, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr. in a standout turn as Oppy’s Brutus, Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh (as Niels Bohr), David Krumholtz, Bennie Safdie (Edward Teller), Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Florence Pugh and Gary Oldman as a chameleon Harry Truman. Nolan returns to the screen 80s British leading man Tom Conti as Albert Einstein and Josh Peck, lost since Nickelodeon’s 2004 series, Drake & Josh, as the nervous wreck here who pushes the button at Los Alamos.
Nolan’s film positions Oppenheimer to understand the necessity of the project, even as the swirl historically pondered how, especially where and whether to use it. Oppenheimer in Nolan is divided against himself. Even on a screen as large as a football field, there’s a lot of one-on-one ruminations before and after the countdown to the Trinity test blast, which Nolan creates in a fireball, and the ultimate bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki delivered more demurely here over a radio report and newsreel aftermath. Oppenheimer is ultimately ruined as a Communist security risk by Senate investigations shown here that drop out to IMAX in black and white. But how we see him hinges on one line, when he responds to a colleague’s private suggestion that the bomb is so terrible they really ought to keep the Soviets in the loop. The film stops for a beat. “That would be treason,” Oppenheimer says here, and he’s having none of that. Ergo, chalk up Oppy as another wronged patriot and a man so traumatized by doubt he’s incapable of defending himself in the face of the fascist McCarthy period.
Everything in America always does come down to how Walt Kelly summarized it in Pogo long ago: “We have met the enemy, and they is us.” This Oppenheimer is brave, ambitious, magnificently accomplished in its filmmaking and on point.
This 7th in the series of Mission Impossibles, Dead Reckoning, begins in a super stealth Russian sub that yields a lot of dead Russians bobbing up beneath the Arctic ice cap and a two-part, interlocking brass key vital to defeat the enemy and save the planet. The hunt is on! Through two hours and 43 minutes, I never did figure out who the enemy is that Cruise as the returning rogue agent Ethan Hunt is battling. He’s got it going on two fronts: his own CIA on the one hand and on the other what?, who? huh?
It helps if the times you live in afford an enemy that corresponds to the real world, but here it’s abstracted into a metaphor called The Entity. (How’s that for a screenwriter hedge?) After all the high tech stuff the CIA uses and Cruise abuses in this film, I never did get how the fate of the planet hinges on finding a brass key? I kept thinking that key sure looks like the one my parents used to open a Chinese dry bar (with pearl inlays) that my father bought for our living room in 1958 at the LS Ayres Dept store in Indianapolis and which my brother transferred from my pile to his pile when we closed up the house in Toledo. “Ethan, don’t kill yourself, my brother has a key like that on Fullerton Ave in Chicago,” I wanted to shout.
No worries, as Cruise, Hayley Atwell as hot female agent Grace, Ving Rhames as the sidekick and Simon Pegg as the techie, engage in a millisecond by millisecond never-ending pitched battle with The Entity, transversing the globe to do chop-socky stunts on the roof of a speeding train, a slap-stick shift tear through Rome in a circus yellow Fiat 500, and leaps of faith over rooftops in Venice and the Swiss Alps and across the sands of Abu Dhabi in a mission that plays out as really quite possible after all to save the world. Yes, Tom Cruise is a Unicorn, as my son calls him. And as with all franchise victories, Carvel Cone afterwards.

2023-06-21 12:19:29+00:00,Why Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” Motorcycle Stunt Was Filmed Day One,"Cruise and the crew knew if the stunt went badly, the entire movie could have been derailed, so best to find out on day one.","Why Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” Motorcycle Stunt Was Filmed Day One
Death, taxes, the physical laws of the universe, and Tom Cruise and his Mission: Impossible team topping whatever the craziest stunt in their previous film was with one even more death-defying—these are a few of the certain things in life. This is why, while it’s not surprising to hear that the most technically challenging and dangerous stunt Cruise and his team have attempted thus far is one they set up for Dead Reckoning Part One, the reasons behind them attempting the stunt on the very first day of filming are still quite chilling.
Co-writer and longtime M:I director Christopher McQuarrie told Empire this past May that Cruise’s biggest stunt for the upcoming film—riding a motorcycle off a cliff and into a BASE jump—was done on day one to give the cast and crew “all the time in the world to understand why [Ethan] was doing what he’s doing.” McQuarrie added: “If we sat around and tried to figure out these movies the old-fashioned way, you’d never find it, simply because it’s such a living, breathing thing.”
Yet Cruise himself was even more straightforward and darkly practical when he described the decision to do the stunt on day one—because it could have gone horribly wrong. Instead of filming a large portion of the movie and then losing Cruise to injury—or worse—Cruise and team figured that attempting to clear the hurdle right from the jump would have given them more flexibility going forward if it went awry.
“Well, we know either we will continue with the film, or we’re not. Let’s know day one!” Cruise told Entertainment Tonight. “Let us know day one what is going to happen: Do we all continue, or is it a major rewrite? I was training, and I was ready. You have to be razor-sharp when you’re doing something like that. It was very important as we were prepping the film that it was actually the first thing. I don’t want to drop that and go shoot other things and have my mind somewhere else. Everyone was prepped. Let’s just get it done.”
Being razor-sharp for massively complex stunts is the core ingredient of the Cruise-led franchise. He scaled Dubai’s half-mile-high Burj Khalifa tower in 2011’s Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol. Then in 2015’s Rogue Nation, Cruise topped that by hanging from the outside of an Airbus A400M Atlas airplane as it took off. There’s more. In 2018’s Fallout, we spoke to stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood about how he helped prepare Cruise for two wildly difficult sequences. One was his HALO jump (high-altitude low-open) from 25,000 feet. The second saw Cruise pilot his own helicopter in a dizzying, insanely daring chase scene for the movie’s climax.
The motorcycle-to-base-jump stunt tops all of those in complexity. It’ll be featured in the two-part Dead Reckoning story, which finds Ethan Hunt and his IMF team trying to track down an A.I.-based weapon that could destabilize the entire world.
Cruise is joined by familiar faces and newcomers alike. The returning champs are Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Henry Czerny, Vanessa Kirby, and Frederick Schmidt. Newcomers include Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, Cary Elwes, Rob Delaney, Indira Varma, Shea Whigham, Mark Gatiss, Esai Morales, and Charles Parnell.
You’ll be able to see the big stunt, which, happily, went off without a hitch, and a whole lot more when Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One opens in theaters on July 12.

2023-07-24 03:15:07+00:00,‘Mission: Impossible’ Box Office: Can ‘Dead Reckoning’ Rebound From Barbenheimer?,'Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning' tumbled a series-worst 64 percent as 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' turned into weapons of box office mass destruction.,"Tom Cruise, the star who is credited with saving the box office after Top Gun: Maverick flew to $1.5 billion in global ticket sales, is now facing another kind of reckoning — surviving the Barbenheimer effect.
His Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One tumbled a franchise-worst 64 percent to $19.5 million in its second weekend when going up against Barbie and Oppenheimer, whose dual arrivals transformed into a cultural phenomenon and propelled the domestic box office to historic heights. Revenue for the July 21-23 weekend was the fourth-biggest of all time; in addition, it was the first time ever that one movie opened to $100 million or more and another to $50 million or more. Barbie scored $155 million, followed by $80.5 million for Oppenheimer. No one in Hollywood anticipated such a staggering turnout.
The seventh installment in Paramount and Skydance’s storied Mission: Impossible series, which finished Sunday with a domestic total of $118.8 million, had hoped to earn as much as $25 million in its second outing.
The question now is whether Dead Reckoning Part One can level out and enjoy a long run as other series installments have done, and just as Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick did. Executives across Hollywood, and not just at Paramount, aren’t ruling Dead Reckoning out just yet, especially since it has a better critics’ score on Rotten Tomatoes than Barbie and Oppenheimer, as well as strong audience exit scores.
“I don’t think the story has yet been written,” says one executive at a rival studio.
Mission: Impossible pics have never sported mega-openings, yet expectations were high for Dead Reckoning after Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick opened to $160.5 million over Memorial Day weekend in 2022, including $126.7 million for the three days. Dead Reckoning had been tracking to open to $90 million in its first five days beginning July 12; instead, it took in a franchise-best $78.5 million, not adjusted for inflation.
Titles in the Mission franchise have always drawn a larger percentage of their global gross from the foreign box office. Dead Reckoning Part One is no exception. It earned another $55 million from 72 markets in its second weekend for a foreign tally of $252.1 million and $370.9 million globally through Sunday. It is doing especially well in Asia, where Barbie and Oppenheimer aren’t strong players. And in a number of markets, it is pacing 15 percent or more ahead of 2018’s Mission: Impossible — Fallout. In Japan, it debuted to $7.9 million, 23 percent ahead of Fallout, which earned a franchise-best $571.5 million overseas for a global total of $791.7 million, including $220.2 million in North America.
Mission: Impossible 7 had to contend with losing Imax screens for three weeks to Oppenheimer, in addition to losing premium large-format screens to both Oppenheimer and Barbie. The upcharge for Imax and PLFs is significant and can have a big impact on the bottom line. In early July, Imax screens were dedicated to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
Cruise’s latest movie, directed by Christopher McQuarrie, cost nearly $300 million to produce and saw its release date delayed numerous times because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was initially set to open in summer of 2021, then summer or fall of 2022. Its release date ultimately landed on mid-July of this year, a date dictated by the shooting schedule of Dead Reckoning Part Two and Cruise’s availability to promote Part One (the actor is known for his global marketing efforts).
Adds another observer: “Barbenheimer siphoned off MI7′s potential this weekend, with Oppenheimer drawing older males away from Dead Reckoning. Not only that, Sound of Freedom is an unexpected force to be reckoned with and is presenting competition from an unlikely source.”
Estimates for the U.S. box office show Angel Studios’ faith-based political thriller Sound of Freedom beating Dead Reckoning for the weekend with $20.1 million for a cume of $123.4 million (Sound of Freedom opened July 4), according to Comscore. Paramount and other studios show Dead Reckoning beating Sound of Freedom; Monday actuals will determine the order.
Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part Two is set to open in theaters June 28, 2024. McQuarrie and Cruise have shot much of the movie, but production is now halted because of the SAG-AFTRA strike in another moment of reckoning for the storied action franchise.
Things looked different in late June, when Cruise — Hollywood’s highest-profile advocate for the theatrical experience — urged audiences to see Dial of Destiny. And, yes, two other movies in a surprisingly effective plea. Wrote the actor on Instagram : “I love a double feature, and it doesn’t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiZW5oZWltZXItMTIzNTU0MzYwMi_SAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3MvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYmFyYmVuaGVpbWVyLTEyMzU1NDM2MDIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-21 18:58:04+00:00,On Set: Mission Impossible,KHOL film critic Jeff Counts reviews Tom Cruise's summer blockbuster Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One,"﻿ ﻿
It was way back in 1996 when Tom Cruise first introduced us to Ethan Hunt. Hunt was a highly effective field agent for the Impossible Mission Force and, though we didn’t know it then, he was also the character we would learn to identify most closely with the real-life persona of Cruise himself. Sure, he’s played Jerry Maguire, Maverick, Jack Reacher and others, but Ethan Hunt and Tom Cruise are the same person.
Any discussion of a “Mission Impossible” movie has to start with the stunts. If you haven’t seen the trailer for “Dead Reckoning Part One”, watch it immediately after reading this review. There is a motorcycle/base-jump trick that is simply breathtaking, more so because Cruise is doing it himself. Apparently, they shot that scene on day one, in case something went wrong, and Cruise couldn’t go on. He’s been doing his own stunts for years, and his willingness to put his own life on the line for his movies adds a blood-and-sweat authenticity that is hard to ignore. Like I said before, the line where Tom Cruise ends and Ethan Hunt begins is pretty faint and can probably be measured in insurance premiums.
As a story, “Dead Reckoning Part One” is kind of lame. Old enemies and new threats are converging to take over the world and make a hell of Ethan’s personal life in the process. It’s nothing we haven’t seen before, even if the latest main villain is so awkwardly “of the moment” you might struggle to keep your eyes from rolling if they weren’t glued to the action. That’s because, thankfully, there’s incredible fight choreography, car chase work and set pieces to offset the unnecessarily expository dialogue and underdeveloped bad guys. Characters in “Dead Reckoning Part One” make a habit of saying all the obvious things out loud, but they get back to the business of being in an action movie quickly enough.

The cast includes regulars like Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson and they all play their parts with clear joy. It seems like it’s genuinely fun to do these projects with Tom Cruise and newcomers like Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff add a lot to the ensemble. The only real disappointment in the cast is Esai Morales. Not because of his performance, but because of how he was written. To call his character thin would be too generous. He’s a piece of paper, and his role in the evil proceedings is among the many things I hope will be given more depth in Part Two.
Speaking of Part Two, the fact that they stretched “Dead Reckoning” across a pair of films feels like a risk. The concept can work, as Harry Potter and the Avengers have shown, but I’m not sure there is enough here to warrant 5 hours. And I really hope Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie don’t attempt to compensate for their story by veering into the cartoonish territory of a “Fast and Furious” movie. “Mission Impossible” is a franchise built using much better materials than that and I’d hate to see the padding overshadow the plot when this adventure continues in 2024. Tom and Ethan are both too good at this to let that happen, right?
There’s a quick comment in “Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One” about technology replacing highly specialized people. Certainly no one involved could have predicted that the WGA and SAG-AFTRA would be arguing right now with the studios, at least in part, about that very possibility. I personally hope the writers and actors prevail in their negotiations with the executives, so Hollywood can get back to work in an environment of fairness and honest appreciation for creative work. Until then, thank you Tom Cruise, for giving us something so thrilling and fun to remind us why we go to movies in the first place.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vODkxa2hvbC5vcmcvb24tc2V0LW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1wYXJ0LW9uZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

This week’s report takes an early look at possible box office trajectories for the seventh installment of the Mission: Impossible film franchise, alongside tracking updates for other upcoming releases.
Updates for No Hard Feelings; Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny; and Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, plus other forecast updates, are in the table below.
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One
Paramount Pictures
July 11, 2023 (WIDE)
3-Day Opening Weekend Range: $65M-$80M
Domestic Total Range: $250M-$320M
PROS:
Selling points for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One include not only the critical and commercial success of its 2018 predecessor, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, but the enormous goodwill earned by star Tom Cruise from last year’s Top Gun: Maverick. These two factors combine for a potentially significant wave of momentum heading into Dead Reckoning Part One‘s release, as audiences look forward to Cruise’s continuation of the long-running action franchise and its marquee real-life stunts.
Dead Reckoning‘s first day of pre-sales in sampled North American markets registered 8 percent above those of John Wick: Chapter 4 and just 15 percent behind Fast X. With the Mission: Impossible franchise typically being less frontloaded than the Fast and Furious films—and with the fact that several other high-profile films are competing for pre-sales dollars—that’s a very encouraging early sign.
Premium formats should be a strong component of the Mission: Impossible franchise’s box office once again. This is particularly true of Imax, which featured a special making-of sequence for Dead Reckoning running in front of Maverick as an early marketing piece last year.
Mission: Impossible films have historically played longer than moreyouth-driven franchises, positioning this sequel to enjoy a leggy run through the back half of summer.
Social media sentiment has been consistently enthusiastic with the release of each trailer and featurette. Christopher McQuarrie, director of this entry and the previous two, has played a significant role in helping drum up buzz by posting various behind-the-scenes tidbits and announcements over the past few years.
Dead Reckoning‘s recent push up from a Friday to Wednesday release, with various preview dates also in play, helps give the film some extra time in theaters—and on premium screens—before Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer opens the following week.
CONS:
With Oppenheimer slated to release nine days after Dead Reckoning, commanding most of the Imax and premium footprint for several weeks, crossover competition for both premium screens and the adult male audience will be notable. Fallout drew a 55 percent male and 59 percent age 35-plus opening weekend demographic share in 2018, while Nolan’s Dunkirk pulled a 60 percent male lead with 76 percent over the age of 25.
On a similar note, if Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny—out less than two weeks before Dead Reckoning‘s Wednesday opening—were to draw healthy word of mouth, its chase weeks at the box office could be a strong player for some of Dead Reckoning‘s target audience.
With the move to a Wednesday release, plus several instances of early access shows and previews, forecast models will be more volatile than when the film was slated for a traditional Friday opening.
As the first of what’s presumed to be the two-part finale of Cruise’s tenure with the franchise, it remains to be seen if word of mouth will be as strong as has it been for the last few entries. A cliffhanger ending, if that comes to pass, for a 163-minute movie could be a blow to the series’ typical crowd-pleasing nature, depending on the tone of the film’s denouement.

,"Pom Klementieff details how she prepared to play the newest ""Mission: Impossible"" villain","Pom Klementieff plays Paris, who is pursuing Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt in ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning.""","For Pom Klementieff, taking center stage in the newest ""Mission: Impossible"" movie was a dream come true.
The actress who has starred in multiple action films, including Marvel's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" series, said she always wanted to do action movies, ""specifically 'Mission: Impossible.'""
""I think it's the best of this genre, you know? It's more than just an action movie,"" Klementieff said. ""I think it's art, you know, and the level of excellence in everything in these movies is just, it's just mind-blowing.""
Even before being cast as Mantis in the second ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movie, Klementieff was training in martial arts. She spent years learning how to fight, and sometimes while writing the sessions in her schedule, she would label them as ""Mission: Impossible"" training instead of martial arts training or stunt training.
""I was manifesting the whole time,"" Klementieff said. ""(I) was like one day, 'Maybe I get to do a fight with Tom (Cruise).'""
Finally, her work paid off and Klementieff was cast as Paris, the villain in ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One,"" the seventh chapter in the high-octane action series. Her character pursues Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt with a maniacal glee, a performance that Klementieff said was partially inspired by a bird.

""This particular bird, you have to Google it, it's called a shoebill or shoe-billed stork. I thought it kind of looked like my character,"" Klementieff said. ""It's a crazy prehistoric bird that looks crazy, and I like the way it moves and the look that it has, and in the movie ... I don't speak a lot. So a lot of emotions are conveyed with just body movement, face movement with just a kind of rage boiling under the skin and wanting to explode, but like, with no words, you know?""
Klementieff said that another part of her acting process was urging Tom Cruise to kick her harder during some of their climactic fight sequences.
""I know my distances and I know that if I squeeze my abs, I can take a hit. And that's (what) you do when you fight, you know? Tom is so trained and so skilled and so good at action that he could actually do it if he wanted to with a little bit of contact in action movies actually helps and makes it look more real,"" Klementieff said. ""And it helps in the acting, too, because if he hits me a little bit, oh, my eyes are going to change and I'm going to become a tiger.""
Despite her requests, Cruise wouldn't kick any harder.
""He's such a gentleman that he was like, 'No, no, no, Pom, I'm not going to hurt you. I'm not going to hit you. I was just like, 'Just a little bit, please,'"" Klementieff said. ""He said 'No.'""
Despite Cruise playing a hero and Klementieff playing a villain on-screen, the two were friendly on set, with him even giving her skydiving lessons after the film was finished shooting.
Pom Klementieff. CBS Mornings
""He set it up for me, which was so kind and generous, and I learned how to skydive. I stayed there for like 10 days, I took lessons, and he did some jumps with me. We did some jumps,"" Klementieff said. ""They were so much fun, and now I'm hooked. As soon as I have some time off, (I'm) going back to jump.""
Klementieff also earned the on-set nickname ""Pom Cruise,"" and when introduced at the film's premiere, cast and crew chanted ""Mission Im-POM-sibble"" as she came on stage.
""They were like, doing that when we were shooting the movie, like sometimes they would just sing 'Pom, Pom, Pom, Pom,'"" to the tune of the franchise's theme song, Klementieff said.
It's music that she says she'll never be tired of. Klementieff said she even sang the theme music to herself when she was worried about a specific stunt.
""What I would do sometimes before an action scene, specifically before when I had to run on top of a moving train, it was going pretty fast ... and to remind myself what I was doing and how happy I was to be shooting this and to give me more courage to do it,"" she said.
That excitement and pride hasn't gone away after filming.
""It's a huge honor,"" Klementieff said. ""I'm proud and I'm very happy to be working with incredible filmmakers like Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise, who are so, so amazing to work with and who inspired me every day. I feel lucky.""
""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One"" hit U.S. theaters on Wednesday, July 12. Deadline calls it ""Hollywood action filmmaking at its peak"" and The Hollywood Reporter praises director Christopher McQuarrie's ability to keep ""his audience glued to every moment.""

We now know why Tom Cruise and his Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One team filmed his insane motorcycle-into-BASE jump stunt on day one. The short answer—the stunt was so complex and difficult that, if something had gone wrong, at least it would have happened before they’d spent millions of dollars and many days and nights filming other parts of the film. Once successfully completed, the cast and crew could focus their full attention on the rest of the film without the highly difficult sequence looming in their near future. And this is precisely what happened. Cruise and the talented stunt crew conceived pulled it off, and Dead Reckoning Part One continued filming thereafter.
Now, Paramount has made a huge cache of new images available, and quite a few of them detail what Cruise and co-writer/director Christopher McQuarrie are calling the most complex and challenging stunt in the franchise’s long, stunt-loving run. As mentioned, Cruise had to drive a motorcycle at top speed off the edge of a cliff and go directly into a successful BASE jump, requiring him to master motocross racing, motocross jumping, and, of course, piloting the parachute after successfully deploying at just the right time. [The massive ramp the crew built was later turned into a proper cliff in post-production by the visual effects team.] Here are images that give you a peek at what it looked like to be there:
The new images also reveal the hugely talented ensemble surrounding Cruise. Dead Reckoning Part One follows the seismic events in Fallout, where Cruise’s Hunt, along with his trusty team of Isla Faust (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg), and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), helped stave off a potential nuclear nightmare. Now, the weapon they’re deployed to keep out of the hands of the bad guys is more dangerous than ever—artificial intelligence. In the wrong hands, the AI has the potential to cause an entire system collapse of the known world order. Enter Ethan and the IMF squad.
The new images include the abovementioned stars, plus some key returning players like Vanessa Kirby’s White Widow and newcomers, too, including Pom Klementieff’s Paris, Hayley Atwell’s Grace, Shea Whigham’s Jasper Briggs, Indira Varma, Esai Morales, and Mariela Garriga.

2023-08-06 18:19:10+00:00,Is the ‘Mission: Impossible’ Series Due for a Reckoning?,"After an underwhelming box office performance for ""Dead Reckoning,"" Tom Cruise should return to the original ideas of ""Mission: Impossible.""","When did the “Mission: Impossible” films become action movies? I’m not sure when that happened, but I do know this much: For a series like the one in question, it’s live by the action, die by the action. For a few days there, people were chattering about all the great action in “Dead Reckoning Part One,” talking up the Fiat car chase or that train-dangling-from-a-cliff climax as if we’d never seen a sequence like that one before. But all I could think was, “Don’t we have the ‘Fast and Furious’ franchise for that?”
For 27 years, the “Mission: Impossible” films have been dotted with great action. That’s part of what these movies are. In a funny way, though, it can’t be the essence of what they are. Because then, no matter how spectacular Tom Cruise’s latest P.T. Barnum feat of star-in-the-air stunt work is (at this point how could he top himself short of doing a spacewalk?), the rest of the film inevitably recedes behind it. If “Dead Reckoning Part Two” weren’t already on the way (most of the movie was shot last year), I’d make the following recommendation to Cruise and his collaborator-auteur, director Christopher McQuarrie: If you really want to end this series on a high note, go back to the thing people loved about “Mission: Impossible” in the first place — the Russian-doll cleverness, the borderline insane trickiness, the way these movies are espionage thrillers turned inside out. If you made a great one of those, then instead of okay-to-disappointing box-office returns you might hold audiences in the palm of your hand as surely as they’re eating up “Oppenheimer.”
I grew up watching the original “Mission: Impossible” series on television with my father. I was 10, 11, 12 years old and could barely follow what was going on, but when those puzzle plots came together I still felt the rush. The series had almost no “action.” It was all deftly absurd, precision-cut, trap-door spy games. In 1996, when director Brian De Palma turned the show into a movie (at that point it wasn’t clear that he was spawning a franchise), he came up with a seductive hybrid: more action-driven than the show had been, but with enough narrative duplicity to bedazzle and pull the floor out from under the audience. The most memorable episode in the movie — Cruise hanging from that wire, performing the ultimate cat-burglar heist, a sequence so tense that a falling drop of sweat felt like a bomb — was at once pure action and pure intrigue.
The “M:I” movies have varied greatly, in tone and quality, to the point that there’s not a lot of consensus as to the highlights. Most of them are fun, and we all have our soft spots (I’m still awed by certain moments in John Woo’s “Mission: Impossible 2,” one of the least-loved entries in the series). But to me the greatest “M:I” film, the one extraordinary enough in its trickery to hypnotize and prank the audience, is Brad Bird’s “Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol.” I still think Cruise’s suction-cup spider crawl over the sleek surface of the Burj Khalifa is the most cinematic stunt of his career, and Bird orchestrated a grand illusion of perception in the rest of the movie.
I thought something like that might happen in “Dead Reckoning Part One” as I watched the early airport pickpocket chase sequence, which is the film’s most breathlessly effective episode. It’s all gambits and reversals, and it introduces a very “Ghost Protocol” idea: that the Entity — otherwise known as the Internet gone AI rogue — could virtually camouflage a character like Esai Morales’ Gabriel. That concept feels like it could be the next evolution of the “M:I” masks. But the film introduces the idea only to do next to nothing with it. On the technological-deception scale, the airport sequence is “Dead Reckoning’s” high point, which is another way of saying that the movie culminates too early.
Action will always be part of cinema, and the “Mission: Impossible” movies have every right to aim for stupendous action sequences. If it sounds like I’m begrudging the evolution of Cruise’s stuntman brand, on the contrary: I’d never deny the excitement, or fanatical bravado, of what he does. A few years ago, I wrote admiringly of how those stunts have become the measure of his stardom, and I stand by that assessment. Yet the ballpark-similar, barely-good-enough-to-get-by domestic box office grosses of “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” ($150 million), “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” ($170 million) and “Fast X” ($145 million) should be telling us something: that action, as a selling point, may have peaked, entering a period of overexposed exhaustion. Of all those franchises, the “M:I” films are the last ones that should be coasting on the coolness of a Fiat 500 zooming around Rome. Cruise and McQuarrie’s mission, should they choose to accept it, is to make this series fascinating again by remembering that the ultimate movie stunt is still the one that wows your brain.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2NvbHVtbnMvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLXNlcmllcy1mdXR1cmUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctZXNwaW9uYWdlLTEyMzU2ODg4Mzkv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vY29sdW1ucy9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtc2VyaWVzLWZ1dHVyZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1lc3Bpb25hZ2UtMTIzNTY4ODgzOS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-14 20:27:19+00:00,‘Mission: Impossible’ Star Hayley Atwell Has Waited Over 17 Years for Her True Blockbuster Moment,Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning star Hayley Atwell steps into her biggest role yet after multiple Marvel movies.,"In 2013, when Hayley Atwell took the stage for Trafalgar Studios’ production of The Pride, she had no idea that future co-architect of the Mission: Impossible franchise, Christopher “McQ” McQuarrie, was in attendance. Atwell had already read for McQ and Tom Cruise’s 2012 film, Jack Reacher, but on this particular occasion, McQ was so gobsmacked by her live performance that he took the actor out to dinner and stated his intentions to write a role for her someday. Well, someday became 2019, as McQ and Cruise needed a new leading lady to play Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One’s master thief, Grace.
Atwell has waited over 17 years for an opportunity like this in a blockbuster film. Yes, she’s played the fan-favorite Peggy Carter at least a half-dozen times in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but her big screen opportunities were almost always in service of another character’s story, that of Steve Rogers/Captain America. In Dead Reckoning Part One, Atwell is finally at the center of a tentpole feature, and that is evident when Grace gets the better of Cruise’s Ethan Hunt multiple times during the first half of the film.
“I was finally given the trust and the platform … to show more range and to show more emotional depth in a franchise or something of this size, which I hadn’t been afforded before,” Atwell tells The Hollywood Reporter in a conversation conducted ahead of the SAG-AFTRA strike. “And so I have this eternal gratitude to Tom and to McQ, who provided the resources and the support system every day on set so that I could thrive. It’s been a deliverance of a long time coming. After 17 years in this industry, I’ve finally been able to do something at this level, with this quality of filmmaking, and I’d never been afforded that before.”
In a production filled with indelible moments, Atwell will never forget a rainy day in Rome, where she drifted during a car chase, all while Cruise was handcuffed to her.
“There’s about 20 minutes of footage of us [drifting] over and over again,” Atwell says. “And then Tom led a round of applause from the crew, and McQ said, ‘Tom put his life in your hands just then and he wouldn’t have allowed you to do that had he not believed that you could look after him, too.’ So they’re never short on their praise for when actors come in and deliver for them. That’s a moment I’ll never forget.”
Below, during a conversation with THR, Atwell also discusses Grace’s real name and backstory, before previewing Dead Reckoning Part Two’s Arctic location in Svalbard, Norway.
So, if I recall correctly, McQ was impressed by your work in a play after you were already in the mix for Jack Reacher, and he’s kept you in mind ever since. Is that the basic origin story?
That’s correct, yes. McQ saw me in The Pride in Trafalgar Studios about ten years ago. He took me out for dinner after and said, “That thing you did on that stage, I want it. I want to bottle it. I don’t know what the character or story would be …” So he’s never forgotten it, and he quoted back a line to me from The Pride the other day. It’s like, “Wow, it really stayed with him.” The character is overcome with this really difficult period in life, and she just says, “All that wasted time.” And so he said it to me. McQ is a really good actor. He’s very engaging. He delivered it in such a beautiful, emotional way, and it took me right back to that moment.

As a highly trained actor, how did you take to a process where the story and the character are still in flux throughout production?
I think my classical training allowed me to surrender to the process of it, without sounding too arty. When you do a degree of three years, you’re trying out lots of different things and failing on a daily basis, or at least you’re feeling like you are. You’re taking lots of risks and you don’t know what skill set you have. You’re still honing in that toolkit. So it put me in good stead of having a work ethic, and if I trust the filmmakers I’m working with to only put into the movie the thing that’s gonna serve the story, then there’s a freedom in it and I can try lots of different things.
With Grace, I really wanted her to be more than one thing, because we are all more than one thing. She has her moments of self-assurance and then self-doubt, and courage and then fear, in the face of these high stakes. So that sense of not knowing, that hypervigilance, is with her throughout, and I just felt like I could ground her and give her a bit more depth than just relying on the physical visual spectacle that we were creating.
So there’s footage of the cast watching Tom’s motorcycle jump on day one, and almost everybody started laughing once he went over the edge. Was the laughter a way to cope with the sheer terror of what he was doing?
I think it was just the exasperation. We’d heard about this, and we’d seen him in preparation and training for it. We’d seen the engineers design and build that ramp at that location. We’d seen him that morning jump off the helicopter over that precipice to test the wind, and so the laughter came out of just awe. A man was risking his life for the movie and to delight his audiences. I actually laughed more once I’d heard that the canopy had successfully been deployed and he’d made it back to the ground. I laughed even harder when the first words out of his mouth were something like, “Okay, I think I can go further off the motorbike.” He was immediately giving himself notes about how to do it better next time. He was like, “Okay, yep. We got that one. Let’s move on.” So the sheer dedication to craft and to entertain just takes your breath away.

Hayley, you are the only person in recorded history who’s experienced a car chase in Rome while handcuffed to Tom Cruise.
(Laughs.)
So, what do you want the history books to know about this experience?
That being outside of your comfort zone can lead to very unexpected beautiful things if you trust your scene partner and if you’ve done the preparation that it takes to be able to put yourself in a situation like that, not only to do it safely, but also to be able to throw out different performances. And Tom, as we all know, is so diligent in his preparation and his discipline, and that becomes very contagious for me to want to also meet him at those intense places. I also knew that there was this huge safety net there and that he’s not reckless, so we were able to have fun with it.
Ethan pulls her file and then extrapolates as to what Grace’s likely backstory is, and I loved the way you played that moment with this almost prideful look on your face. Do you think he was right on the money?
Yeah, it helped me a lot, because I’d already started shooting before they’d written that scene. So I wasn’t sure exactly about the backstory that they would give her, and I’m really pleased that they did say that she’s an orphan. Her need for survival turned her into an opportunist and someone who wanted nice things, “other people’s things,” because she hadn’t come from any sort of privilege or luxury. And I thought, “Okay, that makes sense for the choices that she makes and the way that she changes the plot and pulls the rug from underneath his feet.” She’s not doing that because she enjoys watching other people suffer. She’s doing it because she has a very strong need to survive and be hyper independent in the world.
I know this is an action franchise, but I do try to work out a psychological profile for a character I’m playing, so I can root her in something that often comes from a core wound. And I thought, “Well, how great,” because it shows me there in that moment that if human beings are wired for connection, then that is the reason why we can survive our attachment to our primary caregivers or the world that we are born into. But if she can’t do that, then she’s very fearful of other people. She can’t trust them. Maybe she’s been betrayed by them, and so out of that comes why she does the things she does. And I thought, “They’ve hit the nail on the head of being able to have the audience not despise her or dislike her for all the things she does,” particularly to Ethan at the beginning of the movie. You go, “Okay, so she comes from that perspective. That makes more sense.” It’s a more humane way as to why she does the thing she does.
When Ethan asks for her name, she says, “How about Grace?” which implies that it’s not her real name. I think you can actually see a few letters of her real name on a passport later in the film. [Writer’s Note: “Fr Mar” is visible on the third-act passport.] But do you know her real name yet?
It wasn’t until after we finished filming and McQ had inserted a closeup of this passport where you do see those couple of names, that he sent me the name and some backstory about the name and where it came from. And I thought, “Oh, that’s such a good Easter egg.” And who knows if that is another alias? But I think it’s probably gonna be explored more in Part Two. Their attention to detail when it comes to little things like that is really fun for an actor. It’s also fun for the fans to be able to go back and go, “Oh, that moment was planted early on.” It’s a lovely callback and shows the attention that McQ as a filmmaker puts into things that seem, on the surface, as sweeping visual delight and spectacle. He’s put a lot of thought into each of the characters’ lives, and I love that.
In Venice, there’s a moment where Ethan says, “Your life will always matter more to me than my own,” and it cuts to Grace, who has tears in her eyes that are on the verge of falling. Did you play it as her being moved by Ethan’s words, or were the tears a residual effect of recent tragedy?
At the time, we did lots of variations where she’s still defiant and still unwilling to trust him. She’s coming into this world where she would have to give up the independence that she has not only enjoyed, but also depended on to survive. And so I knew that would be a very emotionally conflicting moment for her. In retrospect, where we ended up taking it is that deep down, whether she’s aware of it or not, that’s something she’s always wanted to hear from another human being. It’s the idea that someone else has got her back, without an agenda. She says, “You don’t even know me,” so she’s definitely not earned that from him by that point at all. But deep down, she really wants that relief of having someone look out for her.
Also, the cost now of caring about another human being and being cared for is a lot for her to take, because the cost of caring and trusting someone for the first time means the risk of losing that person or being betrayed by them. So, in that moment, she’s just on the verge of really wanting to believe that it’s real, because it’s something that she’s always wanted. So when she says, “Promise me you’ll be on that train,” I feel like later it’s her going, “When you said your life wouldn’t be more to me than my own, I need you now to prove it.”
So, don’t get me wrong, you’ve had some amazing moments in Marvel movies, but I’ve honestly always felt like there was some untapped potential there, something McQ has now fulfilled in Mission. You’re as active as you’ve ever been and you show a wide range of your abilities. So do you feel like this is the centerstage moment you’ve been waiting for in a blockbuster film?
Yes. (Laughs.) On this level, yeah. I’ve had plays or productions that I’ve done in London, which, of course, is to a live audience, and so it’s not lived beyond the performance that night. It’s not immortalized on camera. But yeah, I feel this sense that I was finally given the trust and the platform to do lots of different things and to show more range and to show more emotional depth in a franchise or something of this size, which I hadn’t been afforded before. And so I have this eternal gratitude to Tom and to McQ, who saw it in me and provided the resources and the support system every day on set so that I could thrive. They are generous enough to let me try and find my own way through this, without pigeonholing her as one thing, and it feels like it’s been a deliverance of a long time coming. After 17 years in this industry, I’ve finally been able to do something at this level, with this quality of filmmaking, and I’d never been afforded that before.

As AI and the ongoing attack against truth became more and more relevant this year, both issues served as real-life character development for your big bad, The Entity. So, what was the internal response to this real-life and real-time development of your villain?
The idea was brought very early on into production meetings, and my understanding of the story from the beginning was that it was this unquantifiable force that’s impossible to control. It knows us better than we know our own next move, and it’s faceless, ultimately. And I thought it was clever of [co-writers] Chris [McQuarrie] and Erik [Jendresen] to go, “Well, this makes for the perfect villain with global high stakes. It affects potentially every great power in the world.” So then it becomes a question of what do you do once you get that power? And the fight for that power in whoever possesses this key, they possess a different kind of global power that’s never been seen before, so that changes the trajectory of human beings. And then they grounded it in character, with a messenger of the Entity, played brilliantly by Esai Morales. He has such a charismatic, enigmatic presence on screen that’s chilling. To me, it spoke to the spreading of fake news, unregulated social media and the global powers at play that affect the lives of individuals and communities, and the potential repercussions of all those things. So I thought it felt very apt.
Are you allowed to tease your experience shooting in the Arctic for Part Two?
Only insomuch as nothing has ever been filmed in the Arctic for a movie of this scale. People thought that it would be impossible, and luckily, Team Mission just came in and totally invalidated that belief system. I can say that the main focus was the safety of the cast and the crew, but also the respect of the landscape out there. The territory feels unowned in a way because it’s so majestic and raw. At times, in minus 55 with a wind chill, having to get action dialogue in that takes a tremendous amount of organization and focus. So how they put that together and weave that into the story, I don’t know, but it will remain the most extraordinary place I’ve ever been on this planet and will probably ever go.

Decades from now, when you’re reminiscing in front of a crackling fireplace, what day on your Dead Reckoning Part One will you likely recall first?
(Laughs.) It would be drifting in Rome with Tom in the passenger seat, handcuffed to me, with three cameras attached to the windscreen, which impaired my vision. And then it started to rain and the ground was getting wet, which obviously affected the drift. There were stunt cars, and we were beside these very old important monuments. People had come out to watch, and obviously, the crew was watching. I also had to work out whether Tom was speaking to Hayley or Ethan was talking to Grace, when he would say, “Slow down or take a left.” If it was Ethan talking to Grace, she can rebel against exactly what he’s saying and do the opposite. He would also come up with suggestions that he wanted me to try and say, and then we did it. So there’s about 20 minutes of footage of us doing it over and over again, and then stopping to get out and go, “Well, I hope we got some good stuff.”
And then Tom led a round of applause from the crew, and McQ said, “Tom put his life in your hands just then and he wouldn’t have allowed you to do that had he not believed that you could look after him, too.” And I thought, “Wow, that’s generosity and trust from Tom and how hard he’s seen me work to make sure I can do this for him and for the movie.” It was a beautiful surprise to me, because I just thought, “Well, you told me to train really hard to be able to do it. So I did it.” It was a validation because they know what it takes technically, physically, mentally, emotionally to have done that and executed it well. So they’re never short on their praise for when actors come in and deliver for them. That’s a moment I’ll never forget.

,"Vanessa Kirby on bringing ""The White Widow"" to life in ""Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One""",The film hits theaters today.,"Vanessa Kirby on the higher stakes for the ""White Widow"" in new ""Mission: Impossible"" movie
When actor Vanessa Kirby reprised her role as Alanna Mitsopolis, widely recognized as the White Widow in ""Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,"" she focused her portrayal of the White Widow to be a powerful and dangerous international arms dealer, adding an electrifying dynamic to the film.
""I wanted to just try and capture the essence of what she had done,"" Kirby said.
Her character is known to have a quiet, yet menacing look and aura surrounding her which Kirby said was a challenge to learn.
""I would never have thought about myself to be somebody that sort of so in charge of this really dark, you know, hugely powerful organization, but to do it with lightness and play,"" she said.
She performs stunts throughout the movie with Tom Cruise, who plays protagonist Ethan Hunt, and also performs his own stunts in the ""Mission: Impossible"" series.
The film hits theaters today. It is a production of Paramount Pictures, a division of CBS News' parent company. Its highly-anticipated release follows a four-year gap since the release of the previous installment, ""Mission: Impossible – Fallout.""
To express gratitude to the audiences and embracing their enthusiasm for the franchise, Cruise and other members of the cast recently visited movie theaters across multiple cities. Kirby said this speaks to their bond, which got stronger as the cast and crew filmed together during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""We were a little family in our bubble for it now to be out there in the world is really thrilling. I think everybody is so fantastic and and I'm very proud to be a part of it,"" Kirby said.
""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One"" hits U.S. theaters on Wednesday, July 12. Deadline calls it ""Hollywood action filmmaking at its peak"" and The Hollywood Reporter praises director Christopher McQuarrie's ability to keep ""his audience glued to every moment.""

2023-06-30 21:00:00+00:00,Tom Cruise Had the ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Crew in ‘Absolute Terror’ with Death-Defying Stunts,"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" director Christopher McQuarrie admitted that the production was terrified about Tom Cruise surviving stunts.","Tom Cruise truly knew no bounds with the death-defying stunts for “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.”
Cruise already opened up about achieving the most dangerous stunt of his career: riding a motorcycle off a cliff and narrowly escaping a potentially fatal end. Now, in a new behind-the-scenes featurette for the upcoming Paramount film, Cruise shares how he learned how to speed-fly.
“It’s a very beautiful and delicate sport,” Cruise said of the intense sport he spent years training for. “We’re gonna do spirals, and we’re landing at an incredibly high speed, over 80 kilometers an hour.”
“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning” director Christopher McQuarrie noted that speed-flying is “one of the most dangerous sports in the world.” While visually similar to paragliding, speed-flying occurs closer to cliffs to achieve more acceleration; however, there is also a higher probability of crashing.
“While it may look similar, speed-flying is not skydiving,” McQuarrie said. “Skydiving is fairly predictable. Speed-flying is very unpredictable. Behind the scenes, we were all in absolute terror.”
McQuarrie added, “With Tom, there are no limits.”
Lead star Cruise admitted earlier this year that with his motorcycle stunt, he was worried it was “not going to end well” if he didn’t pull the parachute in time.
“I had about six seconds once I departed the ramp to pull the chute and I don’t want to get tangled in the bike,” Cruise said. “If I do, that’s not going to end well.”
The “Eyes Wide Shut” actor previously shared that his favorite element of filmmaking is the practical stunts.
“I am a very physical actor and I love doing them. I study and train and take a lot of time figuring it all out,” Cruise said in 2021. “I have broken a lot of bones! The first time of any stunt is nerve-wracking, but it’s also exhilarating. I have been told a few times during shooting a stunt to stop smiling.”
With a burgeoning stunt category rumored to be recognized by the Academy Awards, it seems like Cruise’s chances of an Oscar just might prove to be true.

,Mission: Impossible's Pom Klementieff talks Tom Cruise fight scene,'Guardians' star Pom Klementieff wanted Tom Cruise to kick her in the stomach for a 'Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One' fight scene. 'But he wouldn't do it.',"Tom Cruise got strapped to the outside of a plane for 2015's Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and rode a motorbike off a cliff for the latest sequel, Dead Reckoning Part One. But there is at least one thing the Top Gun star won't do in pursuit of on-screen verisimilitude while making the action franchise — kick Pom Klementieff in the stomach.
In the latest Mission: Impossible film, the Guardians of the Galaxy actress plays a highly dangerous character named Paris who is partnered with the movie's main antagonist, Gabriel, played by Esai Morales. During a sequence set in Venice, Paris has a fight with Cruise's super-spy Ethan Hunt and it was while shooting the encounter that Klementieff asked her co-star to give her a kick in the guts for real.
""I kept telling him to just kick me here,"" the actress recalls to EW, indicating her midsection. ""I was squeezing abs. [I said], 'You can just go for it.' He was like 'No, no, no, no, no.' I was like, 'But it's going to help me!' But he wouldn't do it.""

Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One director Christopher McQuarrie cast Klementieff after seeing her playing Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 and describes her character as ""very, very, very much a chaotic element in the story. It doesn't matter how deep in the background she is, you're going to be watching her at all times and wondering what she's going to do."" The actress herself says that Paris is someone who ""destroys everything in her path. She's a rebel, she's a killer, she's extremely skilled and quite lonely too.""
Much of the destruction caused by the character takes place in Rome during a sequence in which a Humvee-driving Paris pursues Cruise's Ethan Hunt and Hayley Atwell's character, who are in a small yellow Fiat. ""I had so much fun shooting this scene,"" says the French actress. ""It was so special to be on location in Rome. We were shooting during COVID, so we were very lucky to be here. I was trying to not laugh too much because I was having so much fun in the car following the Fiat.""
Klementieff reveals that her character's name is a nod to the Great Paris, the magician-spy played by Star Trek actor Leonard Nimoy on the original Mission: Impossible TV show. ""When Christopher McQuarrie cast me for the role, he didn't know which name the character would have,"" she says. ""It was cool to name me Paris, me being from France, and then they decided that I would speak French because I speak French in real life.""

It is unlikely that Nimoy ever wore anything as eye-catching on the TV show as the looks sported by Klementieff in the movie.
""She's very different style-wise from every other actress in the Mission: Impossible franchise,"" Klementieff says. ""She has a side that's a bit more punk and she doesn't really give a f---. So that was cool.""
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One will release in theaters July 12.

,‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’ was made for the love of movies,Tom Cruise reaffirms his determination to entertain the audience at all costs in “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning – Part One.”,"Tom Cruise loves only one thing: movies.
In his latest big-screen foray, “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” the seventh film in the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, Cruise reaffirms his determination to entertain the audience at all costs. But “Dead Reckoning” adds extra substance to the typical “I can’t believe he actually did that” stunts the franchise is known for, serving as a tribute to past “Mission: Impossible” films and a warning about potential downturns in moviemaking.
“Dead Reckoning” follows Cruise’s Ethan Hunt as he, yet again, must travel the globe and track down an object that may determine the fate of the world before a villain with unclear motivations — aside from a desire for world destruction — can acquire it. Plus, Hunt is isolated from and being hunted by his own government, who assumes that this time Hunt has really turned evil, unlike the past six times.
As with many “Mission: Impossible” movies, the plot is borderline incomprehensible at times. But the occasional confusion doesn’t make the moments where Cruise comes to the slow realization that he’ll have to perform some crazy stunt, like climbing the world’s tallest building, to get to the next step in his journey any less satisfying.
While not the franchise’s best — that title still belongs to 2018’s “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” — “Dead Reckoning” succeeds as one of Cruise’s better over-the-top globetrotting adventures in no small part because of the film’s locations. Much of the movie’s action occurs in Rome, Venice and the Austrian Alps, three of the most scenic places in the world, making spending time with Hunt and company a delight.
The set piece in Venice is a particularly inspired use of location to further the story. Cruise and costars Hayley Atwell and Rebecca Ferguson are forced to run around the famously confusing, moonlit and claustrophobic stone alleyways of Venice while receiving baffling and often incorrect directions — the only possible improvement would have been a gondola stunt.
“Dead Reckoning” is also probably the funniest movie in the franchise, with Simon Pegg’s portrayal of the doddering Benji, Hunt’s friend, getting many of the best laugh lines. On multiple occasions, he cracks meta-narrative jokes about how he, Hunt and the rest of their team always end up going rogue, saving the day with just milliseconds left and other franchise tropes.
The entire supporting cast of the film turns in strong performances, with franchise newcomers Atwell and Pom Klementieff standing out through their boatloads of charm and intensity in action scenes. Atwell even accomplishes the task that has eluded Cruise’s female co-stars for 40 years — she’s so charismatic that she manages to have some semblance of chemistry with him.
But as incredible as these developments are, there was only ever going to be one highlight of “Dead Reckoning,” the so-called “biggest stunt in cinema history”: Tom Cruise driving a motorcycle off a cliff to do a base jump. After well over a year of the stunt being promoted in trailers ahead of every movie, my expectations were quite high.
Unsurprisingly, the jump completely delivers. The moment is tense and shot breathtakingly, and the whole time one can’t help but think “I can’t believe he’s actually doing this.”
Between the big stunt, classic “Mission: Impossible” mask switcheroos and other brilliantly choreographed action I can’t spoil here, the finale of the movie does not disappoint. It’s a long film, clocking in at more than two and a half hours, but the third act is worth the wait due to the thrilling action.
Perhaps more unexpectedly, “Dead Reckoning” comments on the current state of blockbuster moviemaking. Cruise, who has shown time and again that he will do anything to further cinema, uses the movie as a chance to comment on the rise of artificial intelligence in filmmaking.
The villain of the film is the “Entity,” a sentient piece of artificial intelligence Hunt is determined to destroy, while every world government and a foe from Hunt’s past, Gabriel played by Esai Morales, is determined to use it to their advantage. Coming in the midst of both writers and actors strikes in Hollywood where AI is a central issue and in the middle of a summer full of blockbusters criticized for poor CGI like “The Flash” and “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” the subtext of the plot is hard to miss.
The movie also acts as a throwback to the original “Mission: Impossible,” released in 1996 before every blockbuster was made almost entirely in front of the green screen. The near-constant use of close-up, angled shots evokes director Brian De Palma’s style from that first movie, and plot elements from the late-night scene in Venice to the return of CIA director Eugene Kittridge recall Ethan Hunt’s first mission going rogue.
“Dead Reckoning” is one part tribute and another part eulogy to this nearly extinct style of filmmaking. The follow-up to the film, “Dead Reckoning — Part Two” is expected to be Cruise’s final go-round as Ethan Hunt, marking the end of an era for a franchise that has bucked many of the trends in blockbuster filmmaking over the past 30 years.
Cruise is doing all he can through his bonkers stunts and unexpectedly layered plots to remind audiences one last time of the power action movies hold. He’s even willing to drive motorcycles off cliffs for it.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZ3doYXRjaGV0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3LzIxL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1wYXJ0LW9uZS13YXMtbWFkZS1mb3ItdGhlLWxvdmUtb2YtbW92aWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,"Tom Cruise Refused to End ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’ on a Cliffhanger, Told the Director: ‘It’s Got to Be Satisfying’","SPOILER ALERT: This story discusses the ending of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” currently playing in theaters. “Dead Reckoning,” the seventh installment of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, is the latest Hollywood blockbuster to be split into two movies, but Tom Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie tried their hardest to give “Part One” a non-cliffhanger […]","SPOILER ALERT: This story discusses the ending of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” currently playing in theaters.
“Dead Reckoning,” the seventh installment of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, is the latest Hollywood blockbuster to be split into two movies, but Tom Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie tried their hardest to give “Part One” a non-cliffhanger conclusion. The filmmaker recently told Total Film magazine that thinking about how to conclude the first of two movies kept Cruise up at night during the filming of “Part One.”
More from Variety
“Where we ended the movie was always where we were going to end it,” McQuarrie said of the train action sequence. “How we ended the movie was a big, big mystery for us. It kept Tom awake at night throughout production. He would come in all the time and say, ‘This can’t be a cliffhanger, it’s got to be satisfying.’ The audience has to feel a sense of completion.”
McQuarrie continued, “Tom kept looking at that scene, and he had all this anxiety about whether or not it would be a satisfying conclusion or whether it would feel open-ended. We constantly revisited it, constantly refined it.”
Unlike “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” which threw moviegoers a curveball by ending on a massive cliffhanger (its second part, “Beyond the Spider-Verse,” arrives in March 2024), “Dead Reckoning Part One” ends with Cruise’s Ethan Hunt achieving his immediate goal (he secures the key to unlock the source code of The Entity, the film’s villainous AI program) and Hayley Atwell’s Grace accepting an offer to join the IMF. There are dangling plot threads for “Part Two” to pick up (chief among them being that the film’s human villain, Esai Morales’ Gabriel, is still alive), but at least one mission has reached its definitive end. This is a far more conclusive ending than “Spider-Verse,” which leaves viewers hanging as Miles Morales is stuck in an alternate universe with the Prowler-version of himself.
Story continues
“If you leave it with a cliffhanger, it feels a little bit like we’re expecting you to come back,” McQuarrie told Total Film. “We didn’t want that feeling. The feeling we were reaching for — and we hope you feel — is we dare you not to come back. We want to leave you thinking, ‘Oh, I can’t wait to see what happens next.'”
“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is now playing theaters nationwide from Paramount Pictures. “Part Two” is set to open on June 28, 2024.

,Mission: Impossible’s inadvertently smart take on AI policy,,"Mission: Impossible’s inadvertently smart take on AI policy Presented by Google & BCG
Tom Cruise attends the premiere of the new ""Mission: Impossible"" film. | Evan Agostini/Invision/AP
This week, apparently, DFD goes to the movies: “Oppenheimer” wasn’t the only film released this summer blockbuster season that has a lot to say about AI.
The other one is “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” which, in addition to its title absolutely rolling off the tongue, happens to deal head-on with the growing fear in both Silicon Valley and Washington that AI could pose an existential threat to humanity.
In the film a rogue AI known only as “the entity” manipulates human actors to do its mysterious bidding, insinuating itself into the world’s defense and financial systems and setting off a global race to control the software by any means necessary.
It’s not the first Hollywood film with an AI villain , but it is the first to land amid the current wave of anxiety and hype about the technology. And while it delivers (and then some) on its promised action spectacle, the way the film actually deals with the threats posed by AI is revealing in a very different way. It’s a window into why AI is such a slippery policy issue in the real world.
The main threat posed by the movie’s rogue AI isn’t its intention to launch the world’s nukes, or endlessly reproduce itself at the expense of humanity, or bring down the global banking system, all of which are risks being pondered by serious people, and even addressed in some policy ideas . It’s in its power to manipulate “the truth” — the film’s protagonists breathlessly describe the entity’s ability to manipulate all digitally-transmitted communications and media, plunging the world into a morass of uncertainty and mistrust.
Sound familiar? There’s a cynical argument to be made that we’ve already gotten ourselves pretty far down the road to such an outcome without the help of AI. There’s a non-cynical argument that generative models are poised to make this much, much worse; they’re already creating eerily lifelike audio and video of public figures . The futuristic threat the “M:I7” screenwriters conjure is, like an episode of “Black Mirror,” not much more than our current reality skewed a few more degrees toward the fantastical.
I won’t spoil the story after that, but you could say the most fantastical plot point of all is the hope that we could successfully do anything about this problem. The fight against “misinformation,” despite spawning a lucrative cottage industry , has proved maddeningly resistant to technical or policy fixes since its modern inception roughly a decade ago. The film, in this sense, ultimately serves as a reminder of how powerless humanity has already proven itself in that fight.
It does raise another specter of AI-related doom. Or, rather, one that AI enables: The global Easter egg hunt that Tom Cruise’s superspy Ethan Hunt undertakes is to track down a key (yes, a physical key) that will unlock the power of the AI “entity,” something that every government on Earth, including America’s, now desperately covets. The AI, seemingly omnipotent, will not only grant the state that wields it a nebulous “truth”-establishing power but total digital supremacy over all of its rivals.
In an exaggerated form, that’s a threat about which real-world actors both public and private are keenly aware, with the U.S. framing the race for AI supremacy over China as a global zero-sum competition. “How is it in our interest to allow them to get technology that they may turn around and use against us?” Secretary of State Anthony Blinken asked the Council on Foreign Relations in June.
In the real world, that means narrowly targeted trade controls to prevent U.S. companies from selling high-end semiconductors to our economic rivals — not exactly the stuff of summer blockbusters.
Aside from drawing into sharp relief just how maddening and diffuse AI is as a real-world policy issue, the film also serves as a useful parable about how developers or policymakers should respond to AI — it turns out the world doesn’t necessarily need to be protected from the AI itself, but from the avaricious and power-hungry humans who want to use it. Our real-life efforts toward “AI safety” might ultimately not be about taming a wild and dangerous sci-fi technology, but making a very powerful computer effectively user-proof.

the skeptical spectator
Tech-nerd Twitter — gah, sorry, X, we’ll get used to it soon — blew up this morning after the publication of a pre-print from a South Korean research team that claims it discovered a way for superconductors to work at room temperature , a discovery with massive implications for everything from energy to computer science.
Most superconductors need to be kept at extremely low temperatures to work — around -284 degrees Fahrenheit — making them impractical for everyday purposes. For context, that’s 140 degrees colder than the coldest place on earth, according to NASA . Finding a way to run them under normal environmental conditions would bring a massive reduction in their operation cost, and provide cheap power storage.
Science takes time, and only reproduction and verification will tell whether the Korean researchers’ work is legit. But studies about superconductivity like this get published a lot, and are accompanied by scandal almost as frequently, including in the case of one completely separate study the New York Times reported on just today. And at least one writer is already skeptical: Matt Ridley, a British science writer and former member of the United Kingdom House of Lords, wrote in The Spectator that “the paper comes from an unknown team at a start-up institute with little track record in the field, it has not been peer reviewed and its charts are frankly a mess,” and it will likely “prove to be just a familiar hype-and-disappoint cycle of the kind that plagues the field of energy physics.”
A certain amount of such skepticism is fair enough in a world where the promise of, say, unlimited cheap fusion-generated energy always seems right around the corner without ever arriving. But don’t take Ridley’s word for it: He quotes superconductivity expert professor Jorge Hirsch at University of California at San Diego, who told him the paper is “...not superconductivity. It’s experimental artifacts, wishful thinking and poor judgment (in the best scenario).”

norma rae-i
Can AI be held accountable for union-busting?
The hospitality workers union UNITE HERE Local 11 is trying to answer that question in a complaint targeting gig-economy app Instawork, as POLITICO’s Alfred Ng reported in today’s Morning Tech newsletter. The union claims that while helping a Los Angeles-area hotel replace striking workers, the app violated labor laws by automatically penalizing a replacement worker who decided to join the strike instead.
Alfred points out that in a memo published last year , a lawyer for the National Labor Relations Board urged NLRB leadership to protect workers from the kind of “automated management practices” like the one that penalized the Instawork worker. UNITE HERE Local 11 said it will continue its strike against both the hotel and Instawork itself until the NLRB reaches a decision on the complaint.
It’s one of several different ways that workers have started to target AI specifically in public; the Hollywood writers’ strike is another. Sarah Myers West, managing director of the AI Now Institute, told Alfred the systems tend to “work out very well for employers,” but do not “serve workers’ needs.”

,Review: Tom Cruise returns in 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One',"We are all things Seattle and the PNW, from food to fashion and entertainment to adventure.","The testosterone soap opera known as the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise has never been such a welcome sight for its weary fanbase. Few action blockbusters outside of the superhero genre have landed with audiences recently, and in a summer that has seen a slunk in numbers at the box office, Tom Cruise may be just the antidote the industry needs. That doesn't mean that is a perfect installment. In this year's second big-budget, franchise two-parter - it's debatable if this film or left audiences on a higher cliff by film's end - ""Dead Reckoning Part One"" forgoes the sadistic evil mastermind or sociopath seeking utter chaos. Instead, the film makes a bargain with an artificial devil known as The Entity. That's right. Ethan Hunt must harness his greatest assets, use every trick in his chapter book, use every ounce of knowledge and street smarts he can muster, all to face off against... a computer.
If you're rolling your eyes, it's for good reason. Hunt, an accomplished, well-filmed action hero, has had his fair share of complicated foes. But The Entity, as it's called, will divide audiences more than ever. AI is what keeps most tech junkies up at night these days, and there is reason to believe that such advanced technology could pose a threat to humans one day, but it is certainly an uncinematic opponent, to say the least. Skynet was, at the very least, a figment of the future; the Matrix was born of a dystopian alternative reality. The Entity is operating in the present day, beeping and bopping its way onto all the snarky ""Worst Villains"" lists the internet will inevitably contrive one day. And for good reason. It's a smart chip locked away at the bottom of the ocean, conveniently inaccessible and only destructible with a specific key. It will hardly instill global hysteria. Gabriel (Esai Morales), a mysterious, sinister villain from Hunt's past, enters stage right as a fleshy foe to appease the audience's need for human evil, but even he can't completely distract from The Entity's sometimes hilarious showboating.
Take, for instance, the scene in which Hunt learns exactly what The Entity is. He's crashed a Carnival-type party in Venice where a myriad of dancing guests wear masks and set a scene straight out of The party is hosted by the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), a carryover character known for her constant side-swapping and illegal dealings. The whole crew is gathered around: the White Widow, her entourage, Hunt, his trusty colleague Ilsa (Ferguson), a new acquaintance Grace (Hayley Atwell) whose stealthy pickpocket landed her in a hard drive of hot water (computer jokes really don't land the way you'd hope) and hovering nemesis Gabriel. As vague threats and intimidating glances course through the undercurrent of the dialogue, the final revelation allows a clear understanding: The Entity is everywhere, controlling everything, seeing everyone. It can compute every possible outcome and every imaginable scenario, outthinking and outwitting anyone attempting to stop it. The lights in the large, ancient venue turn an ominous green and flash to personify The Entity's possible evil cackle and to demonstrate its omnipresence.
Strobe lights! Panning camera shots! The look of realization on Cruise's face as he is surrounded by his body-less nemesis! Muah ha ha ha! It's The Entity!
It is by and far the film's most laughable sequence and one of the few that feels forced, farcical and calculated, an attempt to instill fear in viewers that would otherwise remain at giga-arm's length. Luckily, ""Dead Reckoning Part One"" has two weapons against audience disbelief and general premise fatigue: Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie. The twosome have been frequent collaborators over the years, with McQuarrie joining the ""Mission: Impossible"" family as director in 2015's ,"" and even though it's been a minute since Cruise last hopped onto his motorcycle for 2018's ,"" they return to the silver screen like no time has passed.
Speaking of moving vehicles, this film is full of them. The chase sequence through Rome - no you are not imagining it, ""Fast X"" also had an epic car chase through the Eternal City - is particularly fun and demonstrates the physicality and comedic timing that both Cruise and Atwell have mastered in their respective careers. You likely know Cruise's long filmography, but Atwell also has experience in big action flicks, having led a Marvel television series and starred in numerous MCU films as Captain America's significant other and government agent, Peggy Carter. McQuarrie knows how to write an entertaining, outrageous movie that may not have roots in reality, but that carries viewers happily through a saga that won't end (yet). Thankfully, it also doesn't slog like some other recent releases in the genre that have also pushed toward a 3-hour runtime.
The Entity won't keep viewers up at night, but the film is wound together by the chemistry between Cruise and his supporting troupe, including longtime castmates Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames and Ferguson, as well as newbie Atwell, whose wise-cracking, emotive performance steals the show. If you can let your inhibitions go out the moving train - yes, there is another moving train and rooftop battle sequence - then ""Dead Reckoning Part One"" will delight. Hunt and crew jetset around the globe, avoiding authorities, sticking the middle finger at government players and, of course, employing hyper-realistic masks, high-tech gadgets and the formidable stunt work that put ""Mission: Impossible"" on the map back in 1996.

Despite her solid work in Black Mirror and Marvel’s Captain America, this gem has somehow remained hidden in obscurity, stuck making pointless cameos in silly superhero adventures and voicing CGI animals.
Fortunately, game recognized game, and Tom Cruise recruited her for his latest impossible mission, where she effortlessly slides in as Ethan Hunt’s latest partner in espionage. In the sixth sequel to 1996’s Mission: Impossible, Atwell portrays Grace, a mysterious yet ultimately virtuous thief who finds herself in over her head when tasked with stealing a key that unlocks a powerful artificial intelligence program. Eventually, Grace sees the light, joins Ethan’s rogue squadron, and takes part in a variety of thrilling stunts and clever deceptions to prove her worth.
Hayley Atwell goes for broke with her performance, showcasing a range of emotions during her substantial screen time. What starts as a bewildering interaction with Ethan at Abu Dhabi’s airport quickly evolves into an amusing partnership. Grace loves the danger, grinning like a schoolgirl during Ethan’s constant pursuits, but doesn’t quite understand the implications of her actions. However, when the bullets start flying, Grace quickly succumbs to pressure and must learn to navigate this strange new world of violence, death, car chases, dastardly villains, endless double crosses, and lots of friggin’ running.
ComingSoon spoiler alert
There’s a fantastic moment during the big train set piece in which Ethan and Grace stand atop a platform with a piano dangling precariously above. Ethan needs to leap to the other side, but a frightened Grace clings desperately to him. He urges her to let go so he can make the jump, assuring her that everything will be okay. “Do you trust me?” he asks, to which she shakes her head, tears in her eyes, a look of fear splashed over her face. “I need you to trust me,” he insists. Finally, she nods, and he makes his daring move, with her following at the last second.
It’s a refreshing display of vulnerability from a hero in a modern action film. Grace doesn’t back down from a fight or miss an easy mark, provided it serves her best interests, but she has her limits. She takes on the villain Gabriel, gets her butt kicked, tries to flee in a car, smashes everything in sight (unintentionally making it easier for Ethan to track her down), and freaks out (as anyone would) when facing a collapsing train. She’s also not impervious to mistakes and miscalculations, failing to realize Ethan’s trustworthiness before it’s too late. Such imperfections make her relatable and endearing, making it easy for audiences to root for her eventual success.
Furthermore, Hayley Atwell brings out the best in Cruise, creating the most potent dynamic duo in the franchise since, well, Cruise and Rebecca Ferguson in Rogue Nation. Hand-in-hand, Ethan and Grace leap from trains, speeding cars, and late-night club parties. Sexual tension abounds but is never acted upon, which is just as well considering what happens to Ilsa.
On that note, not everything about Grace works perfectly. Her presence, unfortunately, diminishes Rebecca Ferguson’s screen time and demotes Ilsa Faust to a secondary character. Whether due to scheduling conflicts or disinterest from all involved, Ferguson is oddly left in the dust, quite literally. One can’t help but wonder if Grace’s role was initially intended to be Ilsa, with the plot centering on her official recruitment to the IMF, or maybe Ferguson grew tired of playing second fiddle to Cruise. Either way, considering Ferguson’s pivotal role in revitalizing the series in Rogue Nation, it feels wrong to cast her aside so quickly in favor of a newer model.
(Also, am I the only one who thinks Ilsa is still alive? Typically, when a main character gets the axe, they receive a funeral or some sort of remembrance. Dead Reckoning skips the mourning and jumps straight into the third act. Perhaps we’ll see more fallout from the character’s death in Dead Reckoning Part Two, or maybe she will return as part of Ethan’s plan to destroy the Entity. Regardless, the character deserves so much more.)
Personally, I hope Atwell continues to be a part of the franchise in the long run. She more than proves her worth in Dead Reckoning and completely stole the show. For all the high-wire stunts, fight sequences, complex face-offs, and shootouts, this latest Mission: Impossible will best be remembered for introducing Hayley Atwell into the long-running series. I’d call that mission accomplished.

""Not remotely. I honestly know very little about that world,"" McQuarrie replied on Threads to a fan asking if he has played or was influenced by the PlayStation classic for Dead Reckoning’s final act.
The sequence in question involves Ethan (Tom Cruise) and Grace (Hayley Atwell) going off the rails on the Orient Express in pursuit of a key to shut down The Entity – complete with Cruise hanging from a carriage in a manner close to that of Nathan Drake in Uncharted 2’s snow-covered opening.
McQuarrie, for his part, used the word ‘uncharted’ in an old interview – and addressed speculation about the coincidence.
""I used the word in the literal sense in a post years ago and have been hearing that ever since. Games are just something I know nothing about,"" he wrote. He later added: ""The only [game] I ever played was Unreal Tournament.""
Light-hearted accusations flew all over social media, with Uncharted 2 co-director Bruce Straley said ""...the sincerest form of flattery.""

,Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Director Explains Why It Is Two Parts,Mission: Impossible director Christopher McQuarrie explains why Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning couldn't be done in a single film.,"The Mission: Impossible franchise has always found new ways to surprise us when it comes to the practical stunts Tom Cruise will perform, but the announcement of the most recent project also surprised fans when it was announced that the next Mission: Impossible story would be divided in half, requiring two movies to complete. While one has to assume that the studio had little problem greenlighting even more Mission: Impossible, director Christopher McQuarrie says it was the story, not the box office that required Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning to be two movies.
Mission: Impossible movies have always been showcases for incredible action. But especially in the time that Christopher McQuarrie has been at the helm, they certainly haven’t skimped on the story either. And because Ethan Hunt works with a team, these are movies with a lot of characters. Speaking with Collider, McQuarrie says that it was ultimately the characters that drove the idea of breaking Dead Reckoning in two because he simply needed more time to create the characters and give them emotional stories. He explained…
Well, we knew with Fallout. Fallout really grew because of all the character and emotion we were putting into the story, all the things that we had discovered in Rogue Nation that was so unexpected. I knew I wanted to expand the cast, and I knew I wanted to give each one of those characters more to do, so I knew the movie was going to be bigger and longer than Fallout. And at which point I said, 'Why are we fighting this? Why are we going to try to jam this into two hours? Let's just break it in half and make it two movies.' That really was the rationale behind it being a two-part movie. It just it wasn't just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie.
There certainly are a lot of characters in the Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One cast. In addition to Tom Cruise and his regular team (including Simon Pegg and Ving Raimes), we see the return of characters we haven’t seen since the first entry in the franchise, as well as several new characters who clearly have stories to tell. One can only imagine how difficult it would be to give all of them enough to do, in a way that would be emotionally satisfying, if they tried to cram it all into a single film.
Dead Reckoning Part One is already a nearly three-hour movie, so a plot that moved twice as fast would have so much story to cover that it’s hard to imagine we’d get to know the characters at all. McQuarrie has said that he specifically wanted to the new movies to have less plot in them because that let the action tell more of the story, and clearly, it also gave us more time with the various characters.
What will happen to our heroes in Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part Two is anybody's guess right now. However, with so much groundwork already done to introduce characters and plot ideas, one can imagine it will hit the ground running, and with another two or three hours of story to tell, it certainly will have the ability to come to a very emotionally satisfying conclusion.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1kaXJlY3Rvci0xNDMzNTE0NzAuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-09 16:31:16+00:00,Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,"I’ve always thought, without any serious misgiving, that this is the real function of Ethan Hunt: a mask for Tom Cruise as he would like to be seen.","This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, the movie being covered here wouldn’t exist. To learn more, visit the WGA strike hub and the SAG-AFTRA strike site.
The function of Ethan Hunt is, increasingly, to be a martyr. And not just any martyr: one you feel sorry for.
Starting with J. J. Abrams’s Mission: Impossible 3 (2006), each director of the enduring action franchise that Tom Cruise has strapped his reputation to has capitulated to the actor’s whims, including mandated shifts to steer his character into a more vulnerable register. Ethan Hunt is one of the most transparent acts of public relations management in modern cinema history, and he has continued to pay off, both for older generations—who watched Cruise grow from a smirking all-American teen tryhard into the international star he is now—and younger ones, who are largely ambivalent about or unaware of Cruise’s disturbing personal history. Because so much of Cruise’s life had, up to a certain point, been conducted in public, the comparative scarcity of detail in the last decade or so leaves plenty of room for mystery. It creates space for talk-show anecdotes—Christmas cakes sent to Kirsten Dunst, on-set pranks with Simon Pegg, incognito outings to the movie theater to watch his audience’s reactions to his films—and little else, except for the audacious cinematic offerings he bestows upon the world. And so, watching a Tom Cruise project—and, because there are so many of them and continue to be more, watching a Mission: Impossible film—becomes grounds for a futile investigation, one that proves all the more thrilling for the fact that no one really knows what they’re looking for.
It’s been said with every press cycle that these films are partially about the fact that they happened for real: Tom Cruise jumped, rode, drove, and climbed the unthinkable for our amusement, the production aided by the conspicuous lack of CGI, stunt doubles, or other cinematic trickery. This is true, though Mission: Impossible is a franchise that adheres, admirably, to a formula, which means there is an upper and lower limit to what can and cannot happen. One of the more interesting (frankly, funny) contradictions of the series is the fact that Ethan Hunt, so eloquently described by his enemies as a chaotic, omniscient empathy machine who cares more about his friends than himself, kills indiscriminately when the situation calls for it. For Hunt, there are those who have been deemed worthy, and everyone else.
This glorified anointing by Hunt—and by Cruise—is reiterated ad nauseam; Hunt is apparently such a good judge of character that, even when a new recruit betrays him, he still places his full faith in them. Throughout the series, this has remained one of Hunt’s most endearing qualities. He is Captain America without the flag, a cynicism-wicking wrecking ball who wins over his skeptics with action and consistency. I’ve always thought, without any serious misgiving, that this is the real function of the character, a mask for Tom Cruise as he would like to be seen. Indeed, Ethan Hunt has been engineered as Cruise’s go-to export, the slippage between character and actor deliberate; the spectacle of near-death that is performed and received so enthusiastically—the awe inspired and the adrenaline pumped—cannot be attributed wholly to either Cruise or Hunt. Hunt is the closest an audience gets to seeing Cruise act like a normal person. It is striking, and odd, to watch recent interviews and promos with the last true movie star, who smiles, poses, waves, and says almost nothing of interest or substance. Here, there are two masks at play: the bleeding, world-weary heart of Hunt, who affords Cruise the opportunity to perform emotion he never displays elsewhere, and the cipher of (the public-facing) Cruise himself.
**
In Mission: Impossible 3, Ethan Hunt marries a nurse named Julia, played singularly by Michelle Monaghan who, yes, looks a lot like Katie Holmes. What is remarkable about 3 is not just its change in tone—or its period-specific political paranoia—but the degree to which Hunt softens into a kind of person-suit for Cruise. It would be too flippant (and, frankly, incorrect) to say that Cruise is playing himself in the role. What would that even mean? How would the audience know what Cruise really does? But Hunt does begin to resemble a plausible idea of Cruise as an ordinary man, one who lives beneath a secret spotlight rather than a public one, an exceptional and generous man beleaguered by the world but never cynical of it. The tumultuous life of an IMF agent precludes long-term stability and is therefore a tragic one. Friends die or disappear, loved ones (forever in danger) are used as collateral. In between 3 and Ghost Protocol, Hunt fakes Julia’s death to save her from mercenaries. Hunt checks in every now and again, a lovelorn guardian angel putting on a brave face, throwing what remaining devotion he has into protecting his friends, before sprinting into the next mission.
This positioning of the character works better when there is the sense that Hunt is truly out of his depth—that he can’t actually save everyone. It’s nice when Cruise gets a bit weepy, but there is never the complete eradication of a sense of manipulation, backstory as PR. More effective is when Cruise’s jaw drops and his eyes widen, when Hunt is beset by panic and indecision, and we watch Cruise allow us to indulge in his vulnerability. Julia’s sudden, very real return three installments later in the third act of Mission: Impossible — Fallout (2018), after the film has inundated the audience with dream sequences of her, hits squarely in the gut. By this point, disavowed MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) has carved a space in Hunt’s life, almost his female equivalent, their apparent chemistry immediate, a convincing relationship forged through a bevy of meaningful looks. So it is less an imposition of the past—Julia has remarried and gone on to a fulfilled life—than a recentering of all that is at stake, when both Ilsa and Julia individually, along with long-time friends Benji and Luther, scramble to help Hunt save the world.
Dead Reckoning Part One (2023) attempts to seize the many triumphs of Fallout by retconning Hunt’s past and foreclosing his future. The film opens under the Arctic icecap, a Russian submarine named the Sevastopol harboring history-altering weaponry that allows it to stalk the sovereign waters of every nation in the world, undetected. Not since Mission: Impossible 2 (2000)—with its neon-tinged laboratory, manufactured virus, and the hushed voiceover of Croatian actor Rade Šerbedžija—has the series opened on a scene so tonally divorced from the kinetic world of the IMF. There is a haunting intimation here: an invisible crew roaming the ocean, their communications, like their fate, legible only through unseen commands. Onboard the vessel is an AI referred to throughout the film as the Entity. The Entity conjures an enemy ship for the Sevastopol to fight, using fear and panic—and a misfired torpedo—to maroon the submarine deep underwater where no one can find it. In the aftermath, corpses float to the surface, slamming against the ice, captain and crew joined in a bloodless death, frozen, suspended.
This is a movie, which means the Entity is sentient, possibly malevolent, though what the audience mostly sees is the AI’s curiosity. It prods, goads, queries allies and foes alike, its own agenda mysterious. Meanwhile, every government on the planet vies for control over it. There is a lot of talking about the Entity in Dead Reckoning; too much, really, when the opening sequence—all red alert lights, sonar maps, shouted nautical commands, sweat-beaded foreheads, and loaded missiles—succinctly encapsulates what is most dangerous (and compelling) about an enemy that can be, in our digitally-stitched world, anywhere and everywhere. Having seen the film twice in one week (the first an early screening that harbored no trailers, just redundant congratulatory red carpet promotion of the very film we were all about to watch), I wondered if it was inevitable that the Mission: Impossible franchise would find its way to AI—or, at least, the encroachment of technology.
The AI at the heart of Dead Reckoning Part One, just like the next-gen and unmanned jets in Top Gun: Maverick (which Jack Reacher–Rogue Nation-Fallout-Dead Reckoning Part One director Christopher McQuarrie co-wrote), represents the antithesis to the real—to a certain kind of filmmaking—to human intuition and talent. While Hunt has been spreading goodwill towards the pilot of his avatar over the decades, Cruise himself has become the self-appointed, yet deliberately silent, figurehead of theatrical cinema in the pandemic age. He is a lover of film, an avid watcher of movies, a singular force with the ability to hold the theatrical release of a movie for months, even years, and then to keep it there for months, or what feels like years, before relinquishing it to streaming. AI can’t care. It has no ego to protect, no reputation to maintain, certainly no troubling religious allegiance to keep quiet about. AI is a phenomenological singularity, which Cruise fashions into a god worth killing.
Through ponderous dialogue scenes, the audience is treated to a repeated artistic statement—the destruction of truth and certainty, of skill, and, crucially for Hunt, good judgment, at the hands of technology—that echoes Benji’s riff on the “anti-God” in Mission: Impossible 3. In Dead Reckoning Part One, the U.S. intelligence community rushes to convert all of their files to hand-typed hard copies, their screens to cathode ray tubes, their communications to decommissioned Cold War-era satellites. Meanwhile, Hunt’s team can no longer depend on their dazzling gadgets and are forced to go old school, piloting machinery that is less reliable, requiring their trust and wits. And yet Dead Reckoning Part One isn’t just about machines, but people. Namely, the women in Hunt’s life.
In an unconvincing, desaturated flashback early on in the film, Dead Reckoning‘s primary human antagonist, Gabriel (Esai Morales) murders a heretofore unmentioned brunette named Marie in front of Hunt. This is supposed to take place before Hunt has joined the IMF, though the extent to which McQuarrie goes to replicate the ‘90s is staging the scene in a dim tunnel, dying Morales’s gray hair black, and throwing a wig (or maybe late-production grown-out hair?) on Cruise. When Grace (Hayley Atwell), a brunette thief, shows up, stealing one half of a key that unlocks the Entity’s source code, McQuarrie contrives a silly pattern: the women Hunt has cared for always die, so what will happen to Grace and Ilsa?
To say nothing of the fact that this isn’t true—or that neither Gabriel nor Marie existed before Dead Reckoning Part One—it’s telling that, up to this point, Mission: Impossible hadn’t cared to look backward. Each and every flashback sequence across the franchise is contained to the film in which it occurs, never reaching across installments, never invoking new characters. Granted, there are requisite references to the iconic CIA heist from the first film, side characters from the first film, little jokes and asides tying various codenames and objects together from the first film. Indeed, it’s with Dead Reckoning Part One that it becomes abundantly clear, if it wasn’t before, how much the franchise owes to Brian De Palma and 1996’s Mission: Impossible.
The dilemma for McQuarrie and Cruise is that McQuarrie is not a stylist and Cruise can’t be trusted to distinguish a callback from a rehashed idea. There are many a canted camera in Dead Reckoning Part One meant to evoke De Palma’s signature Dutch angles without the extremity or framing precision. Hunt sprints through the nighttime streets of a European city as everything around him goes wrong. A covert purchase is made on board a train in the third act—a longer, more involved, tedium-approaching overlay of the first. Even Henry Czerny returns as former IMF Director Eugene Kittridge, though his major scene, mirroring the famous Prague dinner standoff, looks and feels markedly less than. There’s something fitting about the fact that Dead Reckoning Part One might be the most boring-looking of the Mission: Impossible films thus far. Compared to almost any other franchise, this might not mean much. What McQuarrie loses in color or blocking is made up for, mostly, in the structure and pace, the ingenuity of set pieces. Still, there is the sense that wheels are spinning in place.
Part of this feels due to the fact that, in the McQuarrie era, these scripts are even more of an afterthought to the stunts—which, at their best, feel perfectly melded into the narrative and, at their worst, feel random and disconnected. Cruise and McQuarrie have been waiting their entire careers for each other to correct this gap, a writer-director deft enough to selectively acquiesce to the demands of his star and main producer. Both men have admitted to drastic, on-the-fly script changes during production, which means these latter-day films, edited and shot on a pivot, are also about their own creation. To an extent.
Packed into the breathless press and behind-the-scenes features of Mission: Impossible is their hyperreality, the presence of real danger, location permits, tax breaks, and endless negotiations marshaled to allow the crew to shoot in places they normally couldn’t and the production to do things only Tom Cruise can do. Put another way, these films, these stunts, Tom Cruise, all of it is meant to be hailed as analog. Just as easily as there are people, there are things in Mission: Impossible. Paperclips, hooks, wheels, keyboards, phone cords, fingerprints, maps, triggers, retinas, discs, ropes, prosthetics, hands, faces.
Meanwhile, Dead Reckoning Part One lurches helplessly into the digital realm as McQuarrie defers to the very technology the film decries. Poor CGI creeps throughout, from the cartoonish air bubbles beneath the Arctic at the end of the opening sequence to the Unreal Engine backgrounds of the climactic train fight (a facet that is on display to less disruptive effect in sections of the final act of Fallout). Too, where Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation (2015), perhaps the franchise’s most beautiful-looking film, revels in the textures and grain of film stock, Dead Reckoning Part One partakes of a smoky, fleshy plainness, at once hyper-detailed and muted. Ironically, for the first time in the series, the idea of digital face replacement that has nothing to do with masks becomes aesthetically plausible. In Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City, which opened a month earlier, there are crafty practical effects, even a cleverly-conceived miniature train. Here, there are polygon-dense simulations and digital matte paintings.
Cruise-as-Hunt gives us the goods. An extended car chase in Rome plays fast and loose with tropes specific to Mission: Impossible, stopping and starting, a rhythm of chaos building. But there’s still the smell of burnt rubber.
**
Modern cinema is at a long-standing inflection point regarding its future and the future of non-franchise filmmaking, which means event movies of uncommonly high caliber like Mission: Impossible act as salve and omen at the same time. It’s difficult not to worry about how far the exception to the rule can go. It’s also difficult to contain the knee-jerk reaction to separate this series—approaching its 30th anniversary and eighth installment—from the rest. After all, it was Tom Cruise who was “on the phone with every (expletive) studio at night, insurance companies, producers” to set the “gold standard” of what it means to make a movie of this size and scope during the pandemic. The result at the other end, two years later, shows signs of wear, the seams more visible than usual, the mask slipping.
It is a litmus of the effectiveness of a Mission: Impossible film whether or not the audience remembers who it is they’re watching, or what it took to accomplish the final product. Or rather, whether the audience cares by the end of it. The Scientology jokes flit through the ether, the odd brave crusader setting out to remind us just how shitty Cruise actually is, how powerful, how rich, how untouchable. One side pleads charisma—pointing out just how damn entertaining it is to watch the little guy evoke the wily sensibilities of Buster Keaton or Jackie Chan—while the other scoffs. Months ago, at a different movie, when the trailer for Dead Reckoning Part One played, an older couple in front of me shook their heads the entire time, before the woman said, “I just can’t stand that man.” It’s rare that a movie star like Cruise can at once conjure everything toxic and pointedly redacted about Hollywood, and everything worth preserving.
Perhaps it’s because there are clearly so many fissures left unmended from the pandemic, and because Cruise eludes criticism of any meaningful kind, and that the film opened just before SAG-AFTRA joined the WGA on strike, that a movie like Dead Reckoning Part One plays such a tenuous role. Cruise and McQuarrie operate on an elevated level. Literally, they have situated themselves as people above the concerns of their industry, sympathetic to the struggles of their crew, yet wholly uninterested in anything other than ensuring their own survival. As critic Adam Nayman noted in his review of Dead Reckoning Part One, these men are in the business of quality-controlled products, vehicles of influence and goodwill that try very, very hard—with frustrating but increasingly limited success—to dazzle us into believing Cruise is the only person who can get the job done.
So the end of Dead Reckoning Part One beckons the audience to clamor for what happens next. Its plot folds in on itself, characters like parts traded out, before two halves of a key, like two parts of a story, are finally put back together. The gamble Cruise and McQuarrie have accepted takes the form of an as-yet unanswered question: does Part Two justify Part One? To the average moviegoer (whom I’m envious of), the question doesn’t matter all that much. Hunt and Cruise are sprinting in parallel paths toward an inevitable end. Both men will die one day and what they leave behind will outlast any of us. Yet what is most interesting about Dead Reckoning Part One ultimately has little to do with its making and more to do with the circumstances of its release. With production on Part Two stalled due to both strikes, and McQuarrie vocally impatient to start filming, the future of the franchise, and the industry, is poised for unknown change. Hunt, unlike Cruise, cannot fail to reiterate he is nothing without his team or their acceptance. There is the disruptive possibility now for their places to switch.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWdodHdhbGxkYXJrcm9vbS5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8wOS9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctcGFydC1vbmUtdGhlLXNlbGxpbmctb2YtdG9tLWNydWlzZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning director reveals complex set in Abu Dhabi,Christopher McQuarrie praised the local crew and authorities,"Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One director Christopher McQuarrie praised Abu Dhabi's local production crew and authorities in a behind the scenes video.
The video, shared by the Abu Dhabi Film Commission, shows some of the incredible stunts star Tom Cruise is known for.
McQuarrie revealed that the stunts teased in the trailer aren't even the biggest, or most complex, they filmed.
In the video, he explains that while they were shooting in Abu Dhabi, they were inspired to create a desert scene.
They filmed in what Production Manager Ben Piltz referred to as ""the empty quarter"" which featured ""amazing dunes"" and a ""big salt flat"" perfect for a sequence of charging horses.
McQuarrie said: ""Once we decided we were going to shoot the airport sequence in Abu Dhabi, we decided to shoot a desert sequence as well.
""The desert sequence is something Tom and I have always dreamed about. The location just told us what to do.
""These things that we’re doing, while they seem to flow rather effortlessly, are actually very complicated and involve a lot of skill on Tom’s part. It really was the biggest set we’d ever worked on.”
The team built a scene set inside the airport and on its roof for the scenes in which Cruise's Ethan Hunt is evading authorities.
McQuarrie added: ""Etihad and Abu Dhabi Airport provided us with this airport, and gave us an opportunity to shoot a sequence in a way that one had never been done. It was an extraordinary, beautiful location. It’s epic in scale.""

,"Rebecca Ferguson says new ""Mission: Impossible"" film ""goes beyond"" in terms of action, emotion","""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" hits theaters this Wednesday, July 12.","Rebecca Ferguson says new ""Mission: Impossible"" film ""goes beyond"" in terms of emotion, action
The new ""Mission: Impossible"" movie brings audiences even more action and emotion than previous films in the franchise, said Rebecca Ferguson, who plays former British MI6 agent Ilsa Faust in the film.
Ferguson said Monday on ""CBS Mornings"" that while she expects ""Mission"" films to be incredible, intense and action-packed, the latest installment in the series — ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" — ""goes beyond"" action-wise and emotionally.
The film is set to hit theaters this Wednesday, July 12. It is a production of Paramount Pictures, a division of CBS News' parent company. Its highly-anticipated release follows a four-year gap since the release of the previous installment, ""Mission: Impossible – Fallout.""
Ferguson said that working with Tom Cruise — who produces and stars in the film as Ethan Hunt — has had an impact on her professionally, even outside the franchise.
""Tom brings the best every single day and he expects the best, and not in a hard whipping kind of way,"" Ferguson said. ""Just in a, 'you have been given a platter of training, of knowledge, so give it when it's given,' and I know that I expect the same on a show that I produce. I want the best.""
In the ""Mission"" films, her character and Cruise's character maintain a ""will they or won't they"" tension that captivates audiences and leaves room for interpretation. Ferguson said she finds what keeps the characters apart ""attractive and interesting.""
""Tom and I ... never talk about them as an item. But I guess when we watch the film, they're so similar. They fight the same cause and yet, you have yourself constantly saying, 'But why? Why are we doing this? We could run away,'"" she said, ""There's so much connection between them. But is it sibling? Family? love? What is it? It's humanity.""
For Ferguson, the film's release this week is daunting, but also exciting, she said.
""Also, it's that treat of giving the audience something that I know that I loved before I was in it,"" she said. ""I waited for 'Mission: Impossible.' I loved them.""
""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One"" hits U.S. theaters on Wednesday, July 12. Deadline calls it ""Hollywood action filmmaking at its peak"" and The Hollywood Reporter praises director Christopher McQuarrie's ability to keep ""his audience glued to every moment.""

2023-07-31 11:00:50+00:00,How Editor Eddie Hamilton Cut “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” to the Quick,"Editor Eddie Hamilton knows the ""Mission: Impossible"" formula better than almost anyone not named Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie.","How Editor Eddie Hamilton Cut “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” to the Quick
As it is, Tom Cruise’s new Mission: Impossible movie (now playing) runs a hefty two hours and forty-three minutes, but what people see in theaters actually represents a very slimmed-down version of the original cut that director Christopher McQuarrie screened for his friends. “It ran four hours,” says Cruise’s go-to editor Eddie Hamilton. “We watched it in a screening room with 40 people, and it was two and a half hours to Venice. Then we had snacks and came back for the last hour and a half.”
Hamilton, who earned an Oscar nomination for Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick and cut previous Mission: Impossible entries Rogue One and Fallout, faced an embarrassment of riches in the Dead Reckoning Part One rough cut. High-energy performances, eye-popping stunts, and locations like Abu Dubai, Rome, Venice, and Norway filled the screen. For the seasoned editor, the challenge came in streamlining all that footage into the summer popcorn movie that has so far grossed $370 million and critical acclaim.
Speaking from his home in London, Hamilton explains the tricks of the trade he used to reckon with Dead Reckoning‘s car chases, motorcycle stunts, and multiple character arcs.
Dead Reckoning throws many plates up in the air — new villains, old villains, the “cruciform key” Macguffin, Ethan Hunt’s gang, plus the addition of Hayley Atwell’s new pickpocket femme fatale character Grace. How do you balance all that plot information with emotional beats?
That’s the push-pull we deal with every single day. Especially on a long movie like this, you have to make sure that there’s no air. We discussed it all the time with Chris McQuarrie being like: “I’m feeling air, I’m feeling air.” I’ve been working on the movie for three years, I’ve watched it 700 times and seen it iterate day after day, compressing, compressing, compressing.
You like to keep things moving.
But you can get to the point where you compress it too much. Right at the end of the movie, Ethan Hunt’s talking to the henchwoman Paris, where she’s lying there going, “Why did you spare my life?” We did an ultra-tight version of that scene where I cut all the air out. I came back the next day and watched it again with Chris. We went, “Woah. There’s no emotion at all. I don’t feel anything. It’s just information,” And information is the death of emotion.
The movie’s first big set piece at the airport introduces Hayley Atwell’s character Grace, plus multiple bad guys, surveillance cameras, cutbacks to Luther and his laptop, and you’ve got Benji racing around trying to find a ticking bomb, and Ethan Hunt’s in the middle of it all. That’s a lot of moving parts!
The airport scene was filmed partially at a real airport in Abu Dhabi. It was phenomenally difficult, but Chris doesn’t worry too much about figuring everything out on the page or even on set. The actors give us a lot of flavors, he collects the ingredients, and then we bake the cake in the editing room. That sequence took weeks of work. We had to intercut between Luther and Ethan and Grace and Paris and the buyer while also making sure the graphics on Benji’s laptop are designed so that your eye is guided around the screen. The first time never works. We throw it all out, and it still doesn’t work. It’s an evolutionary process. Honestly, I was working on that scene for two years.
Complex sequences seem to have become part of Mission: Impossible’s DNA.
If you think back to the opera scene in Rogue Nation, there’s all this cross-cutting to keep each character “alive,” so it’s similar in that way to the airport sequence. Chris likes to challenge himself with complicated sequences because he knows that when we sit together in the edit, we will refine it until we eventually get there.
Can you give an example of what it means to “refine” the raw footage?
It often involves going back and getting little close-ups of people, little bits of information. Or in the case of Hayley Atwell, she was finding her character every day. Is Grace scared? Confident? Flirty with Tom? Wily? There were times when she was a bit too confident, a bit smug, and we dialed that down. We modulated Hayley’s performance all the way through.
Were you present on set to make edits during production?
Yes, some of the time. I’d have a feed on my iPad, and on day two of the production, I’m working on day one footage, knowing it’s going to be rough and everything’s going to change. But you’ve got to start somewhere. I went through dailies and watched everything. We had 780 hours of footage on this movie.
The car chases in Rome looked phenomenal. How did you piece that footage together?
I’m thrilled with the way it turned out, but the Rome sequence took weeks of careful work to make sure [the action] landed correctly. You have to understand that Tom Cruise and Hayley Atwell are in a two-shot the entire time. You’re not cutting to create chemistry — you’re allowing their behavior to play out in a two-shot. One of our touchstone movies was What’s Up Doc.
The screwball comedy with Barbara Streisand?
Yeah. Chris loved that film and really embraced that approach in the Fiat and, before that, the BMW chase where Ethan’s handcuffed to Grace, and he’s driving one-handed. We filmed so much cool stuff but ended up compressing it because we kept getting feedback from the audience that it was just too long. Tom would always tell us, “You’ve always got to leave the audience wanting more,” so that became our mantra. We said, “Okay, we’re going to dive back into the chase sequence and take out more until it’s the right length.” Chris and Tom listen to the audience very carefully. They want to make mass entertainment for people in every country on the planet.
Can you talk a bit more about editing the action in Rome so it would track for an audience?
The trick is any time you cut to Tom and Hayley reacting in the car, you can then jump to any location without losing the audience, apart from locals. We cut to Ethan, and he turns right; we’re in a different part of the city, and who cares? Sometimes we’d take one chase and combine it with another one, and you don’t even notice that we’re in two different parts of the city. So we do cheat. But we’re constantly trying to keep this dynamic energy going with pressure from the other characters and the gags while we’re balancing all of that with Tom’s precision driving, where he carefully knocks over scooters or drives into some tiny alley. We cut out quite a bit of cool stuff, so we’re going to do a deleted shots reel for the DVD where you can see all these bits in a montage.
For the grand finale, you’ve got Tom Cruise and his motorcycle flying through the air to land on a speeding train – – pretty spectacular. Were you on set when they shot that?
Yeah. In September 2020, I was in Norway when they filmed the jump, but it’s always about the emotional state, isn’t it? Because it doesn’t matter if someone does a stunt if you don’t have an emotional connection to the characters and the stakes, and why people are doing what they’re doing. How much of the story do we see before we see Ethan on the motorbike? How often do we cut to Grace and the White Widow on the train? To get all those pieces balanced correctly, you have to work really hard to make everything smooth and emotional, so you’re not bumped off the ride.
You clearly place a premium on paring the story down to its essence.
You have to be utterly ruthless. Even in the last week of the edit, I’d say to Chris, “We’ve got to cut this; we’ve got to cut that.” This was stuff that Chris was very fond of, but he was like, “If it can go, it must go.” It’s the art of getting the maximum amount of story into the minimum amount of screen time. That’s what you’re aiming for. That’s the holy grail.

2023-07-20 10:27:33+00:00,‘Mission: Impossible’,"“Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, some language and suggestive material.","In December, Paramount Pictures released an enthralling behind-the-scenes video for its upcoming big-budget release “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” detailing a high-stakes stunt.
In it, Tom Cruise — not a stuntman, but Cruise, the enduring and ageless Hollywood heavyweight — jumps a motorcycle off a mountain in Norway.
It’s crazy.
Crazier? The perfectionist Cruise executed the jump seven more times.
The first couple of pages of production notes for the movie — now in theaters — are devoted to the stunt as well. Shot on the first day of principal photography in September 2020, the effort was the culmination of a year of prep work by Cruise, a skydiver who’d dreamt about executing the daredevil move for decades.
The good news is the work pays off, as it and other large-scale action sequences in “Part One” — the seventh installment in the popular “Mission: Impossible” big-screen franchise — are constantly thrilling and impressive.
The bad news: Almost anytime the movie isn’t in the midst of one “Dead Reckoning” comes pretty close to becoming deadly boring.
It’s surprising just how stagnant the film feels in several stretches given Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie’s penchant for collaborating on winning projects, including the most recent installments in this series. (McQuarrie co-wrote 2011’s “Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol” and since has directed and co-written 2015’s “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation” and 2018’s “Mission: Impossible — Fallout.”)
McQuarrie and co-writer Erik Jendresen have crafted an exposition-heavy tale of an artificial intelligence gone rogue that never feels as if it needs two parts to tell. (“Dead Reckoning Part Two” is set for a theatrical release June 28.) At more than two and a half hours, “Part One” is plenty long enough for a self-contained story.
We meet the persistently pesky AI aboard a Russian sub, a state-of-the-art war machine that runs into problems thanks to what becomes known as “The Entity.”
We then catch up with the franchise’s central figure, Cruise’s Ethan Hunt, operative extraordinaire with the top-secret Impossible Mission Force. He’s lying low in Amsterdam, but he accepts a mission from Henry Czerny’s Eugene Kittridge — not seen since 1996’s franchise-launching “Mission Impossible,” the character is now the director of the CIA — that takes him to the Arabian Desert.
And so begins Ethan’s reconnecting with friends, enemies and frenemies, including Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Alanna Mitsopolis (Vanessa Kirby), aka The White Widow.
The Entity sees Ethan as such a threat that it has recruited an old nemesis to work on its behalf, Esai Morales’ Gabriel. The movie leans so hard into flashbacks involving the pair that you have to convince yourself that you’ve never seen these scenes, their dalliance set prior to Ethan becoming an IMF agent. McQuarrie simply needs to FEEL just how much Gabriel-related baggage Ethan apparently has been carrying around this whole time, but this works only so well.
Also new to the mix — and adding more to it than Gabriel — is Hayley Atwell’s Grace, a high-priced thief hired to steal a key that could be, well, the key to controlling The Entity. Grace is both ambitious and in over her head, a combination that helps keep you guessing as to what she will do at any given time when paired with Ethan, and Atwell (“Agent Carter”) proves to be a solid addition.
They are chased through the streets of Rome — another of the movie’s international shooting locales along with, among others, Venice and the aforementioned Norway, standing in for the Austrian Alps — by Gabriel’s French henchwoman, Paris (Pom Klementieff of “Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3”). The latter is in a giant armored vehicle and Ethan and Grace in a very small car, which allows for a nice amount of humor to be infused into what otherwise is a well-executed but familiar-feeling sequence. (The recently released “Fast X” boasts an even crazier, if less satisfying, sequence set in the streets of the Italian capital.)
Give credit to McQuarrie and others for a well-timed AI-centric story, but it’s simply hard to become invested in it. In part, that’s because it provides no real food for thought beyond what if an AI did this or that horrifying thing? It doesn’t help that this greatest of enemies is represented by visuals that often feel like Windows screensavers.
And there’s the movie’s MacGuffin, the all-important key. It consists of two separated halves that must be united to have any worth. That “Dead Reckoning” uses a central plot device so similar to that of the recently released and entirely mind-numbing “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” is an unfortunate coincidence.
Part of the secret sauce of movies such as those in the “Mission: Impossible” and James Bond series are plots so convoluted that you feel like you’re barely keeping up. If nothing else, it makes them seem a little smarter than they actually are.
“Dead Reckoning Part One” is ultimately so simple — unite key, stop AI — that you wish characters would at least spend less time explaining everything.
There’s so much explaining.
“I’m going to need just a few more details,” Grace tells Ethan, Luther and Benji when they try to recruit her into helping her with a nearly impossible mission.
“They tend to just get in the way,” counters Benji.
How right you are, sir.
We do get a pretty nifty action sequence before the closing credits in “Part One,” leaving us at least a little hungry for “Part Two.”
And we know we’ll accept that “Mission, too, as it’s impossible to believe we won’t see Cruise do something even crazier in that one.

2023-07-17 03:14:25+00:00,China Box Office: ‘Mission Impossible – Dead Reckoning’ Opens in Third Place Behind Local Duo,"‘Mission: Impossible 7’ opens in third at the China box office, this year's fourth best Hollywood debut.","China’s box office weekend was marked more by the tussle for top spot between “Never Say Never” and “Chang An” than the entry of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.” The Tom Cruise-starring U.S. blockbuster was the highest new release title, but landed in third place with an opening score of $25.9 million.
The weekend’s top-ranked film was “Never Say Never,” a holdover title that scored $46.1 million. Lightchaser Animation-produced “Chang An San Wan Li” (aka “Chang An 30,000 Miles”) earned a shade less, at $43.9 million, according to data from consultancy Artisan Gateway.
After 11 days of official release (plus substantial previews), “Never Say Never,” written and directed by actor Wang Baoqiang (“Lost in Thailand,” “Detective Chinatown”) has already become one of the biggest hits of the year. Its cumulative stands at $212 million. “Chang An” has accumulated $96.1 million in nine days.
Local data providers’ daily charts showed that “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” never rose above third place despite a wide release on Friday. It played some 98,000 sessions on Friday, but exhibitors cut that on both successive days, ending at 53,000 on Sunday. (Imax reports that some $3.97 million of the film’s China total came from its screens.)
“Never Say Never” also saw its screen count reduced as cinemas switched their real estate to support “Chang An,” despite the latter’s huge 168 -minute running time. “Chang An” enjoyed its best day on Sunday, its ninth day of release. The Tang Dynasty-set film mixes history and mythology and is touted as Lightchaser’s first from its New Culture series which are based on actual historical figures.
“Mission Impossible” enjoyed the fourth largest opening haul for a Hollywood movie so far this year. The China launch of “Mission: Impossible” is on a par with “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3” ($28 million opening and a cumulative of $89 million) but behind “Fast X” (opening of $51.1 million and $146 million cumulative) and “Transformers – Rise of the Beasts” (opening $38.9 million and running total of $96 million).
Smash hit, “Lost in the Stars” earned an additional $15.9 million as it fell to fourth place. It has now earned $474 million since June 22.
Another Chinese animation “Oh My School” took fifth place in its opening weekend with a $12.8 million. The picture is a body swap comedy involves a naughty pupil and a strict class teacher.
The weekend aggregate box office was a healthy $154 million, which propelled the year-to-date total to $4.36 billion. Artisan Gateway calculates that as being some 64% ahead of the same point last year, and only 9% behind that of 2019, the last pre-pandemic year.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvY2hpbmEtYm94LW9mZmljZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctb3BlbnMtdGhpcmQtMTIzNTY3MTY4NS_SAXFodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9uZXdzL2NoaW5hLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLW9wZW5zLXRoaXJkLTEyMzU2NzE2ODUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Only two actors have appeared in every film, those being leading man Tom Cruise and supporting star Ving Rhames. It wasn't until 2006's Mission: Impossible 3 that fans were introduced to Simon Pegg's Benji, Ethan Hunt's latest right hand man that ended up being the one to stay. The next installment brought in then-blossoming top star Jeremy Renner to play William Brandt, a character that was all but Ethan's equal when it came to many aspects of the Impossible Missions Force. Even though Ethan proved himself to still be the franchise's sole leading man, William had a comfortable spot as second in command.
Introduced in 2011's Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, William Brandt is the Chief Analyst to the Secretary of the IMF. It's revealed later in that film that William is a former field agent himself, like Ethan, but he gave up that position after his team seemingly failed a mission in Croatia. That mission in question was to protect Ethan and his wife Julia, and William believed that he made a choice that led to Julia's death. After Ethan revealed Julia is still quietly alive, William regained his confidence and resumed his position as a field agent.
Renner was back in the role for 2015's Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, becoming just the fourth ""regular"" within the franchise (alongside Cruise, Pegg, and Rhames). That said, Renner was nowhere to be seen come 2018's Mission: Impossible – Fallout and is evidently absent from the latest installment, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning.
When it came to his absence from Fallout, director Christopher McQuarrie revealed that the production schedule conflicted with Renner's commitments within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
""It was just an unfortunate case of bad timing,"" McQuarrie said in 2018. ""At the time, when the movie started, we didn't really have a screenplay, so it was very difficult for us to say who would be in the movie for how long and on what days, and he had a commitment to Marvel. There was just simply no predicting. If we had a finished script, we would have been able to say, 'Yes, this will work and we can let you go for this time.' But there was just no predicting what those roles were going to turn out to.""
Once upon a time, Renner was envisioned as Cruise's successor in the franchise. Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation cinematographer Robert Elswit revealed in 2019 that Cruise's Ethan was originally going to become the IMF Secretary at the end of the fourth installment, with Renner's William taking center stage in the field. Despite these initial plans, Paramount Pictures ultimately kept Cruise as the leading man throughout Ghost Protocol and the film's franchise-record box office return gave the studio the confidence to keep rolling with the original star.
While there was no word on why Renner missed Dead Reckoning Part 1, it was likely due to another scheduling conflict. Renner filmed Hawkeye while Dead Reckoning was rolling cameras on its rescheduled shoot, as the seventh installment was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Even though it's been over one decade since he debuted in the franchise, Renner's Mission: Impossible contract does have at least one more movie on it. The action star revealed in 2014 that he ""signed on to do three Mission: Impossible movies with Tom"" when he first inked his M:I deal in 2010. This leaves a Dead Reckoning Part 2 appearance on the table, although it will likely come down to scheduling once again.

2023-07-15 15:22:48+00:00,Box Office: ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One’ Now Cruising to Projected $78 Million Five-Day Debut,"Tom Cruise's ""Mission: Impossible 7"" is coming in below its $90 million projections, while ticket sales for ""Sound of Freedom"" are up 17%.","Paramount’s “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” is defusing a bit at the domestic box office, readjusting for an estimated $78 million gross over its five-day opening. That’d be a substantial chunk behind projections headed into the weekend, which had the Tom Cruise action sequel hoping for $90 million.
Some in the industry were expecting a “Top Gun: Maverick” halo effect for “Dead Reckoning” after last year’s legacy sequel positively ignited movie theaters, rocketing through the summer to become the fifth-highest grossing domestic release of all-time. That doesn’t seem to be the case though, as “Mission” isn’t exactly transcending the numbers typical for its franchise.
The last entry, 2018’s “Fallout,” launched with a then-franchise record $61 million over three days. “Dead Reckoning” opened on Wednesday, plus previews on Tuesday evening — a bump-up in the calendar that the industry suspects was implemented to take advantage of premium ticket prices for Imax. Universal and director Christopher Nolan take over those auditoriums next weekend with their sweeping historical drama “Oppenheimer.”
Tom Cruise may have fostered a reputation as the global vanguard for movie theaters over the past few years — “I love my popcorn,” he declared in a new video this week — but it’s worth a reminder that his films aren’t the biggest openers on the block. Instead, they tend to draw older audiences, who are less inclined to roll out for a new release in the first few days. “Top Gun: Maverick” is the star’s superlative multiplier, taking its $126 million three-day debut to a $718 million finish, but “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” more than tripled its opening weekend, as did the 2015 entry “Rogue Nation.”
As “Dead Reckoning” falls behind opening estimates, the franchise will need to find those kinds of legs again. This seventh franchise entry is the most expensive yet — with a production budget that ballooned to $290 million, not only due to its high-octane set pieces but also a series of COVID-related production delays and safety measures. (“We are the gold standard!” Cruise shouted at crew members he caught breaking protocols in 2020.) That’s more than $100 million higher than the price tag for “Fallout.”
Strong word-of-mouth should be helpful. The “Mission” series is now a favorite among critics for its daredevil stunts, intricate set pieces and wry humor. Variety chief film critic Peter Debruge filed a rave for “Dead Reckoning,” writing that it “delivers a formidable concept and several hall-of-fame set-pieces while somehow managing to tie the storylines back into these movies’ core mythology.” He’s far from an outlier, as the film stands with a 92% approval rating from top critics on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences are also exhilarated, as indicated by the “A” Cinema Score grade determined by surveying ticket buyers.
“Mission: Impossible” will also look to register strongly overseas, where the franchise has become a strong draw. Both “Fallout” and “Rogue Nation” earned more than 70% of their ticket sales in foreign markets. So far, “Dead Reckoning” has earned $82.1 million across 70 international territories through its first three days of release.
“Dead Reckoning” sees Tom Cruise back as secret agent Ethan Hunt, recruiting his crew of super-spies to take on a very scary and very topical enemy: an all-powerful artificial intelligence called the Entity. Christopher McQuarrie returns to direct after helming the last two entries. Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby and Henry Czerny make series returns, while newcomers Hayley Atwell, Esai Morales, Pom Klementieff, Cary Elwes and Rob Delaney join the fray.
Even with Cruise driving motorcycles off cliffs and chasing criminals around Europe, there is perhaps a more remarkable box office narrative continuing to unfold this weekend. Angel Studios’ “Sound of Freedom” continues to show strength as a bona fide word-of-mouth monster. Major studios are projecting a $23 million haul through the weekend — which would mark a sizable 17% uptick from its gross last weekend.
Wide releases hardly ever see week-to-week rises in ticket sales, but “Sound of Freedom” isn’t a typical wide release. After being shelved by Disney during the shuffle of the 21st Century Fox acquisition, the Jim Caviezel thriller was eventually taken on by Angel Studios. The Utah-based banner has employed a “Pay It Forward” system, encouraging viewers to donate money to the company so that it can purchase and distribute tickets to other prospective audience members looking to see the film at no cost. But a release doesn’t go up in ticket sales just based on an untraditional system — with its glowing “A+” grade on Cinema Score and lots of chatter on social media, “Sound of Freedom” is a phenomenon, particularly among conservative audiences.
The film, which has been scrutinized by anti-trafficking experts, tells the story of real-life ex-fed Tim Ballard, who left the government to take on human trafficking through his own means. Ballard founded the non-profit Operation Underground Railroad, though he has reportedly parted ways with the organization more recently.
Sony’s “Insidious: The Red Door” looks to take third place, projecting a $12.6 million haul through Sunday. That would mark a sizable 62% tumble from its opening last weekend, when the horror sequel debuted on top of domestic charts. The Screen Gems, Stage 6 Films and Blumhouse co-production carries a modest $17 million production budget — a figure that its $54 million domestic gross has already far surpassed.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is facing a 59%-or-so drop in its third weekend. The Harrison Ford finale added $3.3 million on Friday, pushing its domestic total to $136 million. The Disney release will soon surpass “Fast X” ($145 million) to become one of the top 10 domestic releases of the year; it’d be more remarkable if it weren’t for the film’s whopping $300 million production budget.
Disney also looks to round out the top five with the Pixar romance “Elemental.” The animated feature added $2.6 million on Friday, stretching its domestic haul to $119 million. “Elemental” bombed upon release, landing Pixar’s lowest opening in history ($29 million), but it has held remarkably well in the weeks since, continuing to draw family crowds. While it won’t recoup its $200 million production budget in North America, things seemed far bleaker just a few weeks ago.
Opening in limited release, Disney is putting out the ensemble comedy “Theater Camp” out under its Searchlight Pictures banner. The indie release, starring Molly Gordon and Ben Platt, looks to capitalize on strong notices out of the Sundance Film Festival. The film is opening in six theaters in Los Angeles and New York, earning $109,000 on Friday.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLTctcHJvamVjdGVkLW9wZW5pbmctd2Vla2VuZC10b20tY3J1aXNlLTEyMzU2NzA4NDAv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vYm94LW9mZmljZS9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtNy1wcm9qZWN0ZWQtb3BlbmluZy13ZWVrZW5kLXRvbS1jcnVpc2UtMTIzNTY3MDg0MC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,Tom Cruise Gives Update on Plans to Film a Movie in Space: 'Working on It Diligently',Tom Cruise teased that his film set to be shot in outer space is still in the works: 'We’ll see where we go',"Tom Cruise is still charting his work trip to space.
Back in 2020 it was revealed that the actor was planning to film a movie in outer space.
While at the Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One premiere in New York City this week, Cruise, 61, was asked about the status of the space-exploring film.
“We’ve been working on it diligently,” he teased to Variety. “We’ll see where we go.”
The project was first announced by NASA back in 2020, days after a report came out claiming Cruise was looking to space for cinematic inspiration.
NASA director Jim Bridenstein led the charge: “NASA is excited to work with @TomCruise on a film aboard the @Space_Station! We need popular media to inspire a new generation of engineers and scientists to make @NASA’s ambitious plans a reality.”
Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, tacked onto the excitement. “Should be a lot of fun!"" Musk replied in a tweet.

Weeks later, Deadline reported that the project had confirmed Doug Liman to direct. Cruise and Liman previously worked together on 2014's Edge of Tomorrow and 2017's American Made.
Two years later, Universal Pictures executive Donna Langley confirmed the movie’s production in an interview with BBC News.
“I think Tom Cruise is taking us to space. He's taking the world to space,"" Langley said. ""That's the plan. We have a great project in development with Tom that does contemplate him doing just that, taking a rocket up to the Space Station and shooting and hopefully being the first civilian to do a space walk outside of the Space Station.""
The upcoming film, which Langley said Cruise pitched to her over a Zoom call during the pandemic, has a budget in the area of $200 million, according to Variety.

“During the pandemic he asked for a Zoom call with us and got onto the call and said, 'Guys, I've got this great project and here it is,' "" Langley said. ""The majority of the story actually takes place on Earth and then the character needs to go up to space to save the day.”
While Cruise works “diligently” on his space film, he is currently rolling out his latest Mission: Impossible movie. While Dead Reckoning Part One can be found in theaters now, writer/director Christopher McQuarrie admitted that Part Two is yet to be completed.
“We finish this tour, and on our way back to the U.K. we stop to scout along the way. We hit the ground running as soon as we get back,” McQuarrie told Variety. “I get two days of vacation between here and Tokyo and I’m back on.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS90b20tY3J1aXNlLWdpdmVzLXVwZGF0ZS1wbGFucy1maWxtLW1vdmllLWluLXNwYWNlLXdvcmtpbmctb24taXQtNzU2MDMwMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-07 18:49:31+00:00,Barbie and Mission Impossible – Dead Reckoning,"NoHo Arts District is L.A's entertainment hub. Filled with live theatre, bars, buzzing nightlife, restaurants, studios and so much more.","[NoHo Arts District, CA] – This month’s movie and TV reviews of Barbie and Mission Impossible – Dead Reckoning.
I wasn’t planning to see Barbie; in fact, if I had to make a top-ten list of films I was going to see this summer, Barbie would have ranked #13. My curiosity did get the better of me (as well as favorable responses from people I respect), so I hit a weekday matinee and found it to be an enjoyable, even thought-provoking romp (how’s that for a paradox?). By now, many of you know the premise: Stereotypical Barbie (a radiant Margot Robbie who doesn’t make any missteps, even though the character sometimes does) is living the ideal life in Barbieland, with its matriarchal government, with its plethora of Barbies with identical temperaments and differing achievements, where the identifying color is pink and every night is a girls’ night. And then there are the Kens (led by Ryan Gosling’s blonde, buff basker in Barbie’s glow, Ken, who are there–but only exist and thrive in relation to the Barbies. But then Stereotypical Barbie begins having thoughts of death, which leads to her heading off to Los Angeles and eventually Mattel Headquarters. Worlds collide, loyalties are tested, and the fate of the world as we know it hangs in the balance…
Well, perhaps I’m overdramatizing things. From beginning to end, Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig is a delight, and it should probably make it for a good date film (I suspect that accounts for a good part of its half-billion dollar gross, as of this moment). Cultural references abound, so that a second viewing might be in order to see if you noticed everything. There are plenty of knowing, witty lines and situations (co-written by Gerwig and Noam Baumbauch). Robbie and Gosling are perfect as Barbie and Ken, with Gosling particularly funny both as accessory Ken and “enlightened, patriarchal Ken.” Besides the engaging leads, the Barbie also has some secret weapons at its disposal, namely Kate McKinnon as the helpful if eccentric “Weird Barbie,” Rhea Perlman as the mysterious and wise Ruth, Helen Mirren’s narrator, and America Ferrera as a creative, thoughtful, frustrated mom, flawlessly delivering a rousing speech about the contradictions and difficulties inherent in being a woman.
As for the Barbieland setting, with its preponderance of pink, perpetually sunny weather, open design (you don’t find walls in Barbieland), sandless beaches, it is a treat for the eyes, and a fitting contrast with the real world, with its inhabitants only too willing to tear you down, and a “patriarchal system” still very much in place, though its upholders smilingly manage to hide it well. However, the film, if not entirely equivocal, does give the neglected Kens some consideration, with the suggestion that if a society were to be truly ideal, then both sides have to work together. There are also some amusing (and occasionally trenchant) observations of the corporate world, the American Dream, and family relationships, particularly those of mother and daughter. And so, there is much to please everyone with this Barbie – whether you’re looking for an agreeable divertissement or something with a little more heft, it’s hard to go wrong. You may even tear up a bit. (I’m not going to say if I did.)

You gotta hand it to Tom Cruise. Up until these past weeks, he seemed to be the only hope for movie theaters (aside from plush, reclining seats) in their bid to reclaim audiences (Barbie and Oppenheimer have since pitched in). Mission Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, directed by Top Gun: Maverick’s Christopher McQuarrie stars an energetic Cruise in the first part of his farewell to the successful series. Normally, I am averse to these Part One features, since they usually leave the viewer dangling, and more often than not could have been resolved in one film. And if truth be told, there’s a good deal that could be trimmed from this installment, especially in both the endless discussions of Artificial Intelligence (the misuse of which is central) and the allegiance/loyalties of the main characters. Having said that, this Mission…is both exciting and satisfying, as it resolves enough matters and leaves you wanting a bit more. Most of the old team is back, including Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson and Ving Rhames. There is also a welcome addition in Hayley Atwell as a thief who is at first reluctant to do anything but save her own hide. The action sequences are both exciting and not-too-implausible (as these things go), with a noteworthy car chase and train showdown working particularly well. This Mission Impossible…is worth seeing, especially in a good theater. It’s up to you if you need the reclining seats…",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbm9ob2FydHNkaXN0cmljdC5jb20vYmFyYmllLWFuZC1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,"Wait, Is Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 2 Not Delaying Filming After All?",Rumors of Mission: Impossible 8 having a production delay may be exaggerated.,"Due to the life cycle of the movie business, the ongoing WGA Writers strike was not going to have bring the entire industry to a halt immediately. But everybody understood that the longer it went on, the more projects would be impacted. We’re now starting to see significant delays in film and TV; some movies that were planned to start filming being delayed, and release dates being pushed back. But apparently one report of a movie halting itself mid-production, Tom Cruise's Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part Two, may not be entirely accurate.
Mission: Impossible 8 has currently taken a break in filming, and in a recent interview director Christopher McQuarrie said that production on the film saw challenges due to the current strike, and this apparently led some to connect those dots and assume that the pause in filming was due to the strike. But Deadline reports that the current break was always part of the plan, as everybody is currently focused on promoting Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One, which is set to hit theaters in less than a month.
That’s not to say that the WGA strike might not present future issues for that project. The Deadline story specifies that when Dead Reckoning Part Two resumes filming later this summer, there are hopes that the strike will have been resolved. If that isn’t the case, there very well could be complications. No changes of any kind can be made to a script without a WGA writer to make them, and right now there are no writers working in productions due to the strike.
Film productions frequently need to make allowances for their stars to take a break from filming one movie in order to promote a different film. And certainly when the decision was made to shoot two Mission: Impossible movies back-to-back, it was understood that would be an issue here. While the actual filming of Mission: Impossible 7 was delayed by years due to the global pandemic, the decision to shoot the movies together and release them about a year apart never changed.
We are starting to see the WGA strike have a real impact on film productions. Disney just made major changes to its release calendar, and it’s difficult to believe the strike didn’t play a part in some of that. While some major productions, like Deadpool 3 are shooting during the strike, many believe that movie will benefit from the fact that so much of Ryan Reynolds' voice is handled in post-production, and thus shooting the script without changes now won’t be an issue as a lot can still be changed later.
At this point, it does look like most of the serious delays are over, and Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part Two will have a production schedule more like what we were used to seeing pre-pandemic, but movies get delayed all the time for all sorts of reasons, so the possibility that the two-part Mission: Impossible adventure might have a wider gap between entries than planned will remain possible right up until the end.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3dhaXQtbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLTE2MjEzNTk5My5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-06-16 13:15:00+00:00,"The Fight for Imax: How Studios Beg and Barter to Get ‘Mission: Impossible,’ ‘Oppenheimer’ and More Blockbusters on Premium Screens","At the movies, there are tense negotiations between studios and Imax to secure all-important premium screens.","There’s been a battle brewing between two of Hollywood’s blockbuster talents.
In one corner, Tom Cruise is gearing to take a victory lap from the behemoth success of “Top Gun: Maverick” with a sequel to his other big action franchise, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.” It’s expected to be one of the biggest movies of the summer when it opens on July 12. In the other corner, Christopher Nolan, one of the few directors so famous that his name alone can draw crowds, is readying to release his highly anticipated “Oppenheimer.” The big-budget drama about the creation of the atomic bomb launches just a week later on July 21.
At the center of the drama is access to Imax, and how the company’s 401 North American screens will be divided between the two box office draws.
Except, in this case, there wasn’t much to negotiate. Paramount’s “Mission: Impossible 7” is only playing on Imax screens for one week, as first reported by Puck, a newsletter that covers the media business, before it has to relinquish all of its showtimes to “Oppenheimer.” That’s despite Cruise making a few calls around town to remind everyone that not even a year ago, “Maverick” earned more than $100 million from Imax alone. By shorting the Imax run of “Dead Reckoning,” he suggests, all involved parties risk losing out on serious coinage.
But long before the oft-delayed “MI” sequel moved to mid-July, Universal had already ironed out a rare agreement for “Oppenehimer” to control Imax’s entire North American footprint for three full weeks. (Directors like Nolan, who use Imax cameras to film their movies, are typically granted a two-week exclusive window.) Greta Gerwig’s star-studded “Barbie,” which also opens on July 21, isn’t playing in Imax at all as a result.
“I feel sad in a way we can’t accommodate all of them. I know ‘Mission: Impossible’ is going to be a really big movie,” Imax CEO Rich Gelfond tells Variety. “Nolan has a special place in Imax’s heart because he uses our cameras and promotes us. It’s not a matter of us saying which we can make more money on. I would hope after ‘Oppenheimer’s’ run, we can bring back ‘Mission.'”
There may be more of these fights brewing in the future. Here’s why: Attendance hasn’t rebounded in pandemic times, but the demand to watch certain movies on the biggest and brightest screens, known in the industry as premium large formats (PLF), has grown exponentially. Lest that sound like spin from PLF operators, there are stats to back up the idea that audiences are buying what they’re selling. Moviegoing is down 33% from 2019, but the market share for Imax, one of the art’s more recognizable forms, is up 50% without adding any new screens, according to the company. On a big-budget tentpole, those enhanced viewing experiences can account for as much as 30-40% of overall box office returns even though there are only about 900 PLF screens in the country. As a result, studios have more at stake in the battle for access to the finite number of screens that can generate outsized ticket sales.
To pluck a recent example of Imax’s box office heft, take Sony’s “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.” The animated comic book adventure opened to a mighty $120 million from 4,313 North American locations, and averaged $19,736 per location on standard 2D screens. In contrast, it brought in an average of $25,159 per location on PLF screens; and $34,214 per location on Imax screens.
Those figures defy conventional wisdom that price deters people from going to the movies. Tickets for PLF are significantly more expensive, costing up to $28 in major cities like New York City and Los Angeles compared to $18 for regular 2D seats. And yet, those formats are usually the first to sell out for visual effects-heavy movies like “Oppenheimer” and “Mission: Impossible,” with dazzling graphics, crazy stunts and talent that says – nay, insists – it’s not just the best, but the only, way to experience their films.
So how do studios ensure their movies are playing on as many premium large format screens as possible? They fight over them, of course. For distribution chiefs, who handle the theatrical rollout of a movie, an important part of the job is haggling and calling in favors with movie theater owners to guarantee their upcoming box office draw has more prime showtimes than rival offerings.
Imax operates differently than other PLF operators because it doesn’t take as much input from studios when scheduling showtimes. Studios, of course, set the release dates for their own movies. But when there’s a pileup of blockbusters, like the one-two-three punch of “Indiana Jones,” “Mission: Impossible” and “Oppenheimer” in late June and into July, it’s Imax who gets to dictate which of those it’ll be offering its patrons beyond opening weekend.
That’s not how it works for Dolby, ScreenX, 4DX and essentially any other premium large format. Bargaining for those screens is similar to the standard 2D operation, which is a more flexible arrangement that factors in the popularity of a movie as well as the rapport between exhibitors and studios or filmmakers.
Most movie theaters have at least one auditorium with PLF capabilities, with larger multiplexes housing two or three with those special projectors. After a film’s opening weekend, it typically cedes many, if not most, of its premium screens to whatever movie launches on the following weekend. However, if a film is an outsized success story, it stands a better chance at retaining more of those PLF auditoriums in subsequent weeks. And that’s, of course, assuming the movie has the right scale and scope to get people excited. No offense to “80 for Brady” or “Book Club: The Next Chapter,” but very little about those films require its audience to watch it in 3D. So even if “Oppenheimer” is rolling in to town, the latest “Mission: Impossible” movie will still be available in many theaters with enhanced sound and wider screens in its second, third, and even forth weekend.
This is where negotiations can effectively come into play. Studios can’t outright withhold or promise access to one blockbuster in exchange for another that may be riskier in terms of commercial appeal. But they can certainly remind the exhibitors of past successes in hopes that they will want to reward the studio or creative talent with more screens on future projects. This is where Paramount will get to leverage the enduring appeal of “Top Gun: Maverick” as “Dead Reckoning” makes its way to theaters. Ditto Disney with “Avatar: The Way of Water” as it books “Indiana Jones” and Universal with “Super Mario Bros. Movie” as “Oppenheimer” gears up to release. The problem, some insiders lament, is that exhibitors can have short memories. One executive with knowledge of these conversations says it’s a game of “what have you done for me lately?”
There’s a reason that Imax has more control, and it’s not necessarily its ubiquity in the exhibition space. The company uses a proprietary technology to create a film print that’s specifically designed to fit the aspect ratio of its screens. Alternatively, the rest of the country’s PLF operators can project the same version of a movie that they would play on 2D screens, which the studio’s provide. They don’t need to commission specific prints for their high-definition or XD auditoriums. It gives them more scheduling flexibility compared to Imax, which also can’t pivot as quickly in the event that a movie isn’t selling tickets. Since Imax isn’t planning to offer “Barbie,” it won’t have a version of the movie to play even if the company later decided it wanted to slot a few showtimes.
Complicating the matter is that Imax has a vested interest in certain movies like the Marvel installment “Eternals,” Jordan Peele’s “Us” and “Oppenheimer” that use its patented technology. That leaves the company eager to prioritize those films when it comes to deciding who gets its limited screens. Relationships that Imax has fostered with certain directors, like Nolan and Denis Villeneuve (“Dune”), sometimes appearl to trump the demand for popular franchises and long-running series that would otherwise be hugely important to theater operators, insiders say.
“In a situation where there’s an unavoidable conflict,” Gelfond says, “we’ll look at a number of factors: how the franchise has performed before, visuals, and our relationship to the filmmaker.”
Nolan, for his part, is known to breathlessly evangelize about the singular of experience of Imax, going as far as branding it “the best film format that was ever invented.” As he promoted 2012’s “The Dark Knight” he told the masses that “it’s the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion.”
That kind of publicity makes it worth going all in on Nolan, even at the expense of Cruise.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWJhdHRsZS1pbWF4LXNjcmVlbnMtMTIzNTYzMzUzNy_SAWVodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9uZXdzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1iYXR0bGUtaW1heC1zY3JlZW5zLTEyMzU2MzM1MzcvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-01 20:15:49+00:00,Watch Tom Cruise Roll a Fiat 500 in ‘Mission: Impossible’,The director Christopher McQuarrie discusses a chase scene involving the star and Hayley Atwell in ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One’,"“I am Christopher McQuarrie, the director and one of the writers and producers of ‘Mission — Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One.’” [MUSIC PLAYING] “What are we doing?” “Finding us a new car.” “The inspiration for this sequence actually occurred to me during the shooting of ‘Mission — Impossible Fallout’ when I was scouting locations for the chase scene in Paris. And I came across a little Fiat 500 that was parked along the Seine River. And I thought it would be great, the idea of watching Ethan Hunt and Tom Cruise driving in a car like that. When I pitched this idea to Tom, he immediately appreciated the notion of doing a car chase that involved more humor than any of the sequences we had done previously, and he really leaned into that. Something to watch during this sequence is the behavior between Tom Cruise and Haley Atwell. You’re looking at two actors performing in two-shots, meaning you don’t have any editorial control. It’s not like I can pick the best moments of each actor. I have to really be giving you their best at the exact same time. And what it really does is it creates an affinity for these two characters. The most important part about this sequence is not really the action. It’s the feeling of a relationship developing between two people who actually don’t want to be together. And this car chase is all about creating circumstances whereby they are forced together, and over the course of a sequence, you feel them turning into a team. Rome is a very tricky place to shoot. The Fiat is a very difficult car to drive. And obviously, it’s very difficult to drive that car with handcuffs, let alone on cobblestone streets which make all of the driving, everything that you see Tom doing, becomes completely unpredictable. And what you end up with is a sequence where the car almost has a mind of its own. It becomes a character in the sequence along with Haley’s hair, as you can see there. In this part of the sequence, we ended up on the Spanish Steps. We were allowed to shoot at the Spanish Steps with the understanding that we never could actually physically touch the Spanish Steps. But so long as we never touched the Spanish Steps, we could do whatever we want. So what we did is we built the Spanish Steps in three sections on a backlot so that we could drive cars down them. And everything that Tom and Haley are doing here is extremely difficult, extremely punishing. The car doesn’t have really great suspension. So the riding down the steps is very jarring. And we got into this bit here with the cars rolling over we did in three sections. One, Tom drove down the steps. Then we had a bunch of grips roll a car down the steps with no one in it. And then, finally, we built a padded interior for the two actors to actually roll down the steps with the cameras rolling.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMDEvbW92aWVzL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1wYXJ0LW9uZS1jbGlwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-12 21:25:55+00:00,Shea Whigham on the Common Thread Between ‘Mission: Impossible’ and ‘Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse’,"Mission Impossible star Shea Whigham talks how he joined Dead Reckoning, and his most memorable moment with Tom Cruise.","Shea Whigham thought his pursuit of Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker would forever be his toughest assignment, but then Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt quickly proved him wrong in Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.
In Christopher “McQ” McQuarrie’s critically acclaimed seventh chapter of the spy action franchise, Whigham plays Jasper Briggs, a foot soldier for the CIA’s Clandestine Services, and together with his partner Degas (Greg Tarzan Davis), he’s tasked with the tall order of chasing Ethan Hunt around the world. And while his similar role in Todd Phillips’ box office smash hit Joker (2019) would seem like the inspiration for his Mission casting, it was actually his DOD bureaucrat character from the Sam Esmail-directed and Julie Roberts-led Homecoming that piqued McQ’s interest.
“Mission: Impossible – Fallout and Homecoming were nominated for some stuff at one of those functions [24th Critics’ Choice Awards]. And [McQ and I] happened to be behind each other,” Whigham tells The Hollywood Reporter. “And McQ said, ‘I’m gonna write something for you.’ And then all the way in December [2019], I got a very cryptic text from him, saying, ‘Answer in five minutes. I’m calling from a European phone.’ So it was him and Cruise on the other end, and together, they buckled me to my knees.”
In June’s Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Whigham had another notable role as Gwen Stacy’s (Hailee Steinfeld) father, Captain George Stacy. And in a manner that’s similar to Mission: Impossible’s brain trust of McQ, Cruise and co-writer Erik Jendresen, Across the Spider-Verse’s creative team didn’t begin their process with a fully formed script either. Instead, they followed the story wherever it led them, meaning they wrote and rewrote along the way.
“You don’t have a script either way, but both films, Mission and Spider-Man, let you explore and bring something of your own,” Whigham says. “They encourage that process, and I think that’s why they’re both so good.”
Below, during a recent conversation with THR, Whigham also discusses his personal highlights from each of Dead Reckoning Part One’s various locations and sequences.
So what’s the beard for?
I just came off of something called American Primeval. It’s directed by Pete Berg and written by Mark L. Smith, who did The Revenant. So I’m in that world.
Shea Whigham with a full beard? Sold!
(Laughs.) It’s good, man. I’m not gonna lie.
Shea Whigham in Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One Paramount Pictures and Skydance
So once you found out that you’d have to do the impossible and chase after Tom Cruise for an entire movie, what was your first order of business?
To be honest with you, I didn’t think I would be chasing him. We don’t work off of a script per se. So that was McQ and Tom at the last minute. We were in Venice, and they were like, “You know what? It feels like you need to chase Ethan all over Venice.” So I was not prepared, let’s say.
You probably don’t audition anymore, so did McQ come to you?
Yeah, I had done this piece called Homecoming with Julia Roberts, and serendipitously enough, Mission: Impossible – Fallout and Homecoming were nominated for some stuff at one of those functions [24th Critics’ Choice Awards]. And we happened to be behind each other. And McQ said, “I’ve seen Homecoming.” And I said, “I’ve loved your stuff ever since The Usual Suspects.” And he said, “I’m gonna write something for you.” And I said, “Great!” That was in January of [2019], and then all the way in December, I got a very cryptic text from him, saying, “Answer in five minutes. I’m calling from a European phone.” So it was him and Cruise on the other end, and together, they buckled me to my knees.
There’s a video from the first day of shooting, which was Tom’s motorcycle jump. And once he went over the edge of the cliff, most of the cast started laughing as a way to cope with the terror of the moment. How did you handle it?
First of all, I was really surprised, because he rode by us while hanging off of a helicopter, with this look of relaxation. Then I had to walk away and be by myself during the actual jump itself. That’s when the enormity of the ramp and the actual jump really hit me. My heart was really pumping for Tom in that moment. I was palpably nervous.
What’s your impression of Tom and McQ as a duo?
They’re exactly what I want out of collaborators. They are cinephiles. They love cinema. And the only director I’ve heard talk about film as much as them is Marty [Scorsese]. I did Boardwalk Empire and The Wolf of Wall Street with him. So we ended up talking cinema all the time.
Well, in most action movies with a famous character, there’s often another character who delivers a line or a speech about the mythic hero of the story. David Strathairn’s “Jesus Christ, that’s Jason Bourne” comes to mind. And early on, you get to do that by delivering the myth of Ethan Hunt. So did you recognize right away what your purpose was?
First of all, McQ and Tom were very excited because we had access to an Osprey through the military, and that’s the first time it’s been used in a film. But I knew that someone had to try and track down Ethan. I said to them early on, “Look, I love Midnight Run and The Fugitive because I cared about those somewhat left-of-center characters.” Every guy trying to chase the “bad guy” is usually straight down the [middle], and I was interested in obtusely trying to nab Ethan. To keep me interested, I wanted to make it personal and not have to divulge that in some soliloquy. But it’s there. So, yeah, I had a feeling that was gonna be my lot in this film.

Jasper Briggs, along with his partner Degas (Greg Tarzan Davis), eventually recognize, to varying degrees, that Hunt may not be the enemy here. Did you look at Tommy Lee Jones’ character in The Fugitive as an example to follow?
We talked about it, and like I said, I talked about Midnight Run quite a bit. [Charles] Grodin and Dennis Farina. But it was definitely brought up because we’re in a chase film. And you’re right, the audience knows that Hunt is Hunt. So how are you gonna keep that interesting if you’re not able to fully catch him? But, yeah, he starts to show himself to me as it progresses. This was no different than Boardwalk Empire or Silver Linings Playbook. You start with copious amounts of information, and then you whittle it down. You basically answer those big questions of, “What do I want? And how do I serve this story?”
Briggs was the name of a character on the ‘60s TV series [Steven Hill’s Dan Briggs], so did McQ give you any indication if your character’s name is more than just a tip of the cap?
I better not say anything right now.
The film was obviously shut down early due to Covid, but then it resumed later that summer. Did you work steadily until it wrapped?
I worked steadily. We were in a strange time, obviously, as the world was. We pulled up stakes in Venice and had to split because of Covid. So we didn’t know what was gonna happen, but then we got the call from Tom who said, “We’re going in. We’re gonna try to be the canary in the coal mine and figure out how to do this.” So we stayed in place in Norway, and when we went to Rome, we stayed, even if you weren’t working. I wasn’t supposed to be in the Venice portion of it, but as it went along and we uncovered things, it blossomed into more of a role. So we stayed wherever we were, and we had some starts and stops. We had a two-week hold in Venice when we went back there again. So it was tough to actually complete this piece.
So I’d love to go through each location and just do a travelogue of sorts. What was your personal highlight from each location’s sequence, starting with Abu Dhabi International Airport?
That was massive. That’s when Tom’s influence really hit home. He had the Prince give us access to this airport that’s about to be the largest in the world, I believe. They weren’t open yet when we shot there. So we had the full run of it, and that’s when I felt the immensity of the place and what these films mean to the world.
And what about the zany insanity on the streets of Rome?
Rome holds a special place. I’ve been to Rome several times, and to be on the Via dei Fori Imperiali, looking at what was the [Roman] Forum and thinking of the history …. To shut that down and have the ability to do my own driving through the small streets, that’s when I knew I was in a big film again.
Night shoots in Venice …
Venice was quiet. No one was in Venice when we were there [the second time]. When we were there initially, there was going to be a big party and we were going to use this festival that was going on. And so these guys pivoted off of that, but the party still took place there [in the club]. It was lovely because we actually got a chance to explore Venice with no one there. So it was beautiful and somewhat haunting. While we were there, we would island hop, and that was a really special time. It was a bonding time as well because we all stayed together as a group.
And the pièce de résistance of your experience, standing atop a moving train in Norway.
(Laughs.) That was right away at the start of filming. We filmed that first, and I just remember the inherent beauty of the valley that we were in. McQ was on top of the train, directing us in what we called a clamshell. And then I stepped up there and tried to take Ethan down. And I remember Tom looked at me and said, “Is this as good as it gets?” And I said to him, “I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else, but right here, right now.” But that was tough, filming on that speeding train. It was cold. Another thing I’ll never forget is McQ saying, “This was one of the top-three days of filming I’ve ever experienced in my life.” So I knew that was pretty profound because of what they’ve already been through together.
Dead Reckoning Part Two is nearly halfway complete. Do you still have a ways to go before you finish your role in all this?
Oh yeah! I go back in August and shoot all fall. We’re gonna be in London and a place yet to be named. I don’t believe they know yet, but it’ll be somewhere sexy, as usual. (Laughs.) So, yes, I have a lot to do, and we have quite a bit to do still. Like I said, these guys are cinephiles. They love to shoot and they love being on the floor, as we say. They’ll shoot [Dead Reckoning Part Two] right up until the release date just to make it better. They’ll drill down on it and keep making it better and better.
Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis in Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One Paramount Pictures and Skydance
So Tarzan [Davis] told me last year that you helped him out with his various self-tapes during filming and that you really made a difference in his approach to acting and auditions. And my theory at the time was that your inclination to help the next generation of actors began with your own kid’s [Giorgia Whigham] self-tapes. Is that somewhat accurate?
No, to be honest with you, I don’t really even talk about acting with my kid. It’s her own journey, and she wants it to be that way. I’ve said, “I’m there if you need me,” but I stay out of the way. And it’s probably best that it be her journey, her struggle and her triumphs.
But Tarzan came out of the gates in Top Gun: Maverick, and now he’s doing back-to-back Mission: Impossible movies. And I’ve told him, “You don’t know what you don’t know.” I’m not talking down to him; you just don’t know how hard it is to actually be an actor and have success. And to come out of the gate with these three films, I laugh all the time about it with McQ and Tom. He’s three for three with these three films. So he really wants to be a good actor, and I’ve passed on whatever knowledge I have.
Do you think you wanted to help him because you somewhat miss the grind of those early days?
Well, it’s not because I miss it. When I’m working, I see a lot of this younger generation, and I have a real reverence for people who came before me. When I worked with De Niro, Hopkins and some other heavies, I always made sure they knew that I knew their stuff and that I knew they paved the way. And I felt like Tarzan wanted to have some of that. He wanted some of the stories about when I was working with De Niro and Buscemi and Hopkins, and so it just became an organic process. He had some tapes, I looked at them and I said, “I think we can tighten them up a little bit.” And he got something good off of one of them. I think it was Grey’s Anatomy.

So I first said this to Hailee Steinfeld last month, but your scenes together in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse were the best scenes in the movie. She said the two of you recorded your stuff separately at first, but then you eventually re-recorded a lot of it together. Could you feel the difference once you were together?
Yes, we really found something there. Lord and Miller brought us in and it was just so smart. With me having a 25-year-old daughter, we found some really good organic stuff in there. To tell you the truth, I didn’t really know what I was getting into with Spider-Man. I’d seen the first one. My kids were into it and had me watch it. And when Across came along, I didn’t realize how gratifying it would be to do it. I loved it. So we would go back in and tighten it, and then I would bring stuff in. But at the heart of it, they let me do what I would normally do in live-action. So I was pleasantly surprised with how it turned out.
Hailee also said that she never really got a proper script, which sounds a lot like Mission in that both stories are written and rewritten on the fly. Does each process feel similar to you?
Yeah, I didn’t even think about it like that. Mission is like nothing I’ve ever done before and will ever do again. I’m sure of it. When I worked with Terry Malick and Christian Bale, there was no script, but it had parameters of what it was going to be. The Mission guys talked about this film for two-and-a-half years along with Erik Jendresen, who helps write with McQ. But you’re right. You don’t have a script either way, but both films, Mission and Spider-Man, let you explore and bring something of your own. They encourage that process, and I think that’s why they’re both so good. They don’t make films like Mission: Impossible anymore, where it’s that practical and every character gets a moment. You actually care about the characters in this big action film, and they just don’t make them anymore like Tom makes them. His love of film just comes through, and you can feel it emanating off of him and McQ.
Lastly, before you were chasing after Ethan Hunt, you were chasing after the Joker. Are you back for more in Joker 2?
I am not back in Joker 2, no. I don’t think things ended well for me in Joker. There was a pummeling going on when they panned off of me.

2023-06-30 21:22:49+00:00,Hayley Atwell’s ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Screen Test Was ‘Two Hours of Stunt Choreography’ So the Team Could ‘See My Natural Abilities’,"Haley Atwell spent two hours in stunt training for her ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" screen test.","Everything is supercharged when it comes to the long-running “Mission: Impossible” franchise, and that extends to the movie’s audition process. In a recent interview with The Telegraph, Hayley Atwell revealed that her screen test for the mysterious role of Grace in the two-part “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning” required a two-hour screen test that was essentially a stunt training course. Some actors screen test with dialogue, but not “Mission: Impossible” actors.
“Who the character has become is a byproduct of the process,” the film’s writer-director Christopher McQuarrie said. “So when we went into the screen test, we’ve not written a character that we’re trying to find someone to fit with. Rather, we’re looking for an actress who we want to work with and we’ll fit the character to her.”’
Atwell’s screen test was with stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood and was made up of “two hours of stunt choreography just to see where my natural abilities lay,” she said.
“We did an unarmed combat sequence and mixed martial arts to see if I was someone who could grapple and trap or someone who was more into high kicks,” Atwell added. “[It’s to] ascertain my natural style.”
Once McQuarrie and Cruise decided Atwell was the perfect actor to bring Grace to life, they went about constructing the character to fit Atwell’s stunt capabilities. She went through an additional five months of stunt training after accepting the role.
“From the physical training we discovered that I was a quick learner through sleight-of-hand tricks and using a prop – so my character is an opportunist who can take an inanimate object and make a weapon out of it, rather than someone who is slick and skilled and formally trained,” Atlwell said about the process. “From that, this inconsistent character emerged: someone who is spontaneous, quite unpredictable, but not calculating.”
Atwell added of her character, “Tom and McQuarrie were interested in finding a different kind of tone for this film than we’d seen before – and a character who had a relationship with Tom that felt more cat and mouse, two people who through circumstances and pressure find themselves in each other’s company but they’re exasperated by each other. So therein will lie the chemistry between them, but also some of the comedic elements in the film.”

Cruise chasing the bad guys, bad guys chasing Cruise, you get it. We spoke with a couple of his castmates about being part of an iconic Tom Cruise running scene, but another big sequence in Dead Reckoning centers on a car chase, in which Cruise and Agent Carter star Hayley Atwell find themselves in the car together.
In a conversation with ComicBook.com's Brandon Davis, Hayley Atwell expressed her admiration for Cruise, and said that she felt like he went out of his way to be good to his co-stars -- that makes sense, we suppose, since at this point he basically lives at the Mission: Impossible franchise, and co-stars are his house guests.
""How did Tom Cruise manage to sit in the passenger seat first of all, handcuffed to someone else who was driving him, drifting him?"" Atwell said. ""That, to me, shows total dedication to his craft. [That's] probably the hardest thing he's ever done in Mission: Impossible. He was so generous, wanting to find moments for Grace that had real levity in the middle of the car chase sequence -- that had real comedy between them, that felt earned, that didn't feel pushed, or didn't feel like it was actually gonna take away from the stakes of it. Watching Tom and [Christopher McQuarrie] design this, this sequence and having me on a racetrack very early in the morning before the sun had come up with [stunt driver] Wade Eastwood in London, making sure that I was drifting competently and weaving in between cones, to make sure that I could obstacle courses, meant that by the time we got out to Rome, we knew what the shape of it was, and we knew that there was always gonna be time to ad lib.""
Atwell added, ""So there was one day where I'm drifting in front of the wedding cake monument in Rome, and there were three cameras attached to the windscreen. So I can't really see where I'm going. Tom is in the passenger seat handcuffed to me. I've, my character's blown all four doors off the car already and we're improvising. So Tom will say something like, 'slow down, slow down.' And I've gotta work out whether Tom is saying to Hayley actually slow down, or whether he's saying it as Ethan to Grace, or whether he wants me as Grace to say that to him. And I remember just at the end just going, this is a lot. But also I was having so much fun, because there's so, you know, he really cares about the people he works with. He wants to make sure that they feel that they're doing their best too.""
""No one in my life actually wants to get into a car with me now. They're like, yeah, we'll take the bus. We're fine. We'll see you there.""
Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which premieres in theaters on July 12th.

Tom was last seen in Christopher MacQuarrie's blockbuster Top Gun: Maverick last year.
Advance booking numbers
As per a report in Pinkvilla, as of 3:30 pm on Friday, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One had already sold approximately 28,000 tickets for the opening day and 62,000 tickets for the first weekend in advance booking in India. The estimated number of tickets sold in the advance booking before the release is likely to be more than 1.10 lakh tickets.
Tom Cruise's biggest opener in India?
As per the same report, the box office collection of the opening day, July 12, is likely to be between ₹12 crore and ₹14 crore. This would make Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One the biggest opener for Tom Cruise in India so far. The last Mission: Impossible film, Fallout, opened to ₹9.50 crore in India in 2018. The new instalment is likely to improve on the same.
Box office competition
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One will enjoy an unrivalled run at the Indian box office for nine days, before Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig's adaptation of Barbie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, will release simultaneously on Friday, July 21. They're likely to eat massively into the share of the Tom Cruise film, given they're all tentpole Hollywood releases.

Apparently, Cruise had charged $12 to $14 million for the next two Mission Impossible instalments. The film promises to be a massive success despite its shooting and release being delayed due to the onset of the coronavirus.The unexpected happened as the pandemic made huge strains on the budget of the film which had to go up by approximately ten times than what was originally planned to a reported $290 million.A case in point was when some of the crew had tested positive for the virus and Cruise personally spent approximately 500,000 pounds for a special private ship to keep the positively tested film crew out of harm’s way and thereby creating a safe bubble for the rest of the teams to work and prevent a breakout.Similar to the financial agreement for Top Gun: Maverick, Tom is reportedly set to earn more profits as bonuses once Mission Impossible 7 performs well at the box office and also more from streaming and digital rights.According to reports, Cruise made more than $100 million from Top Gun: Maverick ticket sales, his pay, and his share of home entertainment rentals and streaming earnings.

As for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 2, a lot of the international locations are done. But, the biggest set piece at the heart of the movie is still left to hammer out. The creative team is already teasing the absolute scale of that one. McQuarrie also mentioned that there are some surprises waiting for fans in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 2. Characters that didn't appear in the first installment, action sequences for the whole team, and much more. Check out what he had to say here.
McQuarrie began, ""We've shot all but one of our international locations. We've shot our big action except for the biggest set piece, the central set piece of the film, which is massive and unlike anything we've done, and, I think, unlike anything you've seen.""
""All the interstitial stuff is shot. There are characters in the movie you don't even know about yet. And I have one—how would I call it? It's a sidebar action sequence involving the team, which we haven't shot yet, and that's first up as soon as we get back,"" he continued. ""It's involving elements that I've never worked with before. It's a big challenge, and it's a tight schedule. The plan to be wrapped for all principal photography is early next year.""
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One Brings the Stunts
It's no secret that these big stunts have become the lifeblood of the Mission: Impossible brand. No one is driving that truck, or in this case motorcycle, harder than Tom Cruise. Comicbook.com's Brandon Davis spoke to McQuarrie about the hair-raising bike stunt in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 1. The push to keep going bigger is keeping the director very busy.
""There's not a chicken, there's not an egg,"" McQuarrie explained. ""Sometimes we start with...like, Fallout started with the emotional story of Ethan and Julia, and the stunts were kind of put around in the periphery. The beginning of this one, I said, 'What do you want to do?' He said, 'I want to ride a motorcycle off a cliff. What do you want to do?' And I said, 'I want to wreck a train. Let's just wreck a train.' Of course, both of us at one point or another would remind the other, 'You know, this was your idea. You wanted to do this.' Tom was very fortunate in one respect becuase he got his stunt out of the way day one. I'm still shooting that train. That just took forever, and it was very, very challenging.""

Working in these big franchises can be a little tough. McQuarrie told Total Film that the realization came through very clear working on Top Gun: Maverick. It seems like people care about these long-established characters more than ever. So, the pressure is there, but the filmmaker feels like the team can meet that expectation.
""I don't take my position for granted. I don't take the audience's participation for granted. When we were making Top Gun: Maverick, I didn't take for granted that people loved that movie or that it was a 35-year-old cultural institution. I looked at it with a very suspicious and cynical eye towards Hollywood's tendency to make it a cash grab,"" McQuarrie said. ""So, everything I do is to constantly check myself and remind myself that it does not matter what you did before, this is the one you're doing now. I'm terrified of the result of Dead Reckoning, which lives in the shadow of Fallout, which lives in the shadow of Rogue [Nation], and Ghost [Protocol], and all the other movies that came before it. I don't want to let the franchise down. I'm more frightened now than I was on my first Mission.""
How Do We Get To Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two?
Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which premieres in theaters on July 12th. It's the beginning of the end for the action-packed franchise, as Cruise reteams with longtime collaborator and filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie for more death-defying and breathtaking stunts. Hunt and allies Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) attempt to track down a new weapon with the power to tear the world apart. Actors Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, and Esai Morales join the cast for the latest installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise, which is set to wrap up with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two.

When is the predicted Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two Paramount Plus streaming release date?
At the time of writing, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two has a theatrical release date of June 28, 2024.

The expected September 2024 Paramount Plus streaming release date for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two is due to Paramount Pictures’ pattern of releasing its theatrical films on its streaming platform 30 to 45 days after its theatrical run. However, if the theatrical release is delayed because of the ongoing writers’ and actors’ strikes then Mission: Impossible fans should also expect a delay in the streaming release.
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two will serve as a direct sequel to Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One and see Ethan Hunt presumably continue dealing with the AI being known as the Entity.
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two stars Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, Henry Czerny, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Vanessa Kirby, and Esai Morales, among many other cast members.
Is Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two coming out on Paramount Plus?
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two will be available to watch via streaming on Paramount Plus.
The reason that Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two will drop on Paramount Plus is because the film’s distribution rights are owned by Paramount Pictures.

2023-06-26 09:00:57+00:00,Christopher McQuarrie Likens Mission: Impossible 7 – Dead Reckoning's AI Bad Guy To The Cold War,Only Tom Cruise can defeat the machines now.,"According to Christopher McQuarrie, ""Dead Reckoning Part One"" will see our boy Ethan doing everything in his power — including riding motorbikes off cliffs, sending trains flying off their tracks, and, most importantly, lots and lots of running — to stop an AI weapon that threatens all of humanity. McQuarrie admitted that he held off on making AI a ""Mission: Impossible"" villain too soon, worrying it would've felt ""too intellectual"" in the past. Cut to the present, and a story about Ethan and his IMF family sticking it to the machines almost hits too close to home. McQuarrie compared our situation to the Cold War, explaining:
""I felt, in the zeitgeist, this anxiety about technology and what and how technology was beginning to influence our lives, and how do we take that anxiety that the audience is bringing to the movie and give them a release? That's really what the movie boils down to. When you go to see 'Top Gun' in 1986, the Cold War was a very real thing. That anxiety was something you were bringing to it, and you enjoyed that movie because that movie was telling you that everything was ultimately gonna be okay. You were showing them a way out.""
While watching Ethan punch a computer in the face, or however he saves the day in ""Dead Reckoning Part One,"" obviously won't help us defeat the existential threat AI poses to so many people's livelihoods, it may provide some much-needed catharsis. That goes double for ""Part Two,"" by the sound of it. ""[...] There are things very prescient in 'Part Two' that, if you think this is trippy, it'll freak you out in 'Part Two,'"" teased McQuarrie.

2023-07-05 13:17:50+00:00,Mission Impossible: Paramount reckoning,"Paramount Global’s predicament is worthy of its successful “Mission: Impossible” franchise. The various parts of the entertainment conglomerate controlled by Shari Redstone are in theory worth far more than its $11 billion market capitalization suggests. Extracting the additional value, however, would be a formidable assignment for even the most highly skilled financial operatives.","NEW YORK, July 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Paramount Global’s (PARA.O) predicament is worthy of its successful “Mission: Impossible” franchise. The various parts of the entertainment conglomerate controlled by Shari Redstone are in theory worth far more than its $11 billion market capitalization suggests. Extracting the additional value, however, would be a formidable assignment for even the most highly skilled financial operatives.
Additional consolidation looms for the media industry, which has plowed billions of dollars into developing TV shows and films for competing online streaming services but struggled to make the money back. Warner Bros Discovery (WBD.O) will be free to explore more acquisitions or a sale next year after it passes a two-year waiting period to retain the tax benefits of Discovery combining with the storied Batman to Looney Tunes empire that was owned by AT&T (T.N). Netflix (NFLX.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) will have important decisions to make, while Walt Disney (DIS.N) and Comcast (CMCSA.O) will probably reimagine their portfolios. Even video-game developers Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO.O) and Electronic Arts (EA.O) might get involved, too.
Compared to those deep-pocketed giants, Paramount is small-time. The cutthroat competition and challenging economics make it more likely that Redstone, who is chairwoman, will have to merge, sell or carve up the empire built by her late father, Sumner.
In the meantime, she secured some blue-chip backing. Over the past year or so, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) has bought and increased its stake in Paramount to about 15%. And BDT & MSD Partners, the advisory and investment firm run by former Goldman Sachs (GS.N) banker Byron Trott, injected $125 million into Redstone’s National Amusements, which owns cinema chains and controls 77% of Paramount’s voting shares. Without the funding, her closely held firm might have needed to pledge more of its Paramount stock against a loan.
In theory, at least, Redstone has working in her favor that Paramount’s parts are worth more than the whole. In addition, the company has a rich, albeit tormented, breakup history.
After its founding in 1912, Paramount embarked on a series of deals that would make it home to Hollywood luminaries including Rudolph Valentino, Mae West and the Marx Brothers, as well as the owner of one of the largest U.S. cinema chains. Trustbusters took issue with the combination, and a landmark 1948 Supreme Court case ultimately forced the company to cleave theaters from the studios.
Nearly two decades later, Paramount would run into serious financial trouble. Just as it does today, however, the company harbored valuable and underappreciated assets, such as real estate and a film library. Industrial conglomerate Gulf and Western bought the business, lumping it in with a sprawling manufacturing enterprise. By the 1980s, the mishmash model fell out of favor with investors and boss Martin Davis largely dismantled the auto-parts-to-zinc operation. It would eventually be rechristened under the Paramount brand to focus on the retained media holdings.
Around the same time, Sumner Redstone took control of Viacom, short for Video and Audio Communications, which had been spun off from national broadcaster CBS. It would develop some of cable’s biggest networks, including Nickelodeon and MTV. In 1994, Viacom bought Paramount for $10 billion and then orchestrated a $36 billion merger with CBS in 1999 to make it the second biggest media company just behind Time Warner. Seven years later, Redstone decided to split it to free the faster-growing cable business from the plodding but profitable broadcast division. It didn’t exactly turn out as planned.
Reunited under the same roof in 2019, the company reverted to the Paramount name with a focus on streaming. The business has accumulated net debt equal to more than 5 times its 2023 estimated EBITDA with estimates gathered by Refinitiv projecting it will not swing to being cash flow positive for another year. Given all those dynamics, it may be time to consider yet another breakup, one that might prove far harder to execute.
Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics
CBS is the most-watched U.S. broadcaster, its 15th consecutive season in the No. 1 slot. The so-called Tiffany Network also carries popular National Football League games, alongside its portfolio of local broadcast stations, national cable networks and a TV studio.
Paramount’s TV assets are expected to generate nearly $5 billion in adjusted EBITDA, according to Refinitiv data. The division’s closest peer, Fox (FOXA.O), trades at 7 times 2024 forecast profit, but it also offloaded entertainment cable networks that were weighing it down. Using a discounted multiple of 5 times for Paramount’s comparable business implies it would be worth about $24 billion.
The movie studio, behind “Top Gun: Maverick,” is highly coveted. Amazon paid $8.5 billion, or 37 times EBITDA, to buy MGM last year. On Paramount’s $200 million of estimated 2024 EBITDA, the film arm would be worth some $7 billion.
Streaming service Paramount+ is similar to Netflix, whose enterprise is worth 5 times next year’s estimated revenue. Paramount’s smaller and unprofitable rival at best would command half that multiple, but it’s safer to figure the operation would have no value if separated from the studios. Book publisher Simon & Schuster is on the block again after the U.S. government blocked a sale to larger competitor Penguin Random House. It’s reasonable to assume another buyer will pay a similar $2 billion for it.
Put it altogether, and it imputes the Paramount enterprise is worth around $33 billion. Back out some $13.5 billion of net debt and its market value would be $20 billion, a more than 80% premium to where it trades today.
One of the stickiest problems would be unlocking television’s full value. Broadcast TV is a steadily declining business. It has limited appeal to digital native companies such as Amazon, while Walt Disney and Comcast are hamstrung by regulation because they already own competing national networks. Overseas suitors for public airwaves also would face close government scrutiny.
Despite Paramount and its predecessor companies having sliced and diced themselves multiple times over the past century, Redstone may be forced to sell it whole at a less desirable price tag. If nothing else, investors have indicated that they think they’re watching another installment of “Mission: Impossible.”

2023-07-10 08:00:26+00:00,Mission: Impossible actor says Dead Reckoning is the biggest action movie of all time,Cary Elwes calls Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One the biggest action movie ever,"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning actor Cary Elwes has high praise for the latest instalment in the long-running action franchise.
""It’s not just probably the biggest action movie of all time, I think it’s also one of the most emotional action movies we’ve ever seen,"" Elwes, who plays Denlinger in Dead Reckoning, tells GamesRadar+ and Total Film.
""That was what blew me away. I was fully just expecting amazing stunts and cool locations, but the emotional journey the audience is going on is, for me, what sends it into a whole other stratosphere.""
Simon Pegg, who plays Benji in the series, agrees that Mission: Impossible’s scope and scale keeps getting bigger and bigger.
""It did feel different,"" Pegg says. ""Not just because we were making it when we made it, but you know Tom [Cruise] and [director Christopher McQuarrie] are never going to rest on what they’ve done before. They’re going to push it forward. Every film, when it ends, we get asked 'What’s next?' and we think, 'Well, what could we possibly do?'""
Despite the ""enormity"" of the movie, Elwes – who has appeared in everything from The Princess Bride to Stranger Things – was struck by how nonplussed director Christopher McQuarrie was by the globetrotting production.
""There was never a bead of sweat on his head, not once,"" Elwes reveals. ""We had to deal with all kinds of things then – COVID, all kinds of logistical things – that a huge production of this nature entails. The guy never broke a sweat. He was totally, totally chill the whole time. So he set the tone on-set and so everyone felt [like] this is great, this is just a fun day at work.""

""Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part 1"" -- ★ ★ ★
In his seventh impossible mission on the silver screen, Tom Cruise saves Hollywood (again), saves the world (again, maybe) and continues to save his career (again and again).
Still basking in the jet fumes of his massive hit sequel ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" Cruise returns as constantly running IMF Agent Ethan Hunt in ""Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part 1,"" a globe-trotting thriller loaded with the spectacular and innovative action set pieces that eluded ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.""

Both ""Dial"" and ""Dead"" cover familiar genre turf with obligatory motorcycle chases, car races, ridiculous gunfights and tough guys going mano-a-mano atop of yet another cliched speeding train. But here, the expected disaster sequence pulls off one of the movies' greatest nail-biters of all-time, an intricate, elaborately detailed succession of death-defying stunts executed with such precision and tension that viewers might pass out from forgetting to breathe.
That 61-year-old Cruise continues to perform as many of his own stunts as possible (or allowable) anchors the flimsy verisimilitude of these outlandish events. (Well, maybe not the ludicrous idea that IMF agents can convincingly pass themselves off as other people simply by wearing computer-generated masks that magically give them the exact same bodies, vocal qualities and gestures of their targets.)
In the story, two high-tech combination keys disappear from a Russian submarine that has been attacked and turned into a mass crypt on the ocean floor.
Gabriel (Esai Morales), left, goes mano-a-mano with IMF Agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) on top of a speeding train in one of the few cliched moments in ""Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning, Part 1."" - Courtesy of Paramount Pictures
The search is on to find the keys so humankind can be saved from a timely, high-tech boogeyman: a rogue form of artificial intelligence called ""the Entity."" This Entity can access information contained in the world's computer banks. It can manipulate financial markets, military defense systems, private mail, the news media!
In case audiences can't understand the stakes, a high-ranking official exclaims, ""Whoever controls the Entity, controls the truth!""
With reams of self-consciously contrived, bluntly expository dialogue like this, director Christopher McQuarrie and co-writer Erik Jendresen clearly are not focused on winning the Best Screenplay Oscar.
Instead, their perfunctory words in a convoluted plot connect a series of highly energized, crowd-pleasing cinematic constructs not dependent on internal logic or plausibility. ""Fallout,"" the 2018 ""Mission: Impossible"" entry (also directed by McQuarrie) features a much stronger balance of drama and thrills. But no one will complain here.
The ever-cool Esai Morales plays Gabriel, a smooth terrorist and supposed old acquaintance bent on finding those keys before Hunt and his techie assistants (Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn and Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell) do.

Series newcomer Hayley Atwell plays Grace, a British thief so good that Ethan tries to recruit her for his IMF boss Kittridge (Henry Czerny, returning from the first ""Mission"" movie).
Hunt needs all the help he can muster to deal with a shrewd, merciless killer named Paris (Pom Klementieff) -- the same name used by Leonard Nimoy in the CBS TV series ""Mission: Impossible"" from the 1960s.
Lalo Schifrin's iconic TV theme periodically surfaces in Scottish composer Lorne Balfe's percussive score, dressing up a movie so visually incendiary that you leave the theater wondering ""How can Cruise and McQuarrie possibly top this?""
We will find out in June 2024 with ""Dead Reckoning Part 2.""

McQuarrie did an interview in the new issue of Total Film magazine where he relayed the story. He said, ""Edgar came to one of the later screenings [of the film], and asked one simple question about a specific sound–kind of an audio cue–and I thought I’d addressed that note. It was so obvious to me. But it wasn’t obvious to Edgar. And when I asked the audience, it wasn’t obvious to them either. Nobody thought to bring it up until Edgar did. And that changed the entire movie. It changed the entire movie for the better. You just need honesty and clarity and awareness. No one person, Tom [Cruise] included, can really sit there, and look at the movie 24 hours a day, objectively. Tom and I will just look one another in the eye, and say, 'Do we want to change this? Or is this what we prefer?'""
I think this speaks to the confidence McQuarrie has as a filmmaker. He's not afraid to take notes and to tirelessly work to make things better. I think the lesson that we all should get from this is to open ourselves up to that kind of commentary.
In addition, it speaks to the power of a direct note. Wright didn't just say, ""I don't get it."" Instead, he offered a specific instance of what he thought needed to change that helped propel the work.
Let me know what you think in the comments.

2023-07-14 08:36:34-04:00,Four Pitches to Tom Cruise for the Next ‘Mission: Impossible’ Sequels,"I know we have to get through ‘Dead Reckoning Part Two’ first, Tom, but after that, I’ve got some ideas for you","Dear Mr. Cruise,
I wish that we were able to meet in person, but since you’re embarking on a global tour to educate the world about the atrocities of motion smoothing, I understand you’ve got a busy schedule. Being one of cinema’s most high-profile ambassadors is a serious undertaking, so I’ll get straight to the point. It’s a precarious time to be a movie star: IP continues to reign supreme throughout Hollywood, and actors are no longer a blockbuster’s biggest selling point. But for you, Tom—can I call you Tom, or will I be on the receiving end of an infamous Les Grossman tirade?—this myopic era of moviemaking has done little to dim your star wattage. (We can all pretend the reboot of The Mummy never happened; Universal certainly has.) In fact, I’d argue that you’re not deferring to the great IP machine; instead, these franchises are bending to your will as the world’s foremost adrenaline junkie.
Nostalgia for the original Top Gun was surely a factor in Top Gun: Maverick becoming the second-highest-grossing theatrical release of 2022. But I truly believe the most important element to the film’s success, Tom, is that people wanted to see you and your costars fly actual fighter jets. All the stunning CGI in the world is no match for the very real sight of a man’s face contorting from G-force pressure in a cockpit. A similar philosophy applies to the Mission: Impossible franchise, which has evolved from an auteur’s playground (Brian De Palma, John Woo) into a profitable enterprise built on finding new ways to risk your life for the public’s entertainment.
In the previous three Mission: Impossible films alone, Tom, you’ve shot an underwater sequence that required holding your breath for several minutes at a time; hung off the side of an airborne plane and the Burj Khalifa; driven a motorcycle through the streets of Paris without a helmet; broken your ankle while jumping from one building to another; executed over 100 HALO jumps; and learned how to fly a helicopter in six weeks by training for 16 hours a day. This is, respectfully, completely unhinged, but I admire your dedication to the craft. Somehow, you’ve managed to one-up yourself with the franchise’s latest entry, Mission: Impossible–Dead Reckoning Part One, by driving a dirtbike straight off a cliff before performing a base jump. Paramount has called this sequence the biggest stunt in cinema history, and it really isn’t hyperbole.
Part of me shudders to think what you and director Christopher McQuarrie have cooked up for Dead Reckoning Part Two, and whether you’ll survive the ordeal. But then I remember what it’s like to experience these death-defying moments in a packed theater, and how big-budget Hollywood productions keep abandoning this type of practical stuntwork in favor of visual effects. (It’s also probably not a coincidence that the main antagonist of Dead Reckoning is an algorithm.) Clearly, the risks are worth the rewards, and not just because Dead Reckoning slaps. No less an authority than Steven Spielberg has said that you saved the theatrical industry after the pandemic—your commitment to cinema’s well-being is so unwavering that you even tried to trick moviegoers into believing The Flash was good. (No worries, we all make mistakes.) All of which is to say: I love what the Mission: Impossible films have become, and I want to help you keep the good—and extremely dangerous—times rolling.
While there’s been some rumblings that Dead Reckoning Part Two will be your last turn as Ethan Hunt, I believe there’s still some meat on the franchise’s bones. Or, more accurately: I think there’s more stunts you can pull off in these movies that will test the limits of human achievement. We can get down to the nitty-gritty of my consulting fees later, but for now, allow me to break down four additional Mission: Impossible sequels, and what they will mean for you as a performer.
Mission: Impossible–Cosmic Retribution
The premise: A shadowy organization known as the Andromeda Collective is planning to destroy every satellite in orbit to bring about a new world order. The Impossible Mission Force (IMF) have concluded that the Collective has at least one astronaut in a prominent space program working as a double agent, and that the plan will be initiated somewhere aboard the International Space Station. Ethan’s mission, should he choose to accept it, is to travel to the ISS and prevent the Collective from executing the attack.
The execution: Tom, I know you were already planning to shoot a movie in outer space with Doug Liman, but given the lack of meaningful updates on the project, I get the impression that it’s a cool idea still waiting for a good story. So why not head to space as Ethan Hunt? In collaboration with NASA and the ISS, we will shoot scenes both within the station and on spacewalks. (There will also be footage of your launch incorporated into the film.) The movie’s centerpiece will be a fight scene in space against a beloved, all-American astronaut, who’s revealed to be the Andromeda Collective’s leader. (In a nod to First Man, we would eye Ryan Gosling for the role, though he will have a stunt double for the space scenes because no other actor is willing to sign off on actually going to space.) Your characters will be duking it out with the ISS looming in the background—we will take extra precautions with several harnesses that will be edited out in post so you don’t detach and float into the cosmos for all eternity—until Ethan manages to crack his adversary’s helmet and the depressurization kills him instantly. With only a handful of satellites destroyed by the Collective, Ethan is hailed as a hero back on Earth.
The budget: $400 million. Getting to space is expensive, but I’m sure that you of all people can convince Paramount that this will be a good investment.
Mission: Impossible–Continental Drift
The premise: Inspired by the Apostles and their apocalyptic ethos from Mission: Impossible–Fallout—“There cannot be peace without first a great suffering”—an anarchist group known as the Subnauticals plans to detonate several bombs throughout the world’s oceans. If the Subnauticals succeed, massive tsunamis will wipe out coastal communities and lead to catastrophic loss of life. Ethan’s mission, should he choose to accept it, is to stop the Subnauticals before biblical flooding upends the planet.
The execution: While some of the underwater sequences will be shot in giant tanks at the Paramount studio lot, we plan to execute a deep dive in the ocean for the film’s climactic setpiece, during which Ethan defuses one of the bombs off the coast of Italy. The real headline, Tom, is that you will complete the deepest dive ever recorded on film—whether you also want to break the record for the world’s deepest scuba dive at a depth of more than 1,000 feet is up to you and the level of risk you’re willing to take on. I honestly don’t know what to expect since you took a photo atop the Burj Khalifa without any safety equipment, but whatever you decide: please take the bends seriously. In a tussle with the leader of the Subnauticals, played by Jason Momoa, Ethan manages to attach an anchor to his foot and push it over the edge of a massive trench, plunging the villain into a watery abyss. Full disclosure: The original script incorporated a submersible to reach even greater depths on the ocean floor, but that has been scrapped for, uh, obvious safety concerns.
The budget: $275 million. The movie has the potential to go significantly over budget if there are production complications during the ocean sequences (see: Waterworld).
Mission: Impossible–Natural Order
The premise: Horrified by the profoundly detrimental effects of climate change, an ecoterrorist cell calling themselves the Guardians of Gaia have stolen a deadly airborne contagion from a top secret research facility and plan to release it in cities across the globe. The mortality rate from the virus would lead to hundreds of millions of deaths, decimating all major economies and industries. As a result, the animal kingdom will once again have dominion over the natural world. Ethan’s mission, should he choose to accept it, is to locate the whereabouts of the stolen contagion and bring the Guardians of Gaia to justice.
The execution: I’m not going to lie to you, Tom, this is where things get a little zany. Because the Guardians of Gaia are all about protecting Mother Nature, they don’t just carry normal weapons: the group’s members have a plethora of animals trained for combat. That means you’re going to be tussling with some real beasts, including, in the current iteration of the script, a lion and a bear. Of course, we’ll have the world’s top animal trainers on site to ensure the utmost safety during these scenes, but we’ve been warned that animals are, by their very nature, unpredictable. (Who knew?) Thankfully, the animal fights will take place in a wintry climate—we’re still doing location scouting for a good Siberia stand-in—so you’ll have plenty of padding beneath a puffy jacket to prevent injury. Now I know you’re probably thinking: there are so many ways this could go wrong, and one bite from a lion or bear could kill me. And it’s true! But consider that Leonardo DiCaprio won a damn Oscar for wrestling with a bear, and that bear was merely CGI! Imagine how Academy voters will react when Ethan Hunt is rolling around on the ground with an actual bear. If a Best Stunts Oscar hasn’t been implemented by then, the Academy will have no choice but to create the category in your honor—awarding you with a long overdue statuette for decades of high-octane moviemaking.
But wait, Tom, there’s more: Ethan’s globe-trotting mission ultimately leads him to Pamplona, Spain, where the Guardians of Gaia have set up a trap for our beloved hero. You see, the events of the movie’s climax will coincide with the city’s annual Running of the Bulls, and rather than going to the trouble of recreating the event, you’ll participate in the real thing. This will allow us to give the audiences what they really crave from the Mission: Impossible franchise: the iconic Tom Cruise run, only this time, you’re being chased by a herd of pissed-off bulls. While there have been 16 recorded deaths related to Pamplona’s Running of the Bulls—mostly from participants being gored—it’s a relatively low-risk activity by your standards, Tom, and will probably feel like a walk in the park after fighting a lion and a bear. In an ironic twist, the leader of the Guardians of Gaia, played by James Cromwell, is impaled by one of the rampaging bulls before the contagion can be released.
Budget: $125 million. Turns out, using real animals is way cheaper than CGI.
Mission: Impossible–Redpoint Break
The premise: A group of extreme sports enthusiasts have committed a string of successful robberies at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York City and several United States mint facilities across the nation before blowing them up. The anonymous members of the team have been dubbed the Founding Fathers on account of the rubber masks they wear in the likeness of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and other American revolutionaries. If the Founding Fathers aren’t apprehended, the U.S. government will no longer be able to produce new currency, and the economy will enter a death spiral. Ethan’s mission, should he choose to accept it, is to infiltrate the Founding Fathers and put an end to their adrenaline-fueled crime spree.
The execution: Let me start by addressing the elephant in the room, Tom. (Not a literal elephant; you don’t have to fight any more animals.) Yes, this is essentially the plot of Point Break, but you know what? Point Break is a perfect movie, and imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. If we run into any legal complications from all the similarities between the projects, I’m sure your friends at the Church of Scientology have some great lawyers on retainer. Besides, Point Break came out over 30 years ago; I doubt many people will notice.
Anyway, we want Keanu Reeves to play the leader of the Founding Fathers, who brings Ethan into the group’s inner circle after Ethan proves his worth as a big wave surfer. Since the Mission: Impossible franchise is all about authenticity, Tom, you’ll be surfing at Praia do Norte in Nazaré, Portugal, which is home to some of the biggest waves in the world. In a normal Mission: Impossible film, catching record-breaking waves would be the definitive stunt, but we’re not done yet. In an homage to the opening credits sequence of Mission: Impossible 2, the movie’s climax will take place in a remote mountain range that happens to be the Founding Fathers’ base of operations. Ethan will have less than an hour to reach the top of a giant cliff and prevent the Founding Fathers from detonating bombs planted at every government building in Washington, D.C. The rock climbing in Mission: Impossible 2 may have been the real deal, Tom, but I’m guessing you were upset that the studio made you wear a safety cable. I would never do that to you—instead, you’ll be free soloing the entire cliff in one continuous take. Take as many months as you need to prepare; Alex Honnold has already agreed to help you train for the scene. After stopping the Founding Fathers from destroying the nation’s capital, Ethan has a chance to shoot the group’s leader but, after forming a spiritual bond with his adversary over the course of the film, empties his magazine into the sky in frustration.
The budget: $300 million. Paramount is threatening me with legal action in the event that you fall to your death, but I believe in you.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpbmdlci5jb20vMjAyMy83LzE0LzIzNzk0MTE2L21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1zZXF1ZWxzLXRvbS1jcnVpc2UtcGl0Y2hlc9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpbmdlci5jb20vcGxhdGZvcm0vYW1wLzIwMjMvNy8xNC8yMzc5NDExNi9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctc2VxdWVscy10b20tY3J1aXNlLXBpdGNoZXM?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One is already in theaters, and it was released to some of the best reactions of the year for a blockbuster movie. Not only is Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One one of the best-reviewed films of the year, it's actually the highest-rated Tom Cruise film of all time, and that's saying a lot for one of the last movie stars. The film seems to have it all going for it. Stunts, action, and a hell of a plot But one of the things it doesn't have is Angela Bassett. According to a new interview with Variety, director Christopher McQuarrie revealed what Bassett's role could have been in Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One and even teased her return in Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part Two.
""It was interesting,"" McQuarrie said in a recent interview with the trade. ""She was going to be the head of the CIA. She would have been in that room with all the other heads of the intelligence community and, uh, we're not done with Angela Bassett. Angela is too fabulous. You could never ever let Angela get away. There's always a plan in the future.""
What happens in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One?
Tom Cruise is back as the iconic action hero Ethan Hunt in the seventh installment, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which is set to make its way into theaters next week. It's the beginning of the end for the action-packed franchise, as Cruise reteams with longtime collaborator and director Christopher McQuarrie for more death-defying and breathtaking stunts. Hunt and allies Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) attempt to track down a new weapon with the power to tear the world apart. Actors Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, and Esai Morales join the cast for the latest installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise, which is set to wrap up with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two.

2023-07-13 12:00:00+00:00,"Hayley Atwell, Tom Cruise’s new ‘Mission: Impossible’ co-star, addresses romance rumours",'Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One' arrives in theatres July 12.,"Hayley Atwell, who stars in the upcoming Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, is speaking out about rumours of a secret romance with Tom Cruise.
The British actress, who’s engaged to music producer Ned Wolfgang Kelly, described the gossip during the filming of the seventh instalment of the action franchise as “upsetting”.
“I would be like, ‘Ooh, there’s some weird rumours, and it feels base, it feels a little dirty, it feels grubby, it’s not what I’m about,’” she told The Independent.
“Why are things being assumed or projected onto me about my relationship with my work colleague and boss?”
Atwell, 41, particularly took umbrage to the scuttlebutt because she viewed Cruise – who is 61 – and director Chris McQuarrie (aka McQ) as “uncle figures.”
The speculation, she added, has an impact on people in her “personal life, who are subject to being on the receiving end of that. It becomes invasive.”
Atwell confessed she sought counsel from the iconic superstar, who has been a magnet for rumours throughout most of his career.
The Risky Business actor offered some sage advice, she said.
“When I’ve talked to him about it, he’d be like, ‘You know exactly who you are. You know what you’re about. And that is the only thing that matters. It doesn’t matter what people think of you, if you are in integrity with yourself, if you know what your value system is,’” Atwell said.
For the seventh M.I. Atwell portrays a master thief and possible romantic partner for IMF agent Ethan Hunt, played by Cruise since 1996.
The Golden Globe Award nominee previously starred as Peggy Carter in six Marvel movies, and the TV series centring around her character Agent Carter.

This new movie includes two veteran actors looking to take down Cruise's character. PopCulture.com spoke exclusively to Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis who talked about the experience of working with Cruise on Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.
""I've been extraordinarily fortunate with some big people, big stars. I was so taken,"" Whigham exclusively told PopCulture. ""I could sit here and say incredible, amazing, the greatest action. What people don't realize is how kind and how generous he is as a scene partner and as a boss. He's a producer, so you're always aware. I saw the way that he treated [Davis] coming off of Top Gun and I can't tell you how much I admire it and how much I loved being, as we say, on the floor with him and trying to figure out scenes. I have a love for him and [director Christopher McQuarrie], can't even express.""
Davis has experience working with Crusie before Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One as he starred in the hit film Top Gun: Maverick last year. When talking about Cruise, Davis said: ""It's about being competent in what you're doing and the work that you're doing, being able to understand all of the workings of what's going on on set and behind the camera, not just your lines, but understanding everyone's jobs so that you can better help them facilitate their jobs by doing well at yours.""
In the seventh Mission: Impossible film, Whigham and Davis play the characters Briggs and Degas who are asked the responsibility of tracking down and detaining Ethan Hunt (Cruise). And with the way Ethan gets out of trouble, Briggs and Degas have a big challenge on their hands.
""Degas is an interesting individual who, I wouldn't say just joined, but he's entered the Clandestine Services and he's making his way up the ranks,"" Davis said about his character. ""He's been tasked with teaming up with Briggs, Shea's character, and chasing after Ethan Hunt. So it comes down to this new guy. I guess it's like the old way versus the new way and trying to understand how to blend it or if it should be blended at all.""
""You're always trying to find your way, where do you fit in a film,"" Whigham added. ""Especially something like this because Tom's name comes above Mission Impossible, so you know he is the biggest star in the world, man. We, too, wanted to service the story, make sure. These guys follow a story and they let these two guys who could be just somewhat banal and uninteresting become interesting as it unfolded and they allowed us to do that. It didn't happen very often.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vcG9wY3VsdHVyZS5jb20vbW92aWVzL25ld3MvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLXBhcnQtb25lLXN0YXJzLXRhbGstd29ya2luZy13aXRoLXRvbS1jcnVpc2UtZXhjbHVzaXZlL9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vcG9wY3VsdHVyZS5jb20vbW92aWVzL2FtcC9uZXdzL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1wYXJ0LW9uZS1zdGFycy10YWxrLXdvcmtpbmctd2l0aC10b20tY3J1aXNlLWV4Y2x1c2l2ZS8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-11 16:19:52+00:00,‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One’ Review: Still Running,"In this franchise’s seventh entry, Tom Cruise’s mission includes increasingly improbable leaps, chases and stunts. Luckily for us, he chooses to accept it.","I don’t know if anyone has ever clocked whether Tom Cruise is faster than a speeding bullet. The guy has legs, and guts. His sprints into the near-void have defined and sustained his stardom, becoming his singular superpower. He racks up more miles in “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” the seventh entry in a 27-year-old franchise that repeatedly affirms a movie truism. That is, there are few sights more cinematic than a human being outracing danger and even death onscreen — it’s the ultimate wish fulfillment!
Much remains the same in this latest adventure, including the series’ reliable entertainment quotient and Cruise’s stamina. Once again, he plays Ethan Hunt, the leader of a hush-hush American spy agency, the Impossible Mission Force. Alongside a rotating roster of beautiful kick-ass women (most recently Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby) and loyal handymen (Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames), Ethan has been sprinting, flying, diving and speed-racing across the globe while battling enemy agents, rogue operatives, garden-variety terrorists and armies of minions. Along the way, he has regularly delivered a number of stomach-churning wows, like jumping out a window and climbing the world’s tallest building.
This time, the villain is the very au courant artificial intelligence, here called the Entity. The whole thing is complicated, as these stories tend to be, with stakes as catastrophic as recent news headlines have trumpeted. Or, as an open letter signed by 350 A.I. authorities put it last month: “Mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I. should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks, such as pandemics and nuclear war.” In the face of such calamity, who you gonna call? Analog Man, that’s who, a.k.a. Mr. Hunt, who receives his usual mysterious directives that, this time, have been recorded on a cassette tape, an amusing touch for a movie about the threat poised to the material world by a godlike digital power.
That’s all fine and good, even if the most memorable villain proves to be a Harley Quinn-esque agent of chaos, Paris (Pom Klementieff), who races after Ethan in a Hummer and seems ready to spin off into her own franchise. She tries flattening him during a seamlessly choreographed chase sequence in Rome — the stunt coordinator, Wade Eastwood, is also a racecar driver — that mixes excellent wheel skills with scares, laughs, thoughtful geometry and precision timing. At one point, Ethan ends up behind the wheel while handcuffed to a new love interest, Grace (Hayley Atwell, another welcome addition), driving and drifting, flirting and burning rubber in what is effectively the action-movie equivalent of a sex scene.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTEvbW92aWVzL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1wYXJ0LW9uZS1yZXZpZXcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-14 10:00:00+00:00,The Extravagant Treats of “Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One”,"Anthony Lane reviews “Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One,” starring Tom Cruise, Rebecca Ferguson, and Ving Rhames.","Like the beat, beat, beat of the tomtom, a pounding of the drums tells us that another installment of “Mission: Impossible” is under way. Most of us know the trills and thrills of Lalo Schifrin’s original score, which remains the most exciting theme tune ever composed for TV. (Paddling furiously in its wake is that of “Hawaii Five-O.”) For the ensuing movie franchise, the tune has been repeatedly stretched and tweaked—or, in the case of the second film, lacerated by Limp Bizkit. Now, as the seventh chapter of the saga begins, we hear no melody at all: nothing but the rhythm, thudding forth. But it’s enough. We brace ourselves, and adopt the Mission position. Here we go.
The new movie, which is directed by Christopher McQuarrie, runs for two hours and forty-three minutes, and its full title is “Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One,” which takes about half an hour to say. If Part Two, which is due to be released next June, is of similar dimensions, we’ll be landed with a tale that is more than five hours in the telling. Concision junkies will have to look elsewhere. The first sign of swelling, in this latest adventure, comes with a gathering of U.S. intelligence personnel, which goes on and on. It’s eventually halted by a guy who throws smoke bombs around, unleashing clouds of pretty green gas—a mild surprise to those present, who were presumably expecting coffee and a selection of pastries, but by this stage any interruption is welcome.
The topic of the meeting is the Entity, which is discussed at such length, and in tones of such grandiloquent awe, that I understood it even less at the end than I did at the start. In the world of “Mission: Impossible,” villainy gets bigger and more abstract by the movie. In “Rogue Nation” (2015), we had the Syndicate. In “Fallout” (2018), we had the Apostles. Now we get the Entity. (What next? The Intimation? The Word in Your Ear?) It seems to be a species of A.I.—“an enemy that is everywhere and nowhere,” we hear, with “a mind of its own.” Access to it is granted by a cruciform key, in two sections; collect the pair, slot ’em together, and the Entity lies within your grasp. Any government or terrorist outfit possessing it will wield unquenchable power, and the one person who can stop it from slipping into evil hands is, of course, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), Frodo Baggins having taken early retirement.
Ethan assembles his usual gang, consisting of Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), who has been on call since the first “Mission: Impossible” (1996), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg). Also in the mix is Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who made her début in “Rogue Nation.” To my eyes, it was with the arrival of Ferguson that the franchise truly took flight; her manner was tranquil even at the height of tension, her character’s fealty was elusive, and she was splendidly unimpressed by the hero. That impressed him. Make no mistake, Cruise is in control of these movies—“A Tom Cruise Production,” the opening credits of “Dead Reckoning” announce—but he has the wit to realize how dreary that dominance would become if Ethan were not, at regular intervals, unmanned by women.
Hence the amazing Grace (Hayley Atwell). She is a thief, whom Ethan bumps into at the Abu Dhabi airport. The thing about bumping into Grace is that, post-bump, you will find yourself bereft of valuables, for her fingers are feather-light. Although she has a sheaf of passports, like Jason Bourne, she is new to mayhem, never mind to brutality, and Atwell does a lovely job of suggesting that Grace’s natural state is one of criminal innocence—wide-eyed yet without a flake of ditziness, and far too schooled in common sense to be a femme fatale. Observe how she pauses, with a frown of uncertainty, before putting on one of those rubber masks which more seasoned habitués of “Mission: Impossible,” when switching identities, don and doff like gloves. Ever practical, she ties her hair back before clambering onto the outside of a speeding train, and, as she and Ethan are harried through Roman streets by multiple vehicles, exclaims, “Is there anyone not chasing us?” An excellent question. The chase concludes with a merry plea. “Don’t hate me,” she says, leaving Ethan bewitched, bothered, and be-handcuffed to a steering wheel. Nice.
The cuffs are a Hitchcockian clue, and the whole movie is clamorous with echoes of earlier works. (“Dead Reckoning” was a Humphrey Bogart thriller from 1947—tangled, surly, and steeped in postwar bitterness.) On the trusty comic principle that huge blockbusters deserve dinky modes of transport, Ethan and Grace scoot through Rome in a Fiat 500, the color of ripe lemons, recalling Roger Moore’s Citroën 2CV in “For Your Eyes Only” (1981), or, indeed, the tuk-tuk driven to exhaustion by Harrison Ford in the latest “Indiana Jones.” The climax of McQuarrie’s film, set on and atop a train, alludes with pride to the first “Mission: Impossible” and winds up saluting “The General” (1926), Buster Keaton’s runaway masterpiece, as a locomotive takes a deep dive through a broken bridge.
Cruise has none of Keaton’s dreamy stoicism, but both actors, trim and compact, define themselves by the outsized magnificence of their stunts. In addition, each of them is most at ease when in haste. They run unstoppably yet with an oddly formal poise—torso held upright, like that of a waiter with a tray, above the pumping pistons of their legs. Watch Keaton sprint along the crest of a hill, a century ago, in the finale of “Seven Chances,” or Cruise in full flow on the roof of an airport, in “Dead Reckoning.” Relentlessness of this order ought to be chilling. Not so. Instead, we are stirred and amused by a preternatural sight: men as little machines.
There is a devout podcast, “Light the Fuse,” which peruses “Mission: Impossible” in all its incarnations. Should you wish to hear an interview—nay, a two-part interview—with a former marketing intern on the third film, here is your opportunity. As the podcast approaches its two-hundred-and-fortieth episode, one has to ask: why do these movies continue to suck us in? Perhaps because they are as fetishistic as their fans. Precision is everything. I have lost count of the objects, friendly and hostile, that click, lock, or shunt into place. The bass flute that turned into an assassin’s rifle, in “Rogue Nation,” somehow stood for the cunningly wrought design of the entire narrative. Likewise, on a larger scale, the main attraction of “Dead Reckoning” is a motorbike-and-parachute leap that was previewed, unpacked, and explained online, many months ago, the purpose being to demonstrate that Cruise, the nerveless and unfading star, had performed the maneuver himself. Here is a motion picture equipped with auto-spoilers, eager to stress that at the heart of its fantasy lies something risky and real.
It was after “Rogue Nation” that I searched my conscience and discovered, as I sorted through the rubble, that I was looking forward with greater gusto to the next helping of “Mission: Impossible” than I was to the upcoming James Bond. For somebody reared on 007, this was tantamount to apostasy. I felt like a mid-Victorian Protestant admitting, in shame and confusion, to the lure of the Catholic faith. The change of allegiance was merely hardened by “No Time to Die,” the most recent Bond flick, in 2021, which foundered in an agony of self-involvement. Who wants a hero who expires under the sheer weight of backstory? Where’s the fun in that?
By contrast, retrospection has played a blessedly small part in the emotional legend of Ethan Hunt. We gaze back, in remembrance of stunts past—“Oh, my God, that bit in the fourth one where he climbed a skyscraper with magnetic suckers on his mitts,” and so on. Ethan’s own impulse, though, is forever onward, and to complain that his character lacks depth is to misinterpret the laws of dramatic physics. He is mass times velocity plus grin. If he has a history, it tends to self-destruct from film to film; which of us honestly remembers, let alone cares, that he got married in “Mission: Impossible III” (2006)? Does he remember? That’s why the plot of “Dead Reckoning” is a cause for concern—not because of the metaphysical fluff (“Whoever controls the Entity controls the truth”) but because of Gabriel (Esai Morales), a smooth devil who craves the cruciform key. Thirty years ago, apparently, he crossed paths with Ethan, who declares, “In a very real sense, he made me who I am today.” I don’t like the sound of that. Let us pray that Part Two will not require Ethan to follow the example of poor 007, forsaking crazy capers to lick his psychological wounds.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtlci5jb20vbWFnYXppbmUvMjAyMy8wNy8yNC9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctcGFydC1vbmUtbW92aWUtcmV2aWV30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-08 13:30:00+00:00,Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is the mother of all self-aware AI panic flicks,Paramount’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One — in theaters July 12th — can’t stop getting in its own way with an overabundance of meta-humor.,"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One being waylaid for years by a global pandemic only to ultimately hit theaters at a time when the public’s becoming more attuned to the spread of AI tools does a lot to make the film feel eerily prescient — not about the state of the technology itself but the degree to which it’s on people’s minds. In his latest outing as Ethan Hunt, Tom Cruise delivers exactly the kind of seasoned, charismatic, and more-than-put-upon performance necessary to sell the seventh installment of an action franchise about an aging super spy whose longtime team of allies are all getting on in years.
But for all of Cruise’s pitch-perfectness as a stunt-oriented action hero and director Christopher McQuarrie having a keen eye for crafting spectacular action set pieces that genuinely feel like they’d be impossible to survive, Dead Reckoning Part One can’t stop getting in its own way with an overreliance on self-referential jokes, and pre-chewed cliches.
Set some time after the events of Mission: Impossible – Fallout, Dead Reckoning Part One tells the winding and often rather circuitous story of how Impossible Mission Force operative Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his team of fellow agents are tasked with saving the world from a sentient, Machiavellian artificial intelligence that has the power to set off the next series of global wars. Throughout the film, no one seems to fully understand just what “The Entity” — Dead Reckoning’s deeply unimaginative name for its amorphous, faceless, mostly-digital antagonist — is or what it was originally meant to be used for. But after a mysterious accident unleashes the program into the wild along with the two halves of a physical key necessary to control or destroy it, a covert international arms race is set off with multiple world powers — including the US — vying to get their hands on it in hopes of shaping the future in their favor.

The Mission: Impossible movies have always prioritized suspense, intrigue, and action ahead of telling stories that make all that much sense. But Dead Reckoning spends so much time trying (and often failing) to clearly explain things — like what the Entity is and how it’s unlike anything Ethan, Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) have ever encountered before — that the movie frequently feels firmly grounded in parody territory.
Aside from Cruise, who delivers a surprisingly restrained, contemplative performance as Hunt — who never says anything about feeling like a 59-year-old man being portrayed by a 62-year-old but still feels appropriately aged — virtually everyone else in the film feels curiously stuck in a higher, more excited gear of action movie acting that tends to feel hollow. This becomes especially apparent in the movie’s many dramatically shot exposition dump sequences, where the over-the-shoulder glances are so sharply choreographed and executed that it’s easy to imagine the actors practicing them while listening to the most melodramatic music possible.
But while there are plenty of instances in which the vibe skews a little off, there are also a handful of moments built around new characters like Hayley Atwell’s Grace and Pom Klementieff that stand out because of how well the actors are able to compliment rather than approximate, Cruise’s energy. Throughout the film, it’s clear that while Paramount might have longer-term plans for the larger Mission: Impossible franchise, Ethan Hunt won’t always be the centerpiece, and one of the more impressive things about Dead Reckoning is how well it’s able to telegraph that a changing of the guard is on its way without feeling like an overwrought goodbye to Cruise.

What’s most impressive, of course, are the movie’s action sequences — or at least, they would be were it not for the way that Dead Reckoning’s ad campaign has prominently featured (and kind of spoiled) many the more inspired set pieces that take Ethan and co. around the globe. In the same way that Dead Reckoning’s delay wound up making its AI focus feel in sync with the current news cycle, the film premiering just a couple weeks after Fast X — which also featured a cartoonish car chase through a cramped Italian city — creates an unfortunate sense of deja vu that’s amplified by its many, many nostalgia plays.
For all the groundwork it’s laying for the franchise’s future, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (probably correctly) assumes that it can play to its core audience by rehashing beats from previous films and jazzing them up with a heavy pour of meta humor meant to make you feel in on the joke of it all. But while that approach might work for folks who’ve been faithfully following Ethan Hunt’s adventures for the past 27 years, it could be a tough sell for newcomers — especially considering that this is just half of the story that next year’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two is meant to finish.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzcvOC8yMzc4NzQyNi9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctcmV2aWV30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-09 07:00:38+00:00,Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One review – Tom Cruise is still taking our breath away,"With star turns from Vanessa Kirby and Hayley Atwell, plus a zeitgeisty AI plot, this seventh MI outing is one of the most exhilarating yet","MI goes AI in this seventh outing for the TV-series-turned-action-cinema-franchise, a genuinely breathtaking romp that tops the previous Christopher McQuarrie-directed episodes (2015’s Rogue Nation, 2018’s Fallout) for sheer nailbiting spectacle and pulse-racing tension. The zeitgeisty plot may have holes through which you could drive the Orient Express, but for pure adrenaline rush entertainment this will leave you exhilarated and eager for more.
Three decades ago, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) sold his soul to the IMF (“no, the other IMF – the Impossible Mission Force”), a covert organisation whose oath demands that its members “live and die in the shadows for those we hold close and those we never meet”. Since then, Hunt has saved the world more than once (his last mission involved neutralising nuclear bombs). But now he’s up against everyone’s favourite enemy de nos jours – a fiendish artificial intelligence known as “the Entity”, a name that will sound sillier every time it is spoken out loud (and it is spoken out loud a lot).
It’s hardly a new idea. Jack Paglen’s script for 2014’s 70s-influenced Transcendence dramatised the “singularity” (the point at which technology out-thinks humankind) a decade ago, paving the way for MI7’s sentient viral intelligence (“this thing has a mind of its own?!”), which is “everywhere and nowhere… godless, stateless, amoral”, controlling and manipulating information so that “truth as we know it is in peril”.
The wise-cracking interaction between Cruise and Atwell has a nice, old-school screwball flavour
Somehow, this very modern threat has a very old-fashioned key – a weird, crucifix-shaped dongle that (like Archimedes’s Antikythera in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny) has been split into two pieces that must be reunited to unlock its secrets. “Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to bring us the key,” declares the familiar self-destructing tape, the IMF having apparently shunned new-fangled voicemail or encrypted WhatsApp messages. Later, they will retreat to the safety of an offline analogue room – the one place the Entity can’t get to them.
Warring forces wish to own the Entity, to control and weaponise it. Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) apparently holds part of the puzzle – which puts a price on her head, because “the fate of the world depends on finding whatever it unlocks” – thus sending Hunt off in globetrotting pursuit. The pre-credits sequence alone takes us from a submarine in the Bering Strait to a horseback chase through the desert, en route to a sandstorm shootout with brief stopovers in Amsterdam and elsewhere. We also get an early reminder that we’re back in a world in which rubbery masks are realistic enough to get Jason Statham believing in the Face/Off machine again.
There’s plenty of caperish comedy afoot, particularly after Hunt teams up with Hayley Atwell’s light-fingered Grace. A handcuffed car-chase featuring a Fiat 500 careening down Rome’s Spanish Steps recalls the Mini-fuelled fun of The Italian Job (with a cheeky nod towards Battleship Potemkin), while the wisecracking interaction between Cruise and Atwell has a nice, old-school screwball flavour.

Elsewhere, the join-the-dots plot includes a James Bond-style mission to a lavish party where a scene-stealingly cracked Vanessa Kirby warns that “truth is vanishing – war is coming”, a prologue to a Don’t Look Now-style chase through the alleyways of Venice. Esai Morales, who proved so chilling in Ozark, nails another villainous role as Gabriel, a “dark messiah” who is “the Entity’s chosen messenger”. As for Cruise, he may still have the physical fitness of a less-than-40-year-old, but he’s also developed a Richard Gere-style blinky squint of late, which adds a touch of melancholy maturity to his otherwise boyish charm.
The action is impressively gender neutral, with men and women killing and dying with equal relish (plaudits to Pom Klementieff, whose relentless – and largely silent – assassin, Paris, could give Grace Jones in A View to a Kill a run for her money). It all builds to a frankly jaw-dropping train-bound finale in which the heavily trailered sight of the real Tom Cruise really driving a real motorbike off a real mountaintop is only an appetiser for what is to come – one of the most audaciously extended action set pieces I have ever seen, which left my nails not so much bitten as gnawed to the bone. The fact that this is “only the beginning” is cause for celebration.

2023-07-19 23:35:39+00:00,Movie review: ‘Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One’ is pure entertainment,"The longevity of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, now amounting to seven films spanning 27 years, is no coincidence. With the overwhelming quantity of action movies on the market, it wouldn’t be a surprise to assume the minds behind the franchise had run out of new ways to entertain audiences before reaching their seventh movie. But Tom Cruise, lead actor and a producer of the series, has continued to impress audiences with the cinematic thrill of each and every “Mission: Impossible” film, and “Dead Reckoning Part One” might be the most riveting installment yet.","The longevity of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, now amounting to seven films spanning 27 years, is no coincidence.
With the overwhelming quantity of action movies on the market, it wouldn’t be a surprise to assume the minds behind the franchise had run out of new ways to entertain audiences before reaching their seventh movie. But Tom Cruise, lead actor and a producer of the series, has continued to impress audiences with the cinematic thrill of each and every “Mission: Impossible” film, and “Dead Reckoning Part One” might be the most riveting installment yet.
In the film, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his close allies are on the run from the U.S. government, the Impossible Mission Force — the organization by which he was formerly employed — and a number of powerful mercenaries.
He races to recover two halves of a key with the ability to deactivate a rogue artificial intelligence/virus threatening to cause a level of technological chaos capable of starting World War III.
He soon crosses paths with Grace (Hayley Atwell), a pickpocketer looking to sell the key to the highest bidders, namely Gabriel (Esai Morales) — Hunt’s old enemy who controls the virus — and the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) — a broker for illegal trading operations from 2018’s “Mission: Impossible – Fallout.”
If “Part One” has a flaw, it might be that there are too many characters for each one to get their moment to shine.
Pom Klementieff portrays a mercenary working for Gabriel, who seems like a direct rip-off of DC’s Harley Quinn due to a lack of original writing, despite Klementieff’s attempt to bring fresh air into the character.
The “villain” — taking form in AI — is a technology that feels all too contemporarily familiar and initially works better as an overarching concept rather than when Gabriel is introduced, who comes off as a bit bland.
Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) — Hunt’s on-again, off-again partner in missions and romance alike — seems more like a device to further the plot than the fully fleshed-out character she was in prior installments. She also draws attention to a troubling theme in not just “Mission: Impossible” movies but the action genre as a whole: romantic interests of the male lead being used for nothing more than character motivation.
If there is a surprisingly nuanced acting performance, it is Vanessa Kirby as the White Widow. She’s a scene-stealer with a presence notably felt despite limited screen time, and Kirby does a phenomenal job not just playing the White Widow but also mimicking another person pretending to be her through the Impossible Mission Force’s facial-swapping technology.
However, audiences don’t go to “Mission: Impossible” for the side characters. They flock to theaters because of Tom Cruise’ portrayal of Ethan Hunt and the breathtaking practical stunts he performs for every movie.
Stunts featured in “Dead Reckoning Part One” somehow found a way to be bigger and better than the previous films’, a prime example being when Cruise drives a motorcycle off a cliff and parachutes onto a train, making the audience feel like they’re diving right alongside him. Because that’s what makes the “Mission: Impossible” movies so beautiful in the digital age: a sense of realness, of feats being accomplished in the real world rather than in front of a green screen, a testament to the lengths movies will go to entertain.
“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” does all the heavy lifting to set up the second part — expected to release in 2024 — to be even bigger while still paying enough care to let “Part One” feel like a movie that’s rewatchable just by itself.
Maybe it’s a cliche to say that “Dead Reckoning Part One” will have you on the edge of your seat, but it’s true. Cliches in movies only persevere because they’ve been doing something right for a long time. And the “Mission: Impossible” franchise sure has.

,'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One' lauded for action-packed drama: 'Impeccably made',"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" has yet to hit theaters, but critics are already raving about the film. Here's what they had to say.","""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" has yet to rocket into theaters, but the film is already shaping up to be a tour-de-force action flick as far as critics are concerned.
The Christopher McQuarrie-directed action thriller starring Tom Cruise, set for a July 12 release, had its global premiere at the Spanish Steps in Rome on Monday. Cruise, looking dapper in an all-blue suit, appeared on the red carpet alongside his ""Dead Reckoning"" castmates, including co-star Hayley Atwell.
The latest film in the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise, ""Dead Reckoning"" follows the adrenaline-pumping stunt shenanigans of Cruise's superspy Ethan Hunt as he wards off deadly forces.
So far, the film has earned rave reviews from critics for its stunning action sequences and compelling performances.
Erik Davis of Fandango called ""Dead Reckoning"" an ""impeccably made action film that does not stop entertaining.""
""Each action sequence is long, crazy and intense,"" Davis wrote on Twitter. ""The story is big and sprawling, but I like how it both felt complete and left you dying for what comes next.""
Perri Nemiroff of Collider said the film is ""another winner for the franchise,"" including the addition of ""Mission: Impossible"" freshman Atwell.
""Tom Cruise is A+ as always and Rebecca Ferguson continues to be a favorite, but franchise newcomer Hayley Atwell wound up being the major standout for me,"" Nemiroff tweeted. ""She can do it all. Action, comedy, a capable hero in many respects while trying to get her sea legs in others.""
While Screen Rant's Joe Deckelmeier commended the film's action, he also noted how ""Dead Reckoning"" incorporates new technology into the film's plot. ""With (artificial intelligence) being the villain, this feels like a cautionary tale,"" Deckelmeier wrote on Twitter.
Germain Lussier, a senior entertainment reporter at Gizmodo, wrote that the film ""gets a little dense at times, but its pace and intensity more than cover that.""
""'Dead Reckoning Part One' is fantastic,"" Lussier tweeted. ""Huge variety of action and a final set piece that ranks top 2-3 all-time for the franchise.""

,'Mission: Impossible' director wanted to cast Julia Roberts,'Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One' director Christopher McQuarrie considered casting a digitally de-aged Julia Roberts in the film.,"Warning: This article contains mild spoilers for Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.
Julia Roberts could have played a very important part in Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One as one of the brunette women Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) just can't seem to keep alive, no matter how hard he tries.
In a new Empire Spoiler Special film podcast interview, director/co-writer Christopher McQuarrie revealed he considered casting Roberts and digitally de-aging her to play a role in the flashback scenes that show how Ethan and villain Gabriel (Esai Morales) are connected. In the past, Gabriel murdered Ethan's girlfriend Marie and framed him for her death. In the film, Marie is played by Mariela Garriga, but McQuarrie reveals that he originally wanted to cast a megastar from the time period of the first Mission: Impossible film.

""If you hire Esai Morales and Tom Cruise and de-age them, and then hire some 23-year-old woman to be their confidant in Berlin in 1989, that's bulls---,"" McQuarrie said. ""We started looking at it and saying, 'Who's Marie going to be? Who from that era would Marie have been? It would be Tom in, say, 1989, it would be Tony Scott's Mission: Impossible — that's who would have been directing the movie before Brian De Palma in that era... I looked back at who was the ingenue, who was the breakout star in 1989? And right around then was Mystic Pizza, and I was like, 'Oh my God. Julia Roberts. A then-pre-Pretty Woman Julia Roberts as this young woman.'""
The director goes on to explain that the only way he ""could have seen doing the sequence justice was to somehow convince Julia Roberts to come in and be this small role at the beginning of this story."" He originally wanted the flashback scene to be longer as well, but ultimately decided it would be too distracting for audiences to see Roberts, Cruise, Morales, and Henry Czerny (who plays former IMF chief Eugene Kittridge) looking almost 30 years younger via digital de-aging visual effects.
""The best de-aging I've ever looked at, all I kept thinking is, 'Wow, this de-aging is really good.' I'm in no way, shape, or form connecting to the story,"" he said. ""As you're conceptually going through it, you're like, 'Now all anybody's going to be doing is thinking about the de-aging of Julia Roberts, and Esai, and Tom, and Henry Czerny.'""
There was also a much simpler reason why McQuarrie decided against the idea: It cost too much money.
""I got the bill for de-aging those people before their salaries were even factored into it,"" he said. ""And if you put two of them in a shot together, or three of them in a shot together, it would have been as expensive as the [massive third act action scene set on the] train by the time we were done.""
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is in theaters now.

,Mission: Impossible's Hayley Atwell was proud of her bruises for Dead Reckoning,Hayley Atwell plays a thief named Grace opposite Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt in 'Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.',"Before starting to shoot her role of a professional thief named Grace in the just-released Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, Hayley Atwell spent five months working with stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood and his fitness trainer wife Sam.
""The bruises here and there that I would get were so minor and yet I would be very proud of them,"" says the British actress, 41, who spoke with EW on Wednesday, ahead of the SAG strike. ""I would be like, 'I've got proof of my battle scars!'""
Atwell explains that she not only embarked on an exercise program to prepare for her role in the seventh Mission: Impossible film, which once again finds Tom Cruise playing super spy Ethan Hunt, but also embarked on what she describes as a life-changing, sugar-free diet.
""It transformed my body in terms of my energy, my clarity of mind, and the natural by-products that come from living an incredibly healthy way and understanding about nutrition and rest and recovery and injury and prevention and mobility,"" Atwell says. ""The first time I had sugar again, I had this sort of sugar hangover the next day and felt awful."" Did a tiny, imaginary Tom Cruise appear on her shoulder to say, ""Told you""?
""No, he would never rub it in,"" she says.

In the film, Cruise's Hunt forges an at first uneasy partnership with Atwell's character in an attempt to combat ""the Entity,"" a new kind of artificial intelligence with essentially world-conquering powers. The actress is receiving rave reviews for her performance. (EW's Maureen Lee Lenker called Atwell ""the real jewel in the crown of this ensemble."") But the opportunity to perform opposite Cruise on screen has been a long time coming. In fact, filmmaker Chris McQuarrie, who has directed all of the Mission: Impossible movies since 2015's Rogue Nation, first came close to casting the actress over a decade ago.
""Hayley is someone we have been talking to, and talking about, going all the way back to Jack Reacher,"" McQuarrie says, referring to the Cruise-starring 2012 action-thriller, which the filmmaker also directed. ""She read for us for Jack Reacher, and she was somebody we were interested in for Rogue Nation. It took us a while to find just the right character, just the right opportunity for Hayley to really play to her strengths.""
In the years after she auditioned for Reacher, Atwell became well known to MCU fans for playing the role of Peggy Carter in a slew of films and the Agent Carter TV series. The actress most recently portrayed an alternative universe Peggy in last year's Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. The movie featured the actress as a version of the character who has become the superhero Captain Carter but is killed with her own shield by Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch, to Atwell's disappointment.
""It was great to see her in that outfit, seemingly taking a more active role,"" Atwell says. ""But it was a very underwhelming moment for her to say, 'I could do this all day,' and then get cut in half by a frisbee. Definitely don't think that set-up delivered what I would have loved to have seen for her.""

The actress is much happier talking about the shoot for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, despite its tough and frustrating nature. The COVID-19 outbreak delayed the production's start by six months, and caused Cruise and McQuarrie to pause proceedings on several occasions, extending an already lengthy shooting schedule. ""I think Hayley might have been on this movie for well over 100 days before she had her first dialogue scene,"" McQuarrie says.
A hundred days? What was the actress doing during that time? ""Fighting, a lot of the stunt work, a lot of the running through the streets in Venice, a lot of the work in Rome,"" she says. ""The big dialogue scenes, they came later on, once we had established the physicality of the character in all those bigger set pieces. Then we went, 'Okay, we've got to fill this in with some actual storytelling here. Let's work that out.'""
Much of ""the work in Rome"" to which Atwell refers involved shooting a car chase which found Grace and Ethan driving through the streets in a Fiat 500 while handcuffed together. In the finished film, Hunt almost immediately crashes that car after the pair get in the vehicle, a moment which, Atwell reveals, was not part of the day's shooting schedule.
""We nicknamed the car Trixie, because she had a life of her own,"" the actress says. ""It wasn't planned that Trixie crashes immediately when we set off in her, but we did by accident, and it ended up in the film. It's such a great comedic moment. I mean, how lovely to see Ethan Hunt back-footed and undermined by a little yellow cupcake car.""

Despite such moments, and Cruise's daredevil reputation, Atwell insists that her costar was always concerned about her safety on set and that she was having a good time.
""He wants to make sure that anyone that he's working with in those high-stakes environments that he's steering — literally and metaphorically — are capable but also safe and actually enjoying it,"" she says. ""That's one thing he said about the training: when you find the style that you like, you'll be able to get more advanced in it, because you physically enjoy doing it.""
Does Atwell think that the now-61-year-old Cruise will continue making these movies until he's, say, 150? ""Oh, I don't doubt it for a moment,"" the actress says. ""He loves it. He's an extrovert. He gets energy from being with people and making movies. His whole life is committed to this.""

Cruise will, of course, return for at least one more Ethan Hunt adventure, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two, which is set for release next June. McQuarrie and his cast had shot a chunk of the movie before breaking to embark on the publicity tour for Part One, but Atwell claims she is unable to tease the second half of the yarn.
""I can't, because I don't know what happens,"" she says. ""So much of 7, we weren't following a set script. We were finding things in the moment and then seeing what the scene owed in terms of the plot and the exposition and the character dynamic. That's their process. It's a very unique one that clearly works for Tom and McQ because of what they've been able to deliver. What's great for me as an actor is everything is sort of up for grabs in terms of what happens next.""
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is now screening in theaters.

2023-07-27 08:00:31+00:00,Movie Review/’Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’,"Last summer, when “Top Gun: Maverick” was making roughly all the money printed in the United States during that fiscal quarter, I read a number of articles (many publications jumped on the trend at once) calling Tom Cruise various iterations of “The Last Movie Star.” The moniker is obviously an exaggeration – Leonardo DiCaprio and […]","Last summer, when “Top Gun: Maverick” was making roughly all the money printed in the United States during that fiscal quarter, I read a number of articles (many publications jumped on the trend at once) calling Tom Cruise various iterations of “The Last Movie Star.”
The moniker is obviously an exaggeration – Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt haven’t exactly been left in the dust in Hollywood – but it’s understandable where it comes from. It may take a few beats to remember that the “Avatar” movies star Sam Worthington or that Tom Holland is the most recent (live-action) version of Spider-Man, but there is no such confusion with a Tom Cruise movie.
I bet most people, when discussing the “Mission: Impossible” movies, say “Tom Cruise” instead of his character’s name, Ethan Hunt. For that matter, I wouldn’t be surprised if people say “Tom Cruise” instead of “Jerry Maguire” when discussing the film named after the character.
All of this is to say that Tom Cruise has an undeniable screen presence and charisma. He certainly has the straight-up talent to justify this popularity, but his blockbuster appeal is about more than that. He clearly believes that if he’s going to be at the top of the industry, he should push himself harder than the rest of the industry.
That’s why he insists on undertaking difficult tasks like long sequences of running and dangerous stunts involving planes and motorcycles. This kind of dedication is why “Mission: Impossible” is a respectable franchise unto itself and not the James Bond knockoff that it would be otherwise.
The new installment sees Hunt racing around the globe to stop The Entity, a computer program that has seemingly become sentient and bent on world domination. Whoever can access The Entity first, whether it’s a government or an individual, can basically control the world.

Hunt is initially sanctioned by the U.S. government, represented by Impossible Mission Force leader Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny), but he soon realizes that nobody should be allowed to have that much power, so he goes on a rogue mission to destroy The Entity.
Hunt is aided by faithful teammates Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson). Complicating matters are money-driven duplicitous characters like high-class pickpocket Grace (Hayley Atwell) and black-market arms dealer Alanna (Vanessa Kirby).
Full-on villains include assassin Gabriel (Esai Morales) and his henchwoman Paris (Pom Klementieff, gleefully maniacal in a role that frankly doesn’t call for it), who are apparently representing The Entity itself, and no, I’m not sure how that business relationship works.
The mission involves gaining possession of two halves of a key and then figuring out what exactly the key opens. It also involves an elaborate series of druggings, pickpocketings, thievery, bomb scares, knife fights, shootouts, car chases, crosses and double crosses, and a ton of antics with a runaway train. Oh, and those super-realistic masks that this series loves come into play.
This movie really hopes you like Vanessa Kirby, because you’re getting a double dose of her here (no complaints from me).
I spent most of this movie having a hard time deciding if it was worth recommending. Cruise and his team are their usual delightful selves, but it seems like this movie’s been done several times before. The villains are more memorable than some of the others in this series, but their motivations are questionable.

The action is mostly pretty exciting, but the stakes are affected by the “Part One” in the film’s title, which tells me that nothing too conclusive is going to happen here. At the last minute, the film pulled out an effective action sequence with a train that finally earned it my endorsement. I reckon you’ll have a good time with the seventh “Mission: Impossible”
Grade: B-
“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, some language, and suggestive material. Its running time is 163 minutes.

,Tom Cruise wants to still make 'Mission: Impossible' movies in 20 years,"Tom Cruise wants to follow in Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones footsteps: ""I hope to keep making 'Mission: Impossible' films until I'm his age.""","Tom Cruise has already been playing Mission: Impossible hero Ethan Hunt for more than 20 years, but he doesn't intend to stop anytime soon. In fact, he wants to follow in the footsteps of long-tenured franchise star Harrison Ford, who just led Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny 42 years after first playing the title character in Raiders of the Lost Ark.
""Harrison Ford is a legend,"" Cruise told The Sydney Morning Herald at the Australian premiere of Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One this past weekend. ""I've got 20 years to catch up with him.""
Cruise continued, ""I hope to keep making Mission: Impossible films until I'm his age.""

While Cruise is certainly paying Ford a compliment, the latter previously told EW in a new digital cover story that he didn't totally love being called a ""legend.""
""I do not know what a legend does for a living,"" Ford said. ""I know that I consider myself to be a working actor, and I'll settle for that.""
He added, ""I suppose legend means that you've been around for a long time. And I think it's meant to be, uh, gracious, but it just, uh… sounds old.""
Ford hasn't just been occupied with donning his iconic fedora and picking up his token bullwhip. Also starring in the TV shows Shrinking and 1923, he's as busy as ever.
Meanwhile, Cruise has already starred in seven Mission: Impossible movies, and he's hardly out of juice. In EW's new review of Dead Reckoning, Part One, Maureen Lee Lenker writes that the movie's ""action and thrills are next-level,"" with a climactic stunt that is ""quite literally jaw-dropping.""

2023-07-24 10:00:29+00:00,In Review: Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,"In Dead Reckoning, Ethan Hunt and the IMF team must track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity if it falls...","Synopsis: In Dead Reckoning, Ethan Hunt and the IMF team must track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity if it falls into the wrong hands. With control of the future and the fate of the world at stake, a deadly race around the globe begins.
The Story
When an experimental Russian Submarine gets destroyed by a new weapon that is run via Artificial intelligence. Ethan Hunt and the IMF are brought in to try and track down part of a key that can operate the A.I. The problem is Hunt’s old friend Ilsa Faust has half of the key and it is unclear what side she is working for. Subsequently, Kittridge sends Hunt after Ilsa and the key and tasks him with returning the Key to him. When Hunt catches up with Ilsa he starts to realize that Kittridge has pretty much stitched him up and instead of taking the Key back to Kittridge. Hunt gathers his team and attempts to go after the other half of the key himself. But with the authorities on their tail. The IMF team of Hunt, Luther, and Benji find themselves having to play cat and mouse with the law while simultaneously trying to run a covert intelligence op to contact the person with the other half of the key.
Things get complicated when someone from Ethan’s past turns out to be the person that is trying to get both parts of the key and he is being helped by the A.I. that is running the entire operation and playing all sides against each other.
The Acting
Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt for the seventh time and doesn’t seem to have lost a step. All the team from the last two movies returns as we catch up with Benji (Simon Pegg), Luther (Ving Rhames), and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) embark on their most terrifying mission to date. Somewhat reluctantly joining the team is Hayley Atwell as Grace, a professional thief who unwittingly finds herself caught up in the mission as she is hired by a fence to deliver half of a key that can control the A. I. System that seems to be controlling everything and everyone else. Atwell brings her A-game to her performance and very quickly feels like a part of Ethan’s team.
In terms of villains. None are as frightening as the A. I. that seems to be controlling everything. But we get a great performance from Esai Morales as Gabriel who is absolutely no angel. In the film, Gabriel is the person that is partly responsible for Hunt joining the IMF and not much love is lost between the two men. Vanessa Kirby returns as The White Widow and plays quite a big role in the plot of the film.
Pom Klementieff puts in an impressive performance as Paris, who is a more white-knuckle advertisement for the beautiful city that she is named after. She’s the version that will hit you full-on with a crowbar or any other sharp or heavy implement.
Returning to the film series is Henry Czerny as the manipulative Kittridge who we have not seen since the very first Mission: Impossible movie from 1996. He is still the cold-hearted agent that we remember from that first film and one of the villains of this film. As the plot focuses on all the various intelligence agencies trying to get the key to this A.I. system.
Overall
MI7: Dead Reckoning is every bit the white knuckle ride that we’ve become accustomed to from this movie series. The team delivers a compelling and topical story involving an A.I. system that has gone rogue. And we get tonnes of great action sequences as well as one of the most fun car chases that I have seen in years. However, the real thrills come when Ethan must get himself a ride on the Orient Express, which is a runaway train by the time Hunt is able to catch up with it.
Like the previous Mission Impossible Film’s Dead Reckoning, part one delivers and leaves things on a real cliffhanger for the second part, which is expected to drop in the summer of 2024.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiI2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWZpcHVsc2UubmV0Lz9wPTU3NTU10gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,Mission: Impossible's Simon Pegg calls Tom Cruise bike stunt nail-biting,Simon Pegg recalls seeing Tom Cruise ride a motorbike off a cliff while making 'Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.',"What was Simon Pegg doing when Tom Cruise rode a motorbike off a cliff in Norway on the first day of the shoot for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (out July 12)? The British actor was on set, watching his co-star disappear into the wild blue yonder, and chewing on his cuticles.
""All the cast that were in Norway at the time, we all went up there together,"" says Pegg, who plays the character of Benji Dunn in the Mission: Impossible movies. ""It was a genuinely nail-biting experience.""

The stunt took place on Sep. 6, 2020, and found Cruise, who portrays Impossible Mission Force leader Ethan Hunt in the franchise, riding a custom-made Honda CRF 250 off a ramp on the side of Norway's Helsetkopen mountain. Cruise then fell 4,000 feet before opening his parachute a mere 500 feet from the ground.
""Obviously, you hear the idea and you get an idea of what it is in your head,"" Pegg says. ""But it wasn't until I got up there on the mountain that I realized just how death-defyingly awesome the whole thing was. For all his preparation, for all the parachute jumps he did, for all the motocross training he did, there is still always a degree of uncertainty with something like that. He went off the cliff and then vanished out of shot, and we just stood there and waited for the radio to tell us he was okay and that his shoot was open. That gap between him vanishing behind the rock to that radio message felt like an eternity. We could be facing losing our leading man. It was genuinely a fear. But, my god, it was exciting.""

Pegg reveals that Cruise not only fell through the air for more than half a mile but delivered dialogue while doing so.
""When we see the stunt in the trailers, all we see is Tom go off and go down,"" the actor says. ""Tom delivers a line in free fall. I mean, who's ever done that? Who's ever BASE-jumped and acted at the same time? Nobody.""

Pegg was first cast as Dunn in 2006's J.J. Abrams-directed Mission: Impossible III after the Brit's eye-catching turn as a zombie-battling Londoner in filmmaker Edgar Wright's 2004 horror-comedy Shaun of the Dead. The actor has now reprised the character in four more franchise entries: 2011's Abrams-produced Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol; 2015's Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation; 2018's Mission: Impossible – Fallout; and the new movie, which, like the previous two entries, is directed by Christopher McQuarrie. (The filmmaker is also overseeing Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two, which is set for release in June 2024.)
""When I first played Benji 17 years ago, he was a lab technician,"" the actor recalls. ""Then J.J. called a year later and said, 'How would you like it if Benji was a field agent?' I was immediately enthused by that idea. Then here I am on my fifth film."" Pegg describes how Dunn has evolved over time: ""He's grown up. He's a lot less wet behind the ears. He's a more capable, more mature member of the team, but no less human in his responses to the crazy stuff that goes on. He's maintained that position of being the heart of the group. It's really fun to play him, particularly after Fallout, where he was almost killed. I feel like he's taken all that on board and he's a little bit more battle-weary than you've seen him in previous installments.""
Christian Black
Pegg and Cruise are joined in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One by series regulars Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, and Vanessa Kirby. The film also features newcomers Esai Morales, Pom Klementieff, and Captain America actress Hayley Atwell. The latter plays a thief named Grace who falls into the orbit of the IMF team.
""Hayley's character is not part of their world,"" says Pegg, whose other credits include Scotty in the Star Trek film franchise and the father of Jack Quaid's character on The Boys. ""She's not a spy, [but] she's not a Kate Capshaw-in-Temple-of-Doom fish out of water. She's very capable, she's her own thing. The crackle of chemistry between her and Tom is so, so fun. Hayley has great comedic chops to the point where I was like, Hey, whoa, that's my job!""
While shooting Mission: Impossible has occupied most of Pegg's time over the last few years, the actor reveals he has been mulling future projects. These include a possible re-team with Edgar Wright, with whom he wrote Shaun of the Dead, as well as 2007's Hot Fuzz and 2013's The World's End, both of which also starred the actor.
""I haven't been writing recently because I'm on strike in that regard,"" he says. ""But, yeah, Edgar and I have been getting together and having talks about stuff. That will happen when we can sync up our diaries and manage to get our most recent commitments out of the way. I'm always working in my head if nowhere else.""
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One will be released in theaters July 12.

2023-07-14 14:38:26+00:00,‘He is taking it to the next level’: the expert verdict on Tom Cruise’s epic Mission: Impossible stunts,"Amy Johnston, a stunt veteran of Suicide Squad, Deadpool and more, analyses the new blockbuster’s hair-raising action sequences – and praises the star’s commitment to realism","Tom Cruise’s new film Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is stuffed with spectacular stunts, but one in particular has grabbed the world’s attention: riding a motorbike off the top of a 1,240 metre-high crag, plummeting down its vertical, semi-cylindrical face, and opening his parachute, base-jump style, just before he hits the ground.
Cruise says its “far and away the most dangerous thing [he’d] ever attempted”, and in a video released by the film-makers, revealed he had trained for the stunt by making more than 500 skydives and 13,000 motocross jumps over an 80ft mound, as well as training for a year in base jumping (a specialist skill involving parachuting from fixed objects including radio masts and skyscrapers). A practice ramp was constructed in a quarry in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, stuffed with fall-breaking plastic bags, before taking on the actual leap off the Helsetkopen in Norway. Cruise performed the stunt six times for the cameras.

Amy Johnston, a stunt performer on films such as Suicide Squad, Deadpool and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, as well as the TV series Westworld, said: “In the movie theatre where I watched the film, as soon as he dropped, the audience was just dead silent. Everybody was trying to hold their breath, kind of they all felt like they were just having a heart attack.
“What he is able to do is create spectacle, and he knows how to entertain people. He did some of his biggest stunts to date in this film, and I was absolutely very impressed.”
Cruise has been making Mission: Impossible films for nearly 30 years, and will be for another 20 if he has his way. Since the premiere of the first Mission: Impossible in 1996, the role has been particularly testing, with the series renowned for its elaborate and physically challenging stunts, for which Cruise, 61, prides himself on his personal involvement. Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, the seventh entry in the series, carries on the tradition, with other set pieces including a somersaulting Fiat 500, and train carriages hanging over a steep drop.
Johnston points out that while Cruise will have stunt doubles to assist him, as well as elements of CGI to heighten impact, the fact that he gets involved so heavily himself has an influence on the way scenes are filmed and their impact. “He knows how to bring the realism – you can see that it’s happening to him in closeup, like the effect of freefall on his face - and then you can also keep the frame very wide and see the action play out. It adds to the experience, and audiences definitely feel that.”
‘Very impressed’: actor and stunt performer Amy Johnston.
For all that, Johnston says one of the hardest stunts in the film is a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment at the very start, when Cruise’s character, hiding in the desert, has to mount a horse as it gets up from a prone position. “This is very specialty-trained movement; it really needs timing, and it’s dangerous as well, because the horse could lay down on his leg if the timing is off.
“That is what Cruise always brings to his films, the extra details, because he didn’t need to do that. But he wants to do those things, and it adds a lot.”
Johnston also talks admiringly of the car chase scene in which Cruise and Hayley Atwell are handcuffed together as they manoeuvre a Fiat 500 around the narrow streets of Rome. “It was really fun, and not just because of all the somersaults and car hits, but the fact they were connected by handcuffs was so creative. I would love to break it down frame by frame, but I think that Cruise was definitely driving one-handed while being handcuffed. That whole scene [was a] really great job by the stunt coordinators and the stunt performers.”

Johnston says that a scene in which Cruise fights a selection of bad guys on top of a speeding train employed a mix of stunt trickery and actual exposure to the conditions. She suggests that film-makers may have employed harnesses or wires attached to a crane, which are then erased in post-production, for wide shots, and that greenscreen backdrops, where the background is added digitally, were probably used for tighter shots. “But the part where he had to duck under a bridge is one of those things that you have to really work on and go over and over and over and really get the timing right. It’s very scary to do something like that.”
Johnston is also supportive of the stunt industry’s campaign to gain recognition for its work through inclusion in the Oscars, which is spearheaded by John Wick director Chad Stahelski. “It would make a lot of sense, especially with how hard the stunt teams work to make a great film. These fight scenes, and car scenes, are all designed by the stunt team, who also figure out the best way to film them. The stunt coordinator and the stunt crew are such a huge part of a film.”
Mission: Impossible’s main rival in the blockbuster stunt world remains the Bond franchise, which stages equally elaborate scenes for its star performer – until recently Daniel Craig. But for Johnston, Cruise remains the gold standard: “It’s how he shoots action, doing his own stuff, that adds to the experience. I know in the Bond films, the actors are definitely doing a lot of fight scenes and such, but Cruise is taking it to the next level. It’s not that the action is better, but Cruise’s process does make a difference.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjMvanVsLzE0L2V4cGVydC12ZXJkaWN0LXRvbS1jcnVpc2UtbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLXN0dW50cy1hbXktam9obnN0b27SAW1odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZmlsbS8yMDIzL2p1bC8xNC9leHBlcnQtdmVyZGljdC10b20tY3J1aXNlLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1zdHVudHMtYW15LWpvaG5zdG9u?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

2023-07-17 10:10:40+00:00,Latest Mission: Impossible shows the ‘silent Asian’ stereotype is alive and well,"Pom Klementieff’s assassin Paris is largely mute throughout the latest instalment of the franchise, flying in the face of the recent forward-thinking use of Asian actors in Hollywood","There are many things wrong with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One: its ridiculous storyline about AI, its bloated runtime, the plot holes as wide as Tom Cruise’s gleaming megawatt smile, but the most jarring of all? How Pom Klementieff’s supporting role as Paris, a savage assassin, is transformed into the tired stereotype of the silent Asian, who is largely mute throughout the film.
Paris is part of villain Gabriel’s (Esai Morales) crew. She’s on screen for many of the fights and action sequences including a thrilling car chase through the streets of Rome. All kamikaze glee and thigh-crushing aggression, she’s more than capable of giving Cruise’s Impossible Mission Force agent, Ethan Hunt, a run for his money. But the French actor, who is half Korean, barely utters a word throughout the whole thing.
Admittedly, no one comes to a Mission: Impossible film for the dialogue. They come for spectacular set pieces and death-defying stunts performed by Cruise in breathtaking locations – and on those fronts it certainly delivers. But joining those segments together are multiple scenes featuring reputable actors trying to keep a straight face while saying the words “key”, “open”, and “the entity” over and over again in various formations, as the story unfolds about a supersized ChatGPT going rogue.
Despite this, it seems the writers couldn’t spare many of those lines for poor Klementieff. Her most expansive moment comes when she says: “See you soon,” in French, until the very end of the film when she strings together a few more sentences to impart some Extremely Important Information to Hunt. Which makes it even more bizarre that she was so silent before that.
She’s even asked a direct question at one point by Denlinger (Cary Elwes), director of National Intelligence. Does she reply? Does she heck! No, she responds in the language she knows best - full-on violence, pulverising any bodies that happen to be in her way.
After all the fine work done by Asian-led films such as Everything Everywhere All at Once, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Crazy Rich Asians in blitzing Hollywood free from its crusty old stereotypes, I had hoped that the trope of the silent Asian was on its way out. Instead it remains stubbornly persistent.

You don’t have to look too far in the past to see how it has permeated western films and TV. Take Hana Mae Lee in the Pitch Perfect films. The Korean American actor plays Lilly Onakuramara, a painfully shy student who speaks in a barely audible whisper for most of the three comedy films. Sonoya Mizuno, a British actor of Japanese, English, and Argentinian descent, gets to boogie on down with co-star Oscar Isaac in the cerebral sci-fi thriller Ex Machina, but says nothing as Kyoko, a mute, sexy robot.
Similarly, Japanese star Rinko Kikuchi is a spark of joy in the comedy caper The Brothers Bloom as Bang Bang, one of the film’s main characters, but only says a few words. The message to Asian actors is clear; you can be part of our film, a major part even, just don’t expect to actually say anything substantial.
Actor Jimmy Wong, who starred as Ling in Disney’s live-action adaptation of Mulan, called out the trope, posting a tweet with pictures of mute superhero Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) in The Boys and Ben (Justin H Min), the ghost in The Umbrella Academy. “Least favourite acting thing I’ve noticed during pandemic binge watching: incredibly sexy and good looking Asian actors playing characters with barely ANY dialogue because it’s supposed to be … mysterious?”
The silent Asian stereotype taps into the myth that Asians, particularly Asian women, are meek and submissive. Paris, of course, is the opposite of meek and submissive – you can tell that just by her Harley Quinn-esque makeup, her white face powder made up, no doubt, by the ground bones of her long dead enemies. She joins the ranks of Hollywood’s other largely silent Asian assassins, including Devon Aoki’s Miho in Sin City and Bai Ling’s Mysterious Woman in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow – powerful women who are only allowed to lacerate with their fists rather than their verbal wit.
Klementieff’s character points to the franchise’s at times questionable treatment of women. Who can forget Thandiwe Newton’s Nyah in the second instalment? Despite her professional capabilities as an accomplished thief, it’s made clear she’s only recruited by Hunt to seduce her ex, a rogue agent (Dougray Scott). “She’s got no training for this kind of thing,” Hunt complains to his mission commander (Anthony Hopkins). He replies odiously: “To go to bed with a man and lie to him? She’s a woman, she’s got all the training she needs.”
Don’t get me wrong, there have been some great female characters over the years, most notably Vanessa Redgrave’s Max, a cunning and manipulative arms dealer, in the first film. But many of these women disappeared after a single outing, never to be seen again including IMF agents Claire (Emmanuelle Béart), Jane (Paula Patton) and Zhen (Maggie Q).

Hunt’s wife Julia, played by Michelle Monaghan, did make reappearances in Ghost Protocol and Fallout after starring in the third film. But in the Mission: Impossible world, women, it seems, are largely disposable, unlike Hunt’s constant companions Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames).
It’s only in the most recent films that we’ve seen other recurring parts for Vanessa Kirby’s mysterious broker Alanna Mitsopolis, AKA the White Widow, and Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa Faust, the MI6 operative, who can match Hunt punch for punch.
Paris will presumably be returning too for Dead Reckoning Part Two, although her fate is left hanging as precariously as Hunt on a motorbike teetering by a cliff’s edge. Will she survive to talk more in the second half? We will find out in 2024. Until then, Hollywood, this is your reminder – please unmute Asian actors, it’s really not such an impossible task.

2023-06-19 11:47:01+00:00,"Mission: Impossible won't end with Dead Reckoning, according to the director",Mission: Impossible director Christopher McQuarrie says the series will continue beyond Dead Reckoning,"Despite rumors to the contrary, Mission: Impossible will continue after the upcoming Dead Reckoning two-parter.
Director Christopher McQuarrie, who is helming Dead Reckoning Parts One and Two across 2023 and 2024, told Fandango that it is 'not the end' for the action series. Additionally, they already have 'ideas for what comes next.'
Variety had previously reported last year that the two-parter will a 'sendoff' for Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt – so there's every chance the ex-IMF agent could be put out to pasture, with the franchise continuing without him.
McQuarrie, meanwhile, is only focusing on a narrower picture – and that includes ignoring any talk of Mission: Impossible competing with other prominent action icons.
""We don't see ourselves in competition with Bond or John Wick. We love those movies, and we admire those filmmakers, and we want to see those guys win. All we're really doing is competing with ourselves,"" McQuarrie says in the new issue of Total Film magazine, which is out on newsstands on Thursday, June 22.
""And coming away from Top Gun, we looked at that movie, and said, 'We're going to bury those guys. We're going to crush Top Gun.' That's how we look at it. Our only rivals are ourselves.”
Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One, starring Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, and Vanessa Kirby, hits cinemas on July 10 in the UK and July 12 in the US. Part Two is currently dated July 28, 2024.

2023-07-24 11:31:20+00:00,Mission: Impossible 7 suffers franchise-worst slump at the box office,Mission: Impossible second weekend box office is a franchise-worst drop,"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One has been eclipsed by Barbenheimer – resulting in a historic second-week drop for the franchise at the box office.
As per The Hollywood Reporter, Dead Reckoning only brought in $19.5 million in the US in its second weekend, a drop of 64% from its $56.2 million opening. That’s the worst week-on-week drop for the Mission: Impossible series. The previous low, Mission: Impossible 2, fell 53% upon its release in 2000.
It’s slightly better news for Dead Reckoning Part One globally. It’s passed $250 million worldwide after picking up over $55 million across 72 territories and markets this weekend. A $600m total box office isn’t out of the question, then – should audiences choose to accept it.
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’s slump, though, should be seen in the wider context of one of the wildest weekends in Hollywood history. Barbie and Oppenheimer opened to $155 million and $80.5 million respectively, the first time two movies have ever opened at over $80 million on the same weekend. It’s also one of the biggest combined weekends for a box office ever, even if Mission: Impossible didn’t get the lion’s share of attention.
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two is set for release on June 28, 2024.

,Even Tom Cruise is planning a Barbie and Oppenheimer double feature,"Tom Cruise, ex-husband of AMC ad sensation Nicole Kidman, is encouraging moviegoers to flock to theaters for a 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' double feature.","Tom Cruise, ex-husband of AMC ad sensation Nicole Kidman, is emboldening moviegoers to flock to the theaters this summer.
The movie star encouraged a double feature of Greta Gerwig's Barbie and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, both in theaters July 21, in a Twitter post celebrating the riches of the summer movie season. That also includes James Mangold's Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which marks Harrison Ford's last outing as the famed archaeologist.
""This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,"" Cruise wrote. ""Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indy and one of the most iconic characters in history. I love a double feature, and it doesn't get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Oppenheimer and Barbie.""
Cruise will also be fronting a blockbuster this summer with Mission Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, in theaters July 12. The pressure's on, as Cruise's last summer outing, Top Gun: Maverick, grossed a staggering $1.5 billion worldwide. In the aftermath of its success, filmmaker Steven Spielberg was overheard telling Cruise that he was ""saving Hollywood's ass"" as the industry attempts to rebound from the pandemic.
As for the Barbie vs. Oppenheimer discourse, Matt Damon, who stars opposite Cillian Murphy in the war drama, previously encouraged a double feature, telling Vanity Fair last month, ""People are allowed to go see two movies in a weekend. Oppenheimer is one of them!"" As for which title his family would prefer to hit first (Damon shares four daughters with wife Luciana Barroso), he said, ""I'll have to ask them that. If that's the case, they'll see two movies that weekend!""

,Hayley Atwell addresses 'invasive' Tom Cruise dating rumors: 'It feels a little dirty',Hayley Atwell opened up about past speculation that she dated her “Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One” co-star Tom Cruise.,"A love story between “Mission: Impossible” newcomer Hayley Atwell and Tom Cruise is pure fiction.
The British actress, who co-stars with Cruise in the upcoming action thriller “Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One,” opened up about past speculation that she dated Cruise in an interview with The Independent published Saturday.
Atwell, who is engaged to music producer Ned Wolfgang Kelly, said she views Cruise and “Dead Reckoning” director Christopher McQuarrie as ""sort of two uncles.""
""I would be like, ‘Ooh, there’s some weird rumors, and it feels base. It feels a little dirty,"" Atwell told the British outlet. ""It feels grubby. It’s not what I’m about. Why are things being assumed or projected onto me about my relationship with my work colleague and boss?""
Atwell added that she found the rumors ""upsetting"" because of the scrutiny it brought to her private life.
""It’s involving people in my actual life, my personal life, who have to be on the receiving end of that,"" Atwell said. ""It becomes invasive.""
'Impeccably made':'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One' lauded for action-packed drama
Marking the seventh installment in the iconic ""M:I"" franchise, ""Dead Reckoning Part One"" follows Cruise’s secret agent Ethan Hunt as he faces off against ""The Entity,"" an evolving form of artificial intelligence that threatens global security. Atwell plays enigmatic thief Grace in the film. The pair becomes an effective duo, navigating a wild car chase through Rome in a tiny Fiat and a hellacious train trip on the Orient Express.
""Dead Reckoning"" has earned rave reviews from critics for its stunning action sequences and compelling performances. Erik Davis of Fandango called the film an ""impeccably made action film that does not stop entertaining.""
""Each action sequence is long, crazy and intense,"" Davis wrote on Twitter. ""The story is big and sprawling, but I like how it both felt complete and left you dying for what comes next.""
Perri Nemiroff of Collider said the film is ""another winner for the franchise,"" including the addition of Atwell’s character. ""She can do it all. Action, comedy, a capable hero in many respects while trying to get her sea legs in others,"" Nemiroff tweeted.
USA TODAY film critic Brian Truitt gave the film three out of four stars, writing that while ""Dead Reckoning"" is chock-full of gloriously bonkers stunt sequences, its technological villain introduces some narrative obstacles.
""If you choose to accept this 'Mission' – and what action-movie fan or Cruise nerd wouldn’t, really – it’s the first half of a man vs. machine epic that doesn’t skimp in the thrills department,"" Truitt wrote. ""Just don’t think too hard about it, though you’ll probably still give serious side-eye to your laptop.""

Filled with live theatre, bars, buzzing nightlife, restaurants, studios and so much more.","[NoHo Arts District, CA] – This month’s movie and TV reviews of Barbie and Mission Impossible – Dead Reckoning.
I wasn’t planning to see Barbie; in fact, if I had to make a top-ten list of films I was going to see this summer, Barbie would have ranked #13. My curiosity did get the better of me (as well as favorable responses from people I respect), so I hit a weekday matinee and found it to be an enjoyable, even thought-provoking romp (how’s that for a paradox?). By now, many of you know the premise: Stereotypical Barbie (a radiant Margot Robbie who doesn’t make any missteps, even though the character sometimes does) is living the ideal life in Barbieland, with its matriarchal government, with its plethora of Barbies with identical temperaments and differing achievements, where the identifying color is pink and every night is a girls’ night. And then there are the Kens (led by Ryan Gosling’s blonde, buff basker in Barbie’s glow, Ken, who are there–but only exist and thrive in relation to the Barbies. But then Stereotypical Barbie begins having thoughts of death, which leads to her heading off to Los Angeles and eventually Mattel Headquarters. Worlds collide, loyalties are tested, and the fate of the world as we know it hangs in the balance…
Well, perhaps I’m overdramatizing things. From beginning to end, Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig is a delight, and it should probably make it for a good date film (I suspect that accounts for a good part of its half-billion dollar gross, as of this moment). Cultural references abound, so that a second viewing might be in order to see if you noticed everything. There are plenty of knowing, witty lines and situations (co-written by Gerwig and Noam Baumbauch). Robbie and Gosling are perfect as Barbie and Ken, with Gosling particularly funny both as accessory Ken and “enlightened, patriarchal Ken.” Besides the engaging leads, the Barbie also has some secret weapons at its disposal, namely Kate McKinnon as the helpful if eccentric “Weird Barbie,” Rhea Perlman as the mysterious and wise Ruth, Helen Mirren’s narrator, and America Ferrera as a creative, thoughtful, frustrated mom, flawlessly delivering a rousing speech about the contradictions and difficulties inherent in being a woman.
As for the Barbieland setting, with its preponderance of pink, perpetually sunny weather, open design (you don’t find walls in Barbieland), sandless beaches, it is a treat for the eyes, and a fitting contrast with the real world, with its inhabitants only too willing to tear you down, and a “patriarchal system” still very much in place, though its upholders smilingly manage to hide it well. However, the film, if not entirely equivocal, does give the neglected Kens some consideration, with the suggestion that if a society were to be truly ideal, then both sides have to work together. There are also some amusing (and occasionally trenchant) observations of the corporate world, the American Dream, and family relationships, particularly those of mother and daughter. And so, there is much to please everyone with this Barbie – whether you’re looking for an agreeable divertissement or something with a little more heft, it’s hard to go wrong. You may even tear up a bit. (I’m not going to say if I did.)

You gotta hand it to Tom Cruise. Up until these past weeks, he seemed to be the only hope for movie theaters (aside from plush, reclining seats) in their bid to reclaim audiences (Barbie and Oppenheimer have since pitched in). Mission Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, directed by Top Gun: Maverick’s Christopher McQuarrie stars an energetic Cruise in the first part of his farewell to the successful series. Normally, I am averse to these Part One features, since they usually leave the viewer dangling, and more often than not could have been resolved in one film. And if truth be told, there’s a good deal that could be trimmed from this installment, especially in both the endless discussions of Artificial Intelligence (the misuse of which is central) and the allegiance/loyalties of the main characters. Having said that, this Mission…is both exciting and satisfying, as it resolves enough matters and leaves you wanting a bit more. Most of the old team is back, including Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson and Ving Rhames. There is also a welcome addition in Hayley Atwell as a thief who is at first reluctant to do anything but save her own hide. The action sequences are both exciting and not-too-implausible (as these things go), with a noteworthy car chase and train showdown working particularly well. This Mission Impossible…is worth seeing, especially in a good theater. It’s up to you if you need the reclining seats…",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbm9ob2FydHNkaXN0cmljdC5jb20vYmFyYmllLWFuZC1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-14 21:30:18+00:00,No One Can Needle Tom Cruise Like Henry Czerny Can,"A star of the first “Mission: Impossible” film makes a welcome return 25 years later, bringing a delight in exposition that few actors can match.","What did they tell you about why they brought you back?
I think he was brought in as a burr that we remember in Ethan’s shoe. The original idea was that he represented the bureaucracy — the C.E.O. or whatever — that doesn’t like the asset to be human. So with Ethan, he’s the world’s asset. And the American people who Kittridge, to a certain extent, believes he represents, they’re his shareholders. He doesn’t like that there’s one person they’re beholden to. However, who else are you going to call?
How has he changed since we saw him in the first film?
I asked McQ, “OK, what do you think he’s been doing for 25 years?” It wasn’t really bothersome to McQ that there wasn’t an answer for that, and I was somewhat taken aback. At the same time, McQ has such a wide focus, and those particulars are allowed to be brought to the screen by the actor: “You do your homework, you let me know and we’ll sort it out, and we’ll actually do several versions of what you think he’s been doing.”
So before I arrived in London for my fitting on a film that really had no script at the time, we had an idea of what we were going to do. I figured Kittridge got schooled by Ethan 25 years ago, so he figured, “OK, I’m going to work in all the other agencies in Washington because I don’t like being schooled by somebody who’s younger than me.” So I think he’s worked everywhere he could at as high a level as he could, and came back to run the Impossible Mission Force a great deal more edified. He has a sadder but wiser knowledge of how the American intelligence machine works and who it’s working for.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTQvbW92aWVzL2hlbnJ5LWN6ZXJueS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUta2l0dHJpZGdlLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,REVIEW: Your stress level will go up to 100 with new Mission Impossible movie,M:I7 squares up against a rogue AI. Is it worth a watch? Read our review of Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One,"DUN-DUN-dundundun-dun-dun!
Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) returns (cue that signature running pose) for another spy thriller with his Impossible Mission Force (IMF) crew Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), plus Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) and possible new recruit Grace (Hayley Atwell). They are facing off against a crazy sentient artificial intelligence called the Entity and a man named Gabriel (Esai Morales), who knows Ethan from way back, before he even joined IMF.
We’re already expecting the frenzied stress and spectacle of back-to-back action sequences and DIY death-defying stunting, but can Mission: Impossible 7 really outdo itself this time?
The extreme stunts in the new Mission Impossible will hit your adrenaline fix
Tom Cruise went from scaling Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building, in Ghost Protocol, to catching a plane by hanging off an Airbus A400M in Rogue Nation, to pulling off a High Altitude Low Opening from 2,000 feet off the ground and more WTF-were-you-thinking stunts in this film. The M:I franchise has been flexing the behind-the-scenes production of the stunts prior to the official release but seeing the final result was still a mind-blowing experience.
For MI:7, the actor yeeted himself off the Helsetkopen mountain in Norway with a custom-made Honda CRF 250 motorcycle, dropped down 4,000 feet, and opened his parachute around 500 feet from the ground. He also did some Speedflying at Lake Valley UK, landing at around 80 KPH. What a mad lad!

M:I7 also serves quality platform gaming sequences
The hero’s plot armor prevents any real sense of danger from creeping up on you, but from the opening scene until the last moment, the audience has no time to breathe a sigh of relief. Watch for the whole train sequence: It had us hyperventilating and gave us motion sickness, especially when Ethan and Grace were hopping from one cart to another, obstacles threatening to crush them as the train falls down a busted bridge.

As with every M:I film, there are always people and other non-living objects trying to harsh Ethan’s vibe. On the inside, his IMF director Kittridge (Henry Czerny) returns from the first movie to be a meddling boss who gets pissed when Ethan doesn’t directly follow his orders. He sends Briggs (Shea Whigham) and Degas (Greg Tarzan Davis), to stop him from going rogue (too late!), both of whom are low-key entertaining with the usual buddy cop banter. Degas even sides with Ethan at one point, saying that maybe there’s a good reason he’s gone rogue, which is then pointedly ignored by his partner.

The Entity, however, is the main boss battle for Dead Reckoning. This artificial intelligence can erase online existence in real time, take on multiple personalities, gain access to telecommunications, hack infrastructure systems, and basically dominate the digital landscape. And with the modern age being highly dependent on technology, it has the potential to really eff up the world just for the lulz. However, it’s also distracting that Entity looks like a blue Eye of Sauron from The Lord of the Rings.
Also on the side of the baddies is Gabriel, who just looks like your typical corrupt executive. Paris (Pom Klementieff) is a standout Harley Quinn-type of chaotic baddie who looks like she’s actually having fun giving chase but she hardly has any lines and just walks around menacingly as Gabriel’s hype gal.
The dangers of living that anime harem life
Part of the super spy fantasy has always been enjoying some sweet lovin’ from attractive allies and adversaries. Ethan has been living the dream with almost every woman fawning over him throughout the M:I franchise.

In M:I7 alone, we see Alanna A.K.A. White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) draped over Ethan while teasing him and Ilsa cuddling him while overlooking a romantic view. Bro was even flirting with new recruit Grace and constantly invading her personal space.
However, that Ethan Hunt rizz often risks the safety of his many love interests. At times, some unfortunate comic book “fridging” takes place for the drama... and to make way for his new squeeze. There’s even a flashback scene from Ethan’s pre-IMF days with yet another mystery girl (Mariela Garriga) who was possibly offed. Way to really put ghosting to a whole other level — perhaps this is the real Ghost Protocol?

Should you accept the mission of watching Dead Reckoning Part One?
Having an artificial intelligence as an antagonist is timely, considering the real-life issues surrounding the ethics and use of AI and Chat GPT. It also forces the IMF team to cook up some clever analog solutions.
It’s also impressive how this movie, despite being filmed at the height of the pandemic, still delivers. The extreme stunts are also stunting hard with our collective blood pressure shooting up with every jump.
Even more traditional action scenes are still fun to watch ,like the labyrinthine run in Venice, some rat-tat-tat action in Abu Dhabi that straight up looks like a Counter-Strike map, and a car chase in a bright yellow FiatT. Of course, you can have an M:I film without that hyperrealistic unmasking — which gets played for laughs at some point with someone trying to pull off real skin. And yes, Tom Cruise runs A LOT in this film. It wouldn't be Mission: Impossible without it.

The dialogue tends to head towards cheese territory, so prepare for more than your fair share of dairy intake. Instead of “family,” we get a lot of talk about friendship and accepting the mission. Thankfully, new characters like Grace and Paris got that chemistry on lock.
So if you’re down for some stress-inducing stunts and badass women that will wreck your life, then run like Tom Cruise towards the nearest theater.

On Monday afternoon, the star celebrated his 61st birthday by attending the Australian premiere of Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One at Darling Harbour’s International Convention Centre in Sydney. Cruise was joined by co-stars Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff and Simon Pegg.

Dead Reckoning Part One is due to hit cinemas on Saturday (part two will be released next year) and Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, the IMF agent he first played back in 1996.
It’s a testament to Cruise’s staying power and star wattage that despite homegrown favourite Margot Robbie doing the rounds for Barbie this past week, the Mission: Impossible premiere still felt like the biggest event in town.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbWguY29tLmF1L2N1bHR1cmUvbW92aWVzL3RvbS1jcnVpc2UtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy1iaXJ0aGRheS1hdC1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLXByZW1pZXJlLW9mLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS0yMDIzMDcwMy1wNWRsY2guaHRtbNIBhgFodHRwczovL2FtcC5zbWguY29tLmF1L2N1bHR1cmUvbW92aWVzL3RvbS1jcnVpc2UtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy1iaXJ0aGRheS1hdC1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLXByZW1pZXJlLW9mLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS0yMDIzMDcwMy1wNWRsY2guaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One: Tom Cruise at 60 appears implausibly comfortable,Tom Cruise and the series itself are in rude health as this indecently exciting instalment shows,"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One      Director : Christopher McQuarrie Cert : None Starring : Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Henry Czerny Running Time : 2 hrs 43 mins
The latest episode in cinema’s second-most-robust action franchise begins with terrible things happening to a Russian submarine. A good while later – this is all over the publicity, so don’t write in – our hero sports off a cliff and survives thanks to a convenient parachute (though not one emblazoned with the Union Flag). Ring any bells?
It is not unreasonable to wonder if Mission: Impossible is moving into its Spy Who Loved Me phase. After all, Tom Cruise and the series itself are more than a decade older than, respectively, Roger Moore and the Bond Cinematic Universe at the time of that film. Have we reached cosy pastiche? Is it now all just one big guffaw?
On balance, no. The exhaustingly titled Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is certainly aware of its own occasional ridiculousness. The highlight of this indecently exciting film finds Cruise and newcomer Hayley Atwell speeding a yellow Fiat 500 through the streets of Rome while handcuffed to one another. A triumphant melange of practical stunts – juddering cameras bolted to clattering bodywork – and not-too-intrusive CGI, the chase shares as much DNA with (what else?) The Italian Job as it does with The French Connection.
Cruise does his famous “running”. The stuff with masks is still played for laughs. An early bit of pompous exposition casts comic actors such as Mark Gattis and Rob Delaney in the roles of US security big wigs. You could be forgiven for expecting the entire film to play like an extended nudge in the ribs. Wink, wink!

Not quite. Christopher McQuarrie, taking a third crack at the sequence, maintains impressive levels of mock sobriety throughout. This is a little too apparent in the overly anxious jawing about a McGuffin that must surely have tested the actors resistance to rolling of eyes. Do you really want to know? It seems there is a key, formed from two intersecting crosses, that may unlock a potentially self-aware computing “entity” with the capacity to take over the entire world. Nobody lives beneath a dome at the bottom of the sea, but, at such times, we really do appear to be drifting into Roger Moore territory. Irish Times Loo Guide can reveal that one such conversation begins in a Venice disco at about the 90-minute mark. There is easily time to get to WC and back before the action restarts. You’re welcome.
Anyway, those outbursts of jawing allowed, McQuarrie puts enough bloody crunch into the action to dispel any suggestions of creeping comic decadence. Top-flight supporting performances help. Early on, Atwell turns up as Grace, a resourceful thief, apparently hired by someone-or-other to track down the key before Cruise’s Ethan Hunt gets his paws on it. The lunatics who stuff social media with complaints about women taking over franchise movies may blow a temporal artery at Dead Reckoning.
While good old Ving Rhames and good not-quite-so-old Simon Pegg remain in the van, distaff talent carries out the majority of the secondary ass-kicking. Rebecca Ferguson is back behind the sniper rifle as old chum Ilsa. Vanessa Kirby reprises her role as statuesque princess of malignity. Newcomer Pom Klementieff, best known from the Guardians of the Galaxy flicks, strips layers from the screen as an all-purpose henchperson of the old school.
All four are excellent, but the gender shift does pose an interesting moral dilemma. Does Ethan Hunt have the same freedom to smash a woman villain in the face as he is allowed with a male antagonist? PhD theses have been structured around less. The character himself seems unsure.
Cruise, still knocking on 60 during the shoot, appears implausibly comfortable throughout a film that, at 2¾ hours, somehow manages to seem only about 15 minutes too long. Hollywood will, however, be concerned that the most satisfactory blockbusters of 2022 (you know what this is) and 2023 hung around a man born during the Kennedy administration.

For the Hollywood star, there was no time to waste.
In Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One, Cruise would be seen doing several high-octane stunts, one of which includes riding a motorbike off a cliff and base jumping. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Cruise was asked why he chose to begin the film with the hair-raising stunt.
“Well, that way we’d know either we are going to continue with the film or not! ‘Let’s know on day one what is going to happen, do we all continue or is it a major rewrite,” Cruise quipped. The Hollywood star got into the specifics of the scene and said it was crucial he shot the stunt on the first day of filming as he didn’t want to put that aside and shoot other things.

“But preparing for something like that was years (of experience). I had been riding motorcycles since I was a little kid, raced cars and spent a lot of time with aerobatics, airplanes, helicopters, parachutes. But to figure out something like that… It is our understanding of story, understanding of camera, how to do something like that, it all kind of came in that moment. I had trained f0r it, you have to be razor sharp when you do something like that.

“It was very important as we were prepping the film that the stunt actually was the first thing. Because I don’t want to drop that and shoot other things, and have my mind somewhere else. Everyone was prepped. You don’t want to be waking up in the middle of the night thinking, ‘I still have that left to do,'” he added.

HT's review of Dead Reckoning Part One
The review by Hindustan Times says Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a great, fun time at the movies. “As for Tom, he will do anything, jump off anything, crash into anything, for your viewing pleasure, to ensure you have the greatest time at the movies that you deserve. After last year's brilliant Top Gun: Maverick, it won't be a stretch to call him the true king of summer blockbusters. Hours after watching it on the bloated IMAX screen, images of him plunging off a mountain still stay embedded in the mind and the stomach.

,Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One Dolby Cinema Review Blu-ray Review,"'The latest news on all things 4k Ultra HD, Blu-ray and Gear'","The Mission: Impossible film franchise is a genuine rarity in the year of our lord 2023. It’s not the kind of superhero fare filling seats or the prestige, high-budget epics that win awards. Rather, it’s the kind of franchise that’s endlessly reliable for providing the rollicking, high-wire thrills and big comic gags that are so lacking in today’s stream of self-serious, downtrodden action films. And at the center of it all is Dorian Gray himself, Tom Cruise, a one-of-a-kind screen presence that people have literally grown old with over the past few decades. The franchise constantly returns to Cruise because he’s got just the right brand of light, self-effacing humor to make it all work, plus he’s still an action star that puts his body on the line for entertainment. However you feel about the man, his films endure because he’s good.
Enter Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which has been touted in its press tour as the beginning of a massive promise from Cruise: to top every entry preceding it in story and action. Such a serious promise is taken much too seriously, as the film ends up being a hasty grafting of other current successful franchises and the natural (but wrong) intention to buy further into Ethan Hunt’s value as a character. Mission: Impossible is fun when it’s poking fun at Cruise’s infallibility by tossing him around like a rag doll with explosions, kicks, punches, jumps and so much more. As Alec Baldwin’s character in Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation put it so eloquently: “Ethan Hunt is the living manifestation of destiny.” To depict him as less only reveals the half-baked concepts of emotional buy-in.
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One follows Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his IMF team (Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames) as they rush to find two halves of the Dragon Egg’s key, a key that holds the power to control a rogue AI responsible for bringing the entire world to its knees. Ethan wants to destroy the AI, while other world powers would rather control it and use it as a weapon (yes, even the US), thus a race is on to find the key. Along the way, an expert thief named Grace (Hayley Atwell) joins the team, and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) comes out of the shadows to fight for good. Oh, and there’s a mysterious guy (Esai Morales) from Ethan’s past that’s acting as a human cypher for the rogue AI. He’s also trained in bone-crunching martial arts and global espionage, of course.
It brings me not great pleasure to report that the film falls flat in its drama despite the constant string of enlivening, actually funny physical gags and frequently self-effacing humor that the franchise is best known for. But unfortunately, governing it all is not just another end of the world plot, it’s an end of the world plot that throws that artificial intelligence buzz word around like it’s supposed to have the weight of the world behind it. So, the film saddles itself with an unseen enemy and its human cypher that’s a thin new character from Ethan’s past. The dialogue, again unfortunately, calls constant attention to the story and its many dramatic failings. The film stops dead in its tracks whenever exposition needs to be dumped, and it all usually concludes with a big score swell and a revolving shot of Cruise looking contemplative.
That isn’t to say that Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is without humor, which can’t be further from the truth. Set pieces are designed to constantly pit Cruise against the impossible and finding the humor in that, whether it be that shocked look he gives after being shaken by a big stunt or his dogged determination to use his body like a swiss army knife. It’s just that the humor is constantly deflated in the face of all that sodden, dry dramaturgy. Watching Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation again, the first in the franchise to have the McQuarrie-Cruise collaboration, only reveals that the light touch there has been replaced with a heavy sense of purpose here. Dead Reckoning Part One doesn’t fly between set pieces with the sense of self-effacing parody because it wants to be something that means something. Who cares?
To say Dead Reckoning Part One does a disservice to its many recurring players would be an understatement. In its attempt to set up a mentoring relationship with Cruise and Atwell’s characters, it treats others like background players there to re-assert that Ethan Hunt is a suicidal force of good. Even Ilsa Faust’s return rings very false, with her character now a depressive mental case who barely talks and fears for the end of the world. It’s all very silly, so why aren’t they treating it as such?
As for the set pieces themselves, while I found that giant train sequence teased in every preview to be quite fun, engaging and working to the strengths of each of its characters, others lack the kind of full-throated dedication that I found in Rogue Nation’s rollicking opera and motorcycle chase sequences. A desert shootout early on in the film impresses but feels incomplete, and is then used as a flashback further into the story. That all said, the car chase through Rome in a Fiat 500 is exactly the kind of goofy, dangerous thrill-ride that this franchise is famous for providing.
It may seem that I’m endlessly criticizing Dead Reckoning Part One for being a movie that it isn’t, but it doesn’t exactly know what it wants to be either. All of the action beats are frequently thrilling, and there’s an all-timer of a physical gag during the train sequence that ranks with the best of the franchise, yet this entry frustrates in its attempts to build on top of what was already good. Sometimes things don’t need to be improved upon. Just keep hitting your beats well and people will stick around.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYmx1cmF5LmhpZ2hkZWZkaWdlc3QuY29tLzExOTI1MC9taXNzaW9uaW1wb3NzaWJsZWRlYWRyZWNrb25pbmdwYXJ0b25lZG9sYnljaW5lbWFyZXZpZXcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-12 13:07:00-05:00,Tom Cruise vs. AI: Can the last movie star defeat computer villain?,"With his latest blockbuster film, can Tom Cruise once again surmount the impossible and rescue moviegoing from its doomsday reckoning?","Following last year’s smash “Top Gun” sequel, Tom Cruise was championed as the savior of the theatrical moviegoing experience. The title of his new blockbuster, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” could therefore be interpreted literally. Can Cruise once again surmount the impossible and rescue moviegoing from its doomsday reckoning?
Actually, I think all the talk about Cruise saving Hollywood is overblown. The day he appears in a low-budget indie film and that film becomes a smash hit is the day I will believe the movie business is truly back.
But big or small, you still have to deliver the goods, as the mediocre returns for the so-so new “Indiana Jones” movie demonstrate. Directed by Christopher McQuarrie and co-written with Erik Jendresen, the new “Mission: Impossible,” while not peerless entertainment, is a much better sequel. When not bogged down by unnecessary exposition – really, who bothers to follow the plot of these movies anyway? – it’s a giddy, globe-spanning thrill ride.
Why We Wrote This With his latest blockbuster film, Tom Cruise is once again charged with surmounting the impossible and rescuing moviegoing.
To reiterate, this seventh installment in the “MI” franchise, which began in 1996, is only Part One. That means it’s basically a glorified teaser. (Part Two reportedly comes out next summer.) But some of the teases can stand – or fly, or speed race – on their own. Whenever the movie went into full throttle, which was about half the time, I gladly settled into that comfort zone of knowing I was being well taken care of by Hollywood action filmmaking at its techno best.
Paramount Pictures/Skydance View caption Hide caption Esai Morales and Tom Cruise perform a breathtaking battle scene in “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.”
Unlike the latest Indy movie, which overworks the nostalgia angle, or the Daniel Craig “James Bond” movies, which turned 007 into a brutal cipher, “MI” pretty much sticks to the same formula it has engineered for the past three decades: Confront the impossible, vanquish the unvanquishable, and win the day.
The one big twist this time around is that the central villain is not some person or country but a thing – a malevolent sentient artificial intelligence program dubbed “the Entity.” It can stealthily infiltrate any operating system and thereby control the world. With all the unsettling talk these days about AI, this particular species of villainy lends the film a new-style dose of pulp paranoia. Who or what is behind the AI is apparently a matter for Part Two, but the mission – or Mission – here is to head that catastrophe off at the pass.
Enter Cruise’s Ethan Hunt and his Impossible Missions Force (IMF) team: Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and – belatedly – Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson). Luther, warning Ethan about the Entity, has the film’s best line: “You’re playing four-dimensional chess with an algorithm!”
The CIA, headed by Ethan’s former handler Kittridge (Henry Czerny), wants Ethan to claim the Entity for the home team. But since Ethan wouldn’t be Ethan without going rogue, he decides instead to destroy it. Along the way, he tangles with the empathy-free Gabriel (Esai Morales), who apparently is on intimate terms with the AI, as well as with Gabriel’s blond henchwoman Paris (Pom Klementieff). The arms dealer White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) makes a return appearance. The most welcome addition is Grace (Hayley Atwell), the ace pickpocket who pockets more than she bargained for.
She reluctantly joins the IMF team, although, as is true of practically all the “MI” movies, as opposed to, say, the Bond films, there is hardly a hint of sexual tension.

The film’s standout centerpiece, breathtakingly performed and shot, is an extended fight scene featuring cutthroat calisthenics between Ethan and Gabriel aboard a runaway Orient Express train. And yes, Cruise does his own stunts, as when he motorbikes off a 400-foot cliff and parachutes onto that train. Sure it’s impressive, but should we really be encouraging such folly? No doubt the movie studio’s insurance company is asking the same question. I shudder to think how Cruise plans to top it in Part Two.

2023-07-09 14:45:37+05:30,"Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One advance booking soars in India, likely to be Tom Cruise's biggest opener",Tom Cruise's spy thriller Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is expected to sell over 1.10 lakh tickets in advance booking in India.,"If the advance booking collection is anything to go by, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One may just turn out to be Tom Cruise's biggest box office openers in India. Tom was last seen in Christopher MacQuarrie's blockbuster Top Gun: Maverick last year.
Advance booking numbers
As per a report in Pinkvilla, as of 3:30 pm on Friday, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One had already sold approximately 28,000 tickets for the opening day and 62,000 tickets for the first weekend in advance booking in India. The estimated number of tickets sold in the advance booking before the release is likely to be more than 1.10 lakh tickets.
Tom Cruise's biggest opener in India?
As per the same report, the box office collection of the opening day, July 12, is likely to be between ₹12 crore and ₹14 crore. This would make Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One the biggest opener for Tom Cruise in India so far. The last Mission: Impossible film, Fallout, opened to ₹9.50 crore in India in 2018. The new instalment is likely to improve on the same.
Box office competition
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One will enjoy an unrivalled run at the Indian box office for nine days, before Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig's adaptation of Barbie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, will release simultaneously on Friday, July 21. They're likely to eat massively into the share of the Tom Cruise film, given they're all tentpole Hollywood releases.

2023-07-10 08:00:26+00:00,Mission: Impossible actor says Dead Reckoning is the biggest action movie of all time,Cary Elwes calls Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One the biggest action movie ever,"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning actor Cary Elwes has high praise for the latest instalment in the long-running action franchise.
""It’s not just probably the biggest action movie of all time, I think it’s also one of the most emotional action movies we’ve ever seen,"" Elwes, who plays Denlinger in Dead Reckoning, tells GamesRadar+ and Total Film.
""That was what blew me away. I was fully just expecting amazing stunts and cool locations, but the emotional journey the audience is going on is, for me, what sends it into a whole other stratosphere.""
Simon Pegg, who plays Benji in the series, agrees that Mission: Impossible’s scope and scale keeps getting bigger and bigger.
""It did feel different,"" Pegg says. ""Not just because we were making it when we made it, but you know Tom [Cruise] and [director Christopher McQuarrie] are never going to rest on what they’ve done before. They’re going to push it forward. Every film, when it ends, we get asked 'What’s next?' and we think, 'Well, what could we possibly do?'""
Despite the ""enormity"" of the movie, Elwes – who has appeared in everything from The Princess Bride to Stranger Things – was struck by how nonplussed director Christopher McQuarrie was by the globetrotting production.
""There was never a bead of sweat on his head, not once,"" Elwes reveals. ""We had to deal with all kinds of things then – COVID, all kinds of logistical things – that a huge production of this nature entails. The guy never broke a sweat. He was totally, totally chill the whole time. So he set the tone on-set and so everyone felt [like] this is great, this is just a fun day at work.""

,Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,"Over the past two decades Mission Impossible has consistently delivered on engaging characters, fun gadgets, and breathtaking set-pieces","This instalment manages to tell its own satisfying story while at the same time, set the stage for the next chapter in the saga.
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One
Directed by Christopher McQuarrie
Back in May, Charlie Higson (author of the Young Bond book series) claimed, “The best ‘Bond films’ now are the Mission: Impossibles”, and it’s hard to disagree with him.
While the Bond franchise seems to be doing its best to recapture the excitement of 2006’s Casino Royale, over the past two decades Mission Impossible has consistently delivered engaging characters, fun gadgets and breathtaking set-pieces. I am happy to say that Dead Reckoning is no outlier.
This latest installment sees the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) take on a faceless enemy. An artificial intelligence known simply as ""The Entity"" has become complex enough that it could takedown entire governments, and as with any power too great for anyone to wield, everybody wants it.
Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team take it upon themselves to beat the rest of the world to the finish line and destroy The Entity before it’s too late.
Now don’t let the subtitle of Part One put you off. This instalment manages to tell its own satisfying story while at the same time, set the stage for the next chapter in the saga. As always with this series, Cruise’s commitment to doing as much as they possibly can practically leads to the action being as exciting and believable as usual (although I don’t think the filmmakers expected me to laugh when I saw a car chase lead to the destruction of the exact same area of Rome only recently devastated in Fast X). The introduction of international thief Grace (portrayed by Hayley Atwell) ensures fresh dynamics to keep the characters from getting stale.
If you’re finding that recent action films just feel like they’re going through the same old motions, and you’re yearning for the type of suspense that only Tom Cruise’s near-suicidal stunt antics can provide, then I can’t see you leaving the cinema disappointed.
While Part Two was originally announced to be Cruise’s send-off for the franchise, recently the actor gave an interview where he revealed that he intends to keep making these films for years to come. I guess if Indiana Jones can keep kicking butt into his eighties, why not Ethan Hunt?

,"MOVIE REVIEW: Mission Impossible 7 most exciting summer blockbuster, nears $500 million in global box office sales",,"Over the past two months, as Lynn and I have traveled through the U.S., Canada and Mexico, we have seen five of the big, new, summer movies made for grown-ups.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny
Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning, Part 1
Barbie
The Sound of Freedom
and Oppenheimer
Indiana Jones was fun and better than I’d expected, given the terrible reviews and my low expectations after the horrible Crystal Skull installment.
Barbie was bizarre, woke and confused in every possible way.
The Sound of Freedom was by far the most moving and most important movie of the summer, and one I’ll post a video review of soon.
Oppenheimer was dark, fascinating, and earned its R rating, but history I found worth revisiting. More on that in another review.
But hands down, the seventh installment of Mission Impossible was the most fun and most exciting movie we saw this summer.
It’s the only one of the five that we’ve seen twice.
Not surprisingly, it’s about to hit a half-billion dollars in global ticket sales.
Domestically in the U.S., the Tom Cruise-led franchise has raked in just over $153 million so far.
Internationally, it’s raked in more than $342 million.
All told, MI-7 has earned $496,135,000.
To be sure, it’s being blown away by Barbie, which has already topped $1 billion in worldwide box office sales, even though the politically correct pink picture was released several weeks after MI-7.
Still, Mission Impossible is the far more entertaining flick and one of the most fun of the entire series.
In this video, I explain why.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL2FsbGlzcmFlbC5jb20vbW92aWUtcmV2aWV3LW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS03LW1vc3QtZXhjaXRpbmctc3VtbWVyLWJsb2NrYnVzdGVyLW5lYXJzLXVzZDUwMC1taWxsaW9uLWluLWdsb2JhbC1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLXNhbGVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-02 19:30:00+00:00,‘We argue all the time’: Tom Cruise’s director on managing the world’s biggest star,A tense conversation with Tom Cruise before he rides a motorcycle off a cliff? All in a day’s work for Mission Impossible director Christopher McQuarrie.,"The film hits cinemas on July 8, but pre-production started in 2019 before experiencing significant delays due to the pandemic. Shot with a budget of $290 million, it is set to be one of the year’s biggest box office releases, a film designed to drag audiences back into cinemas. Completing his own stunt work has become a part of the Cruise mythology. According to McQuarrie, that has been the aim of his leading man all along. “These are the kinds of movies we need right now, we’re looking at an industry hanging on by its fingernails, and Tom is doing everything he can to bring people back to the theatre,” he says. That’s no understatement. From driving motorbikes off cliffs to base jumping onto a moving train, Dead Reckoning is a testament to Cruise’s willingness to try anything once. “We actually did the cliff thing six times,” laughs McQuarrie.
Completing his own stunt work has become a part of the Cruise mythology; he famously broke his right ankle during a roof-jumping stunt on Mission: Impossible 6. For a director, it sounds like a working nightmare, a hugely famous lead determined to do everything himself. “It’s stressful, but I wouldn’t have it any other way, and neither would Tom; it’s all very considered,” says McQuarrie. “The other day, someone made a comment about him being fearless, and he said, ‘It’s not that I am not scared; it’s that I don’t mind being scared,’ and that’s the difference. People assume Tom Cruise is a daredevil, but he’s just dedicated to confronting the fear.’” At 61, Cruise may soon need to confront a different fear; getting older. He remains the world’s most bankable and daring action star, with contemporaries like Stallone and Schwarzenegger no longer vying for box office dollars.
But with Dead Reckoning set to be a two-part epic, might Cruise call it a day after this? “Even if I knew the answer to that question, I couldn’t be sure because I’ve learned that with Mission: Impossible and with Tom, you just don’t know what will happen when we wrap,” says McQuarrie. Should the impossible become possible and age catches up with Cruise, the franchise could have ready-made replacements in British actress Atwell and French Avengers star Klementieff. Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell, Tom Cruise and Pom Klementieff. Atwell plays Grace, a sleight-of-hand expert who ends up working alongside Ethan Hunt, while Klementieff is Paris, a French assassin tasked with hunting the pair. Both hold their own in Dead Reckoning, undergoing five months of intense training before filming commenced.
“I certainly learned a lot, but this series is so synonymous with Tom; if there were a spin-off, it wouldn’t be the classic Mission: Impossible world,” says Atwell. Loading “There would have to be some understanding that it is new territory, but it could work; I don’t know if I am prepared to jump off a cliff. Klementieff agrees, adding: “The way the females are developed makes them powerful and have their agency; they never depend on the man, they aren’t girlfriends, and much of that comes down to what Tom wants.” “I don’t know what the future holds, but I will always be ready to play Paris.”
How Dead Reckoning Part One will perform remains to be seen, but the bar has been set high. The previous MI film, Fallout, had a total worldwide gross of US$791 million against a production budget of $178 million, becoming the franchise’s highest-grossing film so far. Dead Reckoning opens two weeks before both Barbie and Oppenheimer, two of the other most hyped films of the year. But if he’s feeling the pressure, McQuarrie does an excellent job of hiding it. Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie on the set of the new Mission: Impossible film. “Ultimately, Barbie and Oppenheimer are also movies made by people who want to make movies for the audience, not an audience, and that is the smart thing; that’s what we’re all trying to do; more power to them.” Hard to argue with that.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbWguY29tLmF1L2N1bHR1cmUvbW92aWVzL3dlLWFyZ3VlLWFsbC10aGUtdGltZS10b20tY3J1aXNlLXMtZGlyZWN0b3Itb24tbWFuYWdpbmctdGhlLXdvcmxkLXMtYmlnZ2VzdC1zdGFyLTIwMjMwNzAyLXA1ZGw1di5odG1s0gGLAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNtaC5jb20uYXUvY3VsdHVyZS9tb3ZpZXMvd2UtYXJndWUtYWxsLXRoZS10aW1lLXRvbS1jcnVpc2Utcy1kaXJlY3Rvci1vbi1tYW5hZ2luZy10aGUtd29ybGQtcy1iaWdnZXN0LXN0YXItMjAyMzA3MDItcDVkbDV2Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

DALENCIA, THANK YOU. TIME NOW FOR A LOOK AT WHAT’S NEW IN THEATERS AND STREAMING THIS WEEKEND. OUR FILM CRITIC LAUREN VENEZIANO IS JOINING US LIVE THIS MORNING. HEY, LAUREN. HEY, HOW ARE YOU THIS WEEKEND? GOOD. I’M DOING GOOD, BUT I’M SO SAD NOW. THE WRITERS AND THE ACTORS ARE ON STRIKE. WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET NEW SHOWS? IT’S GOING TO BE FOREVER. I KNOW. AND I DO. YOU KNOW, IT’S GOING TO AFFECT MY INTERVIEWS, TOO. I’M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO ANY INTERVIEWS. I HAD A COUPLE LINED UP, BUT ALL OF THOSE HAVE BEEN CANCELED. SO HOPEFULLY THEY COME TO AN AGREEMENT AND SHOWS WILL BE FILMING AGAIN. MOVIES WILL BE FILMING AGAIN, AND I’LL BE ABLE TO DO INTERVIEWS. SO WE’LL WE’LL HOPE FOR THE BEST AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. YEAH, WE NEED THAT. BUT FIRST, YOU DO HAVE SOME STUFF TO TALK ABOUT. FOUNDATION INTERVIEW. YES. BEFORE I GET INTO MISSION IMPOSSIBLE DEAD RECKONING, MY REVIEW OF THAT, I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT FOUNDATION SEASON TWO. IT’S NOW OUT ON APPLE TV+ AND IT’S ONE OF THE MOST STUNNING SCIENCE FICTION SERIES I’VE EVER SEEN. BASED ON THE NOVELS BY ISAAC ASIMOV, THE SHOW IS A SAGA OF HUMANS SCATTERED ON DIFFERENT PLANETS THROUGHOUT THE GALAXY, LIVING UNDER THE RULE OF THE GALACTIC EMPIRE. AND I SPOKE TO ALL OF THE ACTORS FOR THE SERIES, AND I WANTED TO SHARE A CLIP. I SPOKE TO ACTORS LEE PACE, LAURA BYRNE AND JARED HARRIS ON WHAT IT’S LIKE TO STEP BACK INTO THEIR CHARACTERS AGAIN FOR THIS FAN FAVORITE SERIES. HERE’S A LITTLE CLIP OF THOSE INTERVIEWS FOR FOUNDATION SEASON TWO. DESPAIR, DEATH, DESTRUCTION. THIS IS EVEN BIGGER THAN THE LAST CRISIS. LEE AND LAURA, SO NICE TO MEET YOU. CONGRATULATIONS ON FOUNDATION SEASON TWO. IS THERE SOMETHING WHEN YOU’RE STEPPING BACK INTO THESE CHARACTERS, IS IT BEING ON SET AGAIN? IS IT CONNECTING THEM TO LIKE THE WARDROBE, THE THE MAKEUP? IS THERE SOMETHING FOR YOU AS AN ACTOR THAT REALLY HELPS YOU CONNECT WITH THE CHARACTER AGAIN? YEAH. NO, WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT IT’S SUCH A IT’S SUCH A A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS, THE WHOLE THING. I MEAN, WE’RE SITTING HERE IN FRONT OF YOU, BUT THERE’S, YOU KNOW, A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO HELP US REALIZE THESE CHARACTERS ARE COSTUME DESIGNER JANE RORIE, WHO DESIGNED THE SETS. ALL OF THOSE ELEMENTS COME TOGETHER TO HELP YOU FEEL LIKE A PERSON THAT IS VERY FAR FROM YOURSELF. AND WHEN THOSE THINGS WORK AS WELL AS THEY DO ON ON FOUNDATION, IT JUST BECOMES PLAY FOR US. YEAH, WE’VE TALKED ABOUT IT. WE’VE DISCUSSED THE DIFFERENT CONTRADICTIONS AND RIDDLES INSIDE OUR VERY UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP, BUT THEN WE END UP ON SET AND WE CAN PLAY IT OUT. YEAH, YOU KNOW, AND DEFINITELY IT HELPS CREATING THE CHARACTER, ALL THE COSTUMES AND THE KIND OF LIKE SEEING THE WORLD AROUND YOU, KIND OF LIKE ALL THE OTHER, LIKE THE PEOPLE IN THE PARLORS WEARING THEIR, THE, YOU KNOW, AMAZING COSTUMES. YEAH. IT GIVES A LOT TO THE LIKE BECAUSE YOU CAN IMAGINE A LOT OF THINGS. BUT THEN, LIKE SEEING ALL THAT AROUND YOU KIND OF PUTS YOU IN A DIFFERENT PLACE WHERE IT’S EASIER TO START TO EXPLORE FROM. YEAH, YEAH. I MEAN, PART OF IT IS FAMILIARIZING YOURSELF WITH THE JOURNEY THAT YOU HAD IN SEASON ONE. WHAT YOU UNDERSTAND OF THE, THE GOALS WERE, AND THEN YOU OBVIOUSLY YOU FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF, FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE SCRIPTS AND YOU TRY AND START TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR JOURNEY IS. THIS SERIES IS HONESTLY LIKE STAR WARS MEETS SUCCESS MEETS THE CROWN. IT’S SO VISUALLY GORGEOUS AND LEE PACE IS AN INCREDIBLE ACTOR AND A HIGHLIGHT OF THE SERIES FOR SURE. BUT THERE’S NOT A BAD PERFORMANCE FROM ANY OF THE ACTORS. I INTERVIEWED EVERY ACTOR FOR THIS SERIES AND THOSE CAN BE FOUND ON FILM GIRL. BUT YES, GETTING INTO MISSION IMPOSSIBLE DEAD RECKONING PART ONE. IT’S NOW OUT IN THEATERS. I’VE SEEN IT TWICE, AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A SPOILER FREE REVIEW. OF COURSE, IT’S THE SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER WE’VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. AND TOM CRUISE CAN LITERALLY DO ANY STUNT. HE CAN DO ANYTHING. TOM IS BACK IS HER FAVORITE MISSION SPECIALIST. ETHAN HUNT. AND HE AND HIS IMF TEAM ARE TRYING TO TRACK DOWN A WEAPON BEFORE IT GETS INTO THE WRONG HANDS. REBECCA FERGUSON AS ILSA FAUST HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE PART OF THIS FRANCHISE EVER SINCE SHE WAS INTRODUCED IN ROGUE NATION. AND SHE AND TOM CRUISE JUST HAVE SO MUCH CHEMISTRY. SIMON PEGG, VING RHAMES, VANESSA KIRBY, THEY’RE ALL BACK. AND IN THIS FILM, HAYLEY ATWELL AND POM KLEMENTIEFF PLAY NEW CHARACTERS THIS TIME AROUND TO I’M NOT GOING TO GET INTO TOO MUCH BECAUSE LIKE I SAID, I DON’T WANT TO GET INTO TOO MANY SPOILERS. I WANT PEOPLE TO JUST SEE THE TRAILER AND GO IN AND HAVE A GREAT TIME. THE FILM IS ALMOST THREE HOURS, BUT IT GOES BY VERY, VERY FAST. THE STUNTS ARE A FIVE OUT OF FIVE. OKAY, TOM CRUISE DROVE A MOTORCYCLE OFF OF THAT CLIFF THAT YOU SEE RIGHT HERE, SIX TIMES TO GET THE SHOT RIGHT. AND HE JUST LOOKS FANTASTIC DOING IT. THE TRAIN SEQUENCE IN THE CLIMAX OF THE FILM IS NONSTOP AND LIKE I SAID, THE STUNTS ARE JUST FANTASTIC. I COULD WATCH ALL THOSE ACTION SCENES ALL OVER AGAIN. THERE’S ONE THING THAT HAPPENS IN THIS FILM, ONE SPECIFIC PLOT POINT THAT I WAS NOT A FAN OF AT ALL, AND THAT’S WHY MY RATING IS WHERE IT IS. I ALSO THOUGHT THERE WAS WAY TOO MUCH EXPOSITION OF SAYING THE MISSION OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE SAME TYPE OF VERBIAGE AND LANGUAGE WAS SAID THROUGHOUT I’M GIVING MISSION IMPOSSIBLE DEAD RECKONING PART 1A3 AND A HALF OUT OF FIVE. I’M LOOKING FORWARD TO PART TWO COMING OUT NEXT SUMMER. HOPEFULLY NEXT SUMMER. WITH EVERYTHING YOU KNOW, WITH THE STRIKE TO SEE HOW THEY FINISH THIS STORY. BUT DEFINITELY SEE IT ON THE BIGGEST AND LOUDEST SCREEN YOU CAN FIND IMAX OR DOLBY FOR SURE. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND SEEING IT IN EITHER OF THOSE THEATERS. SO I LOVE THE ACTION PART. SO THAT PART YOU GAVE A FIVE OUT OF FIVE STILL HAVE TO GO CHECK IT OUT. BUT NEXT UP, THE SUMMER I TURNED PRETTY. YES, THE SUMMER I TURNED PRETTY. SEASON TWO HAS PREMIERED ON AMAZON PRIME. THE FIRST EPISODES ARE NOW STREAMING. IF YOU’RE A FAN OF TEEN ANGST, YOUNG LOVE TRIANGLES, FAMILY DRAMA, THEN THIS IS YOUR SHOW SEASON TWO CONTINUES WITH OUR HEROINE BELLY STORY AND THE LOVE TRIANGLE BETWEEN TWO BROTHERS SHE GREW UP WITH. ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE SHOW, THOUGH, IS THE SOUNDTRACK CREATOR JENNY HAN, WHO OF COURSE DID TO ALL THE BOYS I LOVE BEFORE FRANCHISE ON NETFLIX.

Mission: Impossible star Rebecca ferguson has called out “boring” debate her role in the films.
The actor returns as Ilsa faust in new sequel Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which is in cinemas now.
Ferguson made her debut as the undercover MI6 Agent in 2015’s Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, and returned in 2018 follow-up Mission: Impossible – Fallout.
In the film, she is shown to have a spiky camaraderie with Ethan Hunt, the lead character played by Tom Cruise, which led to debate among the fandom about whether their relationship could evolve into somerthing romantic.
However, if writer-director Christopher McQuarrie had any plans to introduce this, Ferguson, who also stars in Denis Villeneuve film Dune and Apple TV+ series Silo, would have had words with him.
At the US premiere of Dead Reckoning on Monday (10 July), Ferguson was asked to describe Ilsa and Ethan’s relationship.
She told Variety: “I think how I would describe their relationship is that of fierce devotion, love, that goes beyond any form of relationship substance because it’s boring.”
She continued: “That’s a boring storyline. People sit and they watch it and go, ‘Are they gonna snog?’ And I think, ‘Who the f*** cares?’ Do you know what I mean? We’ve all seen that.
“They’re two very similar characters constantly driven to do what’s best, getting in the way of each other. They are reliably unreliable and that just make the most perfect incomplete characters. They are juxtaposition.”

Dead Reckoning has seen Cruise break an impressive record on review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes.
In a four-star review for The Independent, critic Clarisse Loughrey praised the film for going one better than its predecessor.

“The film is a mirror image of its star – a muscular, extravagant, thoroughly old-school work of ingenuity and craft,” she wrote.
“In it, Ethan Hunt chases two halves of a key with a mysterious connection to the AI across several fabulous international locations: Abu Dhabi, Rome, Venice and the UK (standing in for the Alps). His loyal techies, Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), are always stationed nearby.”
She concluded: “You will leave Dead Reckoning the same way you always do: wondering how Cruise could possibly outdo himself in the next one – until, inevitably, he does.”

,Mission Impossible's Vanessa Kirby Reveals The Most Challenging Thing About Her Dead Reckoning Role,Vanessa Kirby found herself in the middle of one of Mission: Impossible's most beloved tropes.,"In Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1, Vanessa Kirby returns to the role of Alanna Mitsopolis, the arms-dealing White Widow that was first introduced in 2018's Mission: Impossible - Fallout. Having already played the character, Kirby was far more comfortable as the White Widow this time, but there was one rather challenging aspect in Dead Reckoning.
Warning: The following contains spoilers for Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1. If you haven't seen the film yet, you should stop reading now.
Toward the end of the film, we are treated to two White Widows. One is the genuine article, while the other is an imposter under one of the franchise's iconic masks. Under the latex is Hayley Atwell's character, Grace, who is working with Ethan (Tom Cruise). So not only did Kirby portray White Widow, she played Atwell's character pretending to be Grace. ""It was a gift of a challenge,"" the actress told GameSpot.
""That was the confusing thing because it wasn't playing as another character totally,"" Kirby said. ""It was playing another character pretending to be my character. So it was a bit of a mind bend. And I remember several times, we were like, 'Wait, wait, wait. Is this too much like Grace?'""
One might assume finding and playing the differences between Grace and Alanna wouldn't be so difficult, but as Kirby noted, the two only briefly interacted once. So not only is she playing someone pretending to be Alanna, that person knows practically nothing about her.
""She's only been around Alannah or the White Widow for one short scene,"" Kirby said. ""So it's not like she knows who she is, really... I ended up kind of playing a slightly more frozen version of both [characters]. Because I think she was panicking. She was having to make all these life decisions in that moment. And I was sort of doing it on her behalf.""
In the end, the sequence works well and it's something Kirby takes pride in, especially given how close she became to Atwell during production.
""I adored Haley and we'd spent a long time kind of training together in COVID,"" the actress admitted. ""So I knew her well. That was a really beautiful thing. It was actually a complete gift to play someone like her and try and channel that because it was also one of the first things that we shot.""
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1 is in theaters now.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nYW1lc3BvdC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlcy12YW5lc3NhLWtpcmJ5LXJldmVhbHMtdGhlLW1vc3QtY2hhbGxlbmdpbmctdGhpbmctYWJvdXQtaGVyLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLXJvbGUvMTEwMC02NTE1OTY2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-12 21:25:55+00:00,Shea Whigham on the Common Thread Between ‘Mission: Impossible’ and ‘Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse’,"Mission Impossible star Shea Whigham talks how he joined Dead Reckoning, and his most memorable moment with Tom Cruise.","Shea Whigham thought his pursuit of Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker would forever be his toughest assignment, but then Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt quickly proved him wrong in Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.
In Christopher “McQ” McQuarrie’s critically acclaimed seventh chapter of the spy action franchise, Whigham plays Jasper Briggs, a foot soldier for the CIA’s Clandestine Services, and together with his partner Degas (Greg Tarzan Davis), he’s tasked with the tall order of chasing Ethan Hunt around the world. And while his similar role in Todd Phillips’ box office smash hit Joker (2019) would seem like the inspiration for his Mission casting, it was actually his DOD bureaucrat character from the Sam Esmail-directed and Julie Roberts-led Homecoming that piqued McQ’s interest.
“Mission: Impossible – Fallout and Homecoming were nominated for some stuff at one of those functions [24th Critics’ Choice Awards]. And [McQ and I] happened to be behind each other,” Whigham tells The Hollywood Reporter. “And McQ said, ‘I’m gonna write something for you.’ And then all the way in December [2019], I got a very cryptic text from him, saying, ‘Answer in five minutes. I’m calling from a European phone.’ So it was him and Cruise on the other end, and together, they buckled me to my knees.”
In June’s Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Whigham had another notable role as Gwen Stacy’s (Hailee Steinfeld) father, Captain George Stacy. And in a manner that’s similar to Mission: Impossible’s brain trust of McQ, Cruise and co-writer Erik Jendresen, Across the Spider-Verse’s creative team didn’t begin their process with a fully formed script either. Instead, they followed the story wherever it led them, meaning they wrote and rewrote along the way.
“You don’t have a script either way, but both films, Mission and Spider-Man, let you explore and bring something of your own,” Whigham says. “They encourage that process, and I think that’s why they’re both so good.”
Below, during a recent conversation with THR, Whigham also discusses his personal highlights from each of Dead Reckoning Part One’s various locations and sequences.
So what’s the beard for?
I just came off of something called American Primeval. It’s directed by Pete Berg and written by Mark L. Smith, who did The Revenant. So I’m in that world.
Shea Whigham with a full beard? Sold!
(Laughs.) It’s good, man. I’m not gonna lie.

So once you found out that you’d have to do the impossible and chase after Tom Cruise for an entire movie, what was your first order of business?
To be honest with you, I didn’t think I would be chasing him. We don’t work off of a script per se. So that was McQ and Tom at the last minute. We were in Venice, and they were like, “You know what? It feels like you need to chase Ethan all over Venice.” So I was not prepared, let’s say.
You probably don’t audition anymore, so did McQ come to you?
Yeah, I had done this piece called Homecoming with Julia Roberts, and serendipitously enough, Mission: Impossible – Fallout and Homecoming were nominated for some stuff at one of those functions [24th Critics’ Choice Awards]. And we happened to be behind each other. And McQ said, “I’ve seen Homecoming.” And I said, “I’ve loved your stuff ever since The Usual Suspects.” And he said, “I’m gonna write something for you.” And I said, “Great!” That was in January of [2019], and then all the way in December, I got a very cryptic text from him, saying, “Answer in five minutes. I’m calling from a European phone.” So it was him and Cruise on the other end, and together, they buckled me to my knees.
There’s a video from the first day of shooting, which was Tom’s motorcycle jump. And once he went over the edge of the cliff, most of the cast started laughing as a way to cope with the terror of the moment. How did you handle it?
First of all, I was really surprised, because he rode by us while hanging off of a helicopter, with this look of relaxation. Then I had to walk away and be by myself during the actual jump itself. That’s when the enormity of the ramp and the actual jump really hit me. My heart was really pumping for Tom in that moment. I was palpably nervous.
What’s your impression of Tom and McQ as a duo?
They’re exactly what I want out of collaborators. They are cinephiles. They love cinema. And the only director I’ve heard talk about film as much as them is Marty [Scorsese]. I did Boardwalk Empire and The Wolf of Wall Street with him. So we ended up talking cinema all the time.
Well, in most action movies with a famous character, there’s often another character who delivers a line or a speech about the mythic hero of the story. David Strathairn’s “Jesus Christ, that’s Jason Bourne” comes to mind. And early on, you get to do that by delivering the myth of Ethan Hunt. So did you recognize right away what your purpose was?
First of all, McQ and Tom were very excited because we had access to an Osprey through the military, and that’s the first time it’s been used in a film. But I knew that someone had to try and track down Ethan. I said to them early on, “Look, I love Midnight Run and The Fugitive because I cared about those somewhat left-of-center characters.” Every guy trying to chase the “bad guy” is usually straight down the [middle], and I was interested in obtusely trying to nab Ethan. To keep me interested, I wanted to make it personal and not have to divulge that in some soliloquy. But it’s there. So, yeah, I had a feeling that was gonna be my lot in this film.
Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis in Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One Paramount Pictures and Skydance
Jasper Briggs, along with his partner Degas (Greg Tarzan Davis), eventually recognize, to varying degrees, that Hunt may not be the enemy here. Did you look at Tommy Lee Jones’ character in The Fugitive as an example to follow?
We talked about it, and like I said, I talked about Midnight Run quite a bit. [Charles] Grodin and Dennis Farina. But it was definitely brought up because we’re in a chase film. And you’re right, the audience knows that Hunt is Hunt. So how are you gonna keep that interesting if you’re not able to fully catch him? But, yeah, he starts to show himself to me as it progresses. This was no different than Boardwalk Empire or Silver Linings Playbook. You start with copious amounts of information, and then you whittle it down. You basically answer those big questions of, “What do I want? And how do I serve this story?”
Briggs was the name of a character on the ‘60s TV series [Steven Hill’s Dan Briggs], so did McQ give you any indication if your character’s name is more than just a tip of the cap?
I better not say anything right now.
The film was obviously shut down early due to Covid, but then it resumed later that summer. Did you work steadily until it wrapped?
I worked steadily. We were in a strange time, obviously, as the world was. We pulled up stakes in Venice and had to split because of Covid. So we didn’t know what was gonna happen, but then we got the call from Tom who said, “We’re going in. We’re gonna try to be the canary in the coal mine and figure out how to do this.” So we stayed in place in Norway, and when we went to Rome, we stayed, even if you weren’t working. I wasn’t supposed to be in the Venice portion of it, but as it went along and we uncovered things, it blossomed into more of a role. So we stayed wherever we were, and we had some starts and stops. We had a two-week hold in Venice when we went back there again. So it was tough to actually complete this piece.
So I’d love to go through each location and just do a travelogue of sorts. What was your personal highlight from each location’s sequence, starting with Abu Dhabi International Airport?
That was massive. That’s when Tom’s influence really hit home. He had the Prince give us access to this airport that’s about to be the largest in the world, I believe. They weren’t open yet when we shot there. So we had the full run of it, and that’s when I felt the immensity of the place and what these films mean to the world.
And what about the zany insanity on the streets of Rome?
Rome holds a special place. I’ve been to Rome several times, and to be on the Via dei Fori Imperiali, looking at what was the [Roman] Forum and thinking of the history …. To shut that down and have the ability to do my own driving through the small streets, that’s when I knew I was in a big film again.
Night shoots in Venice …
Venice was quiet. No one was in Venice when we were there [the second time]. When we were there initially, there was going to be a big party and we were going to use this festival that was going on. And so these guys pivoted off of that, but the party still took place there [in the club]. It was lovely because we actually got a chance to explore Venice with no one there. So it was beautiful and somewhat haunting. While we were there, we would island hop, and that was a really special time. It was a bonding time as well because we all stayed together as a group.
And the pièce de résistance of your experience, standing atop a moving train in Norway.
(Laughs.) That was right away at the start of filming. We filmed that first, and I just remember the inherent beauty of the valley that we were in. McQ was on top of the train, directing us in what we called a clamshell. And then I stepped up there and tried to take Ethan down. And I remember Tom looked at me and said, “Is this as good as it gets?” And I said to him, “I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else, but right here, right now.” But that was tough, filming on that speeding train. It was cold. Another thing I’ll never forget is McQ saying, “This was one of the top-three days of filming I’ve ever experienced in my life.” So I knew that was pretty profound because of what they’ve already been through together.
Dead Reckoning Part Two is nearly halfway complete. Do you still have a ways to go before you finish your role in all this?
Oh yeah! I go back in August and shoot all fall. We’re gonna be in London and a place yet to be named. I don’t believe they know yet, but it’ll be somewhere sexy, as usual. (Laughs.) So, yes, I have a lot to do, and we have quite a bit to do still. Like I said, these guys are cinephiles. They love to shoot and they love being on the floor, as we say. They’ll shoot [Dead Reckoning Part Two] right up until the release date just to make it better. They’ll drill down on it and keep making it better and better.
Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis in Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One Paramount Pictures and Skydance
So Tarzan [Davis] told me last year that you helped him out with his various self-tapes during filming and that you really made a difference in his approach to acting and auditions. And my theory at the time was that your inclination to help the next generation of actors began with your own kid’s [Giorgia Whigham] self-tapes. Is that somewhat accurate?
No, to be honest with you, I don’t really even talk about acting with my kid. It’s her own journey, and she wants it to be that way. I’ve said, “I’m there if you need me,” but I stay out of the way. And it’s probably best that it be her journey, her struggle and her triumphs.
But Tarzan came out of the gates in Top Gun: Maverick, and now he’s doing back-to-back Mission: Impossible movies. And I’ve told him, “You don’t know what you don’t know.” I’m not talking down to him; you just don’t know how hard it is to actually be an actor and have success. And to come out of the gate with these three films, I laugh all the time about it with McQ and Tom. He’s three for three with these three films. So he really wants to be a good actor, and I’ve passed on whatever knowledge I have.
Do you think you wanted to help him because you somewhat miss the grind of those early days?
Well, it’s not because I miss it. When I’m working, I see a lot of this younger generation, and I have a real reverence for people who came before me. When I worked with De Niro, Hopkins and some other heavies, I always made sure they knew that I knew their stuff and that I knew they paved the way. And I felt like Tarzan wanted to have some of that. He wanted some of the stories about when I was working with De Niro and Buscemi and Hopkins, and so it just became an organic process. He had some tapes, I looked at them and I said, “I think we can tighten them up a little bit.” And he got something good off of one of them. I think it was Grey’s Anatomy.

So I first said this to Hailee Steinfeld last month, but your scenes together in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse were the best scenes in the movie. She said the two of you recorded your stuff separately at first, but then you eventually re-recorded a lot of it together. Could you feel the difference once you were together?
Yes, we really found something there. Lord and Miller brought us in and it was just so smart. With me having a 25-year-old daughter, we found some really good organic stuff in there. To tell you the truth, I didn’t really know what I was getting into with Spider-Man. I’d seen the first one. My kids were into it and had me watch it. And when Across came along, I didn’t realize how gratifying it would be to do it. I loved it. So we would go back in and tighten it, and then I would bring stuff in. But at the heart of it, they let me do what I would normally do in live-action. So I was pleasantly surprised with how it turned out.
Hailee also said that she never really got a proper script, which sounds a lot like Mission in that both stories are written and rewritten on the fly. Does each process feel similar to you?
Yeah, I didn’t even think about it like that. Mission is like nothing I’ve ever done before and will ever do again. I’m sure of it. When I worked with Terry Malick and Christian Bale, there was no script, but it had parameters of what it was going to be. The Mission guys talked about this film for two-and-a-half years along with Erik Jendresen, who helps write with McQ. But you’re right. You don’t have a script either way, but both films, Mission and Spider-Man, let you explore and bring something of your own. They encourage that process, and I think that’s why they’re both so good. They don’t make films like Mission: Impossible anymore, where it’s that practical and every character gets a moment. You actually care about the characters in this big action film, and they just don’t make them anymore like Tom makes them. His love of film just comes through, and you can feel it emanating off of him and McQ.
Lastly, before you were chasing after Ethan Hunt, you were chasing after the Joker. Are you back for more in Joker 2?
I am not back in Joker 2, no. I don’t think things ended well for me in Joker. There was a pummeling going on when they panned off of me.

2023-07-10 21:53:33+00:00,Mission Impossible – Dead Reckoning Review: Tom Cruise Has No Peers,"In Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1, Tom Cruise has proven that he's not a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood, he is THE force.","Tom Cruise has been one of the most recognizable stars in Hollywood for, literally, my entire life. The original Top Gun (1986) came out nearly 10 years before I was born (1995), so I’ve never known a Hollywood landscape without Tom Cruise playing a major part in it. But somewhere in the 2010s it felt like Cruise had entered his “just a guy” era. Movies like Jack Reacher, Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, and The Mummy all made technically decent money. But nothing that jumped off the page to say that Tom Cruise was a big box office draw anymore. Maybe after a couple decades of being a huge star, the big Cinematic Universe machine had finally passed him by. Or so we might have thought. Looking at it now, though, with the trio of Fallout, Top Gun: Maverick, and now Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 1 in the past few years, Tom Cruise has proven that not only is he still, at age 61, a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood but he is THE force. Dead Reckoning Part 1 confirms what we’ve known. Tom Cruise has no peers today as a movie star.
Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Synopsis
Mission: Impossible – Dead Recoking Part One Official Trailer
In Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team embark on their most dangerous mission yet: To track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity before it falls into the wrong hands. With control of the future and the fate of the world at stake, and dark forces from Ethan’s past closing in, a deadly race around the globe begins. Confronted by a mysterious, all-powerful enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than his mission – not even the lives of those he cares about most.
Upping the Stakes
As the 7th film in the Mission: Impossible franchise, and following up the most successful film in the series to date, Dead Reckoning looks to heighten the stakes in every way for Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt. Obviously the fate of the world being on the line isn’t new territory for a movie like this. But Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1 weaves a thrilling, if a bit contrived, web of a story about a complicated AI weapon that feels especially timely given *waves hands vaguely* everything. While it’d be easy for a story about world-eating artificial intelligence to feel completely detached from real human stakes, Dead Reckoning does a great job of giving viewers plenty of characters to latch onto.
Hayley Atwell hangs with Tom Cruise every step of the way in Dead Reckoning
A Strong Supporting Cast
The stakes are a testament to the performances as well. You already know what Tom Cruise brings to the table. But beyond that, the supporting cast members, especially series newcomers and MCU-alumnae Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff, are all well-aware of what movie they’re in and they provide the perfect amount of bad-ass sexy international criminal energy that a movie like this needs. Obviously no one is going to catch an Oscar nomination for their work here. But in order for a movie like Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning to work, there can be no weak links in the action or the dialogue that take away from how cool everything and everyone you’re seeing on screen are. And I’m happy to report that there are no weak links here.
Dead Reckoning‘s main villain Gabriel (Esai Morales) is equally off-putting, dangerous, and kinda hot. Gabriel is the scariest possible manifestation of the AI/Crypto bros we’ve all come to despise on Twitter. He’s a fanatic who follows the AI unflinchingly to the point it’s become his God. And as annoying as that could have been, Morales makes it work by being fascinating to watch. Morales actually does what Rami Malek was trying to do in No Time To Die with the slow-talking heavy accent thing.
Esai Morales plays a fantastic villain in Gabriel
Tom Cruise Stands Alone
Ultimately, as good as the supporting cast and the plot are, that’s not why we’re here. As the great philosopher of our time Nicole Kidman said, we come to this place for MAGIC. And for the past few years, no one in Hollywood has single-handedly provided us with more movie magic than Tom Cruise.
Say whatever you want to about the Church of Scientology, or jumping on Oprah’s couch, or whatever thing you might want to knock Tom Cruise for. But at the end of the day, who am I to deny this man who has consistently risked both life and limb, purely for my entertainment, his rightful due?
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One | The Biggest Stunt in Cinema History (Tom Cruise)
Whether it’s jumping out of an airplane, climbing the world’s tallest building, or doing a motorcycle jump off a mountain, we know that Tom Cruise lives and breathes for this shit. I don’t know why he does it. Maybe he has a death wish. Maybe he’s had a mid-life crisis. Perhaps he’s wanted to do all of this stuff forever and he’s just now finding a way to make other people pay for it. I don’t care why. What I do care about is that every second of Tom Cruise doing cool shit on screen, and there’s a lot of that in Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1, feels authentic and spell-binding. At my screening, you could feel the entire theater shifting to the edge of their seats for stunts. You could hear the child-like glee and amazement of grown adults who just watched Tom Cruise do the craziest shit they’d ever seen.
There are certain things in life that elicit a communal “OHHHHHHHHHHH” reaction. If you’ve ever been in a packed gym for a basketball game where someone did something absolutely amazing, it feels like that. And getting to be a part of it in person feels incredible.
The crowd reaction is so good.
Nothing like a hot crowd for a basketball game. pic.twitter.com/Z2Z8yNlzAs — De’Vion Hinton (@LordDexHinton) July 8, 2023
I never thought I’d feel that in a movie theater. But there’s a stunt sequence in Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1 that got that reaction out of my crowd at the screening I went to. Through sheer force of will and movie star badassery, Tom Cruise had my Tuesday night movie screening sounding like a basketball game.
You can keep the Keanu Reeves of the world. Brad Pitt, Leo, Matt Damon, Christian Bale, whatever MCU star you want to name. It doesn’t matter. Tom Cruise has no rivals and no equals as a movie star. He is a cinematic event unto himself. And we may never see anyone like him again.
Enjoy him while you can. And do so on the biggest possible movie screen you can find. Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1 is yet another can’t miss moment in an already incomprehensible legacy. It’s one of them ones.
Grade: A+
Recommendation: IMAX, Dolby, RPX, whatever you got at your local cinema. Go to that shit.

2023-07-15 14:00:00+00:00,How Tom Cruise Got Us to Forget About His Scientology Ties,Star of ‘Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One’ has avoided any and all Scientology questions and instead painted himself as Movie Savior.,There are movie stars and then there is Tom Cruise. Forty years a star", enough classics to make listing even a few here pointless, and, now, someone who can stake a legitimate claim to saving Hollywood (or at least jolting some life into that lazy, bloated monstrosity). Last year’s Top Gun: Maverick, with its millions at the box office, helped rescue the movies and movie theaters from the brink of Covid-19 and streaming. This year’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, the seventh and ostensibly penultimate installment of the secret agent series, should reach similar heights. Tom Cruise is as big as he’s ever been — a feat as staggering as any Ethan Hunt stunt.,
Because then there’s all the other stuff. The Scientology of it all. The Church’s interminable history of alleged abuses and misconduct and Cruise’s status as its most prominent figure, a high-ranking member with deep ties to leader David Miscavige. Cruise has been a Scientologist for nearly as long as he’s been a star, his introduction to the Church reportedly brokered around 1986 (the same year Top Gun came out) by his first wife Mimi Rogers. A lot has allegedly happened in that time, from the harrowing accusations against the Church itself (abuse, trafficking, forced labor, to name a few, all of which the Church has denied), to the various claims about Cruise’s relationship with it (the alleged arrangement of romantic partners, for one, which the Church has also denied).,,,
And yet, none of it’s ever really caught up with Cruise, let alone dragged him down. Even Alex Gibney, who directed the damning Scientology doc Going Clear (based on Lawrence Wright’s book of the same name), admitted to Rolling Stone recently that he was “surprised” Cruise had avoided any kind of reckoning.,,,,,,,,,
“There are stories about him that, if one could get people to go on the record, would be shocking,” Gibney said. “But they have to be willing to do it. And so far, they haven’t been.” (Cruise did not respond to a request for comment.) Editor’s picks,,,,,,,,,

It’s easy to let one’s imagination run wild with known unknowns (just ask Donald Rumsfeld — or don’t, actually); but the thing is, there’s already a lot we do know about Tom Cruise and Scientology. It’s not some nasty secret stashed away. It barely qualifies as dirty laundry at this point. We’ve had years of tell-alls, exposés, memoirs, documentaries, lawsuits, even one unforgettable episode of South Park. At the most recent Oscars and Golden Globes, where Top Gun: Maverick was fêted with multiple nominations (and even won an Academy Award for Best Sound), hosts Jimmy Kimmel and Jerrod Carmichael both joked about it. They weren’t even subtle or winking, like the kind of jokes 30 Rock made about Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein years before the full extent of their alleged transgressions were revealed. Carmichael flat-out said the three Golden Globes Cruise returned in protest of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association should be exchanged for Shelly Miscavige — David’s wife, who hasn’t been seen in public since 2007.,,
With Tom Cruise, it’s yet to reach the point where we, as a culture, are devastated, disheveled, distraught, screaming, “He can’t keep getting away with it!” He remains deeply beloved, and not even in an unsettling, upsetting way, like some of our other prominent problematic actors. And it has everything to do with the way Cruise has thrown himself completely into his work over the past 10 years or so — the way he’s effectively replaced Scientology with a different public-facing religion: The Movies.,,,
There was a brief window where it was possible the Tom Cruise/Scientology partnership would end in some kind of mutual assured destruction. The man was on an absolute tear in the mid-2000s, railing against psychology and pharmaceuticals, scolding Brooke Shields for taking antidepressants, then doubling down during a contentious interview with Matt Lauer. It was a time when Cruise was willing to sit down with a major publication like Rolling Stone for a wide-ranging, on-the-record interview, and give quotes like: “If you really want to know, get What Is Scientology?, the book, and look at it, because that’s what Scientology is. It’s a very large body of knowledge with tools that are available. It’s ah… it really is the shit, man.” Related,,,
Shockingly, this didn’t exactly endear Cruise or the Church to the culture at large. A 2008 incident is telling: Hackers obtained and leaked an internal Church video that featured Cruise, full Steve Jobs mode in a black turtleneck, extolling the virtues of Scientology; there was also footage of Cruise accepting the Church’s “Freedom Medal of Valor” and saluting Miscavige. In response, the Church not only tried to wipe the video from the web, but cast doubt on its authenticity, claiming it was “pirated and edited.” By the end of that year, Cruise was apologizing to Lauer for acting “arrogant” and declining to answer interviewer questions about Scientology.,,,,,,
The first half of the 2010s saw more bad press with the release of Wright’s book and Gibney’s doc, as well as the high-profile defection of Leah Remini. Cruise even endured some self-inflicted wounds after filing a defamation suit against the tabloid Life & Style, which had run a story claiming Cruise had abandoned his daughter, Suri, with ex-wife Katie Holmes. In a 2013 deposition, he was forced to admit that Scientology had played a role in his divorce from Holmes, and that Holmes told him she wanted to protect their daughter from the Church. (The lawsuit ultimately settled out of court.),,,,,,,
But by that point, Cruise had weathered the worst of the storm he’d largely wrought upon himself. His M.O. was simple: keep quiet and make movies — and the movies he made were good. Thanks to a creative partnership with writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, he revived the Mission: Impossible franchise and also dropped a few fan favorites, like Jack Reacher and Edge of Tomorrow. (The two also worked together on The Mummy, though, so clearly no one’s perfect.),,,,,,,,
Action flicks have always been a core component of the Cruise oeuvre; but after a versatile first 20 years as an actor, his focus narrowed on them in the 2000s, and since then, that focus seems to have only hardened into a raison d’être. There’s little doubt Cruise loves these kinds of movies and the work that goes into not only doing the stunts, but building the characters and stories to make those set pieces worthwhile. But “Tom Cruise, Action Hero” is also an appealing prospect and PR win: If you’re an organization beset by controversy and accusation, why wouldn’t you want your poster boy constantly saving the world?,,,,,,,
But action flicks have suited Cruise similarly well in this era of muted public association with Scientology. Amidst the ceaseless rise of green screen tech and CGI tricks, and the Marvel-ization of blockbuster cinema, Cruise remains one of the crazy, blessed few still willing to throw himself out of a plane in service of the noble causes of storytelling and entertainment. That willingness to fully embody Ethan Hunt or Pete “Maverick” Mitchell is a great way to make people not necessarily forget, but stop worrying so much about L. Ron Hubbard, or Xenu, or Shelly Miscavige. Or from wondering, when was the last time Tom Cruise saw his daughter?,,,,,,
It certainly helped, too, that whenever Cruise went out to promote one of his new movies, he was never asked about any of that. Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation came out just a few months after Gibney’s Going Clear in 2015, and there’s nothing in the press cycle to suggest the doc was ever broached with Cruise on record. (One reporter got a very generic comment from Cruise the following year at the London premiere of Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, the actor calling Scientology a “beautiful religion” and “something that has helped me incredibly in my life.”) Instead, in these heavily moderated interviews and red carpet chats, he mostly talked about The Movies — his current movie, his next movie, his old movies, other people’s movies, and, maybe his favorite topic of all, the process of making movies.
Cruise would’ve probably kept chugging along like this, but Covid-19 added a new dimension. When audio leaked in late 2020 of Cruise upbraiding Mission: Impossible crew members for not following pandemic protocols, the overall reaction was less shock, more awe. His dedication to making this movie was absolute, imbued with a clear-eyed understanding of the existential threat Covid-19 posed to the film industry. He backed up those words with the fight to keep Top Gun: Maverick off streaming and ensure it safely landed in theaters. He was handsomely rewarded with box office receipts, rave reviews, and respect from his peers. “You saved Hollywood’s ass,” Steven Spielberg told him at an Oscars luncheon earlier this year, “you might have saved theatrical distribution. Seriously.”,,,,,
Even at the height of his public association with Scientology, The Movies were like a kind of religion for Cruise. In 2002, when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences needed someone to validate the existence and value of film and the film industry after 9/11, it called on Cruise, and he delivered. You can see shades of it as far back as 1984, two years before his introduction to Scientology, in the way he discusses movies as a vehicle for betterment and serenity: “I’m interested in my personal growth, what’s going to make me happy. Not how much money am I gonna make, not what film is gonna really make me more visible.”,,,,,
But without the pandemic, Cruise’s embrace of The Movies as his public-facing religion may not have reached such a full expression. What he says about The Movies hasn’t really changed that much, but now it’s shot through with the aura of the savior. With that irrepressible conviction and charisma, he has that preacher’s ability to turn repeated platitudes into mantras or prayers. (Seriously, his reliance on the bit about how, ever since he was four he wanted nothing more than to make movies and travel the world, has arguably surpassed Lady Gaga/100-people-in-a-room levels of ridiculousness — and yet it’s still kinda charming). And what other way is there to look at Cruise’s stunt work than the fearless devotions of a man willing to martyr himself for the thing he loves?,,,,,,,
This is not to argue that The Movies has supplanted the Church of Scientology in Cruise’s private life, too. Despite the public distance, there’s no evidence that Cruise has recently drifted from, left, or ever intends to leave the Church. And therein lies the obvious complication: Tom Cruise, Action Hero was already a reliable way to take people’s minds off Tom Cruise, Scientologist; Tom Cruise, Action Hero and Savior of The Movies, is even better. The benefit to Cruise is clear — the continuation of his career and copious amounts of goodwill. You can even speculate as to the benefit for the Church itself: After all the bad press, investigations, and lawsuits, with membership reportedly declining, Cruise’s success may still be a beacon for those in it, a totem to clutch and claim only they understand its true value and power.
As for the rest of us, we seem to have reached a cordial stalemate with Cruise. We’ve delayed his reckoning — maybe forever, maybe only for now — allowed him to float above the level of a Mark Wahlberg, or worse, a Mel Gibson. And that’s because, as much as Tom Cruise, Action Hero and Savior of the Movies is good PR, it’s also who he is, who he’s always been. Despite everything else he believes, he still believes in The Movies.,,,,
There’s a famous tidbit about how Thomas Cruise Mapother IV spent a year in seminary school as a teenager before he started acting. Tom Cruise has always insisted Thomas Mapother was never actually close to becoming a priest, but the episode still encapsulates the zealous streak in his character, an irrepressible yearning for knowledge and understanding, his belief in, or need for, a higher calling or power. And before he found an outlet for all that in Scientology, he found it in acting and making movies. It’s still there. The proof is everywhere, even when he’s just looking a camera dead in the eye, smiling, and saying, “I love my popcorn. Movies," popcorn.”""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yb2xsaW5nc3RvbmUuY29tL3R2LW1vdmllcy90di1tb3ZpZS1mZWF0dXJlcy90b20tY3J1aXNlLXNjaWVudG9sb2d5LW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1tb3ZpZS1zYXZpb3ItMTIzNDc4OTAxNS_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucm9sbGluZ3N0b25lLmNvbS90di1tb3ZpZXMvdHYtbW92aWUtZmVhdHVyZXMvdG9tLWNydWlzZS1zY2llbnRvbG9neS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctbW92aWUtc2F2aW9yLTEyMzQ3ODkwMTUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,
,Tom Cruise Gives Update on Plans to Film a Movie in Space: 'Working on It Diligently',Tom Cruise teased that his film set to be shot in outer space is still in the works: 'We’ll see where we go',"Tom Cruise is still charting his work trip to space.
Back in 2020 it was revealed that the actor was planning to film a movie in outer space.
While at the Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One premiere in New York City this week, Cruise, 61, was asked about the status of the space-exploring film.
“We’ve been working on it diligently,” he teased to Variety. “We’ll see where we go.”
The project was first announced by NASA back in 2020, days after a report came out claiming Cruise was looking to space for cinematic inspiration.
NASA director Jim Bridenstein led the charge: “NASA is excited to work with @TomCruise on a film aboard the @Space_Station! We need popular media to inspire a new generation of engineers and scientists to make @NASA’s ambitious plans a reality.”
Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, tacked onto the excitement. “Should be a lot of fun!"" Musk replied in a tweet.

Weeks later, Deadline reported that the project had confirmed Doug Liman to direct. Cruise and Liman previously worked together on 2014's Edge of Tomorrow and 2017's American Made.
Two years later, Universal Pictures executive Donna Langley confirmed the movie’s production in an interview with BBC News.
“I think Tom Cruise is taking us to space. He's taking the world to space,"" Langley said. ""That's the plan. We have a great project in development with Tom that does contemplate him doing just that, taking a rocket up to the Space Station and shooting and hopefully being the first civilian to do a space walk outside of the Space Station.""
The upcoming film, which Langley said Cruise pitched to her over a Zoom call during the pandemic, has a budget in the area of $200 million, according to Variety.

“During the pandemic he asked for a Zoom call with us and got onto the call and said, 'Guys, I've got this great project and here it is,' "" Langley said. ""The majority of the story actually takes place on Earth and then the character needs to go up to space to save the day.”
While Cruise works “diligently” on his space film, he is currently rolling out his latest Mission: Impossible movie. While Dead Reckoning Part One can be found in theaters now, writer/director Christopher McQuarrie admitted that Part Two is yet to be completed.
“We finish this tour, and on our way back to the U.K. we stop to scout along the way. We hit the ground running as soon as we get back,” McQuarrie told Variety. “I get two days of vacation between here and Tokyo and I’m back on.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS90b20tY3J1aXNlLWdpdmVzLXVwZGF0ZS1wbGFucy1maWxtLW1vdmllLWluLXNwYWNlLXdvcmtpbmctb24taXQtNzU2MDMwMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

2023-06-26 20:08:41+00:00,Only Tom Cruise can save Hollywood from a summer of box office bombs,"""The Flash"" disappointed, but Tom Cruise's “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,"" out July 12, should do big box office, just like ""Top Gun: Maverick.""","Success at the summer box office this year has so far been mostly Mission: Impossible.
So much for the $2.3 billion “Avatar: The Way of Water” raked in last Christmas — movie theaters are back to being an armory of high-profile bombs.
This weekend, wobbly Warner Bros.’ “The Flash” dropped a staggering 73% in its second week to a worldwide total of just $210 million. A more-than-50% decline for an expensive DC Comics superhero film spells trouble.
Consider that fellow Justice League member “Aquaman” made $229 million by his second weekend in the US and Canada alone.
Pixar’s uninspired “Elemental,” released June 16 and so far having grossed $121 million, will wind up as one of the Disney-owned animation studio’s biggest failures ever.
In contrast, five years ago this month, “The Incredibles 2” grossed $1.2 billion.
Disney’s live-action “The Little Mermaid” has made a $500 million trickle, which is less than half of 2017’s remake of “The Lion King.”

And “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” starring 80-year-old Harrison Ford, is projected to open this weekend to just $60 million domestically — $40 million less than 2008’s “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.”
The movie industry is trapped in an existential “Temple of Doom.” Disney execs staring at these numbers probably look like the guy in “Raiders of the Lost Ark” when his face melts off.
The only bright spot so far this summer has been Sony’s animated “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” with $560 million worldwide.

Only one man can save struggling movie theater chains. Again.
As if summoned by a desperate prayer, Tom Cruise will parachute in on July 12 with Paramount’s “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.”
The film is expected to open domestically to about $90 million over five days — setting a possible record for the seven-film franchise — and heaps more internationally.
If I were Cruise, I’d be jumping up and down on Oprah’s couch. Because I would know full well that I am the only reliably bankable movie star left.

It’s not an exaggeration to say that in May 2022 as theaters were hobbling along, Cruise and his (sometimes irate) efforts to finish and release “Top Gun: Maverick” rescued cinemas around the world that had been sitting empty.
“Maverick” was a sequel to a 36-year-old movie that millennials and Gen Z-ers who regularly flock to Marvel films couldn’t care less about. Older fans of the heartthrob-filled original had no clue if it would be any good.
But the action movie opened the Cannes Film Festival, received euphoric reviews and ultimately grossed $1.49 billion worldwide.
Harking back to the monolithic cultural moment of “Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens,” seemingly everybody saw “Maverick.”

You see, what 60-year-old Cruise has managed in this phase of his career, quite brilliantly, is to become synonymous with Entertainment.
Not prestige, not awards, not sexiness nor hilarity — a Cruise movie simply means a fantastic time had by all.
Five years ago, I gave “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” four stars and called the franchise “the best ongoing action series out there.”
Its consistent sky-high quality is, in large part, because of Cruise’s well-known insistence on doing his own stunts. His overachieving attitude makes his thrill-ride movies more tactile and real than anything else in the genre.
Marvel films, especially the woeful “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” feel increasingly like a 2.5-hour green screen exercise that audiences struggle to connect with.
In “Dial of Destiny,” a very obviously CGI Ford runs on top of a moving train. The sequence is alarmingly fake and hard to believe.
That Cruise regularly puts himself in harm’s way for the sake of a scene has become well-known to average moviegoers.
Plus he does it with nuclear charm and unrelenting intensity, and we feel going in that he has worked extraordinarily hard for our money.
I suspect that in three weeks Cruise and Paramount will make a ton of it.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2LzI2L3RvbS1jcnVpc2UtbmVlZHMtdG8tc2F2ZS1tb3ZpZXMtYWdhaW4v0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvMjYvdG9tLWNydWlzZS1uZWVkcy10by1zYXZlLW1vdmllcy1hZ2Fpbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

2023-07-05 17:29:51+00:00,'Mission: Impossible 7' Reviews Love Those Tom Cruise Stunts,Tom Cruise drops another theatrical must-see with 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One.',"The first reviews for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One are pouring in, and critics are once again praising Tom Cruise for delivering yet another cinematic extravaganza that demands to be seen on the big screen.
Riding high from the record-breaking success of Top Gun: Maverick, Cruise returns as IMF agent Ethan Hunt in this seventh installment of the wildly popular spy series that continues to find new ways for the actor to risk his neck. (This time around, a death-defying motorcycle jump.) While franchises like The Fast and the Furious are starting to show wear and tear, Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie seemed to have pulled off the impossible mission of keeping Dead Reckoning fresh and exciting even if it doesn’t quite top Mission: Impossible – Fallout. At least according to some critics.
You can see what the early reviews are saying below:
Mike Ryan, Uproxx:
I truly get that McQuarrie really wanted to take on this AI idea and that, he’s correct in thinking so, it does feel like a very pertinent issue – at least more than another movie where someone wants to blow something up. This does seem like McQuarrie’s meditation on AI and the dangerous direction we are headed. But it does take a lot of setup and a long way to get there, which after a while does start to feel heavy on the exposition and a bit confusing. (Or, at least, about as confusing as most James Bond movies.) But once all the teams all start chasing the keys, it’s a lot of fun.
Peter Debruge, Variety:
As always, the plot is but an excuse for ever more elaborate set-pieces, executed so convincingly that Cruise has acquired a reputation for carrying out all the insane things Hunt is called upon to do in the movie. That’s a testament to more than just the marketing department; Cruise really is committed to topping his previous feats, and though there’s no shortage of good old-fashioned movie magic involved (in the editing and visual effects), the crew does a terrific job of making “Dead Reckoning” look real. At a moment when nearly every other franchise, from Marvel to “Avatar,” has embraced the fake look of CG cartoons, “Mission: Impossible” appears the most practical: So much of what we see really was captured on camera, and that makes all the difference.
David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter:
In terms of sheer entertainment, the movie has plenty to offer. Editor Eddie Hamilton keeps his foot on the accelerator with breathless pacing, and cinematographer Fraser Taggart’s dynamic camerawork keeps the visuals fluid and exciting. Much of the propulsion is also due to Lorne Balfe’s pounding score, incorporating a thunderous remix of the classic Lalo Schifrin TV theme music.
Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian:
Already, the keynote stunt has become a legend: the one on the poster, the one he reportedly did – for real – six times in one day before he was satisfied. Tom Cruise’s compact body floats free of the motorbike as it drops to earth from between his diamond-hard thighs, having launched him with a throaty roar off an unfeasibly high cliff-edge; he sails through the sky, pulls the ripcord on a nifty little parachute, and swoops down towards … the speeding Orient Express, fully intent on the traditional carriage-top punch-up. We gasped in the audience. Someone behind me went: “Oh shi-i-i …” Carly Simon should have come in with a new song: Fair Enough, Somebody Does It Better.
Todd McCarthy, Deadline:
They should call it Mission: Exceptional. Given that this is a series that began on television 57 years ago and over the past 27 years has delivered seven big feature films, no one would be terribly surprised if it were to begin flagging a bit. But Tom Cruise & Co. will have none of that; to the contrary, this new entry, officially called Dead Reckoning Part One, ramps up the excitement and sheer flat-out impressiveness to a new level.
Brian Tallerico, RogerEbert.com:
Once again, director Christopher McQuarrie, Cruise, and their team have crafted a deceptively simple thriller, a film that bounces good, bad, and in-between characters off each other for 163 minutes (an admittedly audacious runtime for a film with “Part One” in the title that somehow doesn’t feel long). Some of the overcooked dialogue about the importance of this particular mission gets repetitive, but then McQuarrie and his team will reveal some stunningly conceived action sequence that makes all the spy-speak tolerable. Hollywood is currently questioning the very state of their industry. Leave it to Ethan Hunt to accept the mission.
David Ehrlich, IndieWire:
Ridiculous from the start but also strangely fresh for yet another 21st century tentpole about a rogue A.I., “Dead Reckoning Part One” may not be the best movie in the “Mission: Impossible” franchise — there’s no topping the raw adrenaline rush of “Fallout,” and McQuarrie is smart enough not to try — but this extravagantly entertaining Dolby soap opera nails what the “Mission: Impossible” franchise does best: Weaponizing artifice and illusion in order to fight for a world that’s still worth believing in.
Alex Godfrey, Empire:
Every set-piece is a joy, even though there’s a slight nagging sense, here and there, of deja-vu. The same could be said of the film’s flesh-and-bones villain, Esai Morales’ Gabriel, the human face of the more abstract A.I. threat, giving Ethan someone to punch on top of trains. Gabriel is a solid but somewhat serviceable character, and certainly not as memorable as Henry Cavill’s fist-reloading bastard in Fallout. But Fallout is the highest of bars. And as Dead Reckoning Part One hurtles into its third act, everything ramps up, the stakes getting deadlier, the tension getting tenser, Mission once again proving that balls-to-the-wall action films don’t have to be mindless, or humourless, or stupid.

The actress was slated to reprise the role for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, but was forced to drop out due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.

While speaking with Variety on the Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One red carpet, director Christopher McQuarrie spilled a few details on how Angela Bassett would have fit into the new film, while also teasing that we’ll be seeing her again. “ It’s interesting, she was going to be the head of the CIA, she was going to be in that room with all the other heads of the intelligence community that you meet, ” McQuarrie said. “ And we’re not done with Angela Bassett. ” McQuarrie continued, “ Angela is too fabulous. You can never, ever let Angela get away. There’s always a plan in the future. ” Perhaps CIA Director Erika Sloane will return in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two.

The Mission: Impossible franchise has become well-renowned for its use of stunts. While there was no shortage of spectacle in the first couple movies, the series really took off with Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol when there were a number of unbelievable practical stunts such as Tom Cruise running on the sides of the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. It has only continued to escalate with each and every movie with the latest culminating in a series of incredible stunts such as Tom Cruise jumping a motorcycle off of a cliff and a real train being derailed off of a bridge.
If you don't want to know anything about the finale of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, click off this article now. We won't include any plot spoilers, but details of the big final action sequence will be mentioned.
At the end of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, Ethan Hunt and his allies have to board a speeding train to stop the baddies from completing the next step in their master plan. It's quite a spectacle and ends with the a bridge being blown up, sending the train over the edge. Ethan and Grace (Hayley Atwell) end up near the front of the train as it starts to go over, causing a mad dash to race to the back of the train. Ultimately, they end up in a car that is completely dangling off the edge of the bridge. They're then forced to climb seats and other objects that are bolted into the floor of the train as things fall down toward them. The piece of the train car that couples it with the rest of the train is also giving way, meaning they only have limited time to get to the top of the car before it disconnects and falls.
Anyone who has played even five minutes of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is very familiar with that game's big set piece: A sequence where Nathan Drake has to climb up a train that is dangling over the side of a cliff. Many have pointed out how similar Dead Reckoning is to Uncharted 2 and it may not be a coincidence. Director Christopher McQuarrie previously cited Uncharted 3 as an inspiration for the big plane stunt in Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, so the director is very aware of the games. While it's clear the entire train scene is inspired by old school movies like Buster Keaton's The General, it wouldn't be surprising if Cruise and McQuarrie lifted from Naughty Dog's acclaimed adventure game for the beat where Ethan Hunt has to climb the train.

,Hayley Atwell and Simon Pegg Rave About 'Mission: Impossible' Costar Tom Cruise: 'He's Just a Guy',"Hayley Atwell, Simon Pegg and director Chris McQuarrie open up about their relationships with Tom Cruise — and how he's ""just a guy"" who loves making movies","Tom Cruise may be a worldwide movie star, but he’s also “just a guy,"" according to his Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One collaborators.
Despite his enduring fame, Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell and director Chris McQuarrie insist that the actor, 61, is just a man who loves making movies.
Pegg, 53, who plays Benji Dunn in the iconic spy series, told The Times that Cruise is involved “in every part of a film” — from filling its lead role to helping out on-set caterers. “I just don’t think anybody else can be as arsed as he can,” he told the outlet.
The star, who met the Jerry Maguire actor nearly two decades ago, cited the actor’s tendency to do his own stunts while describing his intense dedication to the movies he creates.
“With special effects, you know something is artificial — it removes a degree of tension — so Tom pushes things to the limit, to the point of risking his life,” Pegg said of Cruise.

Atwell, 41, seconded Pegg’s claims of Cruise’s dedication to making movies that audiences will love.
""It’s very rare,"" she told The Times of the Risky Business star’s attention to detail on set, recalling when he gave a runner-slash-aspiring-cinematographer a laminated cinematography guide.
The actress, who plays Grace in the action film, added that — similar to his treatment of everyone on a film set — Cruise values viewers and their experience with a movie above all else.
“He doesn’t want to make movies now to punish an audience,” Atwell told the publication. “He doesn’t want films with the message that if you do not understand this, you’re not smart.”

The Marvel star continued, “I can tell when I watch some movies that the director has made it for themselves. I don’t feel involved or I think, ‘Am I stupid?’ Tom’s not a snob.”
An example of this, Atwell said, was during a script read for a Mission: Impossible film — not Dead Reckoning Part One — when Cruise told the crew that he “didn’t get” a line, which translated to “the audience will not get it” — and thus it was cut.

McQuarrie, 54, the director of several Mission: Impossible movies and a longtime friend of Cruise, echoed Pegg and Atwell’s statements about Cruise’s desire to make movies that are fun for audiences.
“There is an outsized importance placed on Oscars [and] films that not many people are going to see,” he told The Times, noting that it is a phenomenon that he says is a “wedge has been driven into the [film] industry.”
“Are you an artist or an entertainer?” McQuarrie posed, before adding that Cruise — who introduced himself to McQuarrie as a maker of “mass entertainment” in 2006 — does not see these titles as “mutually exclusive.”

Pegg also raved to the publication about Tom’s intense love of movies — the intersection of art and entertainment — and what it means for the future of film.
“People can argue that cinema is frivolous, but it’s not,” he told The Times. “Cinema brings people together at a time we’re pulling apart, and that just added to Tom’s determination to put people in a room together.”
He continued, “The power of cinema is, for him, precious and it’s vital we sustain it.”
The Shaun of the Dead actor also opened up about his personal relationship with Cruise, telling the outlet that he was able to “hack my way through all the bizarre mythology” surrounding the Top Gun star.
“On one side he’s Tom Cruise — this enigmatic film star everyone wants to know about — and on the other he’s just a guy,” Pegg said. “I like being normal with him.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9oYXlsZXktYXR3ZWxsLXNpbW9uLXBlZ2ctcmF2ZS1hYm91dC1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtY29zdGFyLXRvbS1jcnVpc2UtNzU1ODM0NdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

SAVING cinema seemed like an impossible mission. Unless, that is, Tom Cruise chose to accept it.
The fearless actor has, once again, created such an incredible big screen blockbuster that audiences will simply have to pay for a ticket to see it.

After the success of the superb Top Gun: Maverick, that finally got bums in cinema seats after lockdown, Cruise has hit the ground running – and jumping/flying/driving/train hopping – again with this action-packed ride.
The seventh – and without a doubt best – in the excellent MI franchise sees Ethan Hunt (Cruise) back with his Impossible Mission Force, including computer hackers Benji (Simon Pegg) and Ving (Luther Stickell), and martial art fighter Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson).
They are to embark on their most dangerous mission yet: finding a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity if it falls into the wrong hands.
So far, so very Bond, right? In fact, the film starts deep below the Arctic sea, where a submarine full of sweaty Russians watch on a bleeping sonar as they are about to be attacked for a key that’s on board.
It feels like any minute James will appear with a Martini and one-liner.
But, no. This is far superior to anything Danial Craig and his crew have done in the last decade.
The gadgets are better, the storyline sleeker and the stunts... Well, my God. They are beyond anything seen on the big screen before.
Not only do they take your breath away, they make you hold it until all you can produce is a wispy “whoa”.

And it’s not only the death-defying Cruise that risks every bone in his body to avoid green screens in this all-authentic action film.
Hayley Atwell, who plays the pick-pocketing Grace, also throws herself into some serious stunts that see her speeding through the streets of Rome and dangling from fallen train carriages.
Power-mad Alanna Mitsopolis (Vanessa Kirby) purrs her way onto screen again, as well as psychotic baddie Gabriel (Esai Morales).
In my role as film critic I have seen cars chase through the streets of Rome in Fast X and fights happening on top of a runaway train in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny in the past month. Both happen in this MI.
But they are a bit like watching a cartoon – littered with CGI and AI characters.
Cruise and co. put all that to shame. And for that I’d like to thank them.
Now let’s wait for this film to blow up in five… four... three…

2023-07-08 15:00:51+00:00,McQuarrie Rejects Moral Ambiguity in Mission: Impossible Movies,"Christopher McQuarrie rejects moral ambiguity in the Mission: Impossible movies, including Dead Reckoning, where a good guy always wins.","This discussion of the Christopher McQuarrie run of Mission: Impossible movies contains very light spoilers for the newest Mission: Impossible film, Dead Reckoning Part One.
Mission: Impossible – Fallout is a remarkable film for a number of reasons. It is a superb action blockbuster on its own terms. It is a fascinating study of both Tom Cruise as a movie star and the sometimes complicated relationship that the actor has with his audience. It is also a thematic meditation on what the Mission: Impossible films are, as well as the space that they occupy in the modern cultural landscape.
The early Mission: Impossible movies were products of a different time, one that Francis Fukuyama called “the end of history.” There was a moral ambivalence that reflected the post-Cold War milieu. In Brian De Palma’s Mission: Impossible, the hero of the original show, Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), betrays the ideals of a country that had moved past him. By his own admission, co-screenwriter Robert Towne peppered Mission: Impossible 2 with “some chicken-shit misogynism” for flavor.
This is all standard spy movie stuff. These sorts of thrillers are built around morally complex and ambiguous figures. In the new millennium, blockbuster cinema began to lean harder into that moral uncertainty and relativism, depicting heroes who were often conflicted about their decisions and whose actions had unintended consequences. The standard-bearer for this approach might be Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy, one of the century’s great blockbuster achievements.
However, it was also apparent looking at the other iconic spy franchise. Running in parallel with those early ambiguous Mission: Impossible movies, the James Bond films starring Pierce Brosnan had edged into high camp with entries like The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day. The franchise went through a gritty reboot with Casino Royale, casting Daniel Craig as a version of the character who was more introspective and conflicted than his predecessors had been.
As the James Bond movies became heavier, the Mission: Impossible movies became lighter. Brad Bird’s Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol has an energy that occasionally veers into broad slapstick farce as the team works with malfunctioning equipment in high-stakes situations, with producer J.J. Abrams even singling out Bird’s comedic sensibility in pre-release interviews. However, the Mission: Impossible movies wouldn’t truly begin exploring this shift until Christopher McQuarrie took over.
McQuarrie is one of Cruise’s long-term collaborators. Although McQuarrie is now an established director in his own right, he established himself as a screenwriter on The Usual Suspects and first crossed paths with Cruise as the screenwriter of Valkyrie. Cruise has frequently brought McQuarrie on board as a writer on projects being overseen by other directors. He even did an uncredited polish on Ghost Protocol and had a hand in shaping Top Gun: Maverick.
As such, it makes sense that even McQuarrie’s crowd-pleasing blockbusters have a certain “writerly” quality. McQuarrie’s three Mission: Impossible films — Rogue Nation, Fallout, and Dead Reckoning Part One — are all in some ways about exploring what a Mission: Impossible film actually is. Modern pop culture is dominated by franchises and intellectual properties, so what makes Mission: Impossible unique? How do these films stand out from the crowd?
McQuarrie’s films understand that the spy thriller is a genre built around a murky internal morality. These are stories about “realpolitik,” about systems governed by ruthless pragmatism and horrific compromise. These are stories about the sacrifices required by “the greater good,” the inevitability of “the necessary evil.” These are games played in the shadows, in which human lives are measured as statistics and where decency is a luxury that players can seldom afford.
It is notable that McQuarrie’s biggest addition to the Mission: Impossible mythology is the character of Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), whose very name evokes a metaphorical deal with the devil. In Rogue Nation, Faust finds herself caught in a moral compromise between MI6 head Atlee (Simon McBurney) and international terrorist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Atlee is blackmailing Faust into compliance, using her to infiltrate Lane’s organization and cover up his own complicity.
Faust breaks with Atlee when she undermines her cover within the terrorist organization to prevent Lane from executing Ethan Hunt (Cruise). For Faust, it is a simple moral choice. “He was going to torture and kill an American agent,” Faust protests. “I wasn’t going to let him die. He’s our ally.” Atlee counters, “There are no allies in statecraft, Ilsa, only common interests.” Atlee then warns Faust that Lane is going to order her to kill Hunt and that she will do it because she has “no choice.”
Hunt operates within a similarly morally ambivalent system. Early in Dead Reckoning Part One, he meets with CIA Director Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny). Kittridge argues that the world is a morally complicated place and that Hunt’s worldview is outdated. “Your days of fighting for the so-called greater good are over,” he warns Hunt. The CIA is seeking to control “the concepts of right and wrong for everyone for centuries to come. You’re fighting to save an ideal that doesn’t exist.”
While this theme runs through both Rogue Nation and Dead Reckoning Part One, McQuarrie brings it squarely into focus in Fallout. At its core, Fallout is a rejection of the moral ambiguity that defines so many contemporary blockbusters. It is a movie in which Hunt is repeatedly confronted with the choice to sacrifice an innocent life for the greater good, only to reject the choice and find a more creative solution to the problem facing him.
At the start of the movie, Hunt chooses to save the life of his old friend Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), allowing nuclear material to fall into the hands of terrorists. Later on, while organizing a daring raid on a prison convoy transferring Lane, Hunt is haunted by visions of a situation where he might have to take an innocent life to preserve his cover. During the eventual abduction, Hunt chooses to blow his cover rather than allow an innocent police officer (Alix Bénézech) to die.
This character trait is established early in Fallout. “Some flaw deep in your core being simply won’t allow you to choose between one life and millions,” explains Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), the head of the Impossible Mission Force. “You see that as a sign of weakness. To me, that’s your greatest strength.” In the closing monologue, CIA Director Erika Sloane (Angela Bassett) admits that the world needs “people like (Hunt) who care about the one life as much as they care about the millions.”
Fallout is not simply a rejection of the classic “trolley problem.” The film repeatedly pushes Hunt towards the sorts of ethical compromises that defined American foreign policy during the War on Terror, only for him to reject them. At one point, Sloane proposes to abduct a suspected terrorist, boasting that they have “a G5 standing by to rendition him to Gitmo, where a waterboard is waiting.” Naturally, Hunt doesn’t operate that way.
Early in the film, the team captures Nils Debruuk (Kristoffer Joner), a scientist complicit in a terrorist plot. As news footage reveals the horrors of the attacks, Hunt loses control. “Give me five minutes with this guy,” Hunt pleads. “That’s not who we are,” Stickell replies. Hunt counters, “Then maybe we need to reconsider that.” McQuarrie frames this as high drama. The soundtrack builds with solemn choirs and mournful violins. The camera pushes in on Hunt’s face, a man lost in introspection.
Of course, it’s all a ruse. The reports are fake. The scenario has been staged. Hunt manipulates Debruuk without resorting to “enhanced interrogation.” The hospital room is just a set, opening up behind Hunt once he has tricked Debruuk into telling him what he wants to know. Hunt isn’t actually feeling conflicted; he is just playing a character for the scientist’s benefit. McQuarrie reminds audiences that these sorts of cinematic dilemmas are just elaborate constructions.
Fallout isn’t just engaging in abstract philosophical debates or grappling with the political climate. It is also a conversation about the narrative conventions of contemporary blockbusters, which were increasingly morally ambiguous. Fallout’s primary villain is John Lark (Henry Cavill), a brutal CIA operative who is the “hammer” to Hunt’s “scalpel.” Cavill is a modern blockbuster star, at this point most famous for his portrayal of a morally complicated Superman in Zack Snyder’s superhero films.
Fallout often feels directly engaged with Nolan’s Dark Knight films. The sequence in which Hunt and Lark break Lane out of custody directly evokes the Joker’s (Heath Ledger) raid on the convoy holding Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) in The Dark Knight. Lorne Balfe’s soundtrack seems to directly evoke Hans Zimmer’s score for those films, with “The Exchange” specifically recalling “Gotham’s Reckoning” and “Fate Whispers to the Warrior” suggesting “Necessary Evil.” This is no surprise, as Balfe emerged from Zimmer’s Remote Control Productions. Still, the influence is particularly pronounced here.
As a result of all of this, Fallout positions Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt in contrast to other big blockbuster franchise protagonists: Daniel Craig’s James Bond, Henry Cavill’s Superman, Christian Bale’s Batman. Even more than Chris Evans’ Captain America in that same summer’s Avengers: Infinity War, Hunt is positioned as a man who refuses to “trade lives.” He’s a protagonist that the audience can root for without any conflicted emotions or ethical uncertainty. Hunt will always do the right thing.
This is McQuarrie’s thesis statement about the Mission: Impossible franchise. It is a rejection of moral complexity and ambiguity. There is no elaborate ethical trap that the heroes cannot outwit through inventiveness or spectacle. Any time the films threaten to get too bogged down in a philosophical quandary, the solution is an insane stunt or a crazy reveal. It’s a very simplistic and appealing approach to blockbuster storytelling, and Mission: Impossible does it better than any other franchise.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzY2FwaXN0bWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2NocmlzdG9waGVyLW1jcXVhcnJpZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtbW92aWVzLXJlamVjdC1tb3JhbC1hbWJpZ3VpdHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-08 16:57:40+00:00,Dead Reckoning Part One — Movie Review,"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is here to entertain, and it does, with exquisite style and substance. It is the movie of the summer so far.","Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One may be a mouthful, but the newest addition to the 27-year-old movie franchise comes equipped with consistency and relentless energy. The two-hour and 43-minute extravaganza does not stop. Dead Reckoning is an all-out sprint (literally, this is a Tom Cruise picture, after all) to the finish line.
All the usual suspects are here. There are telephoto shots of Tom Cruise doing his best Usain Bolt impression. There are messages that self-destruct. There are our old Impossible Mission Force friends Luther Stickell and Benji Dunn, portrayed by Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg, respectively, whose familiarity allows Dead Reckoning to advance a complicated plot at a breakneck pace. With all that same, Dead Reckoning manages to be different. The film is a fresh, pulse-pounding entry into a flailing 2023 summer blockbuster season in dire need of the kind of escapism it provides.
The advertising blitz leading to the release of Dead Reckoning was vague about the film’s plot details, but without giving away the story, the subject matter is prescient. The story’s villain just a year ago may have seemed like that of a 2000s-era James Bond movie. In 2023, however, Dead Reckoning taps into the basest fears of viewers experiencing modern technological change. The narrative of the seventh Mission: Impossible film seems possible, if not probable, and while it can at times verge into silly, the actors play the scenarios so straight-faced that it’s hard as a viewer not to treat them similarly.
Pom Klementieff in Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning – Part One from Paramount Pictures and Skydance.
The ladies of Dead Reckoning are the most valuable players in the film. Hayley Atwell, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, and Pom Klementieff all hit the ground running and provide compelling foils, allies, and everything in between for the IMF. Klementieff, in particular, shows a side unseen in her previous entries into the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Mantis. Her quirky, stone-cold killer is a welcome addition to the group of substantial actors.
Then there’s Tom Cruise, the superstar of Dead Reckoning. What can be said about Cruise that hasn’t already been said? He certainly has his detractors, but it’s challenging to find an argument against him being on the movie star Mount Rushmore. The man is here to entertain, and all of Dead Reckoning is a testament to that. Cruise runs, jumps, rides, quips, and emotes with the same conviction we’ve come to expect from his recent offerings. There is no “phone it in” for Tom Cruise, and it results in a compelling and convincing performance that elevates the film to heights (literally) that other big-budget movies don’t always reach.
There are nitpicks. The dialogue can be corny at times. The characters habitually look off into the distance and dramatically utter the movie’s plot, seemingly directly to the audience at times. The main villain, and by proxy the story in general, while modern, is a little on the nose. Those taking this thrill ride should know that Dead Reckoning is part one of two, and expectations should be tempered to match that. Every loose end does not necessarily receive a tie-up here.
These gripes, however, are minor complaints about a film that doesn’t take itself seriously enough to warrant them. The film is here to entertain, and it does, with exquisite style and substance. Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is the movie of the summer so far and earns a recommendation.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjhuZXdzbm93LmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LW5ld3MvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLXBhcnQtb25lLW1vdmllLXJldmlldy_SAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy44bmV3c25vdy5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1uZXdzL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1wYXJ0LW9uZS1tb3ZpZS1yZXZpZXcvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

twofour54, which is state-owned, has said the complex will be named twofour54 Studios.
The overall development will span over 100 acres and include 11 soundstages, an exterior water tank, and six versatile standing sets. Complementing the lot will be 7,000 sqm (over 75,000 sqft) of office space with a collection of production facilities, including post-production and screening rooms.
Abu Dhabi has increasingly become an attractive destination for expansive international productions, largely thanks to the introduction of its 30% tax rebate. To date the city has housed shoots such as 6 Underground, Sonic The Hedgehog, Dune, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Fast & Furious 7, and most recently, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. The seventh MI film was shot in Abu Dhabi’s Liwa desert and the city’s new Midfield Terminal airport building, with support from the Abu Dhabi Film Commission (ADFC).
twofour54 collaborated on the shoot with Abu Dhabi Airports and Etihad Airways, the film’s official airline partner, which involved the construction of an Arabian village in the desert and multiple sets at the airport terminal.
The location is also popular with high-profile Bollywood shoots, with its proximity to India and tax rebate system proving a draw for producers. Large-scale Indian productions set in the City include Bharat and Tiger Zinda Hai.
“The creative industries have been identified as one of Abu Dhabi’s priority sectors given the important economic and social value they create,” said Humaid Matar Al Dhaheri, Board Member, Managing Director, and CEO of ADNEC Group.
“We are proud to drive Abu Dhabi’s vision of becoming a leading global destination for content creation through twofour54 Studios. It will take film and TV production to the next level, creating jobs and contributing to the local economy following its completion in 2025.”
Mark Whitehead, CEO of twofour54, added: “twofour54 has facilitated thousands of productions over the last 15 years, establishing a compelling track record and building a deep expertise of the global film industry’s demands. Leveraging this invaluable experience, twofour54 identified an opportunity in the MENA region – the demand for an integrated, future-ready production destination. We remain steadfast in our mission to foster creativity, nurture talent and provide a world-class platform where visionaries can bring their cinematic dreams to life.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvYWJ1LWRoYWJpLXR3b2ZvdXI1NC1zdHVkaW8tMjAyNS0xMjM1NDUyMDc2L9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvYWJ1LWRoYWJpLXR3b2ZvdXI1NC1zdHVkaW8tMjAyNS0xMjM1NDUyMDc2L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

2023-07-18 19:03:44+10:00,Guide to the Classics: Mission Impossible,"One of the best spy movie series has received a new release. A few days ago, a new Mission Impossible film graced theatres - Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One - the 7th instalment in the franchise.","One of the best spy movie series has received a new release. A few days ago, a new Mission Impossible film graced theatres – Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One – the 7th instalment in the franchise. It was well-received by moviegoers, grossing $7 million during its preview screenings alone. This beats the $6 million record of its predecessor, Mission Impossible: Fallout, from 2018.
Given this release, it’s a great time to revisit one of the most iconic movie series ever. Mission Impossible has been running for more than two decades and is still going strong. Let’s take a look at why that’s so:
Adaptability

What sets this series apart from others is how it’s able to adapt. Note how the first Mission Impossible film premiered in 1996. Yet, the elements in each film matched the time of its release. For instance, before Mission Impossible: Fallout (2018), the characters used phones and in-ear devices to communicate, as those gadgets were present in the real world during those times.
Since Fallout, however, the characters have been communicating discreetly. It seems that there’s a new device in their ear canals that can withstand the running, climbing, and fighting they do, reflecting advancements in the technology of modern times. Although these are tiny details, these movies’ ability to advance and adapt makes them relatable and great.
Remarkable characters

Another well-loved aspect of the film series is its characters. Of course, Ethan Hunt is one of them, being a reliable, rugged, and daredevil-type character who’s dedicated to his work and willing to go the extra mile to reach his goals.
Other characters, like Ilsa Faust, have also made an impression on the audience. She first appeared in Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation (2015) as the deuteragonist who worked for the international terrorist organization, The Syndicate.
In the end, she finds a new family with Hunt’s group and joins them to fight her former colleagues. Her character development over the franchise’s various instalments makes her one of the most compelling characters in the series.
Jaw-dropping stunts
Credit: FilmCon on YouTube
By now, everyone knows that Tom Cruise does his stunts. One of his most jaw-dropping ones includes climbing the Burj Khalifa for Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol (2011).
For Dead Reckoning Part One (2023), Cruise’s stunt was so risky that he was given custom eyewear. In the scene, he leaps from a motorcycle over a cliff and parachutes downwards. Major eyewear brand Oakley partnered with Cruise to produce the perfect glasses for his character: the ECLP23.
It featured High Speed Protection, an expanded field of view, Zero Gravity, and an elastic strap to fit his face perfectly. This suited the film well, as Oakley’s sunglasses are suited for sports performance and equipped with the latest technologies to protect the eyes while remaining stylish.
If you want to try a similar look, try the Sutro Lite or Jawbreaker, models that can often be found on cyclists who need the same stability and comfort.
Well-thought-out wardrobes

A good wardrobe can make or break a film. Since the series revolves around spies, their outfits typically consist of suits, combat gear, and casual looks when undercover. What’s notable about this is how well-thought-out their wardrobe is.
One instance is when William Brandt wore a Rolex Submariner Date in Ghost Protocol (2011). The luxurious watch reflected his character: a CIA operative who often wore suits. Moreover, a Rolex watch has hardcore durability that can withstand his character’s job.
Some Rolex watches, like the Oyster Perpetual Deepsea Challenge, even survived the terrifying depths of the Marianas Trench, showcasing just how strong Brandt’s character is after finding a reliable team with Hunt – despite the guilt and self-doubt he experienced in the past.
Indeed, seeing the latest Mission Impossible film will be worthwhile because it’s part of the most fantastic series. For similar articles, check out the guide to the classic film, The War of the Worlds.

Mission: Impossible 7 reactions
The first reactions to Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 1 have been incredibly positive… but not unanimous, and there have been some notable criticisms.
Collider’s Perri Nemiroff called it “another winner for the franchise. Yet again, the production value is THROUGH THE ROOF with some of the most well-defined and exhilarating set pieces photographed in ways that truly make you feel like you’re in the middle of the action. The emphasis on capturing things in camera makes a HUGE difference, and you can feel it.”

Critic Germain Lussier also wrote: “Dead Reckoning Part 1 is fantastic. Dynamite, timely story. Excellent new characters. Huge variety of action and a final set piece that ranks top 2-3 all-time for the franchise. It gets a little dense at times but its pace & intensity more than cover that.”
IndieWire’s Kate Erbland praised the movie for “feeling like its own film while setting up for the second half… after the insanity of the last few films, #MissionImpossible7 has a tremendous amount to live up to, but one thing I’ll say now in quick reaction format: it does the best job yet of recent ‘part 1 of 2!!’ features.”

Several critics have noted the movie’s themes and villain; more specifically, how it examines artificial intelligence. “MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – DEAD RECKONING PART ONE works as Christopher McQuarrie’s ambitious examination of/meditation on AI and the dangerous path we might be on. (He doesn’t like it),” Uproxx’s Mike Ryan wrote, adding: “With the inherent nature of being ‘part one’ (said that a lot lately), not as satisfying as FALLOUT.”

And bless his crazy ass, b/c this is a behemoth-sized spectacle, one go-for-broke set-piece after the next, close to FALLOUT excellence. Henry Czerny fans will go nuts.”

In a particularly negative reaction, The Wrap’s Scott Mendelson wrote: “#MissionImpossible7 was a big letdown. Wonky dialogue, oddly broad acting, and narrative contrivances/shortcuts that (being generous) seemed like COVID-related issues. Felt ‘off’ in a way akin to ‘Saw 3-D’ after ‘Saw VI’.

,DEAD RECKONING Was Inspired by Buster Keaton's THE GENERAL and Other Silent Era Films — GeekTyrant,,"A couple of months ago, I wrote an article about how Buster Keaton was the Tom Cruise of the silent film era. It’s not hard to see the comparisons between Cruise and Keaton especially with the Mission: Impossible franchise. Well, it turns out that Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning was very much inspired by the films in the silent film era from the likes of Keaton, Harold Llyod, and Charlie Chaplin.
During a Letterbox promo video for Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, director Christopher McQuarrie talked about how the silent-era, slapstick comedy and stunt-driven films inspired the film, most notably, Keaton’s The General. He said:
""We start every single one of these movies going back to Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and we look at Safety Last!, Sherlock Jr., City Lights, Modern Times. The General is the big one. If you watch The General, you'll see that its influence on this movie, in particular, is absolutely evident. The fact that it's 100 years old and it's still regarded as one of the greatest films ever made is — that's another one that's high on the list of tonight's recommended viewing.""
It’s really not hard to see the comparison between Dead Reckoning and The General, especially with that climatic train sequence. If you haven’t watched some of those silent films in awhile, they’re worth revisiting! It’s pretty incredible to watch the stunts that they pull off in those films.
Another movie that the director cited was John Frankenheimer's classic 1964 WWII thriller The Train. This is a film that he and Cruise ""studied extensively"" while developing Dead Reckoning Part One. McQuarrie admitted that he can’t even imagine trying to make that movie with no CGI to help make it happen.
""I don't know how on Earth they ever made that movie. It's truly an extraordinary achievement. Having now done a train sequence, I — if you had handed me that script, I would have run screaming. It's incredible what they pulled off in that era with that technology. It's all practical. It has no CGI. There's multiple train wrecks that — it's the original 'Mission: Impossible.' It's really an incredible movie.""
Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One is now playing in theaters. You should watch it if you haven’t already! It’s Grrrrrreat!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL2dlZWt0eXJhbnQuY29tL25ld3MvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLXdhcy1pbnNwaXJlZC1ieS1zaWxlbnQtZXJhLWZpbG1zLWZyb20tYnVzdGVyLWtlYXRvbi1oYXJvbGQtbGxveWQtYW5kLWNoYXJsaWUtY2hhcGxpbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-17 15:11:00+00:00,"'Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part 2' Release Date, Spoilers, Details",It's Tom Cruise versus the machine once 'Dead Reckoning Part Two' hits theaters.,"There's something inherently sold to audiences with a title like Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One. The dead will reckon, of course. That's a given. But every Part One needs a Part Two. It's the first time in the Mission: Impossible series that a major plotline will move from one film to it next installment. It's an emerging trend in Hollywood, with both Fast X and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse splitting up their respective stories. This probably stems back to the success of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Either that, or filmmakers just realized that cliffhangers are cool. (Sometimes.)
Regardless, when the seventh Mission: Impossible film ends, we're left with only half the story. Even something as silly as the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) can get complicated, of course. And make no mistake, Dead Reckoning goes full Lord of the Rings. There's a new powerful A.I. villain called ""The Entity,"" which has access to the world's technology—and Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) must take a special key to its home and destroy it.
Of course, it's not so simple. Every major power in the world wants that key, and The Entity has also employed the work of a dark figure from Hunt's past named Gabriel (Esai Morales). Who is this guy, and why is Hunt so afraid of him? All will presumably be answered in Part Two—granted that they don't surprise us with a whole trilogy. Below, here's everything we know so far about Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part Two.
Tom Cruise will have to top this motorcycle stunt again... somehow. Christian Black // Paramount
What Will Dead Reckoning Part Two Be About?
Much has gone unsolved since the end of Dead Reckoning Part One. Ethan Hunt may have the key, but he has no idea that The Entity lives thousands of miles underwater in an abandoned submarine. Well, we do! Sadly, we can't just yell it at the screen, Dora the Explorer-style. He'll have to figure that one out himself. We'll also (likely) learn about the event that caused Ethan Hunt and Gabriel to become enemies. It seems as if he stabbed and killed a woman—possibly someone close to Ethan, or maybe an associate that they both worked with before Gabriel betrayed them. Oh, and Part Two will also have the destroy The Entity. That A.I. just has to go!
Who Will Return for Part Two?
If you survived Part Two, my best guess is that you'll be back the second installment. Even Pom Klementieff—who barely made it out of this one alive, apparently—will return in Part Two as a new IMF agent. Additionally, Nick Offerman will join as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Tom Cruise, of course, isn't finished. He'll have a new crazy stunt for us—and he'll do it himself. Bravo, sir.
When Will Part Two Premiere in Theaters?
Luckily, we won't have to wait very long. Barring major delays from the WGA and SAG strikes, Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part Two will premiere in theaters on June 28, 2024.

2023-07-17 20:29:00+00:00,Does Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One have a post-credits scene?,"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One doesn't have a credits scene, but there might be a little audio teaser.","After Rogue Nation and especially Fallout, it became clear to me that should Tom Cruise make more sequels, I’d choose to accept the mission: watch them in a theater the minute they’re out. Five years and a pandemic later, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is out in theaters, and it’s an amazing movie to enjoy in an air-conditioned cinema on a hot summer day.
As the title indicates, Dead Reckoning is a two-part story. That means we expect some sort of cliffhanger from it and potentially a post-credits scene to tease Part Two. There is a cliffhanger, which becomes obvious as you watch the movie.
As for the post-credits scene, I can tell you there isn’t one before I tell you that spoilers follow below. But there is something during the credits that you might miss, just like I did. Spoilers follow below.
Dead Reckoning runs for two hours and 43 minutes. It might seem too long to some people. But the minute the action starts, you’ll never think of it again. The plot moves seamlessly from a fast-paced action sequence featuring Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and friends to a few characters having a dialogue to give us room to breathe.

Dead Reckoning gets bonus points for the timeliness of the plot. The Mission: Impossible sequel started filming before the pandemic or well before the arrival of ChatGPT and other generative AI programs.
The smart AI prompted some of the brilliant minds who created the software to worry about the future of humanity. There’s real talk about the potential of AI contributing to the extinction of humanity, although I always thought we were already doing fine on our own.

The obvious cliffhanger
Dead Reckoning takes the concept to a whole new level. Hunt and the gang are fighting a fierce AI rival that has gone rogue. It has infiltrated the entire world and has just one weakness. Its source code is still out there, and it’s the kind of weapon that can be used to kill the bad AI.
I won’t ruin Mission: Impossible 7 for you by telling you what happens or who dies. I will tell you that Hunt and his team are after a key that opens the location of that AI. You quickly realize that Part One is all about getting the key. Part Two will tell the story of actually finding the “home” of that AI.
That is, by the end of Dead Reckoning, you know what the cliffhanger is. And the good news is that the movie delivers a great ending. It doesn’t feel like Denis Villeneuve’s first Dune movie that ends so abruptly you think something has gone wrong in the cinema’s projection room.
What I’m getting at is that Dead Reckoning doesn’t need a post-credits scene to tease the sequel. It’s abundantly clear that there’s another episode in the series that will conclude this particular story. Not to mention that Mission: Impossible would have to copy superhero movies like Marvel’s MCU projects that made post-credits scenes so popular.

The post-credits scene is a… beep?
Since I follow the MCU closely, I stuck around for a potential post-credits scene in Dead Reckoning. At the same time, I started searching whether there would be one.
Separately, five other people spent stayed behind to see whether there was a post-credits scene. They obviously thought the movie would have one.
It turns out there’s no extra footage shown at any point during the credits. I mention that specifically, as there might be a sound that qualifies as a teaser for Dead Reckoning Part Two. Per Money Control, once the credits roll, you’ll hear a few faint beeps that suggest the Entity (the AI) has been watching you the entire time.
It’s a pretty clever take on the whole idea that the AI Mission: Impossible 7 introduces is quite dangerous. But I have to confess I didn’t hear the beeps. Maybe I wasn’t paying attention at the right time. Perhaps I was searching the web while the Entity was watching me.
I’ll certainly pay more attention to the credits once the digital version rolls out. But this sort of teaser is perfect for Dead Reckoning. You wouldn’t notice the AI was watching you if that were to happen in real life, just like I didn’t hear those beeps.
Meanwhile, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two is slated to hit theaters on June 28th, 2024, and I’m already excited to see it.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYmdyLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2RvZXMtbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLXBhcnQtb25lLWhhdmUtYS1wb3N0LWNyZWRpdHMtc2NlbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One director Christopher McQuarrie has explained why the film doesn't have a cliffhanger ending.
Two-parter films have been making a comeback in recent years, following the double whammy of Avengers: Infinity War into Endgame (although delayed by the pandemic). In the last few months we've seen Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and Fast X end on cliffhangers to get fans hyped up for their conclusions.
Despite being the first of a two-parter, Dead Reckoning bucks that trend, with McQuarrie stating that it was something that Tom Cruise felt very strongly about.

Speaking to Total Film/GamesRadar+, the filmmaker stated: ""Where we ended the movie was always where we were going to end it. How we ended the movie was a big, big mystery for us.
""It kept Tom awake at night throughout production. He would come in all the time and say: 'This can't be a cliffhanger, it's got to be satisfying.' The audience has to feel a sense of completion... If you leave it with a cliffhanger, it feels a little bit like we're expecting you to come back. We didn't want that feeling.
""The feeling we were reaching for – and we hope you feel – is we dare you not to come back. We want to leave you thinking: 'Oh, I can't wait to see what happens next.'""

Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Esai Morales, Pom Klementieff, Mariela Garriga and Henry Czerny also star.
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is written by Christopher McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen and directed by McQuarrie.

The seventh overall film in the Mission: Impossible series is getting some of the highest praise in the history of the franchise – which is quite an accomplishment for a series that started 27 years ago.
While the film's Rotten Tomatoes score is still in flux due to the review embargo only lifting on Wednesday night (July 5), it currently stands at an incredible 98% fresh on the review aggregator from 113 reviews so far.
Dead Reckoning Part One manages to top Mission: Impossible – Fallout's previous franchise high of 97% and is leagues above the series' low point – a 56% approval for Mission: Impossible 2.
Paramount
Digital Spy wasn't quite as impressed with Dead Reckoning Part One as its predecessors, as we felt there was an imbalance between mind-blowing stunts and actual story advancement.
""The new movie is a step down from Fallout, but still a blockbuster that often delivers immersive and spectacular action that gets the adrenaline pumping like few other movies can,"" Ian Sandwell wrote in his DS review.
Paramount
Highlights from other reviews are presented below:
""What better mission could there be this summer other than witnessing our perpetual cinematic maverick deliver yet another full-scale cinematic experience? Should you choose to accept it, of course.""
""Dead Reckoning Part One doesn't just rack up the miles in style. Like so many globe-trotting thrillers and big-screen tourist brochures, it's also a gleaming advertisement for Hollywood itself.""
""While the title might feel unwieldy, the film itself is anything but, its nearly three-hour running time passing as quickly as it takes a message to self-destruct.""
""The strong cast, high-gloss production values and constant wow factor of the action offer plenty of distraction from the storytelling deficiencies.""
Paramount
""The story exists only as flimsy interstitial tissue between the Tom-centric stunts, but maybe that’s enough. Ostensibly greater movies have given us less.""
""It feels like a movie that's been assembled by an inattentive monkey, or a luckless studio intern who was handed a bucket of half-completed rushes and told, 'Go make a Covid-beating blockbuster out of that.'”
""The plot borrows from Westworld and aims for cerebral but ends up coming out like a half-baked Christopher Nolan brain fart.""
Paramount
The film sets up an almighty cliffhanger for Cruise and co-writer/director Christopher McQuarrie in Dead Reckoning Part Two, but given Cruise's incredible track record of late, he could very well stick the landing!

The movie is the first of a two-part story that sees Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team head on their most dangerous mission yet. A terrifying new weapon threatens all of humanity, and Ethan must get to it before it falls into the wrong hands.
Mission: Impossible 7 held its world premiere tonight (June 19) in Rome, where some of the movie was shot, and those lucky few to already see the movie have taken to social media to share their first reactions.
So, is it another successful mission for Ethan Hunt?
Paramount
Collider's Perri Nemiroff said: ""Dead Reckoning Part One is another winner for the franchise. Yet again, the production value is THROUGH THE ROOF with some of the most well-defined and exhilarating set pieces photographed in ways that truly make you feel like you’re in the middle of the action.""
Screen Rant's Joseph Deckelmeier added: ""The action had my heart rate elevated. That train scene is mind blowing!""
See some of the other early reactions below:
Like Fast X and Across the Spider-Verse before it, the new Mission: Impossible movie is a two-parter so you can (probably) expect a major cliffhanger, and you should also settle in for a lengthy watch.
It was confirmed last month that Dead Reckoning Part One is the longest movie of the series to date, clocking in at 156 minutes before credits and 163 minutes in total.
Will that include a credit scene? We'll have to wait and see.
Paramount
We had thought that this two-parter would draw an end to Tom Cruise's time as Ethan Hunt. However, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie has been suggesting that this might not be the end.
""There's always a plan, the plan always changes, everything goes completely awry, and hopefully everything always turns out alright in the end,"" he explained. ""But you never really fully understand, or trust where it is you're going, until you get there.""

Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is out this month, bringing Tom Cruise and the gang back for a seventh mix of espionage, action and crazy stunts that make you wonder how the lead actor is still alive.
The series has been going strong since 1996, with the second part of Dead Reckoning set for release next year. While a multi-parter seems it would be the perfect send-off to a series pushing 30 years, Cruise has no plans to stop any time soon.
At the film's Australian premiere, the Ethan Hunt actor told the Sydney Morning Herald that he wants to match what Harrison Ford is doing: making Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny just before he turned 80.

Cruise, who turned 61 just a few days ago, said: ""Harrison Ford is a legend; I hope to be still going. I’ve got 20 years to catch up with him. I hope to keep making Mission: Impossible films until I’m his age.""
A new Mission: Impossible film comes out every four or five years on average (the longest gap being six years, and the shortest – not including next year's Part Two – is three years), so if Cruise does stop at 80, there could be about 13 or 14 Mission: Impossible films in total.
Seeing as how the franchise ramps up the stunts Cruise does with every instalment, we wouldn't be surprised if they send the actor into actual outer space on the side of a rocket at some point. If anyone can do it, it's him.

,Mission: Impossible 7 resolves mystery about Vanessa Kirby's White Widow,"White Widow explained - Vanessa Kirby returns as the White Widow in Mission: Impossible 7, but which previous character is she related to?","Vanessa Kirby returns as Alanna Mitsopolis, aka the White Widow, in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, and you might have forgotten about her link to the series' past.
Mission: Impossible – Fallout revealed that Alanna is the daughter of arms dealer Max, who was played by Vanessa Redgrave in the first Mission: Impossible movie. She's continued the family business, as well as moving into philanthropy which is funded by her illegal activities.
Fallout also established that Alanna works with the CIA every now and then as a broker, such as when she helps to return Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) to MI6 in order to exonerate Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson).
But given that her mother almost sold the list of the US government's most secret agents and their true identities to a lot of bad guys, it never did make sense how Alanna was openly allowed to continue her business.
Mission: Impossible 7, however, solves that mystery by revealing something about Max's past. Mild spoilers ahead if you haven't seen the new movie yet.
Paramount
During Dead Reckoning Part One's action-packed climax, Alanna meets up with new CIA director Kittridge (Henry Czerny) planning to sell him the key that will grant him access to the Entity so that he can control it for the US's benefit.
(It's actually not really Alanna, it's Hayley Atwell's Grace in a White Widow mask, but that doesn't affect what's revealed.)
Before Alanna and Kittridge get down to the business of controlling the world, he remarks that he knew her ""late mother"". When Alanna makes further demands (well, really Grace trying to make a deal for herself), Kittridge says it's only because of Max that Alanna has been allowed to carry on the family business.
It appears that after she was captured, Max made a deal with the US government to give them intel on the various bad guys she was dealing with. In return, they left her alone to carry on her business and, in turn, allow her daughter the same luxury.
Story continues
Paramount
Given the various dodgy dealings we've seen in the US government during the Mission: Impossible series, it's perhaps not a surprise that instead of punishing a fairly serious crime, Kittridge used it as an opportunity to gain more knowledge.
He'd originally have been doing it for the IMF, but it appears that no matter where he moved in the US government agencies, he kept his link open to Max and then Alanna whenever he had to get his hands dirty. It's certainly done him no harm for his career, even if he doesn't get his hands on the Entity key this time.
Alanna's link to the series' past certainly isn't lost on Vanessa Kirby as she told Digital Spy she rewatched a key scene between Ethan Hunt and Max in the first movie for her role.
""It's so strange to think that Vanessa Redgrave played my mother and [Tom Cruise] did that incredible scene with her in the car where she's really playing with him. I watched it a thousand times to try and remotely emulate what she did,"" she recalled.

2023-07-22 14:33:00+00:00,"After Dead Reckoning, Hayley Atwell needs her own Mission: Impossible spinoff","Hayley Atwell's Grace is a standout character of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One, and she deserves a spin-off story.","We’ve known Hayley Atwell as Marvel’s Peggy Carter for more than a decade. As important as she was to the MCU, she didn’t get enough attention in the movies. Now that Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is out, we’ll also know Atwell as Grace, a terrific addition to the franchise.
I can’t say more about Grace without spoiling Mission: Impossible 7. But I can say that I want a Mission: Impossible spin-off featuring Grace after Part Two. This is your spoiler warning: Make sure you watch Dead Reckoning in theaters before reading what follows.
I’ve wondered who Atwell would play in this Mission: Impossible, considering the star-studded cast of the sequel. I wanted to know how important her character would be, and whether the franchise needed more core team members. It turns out that Grace is incredibly important. Not only that, but she’s an awesome addition to the IMF’s Mission: Impossible structure, albeit being just a rookie.
That premise and Atwell’s incredible performance in Dead Reckoning are enough for me to want to see Grace lead her team in the future Mission: Impossible spin-off. One where Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team don’t necessarily show up.

One of the things I enjoyed about Mission: Impossible is the focus on the IMF. On how you become an agent. It turns out we’re looking at an unusual hiring process. And the Dead Reckoning reveals explain Hunt’s proneness to go rogue over the years.

The IMF agents are former criminals. Give or take a few. They’re given a choice at some point during their infamous careers to get a new job: become IMF agents. Once in, they’ll always have to accept the dangerous Mission: Impossible tasks.
Grace is a master thief. She’s charming, quick on her feet, and quite fast to adapt. She knows how to get out of situations where she’s in over her head. But the entire turn of events in Dead Reckoning might be too much for her, at least initially.
Atwell is great at portraying all that. At making us feel anxious and afraid as her character unwillingly becomes entangled in Hunt’s big quest to save the world from dangerous AI. She might not be ready for any of this, but Grace becomes an IMF agent.
The whole process reminds me of movies where an older knight knights a younger one. Or when Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) made Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Avengers while on a ship towards an alien plane in Avengers: Infinity War. Grace’s recruitment happens during a chat about current events. No paperwork, no trips to the IMF headquarters.

The difference is that Grace isn’t necessarily prepared for this. Unlike Spider-Man or the younger would-be knight, she’d like to avoid the complications.
That is what makes Grace so interesting. And why the character needs a Mission: Impossible spin-off after Dead Reckoning Part Two. We’d see a rookie IMF agent grow into an operative as resourceful as Hunt and his team. After seeing Grace deal with the first tiny impossible missions, it’ll be interesting to see her lead her own team. Especially considering that she embraces her new IMF career by the end of Part One.
Otherwise, I’d hate Grace to become the new “Bond girl” in Mission: Impossible, especially considering the heartbreaking exit of Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). The death of that character, who wasn’t just another Bond girl, by the way, was needed for the story. But also for Hunt and Grace.
And yes, there was obvious chemistry between Grace and Ethan, and I loved every minute of the two characters working together or against each other.
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two premieres next June, so we have plenty of time to find out what the franchise’s future will be and whether Atwell will get a well-deserved spin-off.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYmdyLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2FmdGVyLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLWhheWxleS1hdHdlbGwtbmVlZHMtaGVyLW93bi1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtc3Bpbm9mZi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Written and directed by Paul King, and co-written by Simon Farnaby, the movie serves as a prequel to Roald Dahl‘s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and looks to take inspiration from Mel Stuart‘s 1971 adaptation Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, which starred Gene Wilder as the titular character.
Timothée Chalamet plays Willy Wonka in the latest iteration, while Keegan Michael-Key, Rowan Atkinson, Sally Hawkins, Olivia Colman, Jim Carter, Matt Lucas, Natasha Rothwell, Tom Davis, Simon Farnaby, Matthew Baynton, and Hugh Grant co-star.
Here is the plot synopsis:
“Based on the extraordinary character at the center of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl’s most iconic children’s book and one of the best-selling children’s books of all time, “Wonka” tells the wondrous story of how the world’s greatest inventor, magician and chocolate-maker became the beloved Willy Wonka we know today.
From Paul King, writer/director of the “Paddington” films, David Heyman, producer of “Harry Potter,” “Gravity,” “Fantastic Beasts” and “Paddington,” and producers Alexandra Derbyshire (the “Paddington” films, “Jurassic World: Dominion”) and Luke Kelly (“Roald Dahl’s The Witches”), comes an intoxicating mix of magic and music, mayhem and emotion, all told with fabulous heart and humor. Starring Timothée Chalamet in the title role, this irresistibly vivid and inventive big screen spectacle will introduce audiences to a young Willy Wonka, chock-full of ideas and determined to change the world one delectable bite at a time—proving that the best things in life begin with a dream, and if you’re lucky enough to meet Willy Wonka, anything is possible.”

Mission: Impossible star Henry Czerny has shed some light on his nearly three-decade long absence from the franchise.
The Canadian actor, 64, played IMF boss Eugene Kittridge in the original Mission: Impossible film in 1996, but did not appear again until Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which was released in cinemas this week.
Speaking to Uproxx, Czerny, who is also known for his role in the spy thriller Clear and Present Danger, revealed that he had once been involved in a dispute over his character.
Ahead of filming Mission: Impossible, he took it upon himself to research the role, spending a day and a half with people at the CIA.
“Because they want people to know what they do as well, within reason, of course,” Czerny said. “So, I did all kinds of homework there. And then I had the script with me, and I didn’t try to show them the script, but I knew the questions that I wanted to ask them about it.
“And so I went to the UK with all these answers – all these suggestions about what should be done perhaps with this script. And, of course, that was not met in the way I expected it to be met. It was, ‘Thank you very much, but please keep that to yourself. Great backstory for you. I love that you did that for you.’ Very Mission: Impossible.”
The actor explained that he was “a bit s***-grinned” over their response because he had “gone through the effort”.
He continued: “So, after Mission: Impossible, the first month, I had a lunch with Paula Wagner, who was, at that time, Tom [Cruise]’s producing partner. And I let her know all the things they didn’t do with Kittridge, and what they should be doing with Kittridge in the future, if they had options.

“And she was very polite, very nice, paid for the lunch. And that’s the last I saw of Mission: Impossible. I burned that bridge.”

Czerny added that they may have been planning to write out his character anyway. “But I certainly didn’t do myself any favours as a young actor telling Paula Wagner what she missed in this supporting character,” he said.
The actor also claims that Christopher McQuarrie, Dead Reckoning’s director, had wanted to bring back Kittridge in an earlier instalment, “but it just wasn’t right apparently, or whatever”.
He claimed that McQuarrie was “more open” to his own input on the character.
“Absolutely,” he said. “He’s more open to what the actor wants to bring, given the genre, given the tone of the scene, given the trajectory of the story. Yes. All within that, thank you very much. But bring it and we’ll see. We’ll see.”

,New DUNE: PART TWO Trailer Finally Reveals Christopher Walken’s Emperor,"Forget desert power. The new trailer for Dune: Part Two features Christopher Walken power, as it introduced the legendary actor's Emperor.","Denis Villeneuve’s Dune brought Arrakis back to theaters. Now the director is bringing a Hollywood legend to the spicy fantasy world for the second half of his big budget adaptation. The new trailer for Dune: Part Two finally introduces Christopher Walker as the Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV. But he’s just one of the big names, both old and new, that will star in a film that looks even more epic than its predecessor.
As much as we want to focus on seeing nine-level CHEOPS chess in this trailer, there’s too much going on in this promo to plan an intergalactic board game night. (We’re always up for that though, FYI.) From shots of the Harkonnen home world of Geidi Prime and Austin Butler’s deadly Feyd-Rautha, to Gurney Halleck’s reunion with Paul and the new head of House Atreides’ guerilla war on Arrakis, this trailer is our best look yet at the film. Plus, you know, Christopher freaking Walken!
But the most intriguing aspect of this trailer is how much it focuses on Paul’s status as a possible messiah figure. How many truly believe he is? How many only do so because the Bene Gesserit led them to think that? And what awaits Paul as he wages war? The film’s official synopsis offers a clue at the decision he will have to make:
This follow-up film will explore the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee.
Warner Bros./Legendary Pictures
Even without Walken this would be an epic trailer. But obviously he makes it even better, which will almost certainly be true of the movie, too.
Dune: Part Two also stars Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya. Also returning are; Javier Bardem, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin Stephen McKinley Henderson, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, and Charlotte Rampling. Also joining the series are Florence Pugh, Léa Seydoux, and Souheila Yacoub. The sequel comes to theaters this fall on November 3, 2023.

And again. And once more. And it probably won’t be the last time that he risks his life to achieve the best scenes for one of his favorite series: Mission Impossible. So much so that Paramount Pictures has shared a new making-of trailer in which we see good old Tom paragliding surrounded by cameras, thus achieving one of the riskiest and most spectacular sequences in the actor’s already long career. This is how they filmed the so called “Speedflying” scene for Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning - Part 1.
Tom Cruise and his riskiest scenes
Thus, after the famous motorcycle jump off a cliff, we now see how Tom Cruise stars in a new action scene executed by himself, without doubles, without cheating or tricks. So much so, that Cruise trained for hours and hours to learn how to paraglide down an impressive mountainside, including sharp turns at full speed to end up landing in the lowest part of the valley that served as the setting for this new feat.
We’ll have to wait and see what context this new scene is situated in which the actor, instead of leaving these activities to the stuntmen, stars in the entire stunt himself, jumping from the top of a mountain without qualms. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning - Part 1 aims to become one of the most visually spectacular installments of the franchise, which is no small thing.

With control of the future and the fate of the world at stake, and dark forces from Ethan’s past closing in, a deadly race around the globe begins. Confronted by a mysterious, all-powerful enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than his mission – not even the lives of those he cares about most.”.says the official synopsis.

,"Nandor Fodor and the Talking Mongoose trailer reveals Simon Pegg, Neil Gaiman","In the trailer for 'Nandor Fodor and the Talking Mongoose,' Simon Pegg is Nandor Fodor, a psychic who investigates a supposed talking mongoose, voiced by Neil Gaiman.","Ever heard a mongoose talk? The Irving family was convinced they had, and told anyone who would listen in 1930s Britain that their farmhouse on the Isle of Man was inhabited by an animal named Gef. This phenomenon attracted the attention of various psychic investigators, which will be dramatized in the new film Nandor Fodor and the Talking Mongoose.
EW can exclusively reveal the trailer ahead of its premiere at San Diego Comic-Con later this week.
For such a surreal story, Nandor Fodor and the Talking Mongoose boasts an all-star cast. Simon Pegg stars as the titular psychic detective, who comes to investigate whether this mongoose really can communicate. The film also features Minnie Driver as Nandor's friend/assistant Anne, Christopher Lloyd as fellow paranormal investigator Dr. Harry Price, and Neil Gaiman as... well, the voice of the mongoose.

As seen in the trailer, the more time they spend on the Isle of Man, the more Nandor becomes convinced that the townspeople are lying about Gef, of whom it's hard to catch a glimpse. Anne, meanwhile, starts to believe that he might be real.
Pegg recently co-starred in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, reprising his supporting role as IMF agent Benji Dunn. Nandor Fodor marks his first lead role in some time.
Gaiman is a bestselling author known for writing novels like American Gods and comics like The Sandman, but he also has a distinct voice and narrates The Sandman audiobook adaptations on Audible.
Nandor Fodor and the Talking Mongoose will be released in theaters Sep. 1. Watch the trailer above.

Kirby's character is the daughter of Max, who was played by Vanessa Redgrave all the way back in the first film (which was released in 1996, if you can believe that).
To create that connective tissue, Kirby told Digital Spy exclusively that she went back and studied one scene from the original film many, many, many times.

""There's a history with it and a legacy that they're building on. It's very much the same heart of it. It's totally retained that.
""What I find incredible about it is that you have Ethan Hunt, he's in the centre, he's been the common denominator in every movie, and it's so strange to think that Vanessa Redgrave played my mother and he did that incredible scene with her in the car where she's really playing with him. I watched it a thousand times to try and remotely emulate what she did.""
Pom Klementieff, who joined the franchise with this film, interjected to say that she honestly thought Kirby was related to Redgrave, as their performances were so similar: ""It's crazy what you did. At some point, I really thought they were from the same family. I Googled it at some point.""

""That was amazing and to think that Tom has looked in the eyes of Vanessa Redgrave in that car and is now looking at me as her daughter.""

Tom Cruise recently stated that he wants to make Mission: Impossible films until he's at least 80, so does that mean that we might get to see another generation of Max's family in the films?

2023-07-18 10:01:49+00:00,The Official “The Creator” Trailer Reveals Gareth Edwards’ AI-Centered Sci-Fi Epic,"John David Washington stars as a man on mission to kill a sentient AI, only to find out that it's taken the form of a little girl.","The Official “The Creator” Trailer Reveals Gareth Edwards’ AI-Centered Sci-Fi Epic
The official trailer for co-writer and director Gareth Edwards’ The Creator has arrived. It’s our longest look yet at Edwards’ exceedingly topical film, which features a war between humanity and artificial intelligence, a classic sci-fi trope that has been given fresh relevance thanks to the recent release of the AI-backed ChatGPT and the growing concern across governments all over the world about the rise of AI. You’ve maybe read about it in major newspapers, magazines, Reddit threads, podcasts, or research papers, or perhaps you saw Tom Cruise battle a rogue AI in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.
In Edwards’ The Creator, John David Washington stars as Joshua, an ex-special forces agent recruited to go behind enemy lines—the enemy, in this case, is an AI-controlled area—and hunt down and kill the titular creator, the architect of the AI that dropped a nuke on Los Angeles and is only just getting started wiping out humanity. The trailer reveals that once Joshua gets behind enemy lines and finds the titular creator, the all-powerful and elusive mastermind behind the nefarious AI turns out to be a child. Well, not a human child, but an AI in the form of a human-like child that Joshua will learn is not at all what it seems.
Joining Washington are a stellar cast, including Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (Inception), Allison Janey (I, Tonya), Sturgill Simpson (Dog), and newcomer Madeleine Yuna Voyles as the child/Creator. Edwards directs from a script he co-wrote with Chris Weitz, his collaborator from Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.
Edwards told Total Film Magazine that the fact that his film focuses on artificial intelligence right after ChatGPT became a phenomenon and Tom Cruise’s latest Mission: Impossible movie focuses on a rogue AI is a “total fluke.” Here’s more:
“It was a total fluke. When we started, the Al in the movie was really an allegory for people who are different. But obviously, I love science fiction, and I think the best science fiction has meat on the bone. It’ll explore ideas. It’s usually able to explore things that other genres can’t go to in quite the same extreme. And so as soon as you start to have anything AI in your storyline, the questions that come up really quickly are super-fascinating: are they real? How would you ever know? Does it matter? What happens if you want to turn them off? Do they want to be turned off?”
Check out the trailer below. The Creator arrives in theaters on September 29:

Cruise has performed chilling stunts throughout his filmography, including the Mission Impossible and Top Gun franchise and had no qualms about performing even more dangerous stunts in his latest, despite turning a year older.
In Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One, Cruise will be seen doing several high-octane stunts, one of which includes riding a motorbike off a cliff and base jumping. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Cruise was asked why he chose to begin the film with the hair-raising stunt
“Well, that way we’d know either we are going to continue with the film or not! ‘Let’s know on day one what is going to happen, do we all continue or is it a major rewrite,” says Cruise, reports Midday. The Hollywood star said that a lot of energy, equipment and preparation time had gone into getting him stunt-ready for that particular take. Cruise wanted to get into the specifics of the scene right away and said it was crucial he shot the stunt on the first day of filming and prevent the rest of the shoot from getting delayed.
“It was very important as we were prepping the film that the stunt actually was the first thing. Because I don’t want to drop that and shoot other things, and have my mind somewhere else. Everyone was prepped. You don’t want to be waking up in the middle of the night thinking, ‘I still have that left to do,'” he added.
The stunt in question was shot in the mountainous landscapes of Norway. For Cruise, who had been a motorcycle and adrenaline enthusiast for nearly all his life, this stunt had been a childhood dream. But dreams come with their perils –
“Preparing for something like that was years (of experience). I had been riding motorcycles since I was a little kid, raced cars and spent a lot of time with aerobatics, airplanes, helicopters, parachutes. But to figure out something like that… It is our understanding of story, understanding of camera, how to do something like that, it all kind of came in that moment. I had trained for it, you have to be razor sharp when you do something like that,"" he says.
The stunt is arguably one of the most dangerous in not just Mission Impossible but cinematic history. Fans couldn’t be more excited to watch it on the big screen
Christopher McQuarrie, who previously helmed Rogue Nation and Fallout, has directed Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. The film is ready to hit screens on July 12.

""If I ever do an Instagram Live or whatever, people are always like, 'I need Shaun of the Dead 2 in my life',"" he said.

In a surprising turn of events, the highly acclaimed manga and anime series Spy x Family is using its web of connections to promote the blockbuster spy film Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One with Spy x Family Code White, the anime’s first theatrical release.
On July 10, the official Spy x Family website unveiled a teaser poster and a promotional video featuring the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) and the Forger family.
Here is everything we’ve gathered from the latest collaboration.
Spy x Family and Mission Impossible join forces to promote their thrilling spy films

The promotion included a side-by-side poster juxtaposing Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One’s original movie artwork with a cleverly edited version featuring characters from Spy x Family.
Here is the breakdown of the corresponding characters from both franchises.
SPY X FAMILY CHARACTER MISSION IMPOSSIBLE CHARACTER DEAD RECKONING PART ONE ACTOR Loid Forger Ethan Hunt Tom Cruise Yor Forger Grace Hayley Atwell Anya Forger Ilsa Faust Rebecca Ferguson Bond Forger Gabriel Esai Morales Yuri Briar Benji Dunn Simon Pegg Sylvia Sherwood The White Widow Vanessa Kirby Franky Franklin Luther Stickell Ving Rhames Fiona Frost Paris Pom Klementieff
A promotional video was also released alongside the poster, showing Loid introducing Anya to the Mission Impossible franchise.
The video starts with the narrator giving background information about Operation Strix, a mission from the Westilian Intelligence Agency that coincidentally pulled together Loid Forger, Yor Forger, Anya Forger, and their dog, Bond Forger.
Anya then sits down and watches the Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One trailer with Bond, Loid, and Yor. Loid starts thinking about its plot, which Anya can hear because of her telepathic ability.
Anya is confused by Mission Impossible’s backstory but gets intrigued with Ethan Hunt, Tom Cruises’ character in the series. She then compares Ethan to Bondman, the main character in Spy Wars, her favorite cartoon TV series.
Loid notices that Ethan can escape dangerous situations because of his latest spy tech. The Spy x Family super agent believes Ethan’s gadgets would be useful for him, too, and wonders if his associate, Franky Franklin, could get him the same gear.
Yor suddenly says out loud that Ethan seems capable, just like Loid. Anya, who is so absorbed with the trailer and Loid’s thoughts, nearly slips up and reveals that Loid is a spy.
Anya stops before Loid can notice and changes the conversation by shouting, “Anya would like spy merch, please!”
Loid then explains how having a lot of handy gadgets and a trusted team is vital for spy missions and introduces Ethan’s team in the movie.
The last part of the crossover video features a short Spy x Family Code White teaser trailer. Spy x Family’s first theatrical release is set to hit theaters across Japan on December 22, and it will feature an original plot that isn’t adapted from the manga.
Instead, Spy x Family creator Tatsuya Endo had worked with Wit Studio and CloverWorks to create new characters for the movie.
Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One will hit Japanese cinemas on July 21.

,‘Napoleon’ Trailer Coming … — World of Reel,"A trailer for Ridley Scott’s much-anticipated “Napoleon” is attached to 
IMAX copies of ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.’","A trailer for Ridley Scott’s much-anticipated “Napoleon” is attached to IMAX copies of ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.’ I presume the trailer might be released online this coming week.
Although it will be gunning for awards season, “Napoleon,” according to Screen Daily, is currently set to skip the fall festivals.
At time of writing Screen understood the film will not receive a world premiere festival berth.
Produced and financed by Apple, Scott’s epic reunites the filmmaker with Joaquin Phoenix as the European conquering emperor. Scott is 85-years-old, but this is said to be one of the most ambitious films of his career.
The exclusive footage shown at this past April’s CinemaCon was said to feature a winter battle scene where Russian and Austrian forces team-up against a French advance only to fall victim to a battlefield trap concocted by Napoleon.
Here’s The Playlist’s Gregory Ellwood describing what he saw:
The scenes featured hundreds (a thousand?) extras on horseback (“Kingdom of Heaven” vibes) and almost entirely in-camera visual effects (lots of on-the-ground explosions). There were at least three or four individual shots that anyone in the room will still remember weeks from now, which obviously a very good thing. The only concern is Scott has allowed all the actors to speak in their native accents which in this case means Napoleon sounds American. Scott got away with it on his last film, “The Last Duel,” but we’re a bit concerned it won’t work in this particular historical context.
The film, which opens exclusively in theaters on November 22, has already been test-screened twice — I posted three reactions so far, masterpiece, masterpiece and mixed.
“Napoleon” stars Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby. It is 154 minutes in length and tackles Napoleon’s world-conquering theatrics, not to mention his frosty relationship with wife Joséphine (Kirby).
Scott’s epic has also been “Rated R” for strong violence, some grisly images, sexual content and brief language. Based on what I’ve heard, it’s a bloody and gruelling epic that has an incredible performance from Phoenix.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndvcmxkb2ZyZWVsLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjMvNy93OWtiNXA0eTV6dXI3eTE3Nmkzc2Rxc2JtMGFuNGjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,Mission: Impossible 7 key scene was filmed in Tom Cruise's garage,Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One director Christopher McQuarrie was forced to shoot a key scene in Tom Cruise's home garage.,"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One star Tom Cruise gave up his own garage for an intense day of shooting, it's been revealed.
Director Christopher McQuarrie, who first joined the franchise with 2015's Rogue Nation, shared this anecdote during a recent appearance on The Empire Spoiler Special Film Podcast
McQuarrie recalled he faced a challenge with how to present Marie (Mariela Garriga)'s backstory in the movie, with test screening audiences failing to understand her storyline.

""That entire [mission briefing] scene came together in the course of a week and was shot in a day,"" he explained. ""Except for the inserts, which we shot in Tom's garage in Florida because there was a missing element.
""First, we raced to shoot the inserts and anything you race to shoot just looks like shit. It was the longest day on the movie, it was the last day on the movie. I realised when putting the scene together that I had the key, I had Ilsa, I had the bounty hunters, and we had been struggling with what those flashbacks to Marie meant.
""I was in the editing room. I cut in the Marie footage and went, '30 years ago you were given a choice.' I just laid it out. Stop trying to ask the audience to figure it out and just effing tell them, they want to know.""

The filmmaker then added he phoned Cruise and confessed to mucking up the sequence – telling him that they'd need to add a mugshot to keep the audience gripped by the storyline.
""That triggered – once I was shooting one photograph, well, might as well reshoot them all,"" he added.
""So we brought a desk and some flooring and that bag and some photos and a gun, all the basic props, and went to Tom's garage in Florida. We had a splinter crew go and reshot everything.""
Paramount
McQuarrie previously revealed that a 'cold open' scene featuring a digitally de-aged version of Cruise's character Ethan Hunt was considered, but they decided not to go ahead with it because the director thought it would be too distracting.
Story continues
He added that when the scene was seriously being considered, there had even been talk of trying to cast Julia Roberts to play a digitally de-aged love interest for Ethan.
""I got the bill for de-ageing those people before their salaries were even factored into it,"" he further explained.
""And if you put two of them in a shot together, or three of them in a shot together, it would have been as expensive as the train by the time we were done.""

Today, A24 dropped the very first trailer for the movie, which throws in a good old-fashioned Parent Trap style caper into the plot for good measure.
""The trippy comedy stars Aaron Jackson and Josh Sharp as antagonistic businessmen and long-lost twins with a plan to trick their separated parents, played by Nathan Lane and Megan Mullally, into getting back together,"" Variety says of the film. Megan (real name: Megan Jovon Ruth Pete) will play the twins' boss — and makes an appearance in the trailer spitting lines and using the word ""dick."" The movie marks her feature film debut. For anyone wondering where Bowen Yang fits into all of it, he plays God.
Aaron Jackson and Josh Sharp, who play the twins, adapted Dicks: The Musical from their play Fucking Identical Twins. The play actually premiered in Manhattan back in 2014 with music from the obviously very talented and very irreverent duo along with composer Karl Saint Lucy.

,MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE Meets PADDINGTON in This Trailer Mashup,Does Ethan Hunt like orange marmalade and bears? Find out in this mash-up that brings together Mission: Impossible and Paddington.,"Ethan Hunt only works with the best of the best at the Impossible Mission Force. His teams throughout the Mission: Impossible movies bring exceptional talent to the table. But what if Paddington—yes, the bear—helped out? Maybe the sweet bear can bring more than an undying passion for marmalade to the table. In fact, Paddington might be made for the spy life. The latest Nerdist Remix brings together the worlds of Mission: Impossible and Paddington. Watch the trailer mashup below.
Edited by Matt Caron, the Mission ImPaddington mashup brings quite the cast of characters together. We can’t decide if Luther would embrace Paddington or just sigh with exasperation throughout the mission. Benji, however, would become best friends with Paddington immediately. They’d probably stay in touch long after the mission ended to exchange marmalade recipes. Ethan would adopt Paddington. Maybe he’d give the bear a new identity and send him to live with Julia.

2023-07-12 13:15:00+00:00,Tom Cruise Killed 6 Motorcycles in One Day Because He Loves Movies So Damn Much,"Tom Cruise loves movies. This isn’t always the case with actors or even movie stars, some of whom may be good at faking it but really are more interested in fame and fortune than they are the cinematic experience. And while Cruise may be one of our last, true movie stars, it’s pretty hard to question that his feelings for the art of moviemaking are real.
I mean, Steven Spielberg himself gave Cruise credit for saving Hollywood after the pandemic.
In that particular case, Spielberg was talking about Cruise’s insistence on releasing Top Gun: Maverick in theaters during a time of great uncertainty in the industry. A billion and a half dollars later, Cruise clearly made the right call there. But there’s another key ingredient to the once and future Ethan Hunt’s strategy to keeping cinema alive – and that’s his frankly insane stunt work.
Tom Cruise has been making movies since 1981, and became a star within two years of that with the release of Risky Business. He’s had his ups and downs over the decades of course, but one thing that audiences have come to expect from the actor in recent years is him doing his own stunts. And not just that, but one-upping himself with each subsequent Mission: Impossible movie, especially since director Christopher McQuarrie joined him on the franchise.

After 27 years and counting, Paramount’s Mission: Impossible action franchise has far surpassed CBS’s original 1966-73 television show in public fame.
The stunts rank among the most iconic in modern movie history: Tom Cruise’s protagonist Ethan Hunt dangling by wires in the first film, scaling the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in the fourth, hanging onto the side of an airplane several thousand feet in the air for the fifth, skydiving in a “HALO jump” [high-altitude low-open parachute] in the sixth.
Before Wednesday’s release of seventh installment Dead Reckoning – Part One, here’s a recap of the financials for the six prior films.
Mission: Impossible (1996)
Release Date: Wednesday, May 22, 1996

Domestic 1996 Rank: #3
Global 1996 Rank: #3
Based on the hit television series, this opening installment directed by Brian DePalma set the template with many now-iconic components of the franchise: the pull-off facial disguises, the catchphrase “This tape will self-destruct in five seconds,” Ving Rhames as tech genius assistant Luther.
At the box office, the film came in third place for the year in both the domestic and global rankings, in both cases behind Independence Day and Twister.
Mission: Impossible II (2000)
Release Date: Wednesday, May 24, 2000
Domestic Opening Weekend: $57.8M
Domestic Total / Market Share: $215.4M (39%)

Domestic Franchise Rank: #2
Global Franchise Rank: #4
Domestic 2000 Rank: #3
Global 2000 Rank: #1
Before the likes of Top Gun: Maverick and Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, this marked the first sequel of Cruise’s career. Clearly he made the right decision, as the follow-up ranked as the top film globally of the entire year, the only Mission installment to achieve the feat. Domestically it ranked third, behind How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Cast Away.
Costarring Anthony Hopkins as the mission commander, John Woo (Face/Off) directed the project. Cruise even insisted that the production use a real knife during a climactic fight scene, rather than a prop.
Mission: Impossible III (2006)
Release Date: Friday, May 5, 2006
Domestic Opening Weekend: $47.7M
Domestic Total / Market Share: $133.5M (33%)

J.J. Abrams made his feature film directorial debut, previously serving as executive producer for ABC’s television shows Alias and Lost, though he would go on to helm two Star Wars and two Star Trek movies. This third Mission installment also costarred Philip Seymour Hoffman as the franchise’s most memorable villain, Laurence Fishburne as the agency director and Simon Pegg as tech expert Benji Tunn, who would appear in every subsequent installment.

Domestic Franchise Rank: #3
Global Franchise Rank: #2
Domestic 2011 Rank: #7
Global 2011 Rank: #5
The series returned with a December release date, marking the only installment to shun a summer debut. It also marked the only installment not to debut wide, starting in a limited 465 theaters before expanding wide on its sophomore frame.
As a result, it’s the only franchise installment not to debut atop the weekend box office. In fact, it debuted in third, behind both Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows and Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked. Yet with strong legs, it finished above both Shadows and Chipwrecked in the end.
Brad Bird made his live-action directorial debut, after previously directing Pixar’s animated The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Jeremy Renner costarred as an intelligence agent.
Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation (2015)
Release Date: Friday, July 31, 2015

Domestic 2015 Rank: #11
Global 2015 Rank: #8
Returning to a summer release date once again, this installment starts with Ethan Hunt and his team disbanded as a government espionage agency. Christopher McQuarrie directed, after previously directing Cruise in 2012’s Jack Reacher, and has stayed with the Mission franchise ever since. Alec Baldwin also costarred as the director of the CIA.
Mission: Impossible — Fallout (2018)
Release Date: Friday, July 27, 2018
Domestic Opening Weekend: $61.2M

Global Franchise Rank: #1
Domestic 2018 Rank: #8
Global 2018 Rank: also #8
Often cited as the best installment to date, the financials certainly reflected that view, ranking as the top film to date both domestically and globally. Costarring Henry Cavill, Vanessa Kirby, and Angela Bassett, this installment finished the year in eighth place both domestically and globally.
Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)
With a trailer playing in cinemas for a full year and two and months, ever since May 2022’s Maverick, hype has been building around this seventh installment for a long time.
Boxoffice PRO‘s most recent forecast projects it will earn the franchise’s highest opening weekend to date. Whether it earns the franchise’s highest final total depends on word of mouth, but early reviews are positive, suggesting the odds are good.

2023-07-05 13:46:36-04:00,New Trailer for ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ Gives a Better Look at Martin Scorsese’s Latest Film; IMAX and Dolby Release Confirmed,"The movie will release in select IMAX theatres on October 6, before expanding to more locations on October 20.","Apple seems to be the first studio that seriously wants to get into the theatrical game. While Amazon certainly made a great first impression with Air, Apple is currently winning their more than $1 billion investment in theatrical-exclusive releases with the announcement of Killers of the Flower Moon, Napoleon, and Argylle bowing out in cinemas before releasing on their streaming service.
Even more exciting: IMAX confirmed that Martin Scorsese‘s Killers of the Flower Moon will be released in their theatres on October 6 before expanding to more venues on October 20. That would probably follow the same template as Beau is Afraid did for IMAX, as it released a week early in select IMAX theatres in New York and Los Angeles before expanding in most locations the following week. The movie will also release in select Dolby Cinema venues as well.
IMAX had previously worked with Apple before on Billie Eilish: The World’s A Little Blurry and with Netflix on Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny, and Paul Thomas Anderson‘s ANIMA and have consistently reaffirmed their willingness to work with streamers if they respect the traditional theatrical window. It seems that Apple will be the first to craft this new relationship with IMAX, and do not be surprised if Napoleon and Argylle get released on their screens.
Killers of the Flower Moon premiered at the Cannes International Film Festival in May and immediately received rave reviews, and currently has a 97% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Martin Scorsese’s latest movie was based on the book of the same name by David Grann, with a screenplay co-written by Scorsese and Eric Roth. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, Lily Gladstone, Jesse Plemons, Brendan Fraser, John Lithgow, Tantoo Cardinal, and Scott Shepherd.
Here is the plot synopsis:
“At the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), “Killers of the Flower Moon” is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal.”

Connor, who was adopted by Tom Cruise and his ex-wife Nicole Kidman, was seen walking with his dad to an AMC theatre on Town Square dressed casually, wearing a grey collared shirt with blue jeans and sneakers. The duo was also joined by Cruise's older sister, Lee Mapother.
According to Aceshowbiz, the 61-year old 'Top Gun: Maverick' star also donned a 'casual in a black button-up with blue jeans and black shoes. He paired it with reflective aviator sunglasses and a silver wristwatch.'
Tom and Connor have made only a handful of public appearances together in the past. Back in 2021, the two attended a Los Angeles Dodgers game in San Francisco, California, together.
Tom Cruise also shares 30-year-old Isabella with Nicole, while he has a 17-year old daughter Suri with ex-wife Katie Holmes.
Back in 2018, Nicole Kidman made a rare statement about her relationship with her children. Elaborating on the matter she said, ‘""I'm very private about all that. I have to protect all those relationships. I know 150 percent that I would give up my life for my children because it's what my purpose is,""’ as reported by Aceshowbiz.
""She also weighed in on her children's decision to pursue Scientology like their father. 'They are able to make their own decisions. They have made choices to be Scientologists and as a mother, it's my job to love them',"" Nicole, who left the church in the '90s, added.
""And I am an example of that tolerance and that's what I believe - that no matter what your child does, the child has love and the child has to know there is available love and I'm open here.""

Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One's director has revealed that they cast a former EastEnders star at the last minute.
The upcoming seventh instalment in the action series is due to hit the big screen next month, though Christopher McQuarrie explained how at one point there was a slight bump in the movie's plot, and the creation of a character helped to smooth the issue.
For the role, they cast Alex James-Phelps – who played the part of Travis Law-Hughes in EastEnders back in 2017.

2023-06-26 18:57:55+04:00,"Hollywood icon Tom Cruise swoops down Abu Dhabi for ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One’ premiere",Stars walk the red carpet at glittering event for film showcase,"Hollywood action star Tom Cruise, who battled a sandstorm on a horseback while saving his peer in ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One’, swapped his swashbuckling persona for a sleek tuxedo as he walked the red carpet for the UAE premiere of his film on Monday night. Frenzied chants of “we love you Tom” echoed through the indoor red carpet arena.
The glittering event — which saw the cast and crew of the film attend, including director Christopher McQuarrie, Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff — took place at the opulent Emirates Palace Mandarin Oriental.
The highly anticipated premiere of the latest ‘Mission: Impossible’ installment, shot in Abu Dhabi’s striking Liwa desert landscape and the Midfield Terminal which is yet to be formally opened, brought its actors back to where it all began.
The iconic ‘Mission: Impossible’ theme played in the background as he walked the red carpet. Later, the actor spent over 30 minutes signing autographs to fans with utmost patience.
Dressed in a bespoke suit, Cruise greeted the crowd with his signature charm and an infectious smile. The actor, known for his daring stunts on screen, brought along an electrifying energy. Cruise, 61, is one of Hollywood’s bona fide movie stars standing.
“It’s beautiful to be here. I love being here and I love my fans,” the actor told reporters on the red carpet.
Talking about his famous horseback scene from the movie, Cruise said: “It was incredible to go horse back riding. My horse’s name was Zeus.”
The showcase of the seventh installment in the franchise takes off from the events shown in ‘Mission Impossible Fall Out’ with the super spy Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his crew of highly-accomplished agents having to save the world from a new threat.

Cruise’s co-stars praised him.
“Tom Cruise is a thorough gentleman,” Hayley Atwell, actress who plays Grace in the film, said at the event. “This film must be watched on the big screen.”
Simon Pegg left none in doubt about his prediction for the movie's box office success. “This is a genuine summer blockbuster material,” he said.
Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, this film is high on stunts and will release in the UAE on July 9 with part two set for June 28, 2024, release.
“We are excited to be here in Abu Dhabi tonight … I can’t wait to see the reactions from the audiences tonight,” said McQuarrie.
Beauty of Abu Dhabi
McQuarrie said he was enamoured by the beauty of Abu Dhabi while filming ‘M: I’. “The beauty of Abu Dhabi is incredible — the desert, the people, and the airport,” he said at the event. “It wasn't challenging to make Abu Dhabi beautiful.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL2d1bGZuZXdzLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2hvbGx5d29vZC9ob2xseXdvb2QtaWNvbi10b20tY3J1aXNlLXN3b29wcy1kb3duLWFidS1kaGFiaS1mb3ItbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1wYXJ0LW9uZS1wcmVtaWVyZS0xLjk2NjM4Mzk20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

And look: You would have good reason to! The first trailer for The Nun 2 looks flippin’ sweet. As someone who likes The Conjuring films, the various spinoffs generally aren’t as compelling to me because they rely on overly effects-heavy scares. But this trailer? It’s just good old-fashioned creepy imagery and negative space. The shot where an image of The Nun appears in the pages of a magazine rack? Inspired.

,‘The Exorcist: Believer’ Trailer: Ellen Burstyn Is Now Battling Demons Like Max Von Sydow Did,"After footage from David Gordon Green's upcoming sequel terrified CinemaCon, it's now here for all viewers to see.","Pazuzu, is that you?
It sure seems like it in the first trailer released to the public for “The Exorcist: Believer.” This had already played at CinemaCon in April and absolutely terrified the audience. Now, viewers can get a jump on their Halloween season themselves. Watch it below.
More from IndieWire
Most notable about this entire sequel is the fact that it’s the first time Ellen Burstyn has returned to play Chris MacNeill, the D.C. actress terrorized when her daughter was possessed by a demon in the original “The Exorcist” in 1973. For all the subsequent sequels (and a prequel), she was absent as the franchise went in other directions. But in director David Gordon Green’s take on this material, produced by Blumhouse, he seems to be doing what he did with his 2018 “Halloween”: take an iconic star of the original film and let us see how those terrifying events shaped her life in the decades after.
Of course, Jamie Lee Curtis had appeared in multiple “Halloween” sequels. So Burstyn’s appearance in an “Exorcist” movie after half a century is even more astonishing. And what’s unique is that it seems she’s being brought in to serve the role Max Von Sydow played in the original: as an exorcist herself. We see in the trailer that she’s spent a lifetime researching the occult, following the events in which her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) was possessed by the demon Pazuzu. Now she needs to help two girls who seem possessed as well, at least one of them by a demon who may be Pazuzu.
“We’ve met before,” Burstyn says, as one of the girls creepily hisses “Mother…” at her.
Mind you, Burstyn is 90. Her casting in this is really a singular gift, and something that instantly generates that much more interest in “Believer.” She had been nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars for her turn in the original film (and won a year later for “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore”) and was, along with Von Sydow especially, representative of director William Friedkin’s early take on “elevated horror.” That original film, slow and contemplative long (sometimes pretentious) sections, was a blockbuster by fusing its extraordinary horror with elements of art cinema. Hard to imagine Burstyn, after a 60-year career, would return to her iconic role if there wasn’t something particularly ambitious about this script.
Watch it below. Universal opens “The Exorcist: Believer” on October 13. The new cast includes Leslie Odom Jr., Lidya Jewett, Olivia Marcum, Ann Dowd, Okwui Okpokwasili, Jennifer Nettles, and Raphael Sbarge. A follow-up titled “The Exorcist: Deceiver” is now confirmed to be released Easter weekend, April 18, 2025.

Paul Schrader took to his always-colorful Facebook page to write a terse review of Christopher McQuarrie’s latest Tom Cruise blockbuster. The “Master Gardener” director was not a fan of the blockbuster’s script, which he saw as indiscernible from AI writing. (Not to mention the movie’s main villain is a godlike AI.)

While Schrader invoking AI is hardly a compliment, he has been more supportive of computers writing scripts than most of his peers. The Oscar nominee has frequently spoken about what he sees as the potential for AI to replace screenwriters on supposedly lowbrow Hollywood entertainment.
“It’s apparent that AI will become a force in film entertainment” Schrader recently wrote. “Do you need a new episode of ‘CSI: Vegas?’ ChapchatGPT [sic] will deliver that in a matter of seconds. And it will be good, it will cull all the episodes of CSI for the last 20 years and come up with something both generic and contemporary.”
Schrader has not been shy about sharing his thoughts on this summer’s biggest theatrical blockbusters. He raved about Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” calling it the best film of the 21st century and encouraging his followers to make the long drives to see the film in IMAX.
“‘Oppenheimer.’ The best, most important film of this century,” Schrader wrote. “If you see one film in cinemas this year it should be ‘Oppenheimer.’ I’m not a Nolan groupie but this one blows the doors off the hinges.”
On the opposite end of the spectrum, Schrader found time to see the allegedly MAGA-coded blockbuster “Sound of Freedom” after every screening of “Barbie” was sold out on opening weekend. He had harsher words for that film, even if he conceded that he could understand its appeal to largely Trump-supporting audiences (many of whom see it as touching on subject matter related to Q-Anon conspiracy theories).
“Interesting film, more interesting phenomenon,” he wrote of the film. “It’s simplistic, schematic and effective in the Hollywood tradition of ‘message’ movies–but is not ‘Christian’ per se. It’s also a white savior movie, the Hispanics beings saved or punished by the interloping blue-eyed hero. I saw it with a predominately Hispanic audience who applauded afterwards, not seeing the irony in this.”
Ultimately, Schrader did rave about “Barbie” on his Facebook after finally seeing it, calling the film a “wonder” and declaring Barbieland “Gretaland” after director Greta Gerwig.
No question, “Dead Reckoning” has suffered at the box office due to Barbenheimer. The tentpole has grossed $452 million worldwide so far, but that’s nothing compared to “Barbie’s” $823 million and counting total. “Oppenheimer” has so far grossed a cool $425 million, but it’s also currently occupying all IMAX screens in North America, crushing opportunity for “Dead Reckoning” even despite Tom Cruise’s alleged entreaties to exhibitors to make way for his movie.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9nZW5lcmFsLW5ld3MvcGF1bC1zY2hyYWRlci1oYXRlZC1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctMTIzNDg5MjE1NC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

This article is a preview of The Tech Friend newsletter. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Tuesday and Friday. The latest “Mission: Impossible” movie features a villainous artificial intelligence called the Entity. Spooky, right? Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight Like many fictional AI including Skynet in the Terminator films and HAL 9000 from “2001: A Space Odyssey,” the Entity is up to no good.
There’s a race between the good guys and the bad guys to take command of this all-knowing, out-of-control AI before it destroys the world in some unspecified way.
Sure, sure, sure, the new “Mission: Impossible” has amazing stunts and action sequences. I had fun watching it.
But my technology-obsessed brain wondered: How plausible is the Entity? How does it stack up against other supercomputer baddies in popular culture? And how seriously should we take fake AI in movies, anyway?
Advertisement
To explore these questions, I spoke with Alex Hanna, director of research at the Distributed AI Research Institute and co-host of the ""Mystery AI Hype Theater 3000″ podcast. (An edited and condensed version of our chat is below.)
Maybe it seems silly to have deep conversations about movie AI villains, but fiction matters. Made-up artificial life forms going back to “Frankenstein,” Isaac Asimov’s robot novels and Iron Man comics have influenced our beliefs about real world AI.
This piece comes with an obligatory spoiler alert: It discusses some plot details of “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One.”
But reading this won’t ruin the movie for you. The plot is not the point. (The Washington Post’s Ann Hornaday gave it three out of four stars.)
Q: Does the Entity accurately portray the real capabilities of AI?
Advertisement
Hanna: No. It's absurd.
Q: Why? What's implausible about the Entity?
The idea that the Entity can hack into basically any electronic system — that it can listen and see everything happening in the world and learn from it — is pretty ridiculous. None of the current AI technologies can do this autonomously.
The Entity has such foresight that it can predict who is going to do what in the future down to the second, and game every possibility with humanlike ingenuity. That’s not possible.
The Entity also has intent. [Tom Cruise’s character] Ethan Hunt wants to shut down or control the Entity, and it is like the robots from Isaac Asimov’s fiction in that it’s trying to protect itself.
My colleague Emily M. Bender says that these machines don’t understand anything. Understanding is exclusive to sentient beings.
Q: Are there more realistic AI technologies in this movie?
Advertisement
Yes. Facial recognition is so commonplace in this movie that it's not even seen as AI. It's used by the American intelligence agencies, by the Italian police and by Hunt's team.
The depictions track with a lot of representations of facial recognition in popular media — that the software has true sight and can identify who is a terrorist. But this technology in the real world messes up all the time.
There’s also a moment in this “Mission: Impossible” movie in which [a character named Benji Dunn] is in a self-driving car and he hops over to the passenger seat. He puts on his seat belt as if to say, I don’t trust this thing.
That’s an existing AI that’s still questionable, and the movie makers had enough thought to make a character insecure about it. That was great.
Q: Are there examples of other AI in popular media that you think are accurate?
Advertisement
No.
The perennial problem is that technology and computing are portrayed in popular media as magic.
Share this article Share
Even in this “Mission: Impossible” movie, the idea is once the good guys get a key to access the Entity’s source code, the AI can be controlled. That’s a misunderstanding. Even if you had the actual source code of an AI, it wouldn’t tell you what you need to know.
You’d also need the model weights in a neutral network to be able to replicate any of its decision-making. You would need to know which data it has access to.
[Here’s a glossary of artificial intelligence terminology]
Q: Do you like any technology-related entertainment?!
I love [the android character] Data in “Star Trek” because he aims to be more human to improve his relationships with his crew mates — as opposed to his evil twin, Lore, who wants to kill humans and accrue power.
The movie “Hackers” isn’t realistic, but I love it for the motley crew of people who are trying to take down a mega corporation. Plus a young Jonny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie are fun.
Q: This is all fictional. Why do fake depictions of AI matter?
Advertisement
Science and science fiction co-create each other.
Representations of AI can influence how we think about real-world AI because they can assign those real-life models too much agency or power.
But real-world AI is much more narrow, and destroys lives with much less public carnage — for example, facial recognition and predictive policing software.
Q: Do you believe that some technologists’ current fears of AI triggering human extinction are influenced by fictional killer machines?
I don’t know. Fears of out-of-control artificial entities have a long history. Frankenstein’s monster is a cautionary tale about man’s hubris.
Q: If you were writing a fictional AI villain for a movie, what would it be?
It might be AI systems used as a cudgel by bosses to break the backs of workers. Those are the kinds of AI uses that Hollywood writers’ and actors’ unions are talking about now.
Those depictions would be more like labor movies than “Mission: Impossible.”‘ But I’d watch that.
One tiny win
If you have an Android phone, you will soon be notified if someone is stalking you with Apple’s AirTags location-tracking devices.

Relatively inexpensive Bluetooth trackers such as AirTags can be useful for keeping tabs on your keys and luggage, but they have also been abused by stalkers to covertly track their victims.
Apple’s iPhones have added notifications when unknown AirTags are moving along with you, but the notifications weren’t built into Android phones. (Apple has an Android app to scan for AirTags nearby. It’s a good bet that not many people use that app.)
Google said on Thursday that most Android phones over the next few weeks will update automatically to include anti-stalker notifications for AirTags. The notifications don’t work for other brands of Bluetooth trackers.
Once you have the updated Android software, you’ll be able to tap on the phone notifications for more information and advice on what you might do.

These automated alerts work for the majority of Android devices dating back to 2015, Google said.
Google also included a feature to manually scan for Bluetooth trackers that are near you.
Go to Settings → Safety & emergency → Unknown tracker alerts and tap the “Scan Now” button. (This feature wasn’t available for my Android phone as of Friday morning.)
Google and Apple are working on a separate technology that could automatically detect major brands of Bluetooth trackers near you including AirTags, Tile, Chipolo and eufy Security.
That technology isn’t available yet. Yes, this is all confusing.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjMvMDcvMjgvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWFpLW5vdC1yZWFsaXN0aWMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Atwell and Ned Wolfgang Kelly got engaged back in April during a getaway in Venice, and the actress – who appears in the latest instalment of the action franchise Dead Reckoning Part One – recalled how Kelly was trouserless when he decided to pop the question.
""My fiancé was in his pants in the kitchen, and there was an accordion playing outside our window – which was timed perfectly but not planned,"" Atwell said (via Daily Mail).

Despite the lack of trousers, it seemed Kelly put a lot of thought into it in general, Atwell revealing: ""I said to him, 'Venice was my first most precious destination', and I've always had a weird connection with it. So, he took me there, and it happened there.""
The actress takes on the role of Grace in the new Mission: Impossible movie, and recently revealed to Digital Spy that she wanted to do her own stunts in the film.

Speaking about her strict training programme, Atwell added: ""We had this expert team of stuntmen and women who oversaw all my training, so it meant I was fit for purpose.
""It meant on any given day, my physical behaviour and what I'd built up to physically be able to do was dynamic, it was safe enough so I could change elements of the performance so I could make her seem more reckless or more full of self-doubt.""

However, amidst the thrill, a section of Netizens noticed similarities between some shots in the trailer and Shah Rukh Khan’s upcoming film, Pathaan. Particularly, the train-set sequences drew comparisons between the two movies, leading to online discussions and contrasting opinions.
Twitter users shared screenshots from both films, highlighting the resemblances they observed. Instances like Tom Cruise hanging off a cliff and the train crash scene triggered memories of Pathaan for fans. One user pointed out the irony, saying, “Few days ago, I saw the whole Twitter making fun of #Pathaan train scene just because it accidentally has a similarity with Jackie Chan cartoon. But now that #MissionImpossible also has similar action scenes, nobody will say anything.” Another user shared screenshots of matching scenes and humorously noted, “Bollywood should be proud.”
A user highlighted the comparable shots but received contrasting responses. One user argued, “Train falling off a bridge with people on top was not invented by Tom Cruise or SRK… it’s been an old stunt or action sequence… that’s like saying, ‘Oh, these two songs have the same scale.'” Another user chimed in, stating, “I am sorry, what?! I thought Pathaan was an Indian copy of all Mission Impossible films? The entire train sequence is a scene-to-scene remake of a Jackie Chan animation.”

While","Hollywood Superstar Tom Cruise’s latest action extravaganza, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One”, is hitting cinemas on July 12th 2023. While the film is going to have the biggest release in India as well, the big treat that is coming up along with this movie is the release of Indian Superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s Jawan trailer.
Directed by Tamil filmmaker Atlee, SRK is hoping big on the film as it is coming right after his stupendous blockbuster Pathaan. However, some Bollywood insiders opined that there is this extra-usage of visual effects throughout the film (as per the trailer) and that looked pretty cliche. They say that SRK took clues from films like Adipurush and others, and came up with lots of unwanted VFX in the trailer itself.
In the first place, one cannot really judge the fate of a film just based on VFX. While poor-quality Computer Graphics are surely going to ruin the party, King Khan knows that better and most of the CG done by his own company Red Chillies VFX stands out tall in terms of quality.
And who knows, his fans and movie lovers might admire that heavy dose of VFX, while it is pretty sure that Atlee will not be making any CG-centric film in the first place.

2023-07-22 17:15:00+00:00,Ranking every ‘Mission: Impossible’ movie from worst to best,"With 'Dead Reckoning Part One' in theatres now, let's look back at all the missions accomplished in a ranking of the 'Mission: Impossible' franchise.","Ranking every ‘Mission: Impossible’ movie from worst to best
The Mission: Impossible franchise is a curious tale of evolution and reinvention, from its inception as a 1960s TV show to its rebirth as a modern cinematic behemoth led by Tom Cruise. A wild kaleidoscope of spy-jinks and audacious action, it began as the brainchild of Bruce Geller, whose high-concept television series focused on the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) and their covert operations. It was a sign of the times, a product of Cold War anxieties and the burgeoning spy genre, epitomised by the iconic line: “Your mission, should you choose to accept it…”
Fast forward three decades to 1996, when the sands of Hollywood started to shift. The genre had grown stale, and the spy game needed a new player. This was Tom Cruise’s cue – a leading man with a reputation for high-octane performances and an unquenchable thirst for adrenaline. Backed by Paula Wagner and Cruise/Wagner Productions, Mission: Impossible was about to get a much-needed facelift. The television show was dusted off, repackaged and presented as a blockbuster movie under the direction of Brian De Palma, a maestro of suspense and psychological thrillers. This new iteration was grittier, sleeker, and, most importantly, led by a bona fide movie star.
Cruise, reprising the role of Ethan Hunt, brought with him a raw intensity and passion for practical stunts that became the franchise’s signature. Despite changes in directors and varying tones, each instalment carried this thread, embodying Cruise’s fearlessness and relentless pursuit of authenticity. The franchise morphed into an ever-escalating series of impossible stunts, from scaling Dubai’s Burj Khalifa to hanging off an airborne plane, most performed by Cruise himself. The transformation was stark: from a quiet, methodical show about subterfuge and deception, Mission: Impossible became a roaring testament to Hollywood’s capacity for spectacle.
Over the years, the franchise, much like its relentless star, has refused to slow down. Seven films in, with Part Two of Dead Reckoning on the horizon, Mission: Impossible has become synonymous with Cruise’s daredevil persona and “high-risk, high-reward” action filmmaking. What began as a leap of faith in the mid-1990s has become a cinematic institution, forever changing how we perceive spy thrillers and the boundaries of film stunts. And now, for our mission, should we choose to accept it…
Ranking every Mission: Impossible movie:
7. Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (Christopher McQuarrie, 2023)
Dead Reckoning Part One represents a seriously unfortunate stumble in the franchise’s otherwise impressive stride. Despite boasting the combined talents of Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie, this entry felt like a tepid intermission rather than a gripping standalone chapter. Even the stunning action set pieces couldn’t lift it above the feeling of being a placeholder for a future instalment.
The action feels disoriented, lacking the clear purpose and urgency that the franchise is renowned for. Although a few high-octane stunts hint at the franchise’s former glory, the overall narrative fails to build up substantial suspense, and its high-concept AI villain feels severely undercooked.
6. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (Brad Bird, 2011)
This one is a noteworthy entry in the franchise due to its visual spectacle and the smooth transition of director Brad Bird, known for The Incredibles, from animation to live-action filmmaking. However, its antagonist, the somewhat bland Cobalt, lacks the dramatic weight that adversaries in other instalments have brought to the table.
Despite this shortcoming, the film does manage to entertain, mainly due to its commitment to practical effects and breathtaking stunt sequences – including an incredibly memorable prison sequence. This film truly solidified the franchise’s reputation for daring stunt work, including the now-famous scene with Tom Cruise scaling Dubai’s Burj Khalifa.
5. Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (Christopher McQuarrie, 2015)
McQuarrie’s directorial debut in the franchise Rogue Nation brings a fresh new voice and direction. It introduces an exceptionally threatening villain with Solomon Lane, portrayed by British actor Sean Harris, whose croaky voice and quiet menace infused the series with a real threat.
Despite some narrative complexities that had some viewers scratching their heads, the film delivers a singularly engaging experience filled with high-stakes espionage and thrilling stunts. McQuarrie’s knack for crafting sleek, heart-pounding action sequences combined with Cruise’s trademark fearlessness is on full display.
4. Mission: Impossible II (John Woo, 2000)
Mission: Impossible II, with its flair for slow-motion action and a plotline that revels in its over-the-top nature, is a distinctive entry in the franchise. John Woo’s distinct direction and the inclusion of Anthony Hopkins add a unique touch to this instalment, making it a fun rollercoaster of a film – and a bizarrely drastic departure from the first film.
Although not as sophisticated or nuanced as some other entries, this instalment perfectly captures the spirit of early 2000s action cinema and is still great fun to watch today. Its blend of stylistic action sequences and unabashedly cheesy dialogue makes for an entertaining throwback to a different era of filmmaking.
3. Mission: Impossible – Fallout (Christopher McQuarrie, 2018)
Fallout was, and still is, an exceptionally high point in the franchise. It introduced the audience to a formidable new adversary played by Henry Cavill, equipped with an iconic moustache. It’s a thrilling adventure, offering a solid antidote to some of the less satisfactory spy thrillers of recent years – many considered it an answer to the disappointing 007 film Spectre.
The story, woven around a tense nuclear threat, brings a sense of previously unseen urgency that adds to the film’s surprisingly high level of tension. The stunning Paris chase sequence and the climactic helicopter showdown are among the most intense and best-executed action scenes in the entire franchise.
2. Mission: Impossible III (J.J. Abrams, 2006)
J.J. Abrams’ Mission: Impossible III ventures into darker territories, offering a grittier and more character-focused instalment in the franchise. Philip Seymour Hoffman’s turn as the ruthless antagonist is an absolute, bonafide standout performance. His grounded portrayal of an arms and information dealer brought the series into a terrifying new place.
With its themes of personal loss and shockingly grim consequences, the third Mission Impossible brings a sense of realism lacking in other Hollywood action blockbusters. Its real-world approach results in a high-stakes thriller that provides the perfect backdrop for some of the series’ most powerful performances and character-defining story beats.
1. Mission: Impossible (Brian De Palma, 1996)
The first film in the franchise, Brian De Palma’s Mission: Impossible, remains its best, with its captivating blend of suspense and intrigue. It’s less about flashy stunts and more about high-tension espionage, reminiscent of a Hitchcockian thriller and utilising De Palma’s penchant for stylistic and heightened cinematography.
It really feels more like a De Palma film than a Mission: Impossible film, and despite the objective quality of the later instalments, that defining quality is what makes it the best.

2023-08-08 16:14:41-04:00,‘We don’t want to be Kenemies’: Movie theatre releases trailer appealing for return of stolen Barbie poster,A movie theatre in Oakville decided to get creative after their security cameras captured the theft of a promotional poster for the Barbie movie over the weekend.,"A movie theatre in Oakville decided to get creative after their security cameras captured the theft of a promotional poster for the Barbie movie over the weekend.
Film.ca Cinemas, located on Speers Road, posted a satirical movie trailer titled “Barbie Heist” to their Facebook page, which appears to show a male suspect stealing three posters from their display cases at the front of the theatre.
The cinema says the theft occurred just after 3:30 a.m. on Sunday, and the thief made away with a poster for the Barbie movie, ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ and ‘Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part one.’
Film.ca CEO Jeff Knoll told CP24 on Tuesday that they released the trailer in the hopes that the thief would bring the posters back, but so far, they’ve had no luck.
“The video just went up yesterday and we're hopeful that somebody will step forward and return the posters,” he said. “More importantly, the message we're trying to deliver is; please stop victimizing our theater.”
Knoll says that the theatre has dealt with a number of vandalism incidents over the past few years, including the theft of two ATM boxes which were dragged out with chains, damaging the theatre’s front doors, as well as the slashing of multiple cinema screens.
“We've had graffiti, we've had property theft, catalytic converter theft, we’ve just had a string of things happen to us since the pandemic and we just really want to say enough is enough,” he added.
“If you're going to come after us, we're going to make you famous, effectively.”
Knoll says he deliberately hasn’t gone to the police with a theft complaint because he doesn’t want to tie up their resources with what he says is a relatively minor crime.
“We've gone to the police with most of the previous ones, but this is a fairly petty theft and I happen to also serve on the Halton Police Board and I know how expensive our police resources are,” Knoll said.
“So I've made the decision not to pursue it through a police investigation that would cost thousands of dollars. I think that the punishment in this particular case is this person, his friends and family are going to know who he is from the video, I don't think there's any question about that.”
Knoll says the posters were initially provided to the theatre free of charge from the film’s production studio, but cost about $25 each to replace.
“But the poster like the Barbie poster would sell on eBay or Kijiji or one of those auction sites for quite a bit more because that's a popular movie,” he added.
“Maybe not so much the Haunted Mansion poster, which is why that one was left behind.”
The thief was also apparently not interested in the poster for Christopher Nolan’s latest blockbuster, ‘Oppenheimer,’ as it was also left behind.
Knoll delivered an on-air message to the alleged poster thief on Tuesday afternoon, saying the cinema simply wants its posters back.
“You made a bonehead move, we're tired of these things happening to our business. Bring the posters back, and, you know, we'll let bygones be bygones,” he said.
“But make no mistake about it, if you're going to victimize our business, you're going to be called out on it.”
Based on the security footage provided by the theatre, the alleged thief appears to be an adult male, wearing a white hooded sweatshirt, with a baseball cap, grey shorts and crocs. The suspect was also seen driving away in a black hatchback.
“To the Barbie thief,” said Knoll in the Barbie Heist trailer, “if you’re watching, we don’t want to be Kenemies, if you would kindly return the posters, that would be more than Kenough.”
“But we do want an answer to the question; did you really not see the cameras?”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jcDI0LmNvbS9uZXdzL3dlLWRvbi10LXdhbnQtdG8tYmUta2VuZW1pZXMtbW92aWUtdGhlYXRyZS1yZWxlYXNlcy10cmFpbGVyLWFwcGVhbGluZy1mb3ItcmV0dXJuLW9mLXN0b2xlbi1iYXJiaWUtcG9zdGVyLTEuNjUxMDg2MtIBMmh0dHBzOi8vYmV0YS5jcDI0LmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvOC84LzFfNjUxMDg2Mi5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Director Reveals Staggering Number of VFX Shots,"Paramount Pictures finally released the highly anticipated seventh installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise, and fans loved the most recent look at what Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is doing next. Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One was released to some of the best reviews of the [...]","Paramount Pictures finally released the highly anticipated seventh installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise, and fans loved the most recent look at what Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is doing next. Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One was released to some of the best reviews of the year, and it definitely lives up to the hype. From everything that was released in the trailers, Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One was shaping up to be one of the most action-packed films of the year. As it turns out, the film features a lot of visual effects shots, and that includes the shot of Cruise actually driving a motorcycle off of a mountain. In a new interview with PostPerspective, director Christopher McQuarrie revealed that the film has 2,500 VFX shots.
""There were 2,500. While Mission is almost entirely practical, there is a great deal of VFX work — removing camera rigs and safety gear, etc. The underwater submarine shots are entire CGI, which was a very big point of concern for me,"" McQuarrie said. ""I am deeply skeptical of purely CGI shots, particularly when they are the opening and closing shots of the film.Special effects supervisor Alex Wuttke assured me it could be made to work, and I was satisfied with the end result. The shot above the ice at the end of the film is practical, captured when we filmed the Arctic portions of Dead Reckoning Part Two in March of '23, just a few months before completion of Part One.""
""With over 2,500 shots, many of which were extremely ambitious, it's hard to pick just one. The motorcycle jump, despite being shot on the first day of principal photography, was one of the very last shots to make final. The shot in the trailer is not the finished product."" The Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning director added.

The Hollywood legend delighted fans at the premiere of his new movie, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, in Seoul, South Korea on Thursday when he briefly commandeered a photographer’s camera to take a snap of his co-stars in the movie — Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff and Vanessa Kirby.
“This guy loves to give his leading ladies the spotlight 🌟” Atwell captioned a video of the moment she shared on Instagram Friday.
In the clip, a dapper-looking Cruise is handed a camera as he stands among a group of photographers at the event. Text over the screen reads “The Moment Vs The Photo,” as the actor familiarizes himself with the camera’s settings.

Determined to get the right angle, Cruise leans down to his right to ensure he's nailed the perfect shot. An image of the photograph then appears in the clip.
“How does it look,” a voice asks Cruise as he walks away.
“Good,” the actor replies with a smile.

""Through my movies, I’ve been able to have that because everyone here has allowed me to entertain them. It’s a privilege that I have never taken for granted,"" he continued in his speech, highlighting the importance of seeing movies in theaters.

,'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One' - Hayley Atwell,"Moviefone speaks to Hayley Atwell about 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One' and Tom Cruise. He is dedicated, a professional, and a gentleman.","‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,’ which was co-written and directed by Academy Award-winner Christopher McQuarrie ('The Usual Suspects,' ‘Mission: Impossible – Fallout’), opens in theaters on July 12th and is the latest installment of the ‘Mission: Impossible’ franchise.
What is the plot of ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’?
In ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,’ Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team embark on their most dangerous mission yet: To track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity before it falls into the wrong hands. With control of the future and the fate of the world at stake, and dark forces from Ethan's past closing in, a deadly race around the globe begins. Confronted by a mysterious, all-powerful enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than his mission – not even the lives of those he cares about most.
Who is in the cast of ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’?
Tom Cruise ('Top Gun') as Ethan Hunt, Hayley Atwell (Captain America: The First Avenger') as Grace, Esai Morales ('Master Gardener') as Gabriel, Ving Rhames ('Pulp Fiction') as Luther Stickell, Simon Pegg ('Hot Fuzz') as Benji Dunn, Rebecca Ferguson ('Dune') as Ilsa Faust, Vanessa Kirby ('Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw') as Alanna Mitsopolis, Pom Klementieff (‘Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3’) as Paris, Henry Czerny ('Scream VI') as Eugene Kittridge, Shea Whigham ('Joker') as Jasper Briggs, and Greg Tarzan Davis ('Top Gun: Maverick') as Degas.
Moviefone recently had the pleasure of speaking with Hayley Atwell about her work on ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,’ her mysterious character, her relationship to Ethan Hunt, and working with Tom Cruise.
You can read the full interview below or click on the video player above to watch our interviews with Pegg, Hayley Atwell, Vanessa Kirby, Pom Klementieff, Shea Whigham, Greg Tarzan, and director Christopher McQuarrie.
Moviefone: To begin with, can you talk about your mysterious characters, Grace, and your approach to playing her?
Hayley Atwell: Great question. Because it was a collaborative one over a long period of time. There was a lot of time in filming where she didn't even have a name. So, we tried lots of different things and different kinds of qualities to see what kind of thing felt most exciting on camera and, Tom and McQuarrie, I'd met several times before. McQuarrie had come to see me in a play in London's West End about 10 years ago and said, ""I want to work with you. I just don't know what the character is yet."" So when I came in for the screen test for this, they both said, ""We're looking for the actor we want to work with and then we will build the character with them in real time as filming commences."" So I loved that. I found that very liberating because I trusted that I was in safe hands with them. They were not going to allow me to do something that ended up on a screen that I wouldn't be proud of. So it allowed me the freedom to try lots of different things. So, the five months of preparation of stunt training for it was also about studying films from ‘Paper Moon’ to ‘The Sting’ to ‘Broadcast News’ to ‘What's Up Doc?,’ to try and find a levity that I could take and build with Tom as a new kind of chemistry than you've seen before in this kind of franchise.
MF: What is Tom Cruise like as a scene partner, especially in the action sequences?
HA: He is dedicated, he is a consummate professional, and a gentleman. He's very concerned with people's health and safety as well as his own. So, he's meticulous in his preparation for any stunt that he does, which also means that his resources or an education for myself coming into this is so huge that I too felt like I could learn so much about what's going to keep me safe, what's going to keep me dynamic and mobile, and able to do a stunt several times from different directions, different takes with different performance notes, and how to sustain that over months and months. You feel very much in safe hands because he's like a boxing coach that's on your side. When you do something or land something, he is your greatest fan because he wants to see everyone around him thrive, which means his encouragement is contagious. I think everyone says that about him, that have worked with him in this way close up with him in terms of stunts that there's no one quite like him.
MF: Finally, can you talk about Grace’s alliance with Ethan Hunt?
HA: That was so fun to discover. It's going, how are they cat and mouse or sort of sibling, how can they play with each other but in a way that didn't seem to be too calculating? That they both needed each other in some way or both looking for the same thing, and how could they get their own needs met, but by using each other? To work with him in scenes, he's incredibly present. Anything that you offer up, he will have seen it, taken it on board and reacted to it. He's very alive to the other actor. Even when he's off-screen and he's standing behind the monitor or the camera and it's your closeup, he is right there with you giving exactly the same amount of energy and focus as he would be if he was in front of the camera too. So, you have a scene partner, you have someone that's in your corner and someone that's opposite you, that's holding the space for you to the best work you can possibly do in that moment.

As Cruise put his life on the line to perform the vigorous, intensive and dangerous stunts for the film, he needed the right gear for the job, so for one of his biggest scenes, stepped in one of the biggest performance eyewear brands.
Oakley teamed up with Cruise to design and develop bespoke eyewear for his iconic character, Ethan Hunt. With one of the most dangerous stunts in the Mission: Impossible franchise included in the recent film, Oakley had to innovatively design the ECLP23 glasses to withstand high speeds and extreme wind velocity.
While considered to be a prototype, the finished product was operational and provided a custom fit to Cruise’s face, as well as a “Zero Gravity” expression that offered the actor an expanded field of view, allowing for enhanced situational awareness.

This year’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, the seventh and ostensibly penultimate installment of the secret agent series, should reach similar heights. Tom Cruise is as big as he’s ever been — a feat as staggering as any Ethan Hunt stunt.
Because then there’s all the other stuff. The Scientology of it all. The Church’s interminable history of alleged abuses and misconduct and Cruise’s status as its most prominent figure, a high-ranking member with deep ties to leader David Miscavige. Cruise has been a Scientologist for nearly as long as he’s been a star, his introduction to the Church reportedly brokered around 1986 (the same year Top Gun came out) by his first wife Mimi Rogers. A lot has allegedly happened in that time, from the harrowing accusations against the Church itself (abuse, trafficking, forced labor, to name a few, all of which the Church has denied), to the various claims about Cruise’s relationship with it (the alleged arrangement of romantic partners, for one, which the Church has also denied).
And yet, none of it’s ever really caught up with Cruise, let alone dragged him down. Even Alex Gibney, who directed the damning Scientology doc Going Clear (based on Lawrence Wright’s book of the same name), admitted to Rolling Stone recently that he was “surprised” Cruise had avoided any kind of reckoning.
“There are stories about him that, if one could get people to go on the record, would be shocking,” Gibney said. “But they have to be willing to do it. And so far, they haven’t been.” (Cruise did not respond to a request for comment.) Editor’s picks

It’s easy to let one’s imagination run wild with known unknowns (just ask Donald Rumsfeld — or don’t, actually); but the thing is, there’s already a lot we do know about Tom Cruise and Scientology. It’s not some nasty secret stashed away. It barely qualifies as dirty laundry at this point. We’ve had years of tell-alls, exposés, memoirs, documentaries, lawsuits, even one unforgettable episode of South Park. At the most recent Oscars and Golden Globes, where Top Gun: Maverick was fêted with multiple nominations (and even won an Academy Award for Best Sound), hosts Jimmy Kimmel and Jerrod Carmichael both joked about it. They weren’t even subtle or winking, like the kind of jokes 30 Rock made about Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein years before the full extent of their alleged transgressions were revealed. Carmichael flat-out said the three Golden Globes Cruise returned in protest of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association should be exchanged for Shelly Miscavige — David’s wife, who hasn’t been seen in public since 2007.
With Tom Cruise, it’s yet to reach the point where we, as a culture, are devastated, disheveled, distraught, screaming, “He can’t keep getting away with it!” He remains deeply beloved, and not even in an unsettling, upsetting way, like some of our other prominent problematic actors. And it has everything to do with the way Cruise has thrown himself completely into his work over the past 10 years or so — the way he’s effectively replaced Scientology with a different public-facing religion: The Movies.
There was a brief window where it was possible the Tom Cruise/Scientology partnership would end in some kind of mutual assured destruction. The man was on an absolute tear in the mid-2000s, railing against psychology and pharmaceuticals, scolding Brooke Shields for taking antidepressants, then doubling down during a contentious interview with Matt Lauer. It was a time when Cruise was willing to sit down with a major publication like Rolling Stone for a wide-ranging, on-the-record interview, and give quotes like: “If you really want to know, get What Is Scientology?, the book, and look at it, because that’s what Scientology is. It’s a very large body of knowledge with tools that are available. It’s ah… it really is the shit, man.” Related
Shockingly, this didn’t exactly endear Cruise or the Church to the culture at large. A 2008 incident is telling: Hackers obtained and leaked an internal Church video that featured Cruise, full Steve Jobs mode in a black turtleneck, extolling the virtues of Scientology; there was also footage of Cruise accepting the Church’s “Freedom Medal of Valor” and saluting Miscavige. In response, the Church not only tried to wipe the video from the web, but cast doubt on its authenticity, claiming it was “pirated and edited.” By the end of that year, Cruise was apologizing to Lauer for acting “arrogant” and declining to answer interviewer questions about Scientology.
The first half of the 2010s saw more bad press with the release of Wright’s book and Gibney’s doc, as well as the high-profile defection of Leah Remini. Cruise even endured some self-inflicted wounds after filing a defamation suit against the tabloid Life & Style, which had run a story claiming Cruise had abandoned his daughter, Suri, with ex-wife Katie Holmes. In a 2013 deposition, he was forced to admit that Scientology had played a role in his divorce from Holmes, and that Holmes told him she wanted to protect their daughter from the Church. (The lawsuit ultimately settled out of court.)
But by that point, Cruise had weathered the worst of the storm he’d largely wrought upon himself. His M.O. was simple: keep quiet and make movies — and the movies he made were good. Thanks to a creative partnership with writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, he revived the Mission: Impossible franchise and also dropped a few fan favorites, like Jack Reacher and Edge of Tomorrow. (The two also worked together on The Mummy, though, so clearly no one’s perfect.)
Action flicks have always been a core component of the Cruise oeuvre; but after a versatile first 20 years as an actor, his focus narrowed on them in the 2000s, and since then, that focus seems to have only hardened into a raison d’être. There’s little doubt Cruise loves these kinds of movies and the work that goes into not only doing the stunts, but building the characters and stories to make those set pieces worthwhile. But “Tom Cruise, Action Hero” is also an appealing prospect and PR win: If you’re an organization beset by controversy and accusation, why wouldn’t you want your poster boy constantly saving the world?
But action flicks have suited Cruise similarly well in this era of muted public association with Scientology. Amidst the ceaseless rise of green screen tech and CGI tricks, and the Marvel-ization of blockbuster cinema, Cruise remains one of the crazy, blessed few still willing to throw himself out of a plane in service of the noble causes of storytelling and entertainment. That willingness to fully embody Ethan Hunt or Pete “Maverick” Mitchell is a great way to make people not necessarily forget, but stop worrying so much about L. Ron Hubbard, or Xenu, or Shelly Miscavige. Or from wondering, when was the last time Tom Cruise saw his daughter?
It certainly helped, too, that whenever Cruise went out to promote one of his new movies, he was never asked about any of that. Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation came out just a few months after Gibney’s Going Clear in 2015, and there’s nothing in the press cycle to suggest the doc was ever broached with Cruise on record. (One reporter got a very generic comment from Cruise the following year at the London premiere of Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, the actor calling Scientology a “beautiful religion” and “something that has helped me incredibly in my life.”) Instead, in these heavily moderated interviews and red carpet chats, he mostly talked about The Movies — his current movie, his next movie, his old movies, other people’s movies, and, maybe his favorite topic of all, the process of making movies.
Cruise would’ve probably kept chugging along like this, but Covid-19 added a new dimension. When audio leaked in late 2020 of Cruise upbraiding Mission: Impossible crew members for not following pandemic protocols, the overall reaction was less shock, more awe. His dedication to making this movie was absolute, imbued with a clear-eyed understanding of the existential threat Covid-19 posed to the film industry. He backed up those words with the fight to keep Top Gun: Maverick off streaming and ensure it safely landed in theaters. He was handsomely rewarded with box office receipts, rave reviews, and respect from his peers. “You saved Hollywood’s ass,” Steven Spielberg told him at an Oscars luncheon earlier this year, “you might have saved theatrical distribution. Seriously.”
Even at the height of his public association with Scientology, The Movies were like a kind of religion for Cruise. In 2002, when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences needed someone to validate the existence and value of film and the film industry after 9/11, it called on Cruise, and he delivered. You can see shades of it as far back as 1984, two years before his introduction to Scientology, in the way he discusses movies as a vehicle for betterment and serenity: “I’m interested in my personal growth, what’s going to make me happy. Not how much money am I gonna make, not what film is gonna really make me more visible.”
But without the pandemic, Cruise’s embrace of The Movies as his public-facing religion may not have reached such a full expression. What he says about The Movies hasn’t really changed that much, but now it’s shot through with the aura of the savior. With that irrepressible conviction and charisma, he has that preacher’s ability to turn repeated platitudes into mantras or prayers. (Seriously, his reliance on the bit about how, ever since he was four he wanted nothing more than to make movies and travel the world, has arguably surpassed Lady Gaga/100-people-in-a-room levels of ridiculousness — and yet it’s still kinda charming). And what other way is there to look at Cruise’s stunt work than the fearless devotions of a man willing to martyr himself for the thing he loves?
This is not to argue that The Movies has supplanted the Church of Scientology in Cruise’s private life, too. Despite the public distance, there’s no evidence that Cruise has recently drifted from, left, or ever intends to leave the Church. And therein lies the obvious complication: Tom Cruise, Action Hero was already a reliable way to take people’s minds off Tom Cruise, Scientologist; Tom Cruise, Action Hero and Savior of The Movies, is even better. The benefit to Cruise is clear — the continuation of his career and copious amounts of goodwill. You can even speculate as to the benefit for the Church itself: After all the bad press, investigations, and lawsuits, with membership reportedly declining, Cruise’s success may still be a beacon for those in it, a totem to clutch and claim only they understand its true value and power.
As for the rest of us, we seem to have reached a cordial stalemate with Cruise. We’ve delayed his reckoning — maybe forever, maybe only for now — allowed him to float above the level of a Mark Wahlberg, or worse, a Mel Gibson. And that’s because, as much as Tom Cruise, Action Hero and Savior of the Movies is good PR, it’s also who he is, who he’s always been. Despite everything else he believes, he still believes in The Movies.
There’s a famous tidbit about how Thomas Cruise Mapother IV spent a year in seminary school as a teenager before he started acting. Tom Cruise has always insisted Thomas Mapother was never actually close to becoming a priest, but the episode still encapsulates the zealous streak in his character, an irrepressible yearning for knowledge and understanding, his belief in, or need for, a higher calling or power. And before he found an outlet for all that in Scientology, he found it in acting and making movies. It’s still there. The proof is everywhere, even when he’s just looking a camera dead in the eye, smiling, and saying, “I love my popcorn. Movies, popcorn.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yb2xsaW5nc3RvbmUuY29tL3R2LW1vdmllcy90di1tb3ZpZS1mZWF0dXJlcy90b20tY3J1aXNlLXNjaWVudG9sb2d5LW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1tb3ZpZS1zYXZpb3ItMTIzNDc4OTAxNS_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucm9sbGluZ3N0b25lLmNvbS90di1tb3ZpZXMvdHYtbW92aWUtZmVhdHVyZXMvdG9tLWNydWlzZS1zY2llbnRvbG9neS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctbW92aWUtc2F2aW9yLTEyMzQ3ODkwMTUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,Why is Jeremy Renner NOT in Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning?,"The Mission: Impossible franchise began as a revolving door.

It wasn't until 2006's Mission: Impossible 3 that fans were introduced to Simon Pegg's Benji, Ethan Hunt's latest right hand [...]","The Mission: Impossible franchise began as a revolving door. Only two actors have appeared in every film, those being leading man Tom Cruise and supporting star Ving Rhames. It wasn't until 2006's Mission: Impossible 3 that fans were introduced to Simon Pegg's Benji, Ethan Hunt's latest right hand man that ended up being the one to stay. The next installment brought in then-blossoming top star Jeremy Renner to play William Brandt, a character that was all but Ethan's equal when it came to many aspects of the Impossible Missions Force. Even though Ethan proved himself to still be the franchise's sole leading man, William had a comfortable spot as second in command.
Introduced in 2011's Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, William Brandt is the Chief Analyst to the Secretary of the IMF. It's revealed later in that film that William is a former field agent himself, like Ethan, but he gave up that position after his team seemingly failed a mission in Croatia. That mission in question was to protect Ethan and his wife Julia, and William believed that he made a choice that led to Julia's death. After Ethan revealed Julia is still quietly alive, William regained his confidence and resumed his position as a field agent.
Renner was back in the role for 2015's Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, becoming just the fourth ""regular"" within the franchise (alongside Cruise, Pegg, and Rhames). That said, Renner was nowhere to be seen come 2018's Mission: Impossible – Fallout and is evidently absent from the latest installment, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning.
When it came to his absence from Fallout, director Christopher McQuarrie revealed that the production schedule conflicted with Renner's commitments within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
""It was just an unfortunate case of bad timing,"" McQuarrie said in 2018. ""At the time, when the movie started, we didn't really have a screenplay, so it was very difficult for us to say who would be in the movie for how long and on what days, and he had a commitment to Marvel. There was just simply no predicting. If we had a finished script, we would have been able to say, 'Yes, this will work and we can let you go for this time.' But there was just no predicting what those roles were going to turn out to.""
Once upon a time, Renner was envisioned as Cruise's successor in the franchise. Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation cinematographer Robert Elswit revealed in 2019 that Cruise's Ethan was originally going to become the IMF Secretary at the end of the fourth installment, with Renner's William taking center stage in the field. Despite these initial plans, Paramount Pictures ultimately kept Cruise as the leading man throughout Ghost Protocol and the film's franchise-record box office return gave the studio the confidence to keep rolling with the original star.
While there was no word on why Renner missed Dead Reckoning Part 1, it was likely due to another scheduling conflict. Renner filmed Hawkeye while Dead Reckoning was rolling cameras on its rescheduled shoot, as the seventh installment was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Even though it's been over one decade since he debuted in the franchise, Renner's Mission: Impossible contract does have at least one more movie on it. The action star revealed in 2014 that he ""signed on to do three Mission: Impossible movies with Tom"" when he first inked his M:I deal in 2010. This leaves a Dead Reckoning Part 2 appearance on the table, although it will likely come down to scheduling once again.

Here's when you can expect to see Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One on streaming.,"Where to Stream: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning - Part One
Powered by Reelgood
Tom Cruise is primed to dominate the summer box office for the second year in a row, with Mission Impossible 7—aka Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One—coming to theaters this weekend.
Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who has helmed all of the Mission: Impossible films since 2015’s Rogue Nation, the seventh movie in this franchise once again finds Agent Ethan Hunt on a mission. (An impossible one. Duh.) This time Ethan and his team are facing off an adversary known as “the Entity,” which sounds sufficiently scary. But if anyone can handle it, it’s Tom Cruise. This is the the man who drives his motorcycle off the edge of a cliff and doesn’t bat an eye.
Despite Cruise’s insistence that he’ll see us at the movies, some folks may be wondering if they can wait to watch Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning on streaming. Don’t worry, Decider has all the info you need to help you make an informed decision. Read on to find out when Mission Impossible 7 will be on Paramount Plus.
Will Mission Impossible 7 be on Paramount Plus?
Yes. Mission Impossible 7 will eventually be streaming on Paramount+, after the movie has left theaters and released on DVD and digital platforms, because it is a Paramount Pictures release, and all of the new Paramount movies have been going to Paramount.+
When will Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning be on Paramount Plus?
The short answer? We don’t know. A Mission Impossible 7 Paramount+ release date has not yet been announced, given that the film is only just now opening in theaters. However, we can make an educated guess as to when Mission Impossible 7 will be on Paramount+, based on previous Paramount releases.
Last year’s Top Gun Maverick, another big Paramount release starring Tom Cruise, was released in theaters on May 23 and began streaming on Paramount+ on December 22—about six months after it opened in theaters. If Mission Impossible 7 follows the same release pattern, you can expect Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One to be streaming on Paramount+ in February 2024.
Six months is a long time to wait, so if you want to see Tom Cruise hang off of things right now, you can go see Mission Impossible 7 in theaters.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZGVjaWRlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8xMy9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtNy1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1wYXJhbW91bnQtcGx1cy1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWNpZGVyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3LzEzL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS03LWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLXBhcmFtb3VudC1wbHVzLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-06 16:49:18+00:00,Hayley Atwell: 'Drifting Was My Thing' While Filming Mission Impossible,"Hayley Atwell trained for five months before cameras rolled on ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One.""","Hayley Atwell’s Marvel Cinematic Universe character Peggy Carter was already a high bar to clear, but watching her performance as Grace, a pickpocket who gets roped into the world of Ethan Hunt’s (Tom Cruise) Impossible Missions Force is a worthy successor. Grace has a shadowy backstory but in just the first 10 minutes of her appearance, the audience learns she’s a master of thievery – and that took a lot of training.
“I trained for five months before we began shooting,” Atwell told TheWrap. “In that time, [director] Chris McQuarrie and Tom [Cruise], and Wade Eastwood, our stunt coordinator, would be monitoring my progress to see where my natural skills lay.”
The actress didn’t just have to master sleight of hand to play a pickpocket, but also working with knives and guns, doing unarmed combat, mixed martial arts – and stunt driving. Based on how successful Atwell was at each thing would go into her character’s backstory.
“It became a total surprise to me that drifting was my thing,” she said. Not only was it something Atwell could do, and enjoyed, but it inspired Cruise and McQuarrie to craft a cat-and-mouse car chase between the pair where they not only have to evade baddies in different stolen vehicles, but do so handcuffed together.
“I remember this one day I was having to drift in in front of the wedding cake monument in Rome, [and] do 360 [degree] spins, drift out again, come back in, 360 the other way and go back out again. And we knew that the camera was gonna roll and get as much footage as possible,” she said.
With three cameras attached to the windscreen, limiting Atwell’s vision, the stunt became even more complicated with Cruise handcuffed to her in the passenger seat which “is somewhere, literally and metaphorically, Tom Cruise doesn’t particularly love being, as you can understand,” Atwell said. “He is the one that’s always driving.”
The abundance of stimulation forced Atwell to develop a hyper-vigilance of being present in the moment while also being able to improvise.
“While I was drifting with impaired vision, while it’s slightly raining, in this incredible old city with lots of people also watching during a pandemic, Tom would feed me lines of dialogue and I would have to work out whether it was Tom telling Haley, ‘Really, do slow down. This is dangerous’ or Ethan telling Grace [to] slow down or take a left, in which case I would then improvise back that she might do the opposite,” Atwell said.

7/13/2023 11:00,Tom Cruise's real 'Mission: Impossible' was making me like him,"""Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One"" made SFGATE columnist Drew Magary reluctantly think that Tom Cruise might be our last hope at saving movies.","Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt in “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.” Christian Black
You’d like confirmation that the latest “Mission: Impossible” is worth your money, so let me give that to you right now. “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” — a title so ornate that it has to go out of its way to avoid using three colons — is predictably a great time in the theater.
The stuntwork is first class. Rebecca Ferguson again outclasses everyone else on screen. The location porn, especially all of the scenes set in Italy, is fantastic. The score is grandiose in ways that most movie scores now simply aren’t, amping up the tension rather than intruding upon it. Director Christopher McQuarrie adds enough of his signature wrinkles to the action sequences, especially a fight sequence that takes place in an unbearably tight Venetian alleyway, to make those sequences feel realistic in a movie that is not. Despite being a Part One affair, it sticks its landing much better than “Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse” did, with an Orient Express-bound finale that had me and my kids going “HOLY S—T,” in unison, on multiple occasions. And best of all, its CGI work is, for the most part, barely discernible. Every penny is up there on the screen, and it makes a wild difference. This is a movie made by people who clearly give a s—t about movies. Turns out that can make quite a difference in the final product.
Which brings us to star Tom Cruise, who is the last of his breed. No one on Earth cares about movies more than this man, which is how Tom Cruise went from being known mostly as a freakshow Scientologist early in this century to being a self-appointed head ambassador for his chosen industry. No one acts harder, and no one lobbies harder. To that end, “MIDR1” first opens not with a bunch of expensive production company logos (don’t worry, they arrive soon enough), but with a message from Cruise and McQuarrie thanking you, the moviegoer, for coming to the theater to watch their film on a big screen, the way both God and Cruise intended. It’s like having your movie be introduced by the world’s highest paid ArcLight ushers.

And Cruise is right to appreciate us moviegoers, given the dire shape that movies are in presently. Ticket sales are down 21% from just a year ago, and the box office has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. The writers are on strike, with actors potentially following suit. Studios intend to break them by dragging out the work stoppage until fall and beyond, drying up the production pipeline entirely as a result, save for a self-produced Lizzo documentary or six. Meanwhile, comic book movie fatigue has set in among audiences, with “The Flash,” “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” and “Ant Man 3: Sure Why Not” all failing to make a significant profit. That’s not good for an industry that long ago adopted a Reaganomics business model where a handful of cookie-cutter franchise movies are counted on to buoy ALL titles below them, and scumbag studio chiefs like David Zaslav are disappearing movies entirely, both old and new, in an effort to dodge taxes and limit audience choices to the few McMovie combo meals.
In this way, Cruise’s franchise is an anomaly among its brethren: a series that features real stunt work and real location shots, and limits visible CGI wherever it can. The only reason that the “MI” films have been able to pull this off is because of Cruise’s sheer force of will, and because of the incredible amount of power he wields at Paramount.
But that power, like Cruise himself, can’t last forever.

The next “MI” installment might be Cruise’s last, almost because it has to be. In that PSA before the start of “Dead Reckoning,” Cruise looks his 61 years of age more than he ever has. After all, there’s only so much that cosmetic medicine, tasteful muscle shirts and natural beauty can do to keep the years at bay. There will come a time when Cruise won’t be able to ride a motorcycle off of a cliff face, and he’ll have to choose between playing normal characters — something he may not be able to do because he hasn’t BEEN a normal person since the 1980s — and electing himself president of the Motion Picture Association of America. Either way, he won’t be able to use his status as The Last Movie Star to make top-of-the-line action films and promote them harder than he promotes Dianetics to children.
Cruise’s films are by no means perfect. The story line of “Dead Reckoning” is overstuffed in ways that virtually every franchise movie is now. There’s a ton of needless exposition, given that the plot is essentially a scavenger hunt for a magic key. And some of the characters are underdeveloped, most notably Pom Klementieff’s villainous henchwoman, who’s like Harley Quinn without the jokes. But Cruise, with generous help from his castmates and McQuarrie, helps the film transcend those now-common flaws. With him gone, “MI” will likely keep going, because money. And I can guarantee you that the next Ethan Hunt won’t be running (always running, this guy) across real airport terminal rooftops and actually hanging onto real airplanes as they take off. All of that movie magic will be replaced by prototypical green screen horses—t, more superfluous world-building, and Ezra Miller for some reason. The franchise will suffer for it. All movies will.

2023-07-15 14:17:00+00:00,"‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’ Seeing $78M 5-Day US, $240M WW: Why Sequel Is In Better Position Than ‘Indy’ – Box Office Update","Mission Impossible - Dead Reckoning' Eyes $6M-$7M in Tuesday Previews, $90M 5-day Domestic Box Office opening","UPDATE SATURDAY AM: In the wake of the older-skewing, very expensive Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny stumbling at the box office with an $83.8M Friday-Tuesday domestic start, sources have called upon me to evaluate a similarly priced, older dude franchise sequel at around $300M. That’s this weekend’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which, analyzed by the same measuring stick — particularly given the pic’s U.S./Canada 5-day of $78M — is well-below the $90M tracking Paramount was hoping for. Three-day here is $54.2M.

But here is the root of the root, and the bud of the bud, and that is Dead Reckoning and Dial of Destiny are not the same. Already, in its running global take of $122.2M through yesterday, Dead Reckoning is on the verge of overtaking the $130M global start of Indy.
In fact, Dead Reckoning is bound to have the upper hand in the long-run, particularly on a global basis.
Yes, I just said that.
Dead Reckoning‘s demos are very similar to Dial of Destiny: 55+ was both their largest quad (Mission at 22%, Indy at 25%), Men over 25 are dominant in the turnout (respectively 46%, 43%), the prime moviegoing demo of 18-34 is just over a third for both (37%, 36%), and so on.

However, the reviews and audiences exits on Dead Reckoning bury Dial of Destiny. In updated Friday night PostTrak exits, Dead Reckoning gets 5 stars and 90% from audiences (Indy only received 4 stars and 79%), with men/women at 62% / 38% grading it 90% / 89% (Indy‘s grades for both were 74% and 85%). Deal with it, Disney: The ball was dropped quality wise on Dial of Destiny, and the sequel is suffering with critics and fans. We expect more from Lucasfilm, especially on a legacy finale.
Grosses went down between Indiana Jones movies, while grosses went up on Mission movies: Dead Reckoning could see a 5-day franchise record still, besting Mission: Imposible II’s $78.8M. The Cruise feature is still in its prime; keep reading.
Said one rival studio executive source this AM, “With these reviews and PostTrak numbers, I would expect this one to leg out through summer — these are strong numbers.”
If anything, the Tom Cruise sequel has all the mojo to not only outstrip Indy domestically, but the potential to make significantly more overseas — even if China doesn’t pull in a $100M+ gross like it did on Mission: Impossible – Fallout, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.
Cruise’s previous three Mission movies generated over 70% of their global box office abroad. Indy is not going to do that. As we told you yesterday, the global outlook for Dead Reckoning is still around $240M; As of last weekend, Indy‘s global was slightly more domestic than foreign, 51% to 49%.
But wait a second, wait a second — wasn’t Dead Reckoning suppose to open to $90M over five days? This is surely an upset, no? The reality of the situation here stateside is that there isn’t any Top Gun: Maverick halo effect. That long-awaited sequel brought out non-moviegoers, people who haven’t been to the movies in years. Dead Reckoning is bringing its finite, older-skewing fanbase. As a Mission movie, Dead Reckoning‘s start here isn’t below its franchise expectations.
Hold on again – doesn’t Dead Reckoning stand to lose as much money as Dial of Destiny? Both cost about the same. What’s clear is that the industry is still releasing over-budgeted movies that were challenged by Covid stops; Dead Reckoning being one of the first movies to shut down because of the pandemic in Italy back in early 2020. The box office to profit measure for some of these tentpoles is still a hurdle, and will continue to be for a while. These movies weren’t made under normal circumstances, and Disney and Paramount both invested heavily in prime IP under the notion that they would deliver, and it’s better to perfect and avoid scaling back costs. Who doesn’t want to invest more on a trusted franchise sequel, especially a global star who delivered one of the highest-grossing movies of last year in Top Gun: Maverick?
However, as we said above — the word of mouth on Dead Reckoning will empower it, even with Barbie next weekend potentially posting Little Mermaid numbers ($95M+ 3-day) and adult-leaning Oppenheimer in the mix, and that buzz will carry the Cruise film through all ancillaries.
Let’s step back again and assess — Dead Reckoning is posting a lower 3-day and 5-day next to Dial of Destiny. Why is that? The notion is that with Dead Reckoning having all the goods in great reviews and audience exits, there was no reason for it to debut on a Wednesday stateside. The movie could have gone on Friday and saw a $78M 3-day, which would have been a record opening for the Cruise series. I was under the impression that the movie, at a long running time of 2 hours and 43 minutes, would benefit from a 5-day launch, given that there’s fewer showtimes at cinemas, and it would propel word of mouth. However, another source splashed water in my face and reminded me that the exhibition infrastructure as it is has the capacity and the power to deliver enormous box office grosses: Hello, Avengers: Endgame was a three-hour movie and holds the opening domestic box office record opening with $357.1M.
Like Indy, could Mission have expanded to a younger audience? Of course, and Cruise might want to consider hiring some popular YA stars for future sequels. Imagine the juiced gross on a Mission: Impossible if Harry Styles or Zendaya were part of the ensemble.

The Cruise sequel is playing strongest in the East, West & Mountain. Meanwhile, red state fave Sound of Freedom is throwing off those percentages, as it’s so strong in the middle of the country. Meanwhile, 53% of Sound of Freedom‘s $23.6M second weekend (up a massive 20%) is coming from the South, South Central, and Midwest (parts of the country that do very well with Cruise movies).
PLFs and Imax screens are driving 42% of Dead Reckoning‘s business to date.
In 13 days, Sound of Freedom, with $82M, will have made more than Everything Everywhere All at Once‘s lifetime domestic of $77.1M. Of course, both movies appeal to polar opposites. But it’s interesting to note their comparison, as both movies were unexpected outliers that were unforeseen in their success at the B.O.
This movie is stoking the Fox News Channel crowd to get out to the movies, and is appealing to them in its subject of child-trafficking, something which some right wingers believe is the fault of the left. The movie’s success is a testament to its star, title, and release date: It headlines Jesus (Jim Caviezel from Passion of the Christ), and the distributor, Angels Studios, was adamant that the movie open on July 4. Why? The picture has the word “Freedom” in the title, and that says something to the red state crowd, especially on the Day of Independence.
Total weekend box office is an estimated $130.3M from all titles, off 2% from a year ago, when Thor: Love and Thunder led the box office in its second weekend, and +3% from pre-pandemic 2019, when Spider-Man: Far From Home held No. 1 in its second frame.

UPDATE FRIDAY PM: As we told you, it’s all about global when it comes to the opening of Paramount/Skydance’s Tom Cruise sequel Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One and we hear a $240 million global start is being forecasted right now. Stateside, the 5-day is $76M after what is expected to be a $16M Friday and $52.2M 3-day at 4,327 theaters. Offshore opening will be $164M.
Anything north of a $78.8M 5-day domestic is an opening record for the franchise stateside; currently, that benchmark is owned by the Wednesday-through-Sunday start of 2000’s Mission: Impossible II. (Deadline’s Nancy Tartaglione will have more details on foreign later this weekend.) China is eyeing a $27M-$30M weekend, not too shabby for a Hollywood film now. We’ll take it. The last Mission: Impossible, 2018’s Fallout, posted a $76.1M in the PRC (not accounting for inflation and currency swings); that was a much different time for Hollywood movies. Note Japan, a big Mission market, isn’t in this opening suite.
Angel Studios’ Sound of Freedom continues to ring loudly at 3,265 theaters with a second Friday of $6M (+15%), a second weekend between $20M-$22.5M, and running cume that could reach $81M by EOD Sunday. This Jim Caviezel thriller is bound for a $100M-plus gross. Rivals are even betting substantially more.
Sony/Stage 6 Films/Blumhouse’s Insidious: The Red Door is seeing a $4.35M Friday, -71%, with a second weekend of $13.5M, -59%, and running total by Sunday of $58.6M at 3,188 theaters.
Disney/Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, booked at 3,865 spots, is seeing a third Friday of $3.6M, -53%, and third weekend of $12.9M, -53%, and a running total by Sunday of $146.2M.
Disney/Pixar’s Elemental continues to hold in the top five with an estimated fifth weekend of $8.8M, a great -12% hold, and a running total of $125.3M. That will fire it past Lightyear‘s final domestic of $118.3M. Friday is estimated to be around $2.5M at 3,235 theaters.
UPDATE, FRIDAY AM: Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One saw $8.3 million million on Thursday, repping a 47% decline from the Wednesday opening plus previews of $15.5M. The two-day total for the Paramount/Skydance feature is $23.8M from 4,049 theaters. Hopefully this film spikes today. I mean, it will spike today, it’s just by how much given that A CinemaScore and 4 1/2 stars and 88% on Screen Engine/Comscore’s PostTrak. Guys at 65% gave the movie its best grades at 90%. Women at 35% weren’t that far behind at 86%.
A $90M five-day total seems unlikely, with rivals spotting $50M over three days and $73M over five. We’ll dissect what’s up here on this near-$300M production as the numbers become clearer; the feature went through several Covid delays. Right now M:I‘s box office looks similar to that of Paramount’s 2017 Transformers: The Last Knight, which was another long movie at 2 hours and 34 minutes that opened on Wednesday to $15.6M and Thursday to $8.1M for a two-day of $23.7M. However, that was largely a younger-guy-skewing feature versus the 74% over 25 here; and it was a B+ picture and not one of the fan-faves for the robots-in-disguise series. Last Knight‘s first Friday was $13.7M.
Last night’s 7 p.m. Dolby auditorium show for Dead Reckoning at the AMC Porter Ranch (30 minutes north of Los Angeles, and where Nicole Kidman shot the exhib’s commercial) was nearly sold out. What that exemplifies for these big tentpoles is that we’re under-screened when it comes to premium-format auditoriums. There’s no reason why a big star like Tom Cruise should have to go around asking for more PLF screens on a movie for which he’s already doing 360-degree press; exhibition has to build more of them if we’re going to expand the marketplace. Mission is expected to have its grab of PLFs next weekend despite Universal’s three-hour Christopher Nolan epic Oppenheimer muscling in.
Speaking of publicity, especially at a time when there aren’t any late-night talk shows, Dead Reckoning had a ton of it. Cruise is becoming a rare movie star, together with Dwayne Johnson, who knows how to go all out in making a movie a fire-breathing event and having the world know about it. I mean, this movie was promoted at two different CinemaCons, 2021 and 2022; there was the Rome premiere where the pic was shot including a mind-blowing chase scene; as well as multiple global stops by Cruise. RelishMix says that the social media universe reach for Dead Reckoning is at an awesome 529.9M across TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube views, which is ahead of Top Gun: Maverick (401.5 SMU/$126.7M opening), John Wick 4 (452.3M SMU/$73.8M opening) and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (296.4M/$60.3m opening).
‘Sound of Freedom’ Everett
Meanwhile, Angel Studios’ Sound of Freedom continues to wow. The pic posted daily middays of $4M+, out-pegging Sony/Stage 6 Films/Blumhouse’s Insidious: The Red Door every day. The latter pic took No. 1 last weekend with $33M. On Thursday, Sound of Freedom grossed an estimated $4.5M, +4% over Wednesday. Pic’s last seven days grossed $36.5M for a running total of $58.5M. Angel Studios released a statement yesterday, squashing rumors that AMC has made it difficult for patrons to see the movie. That’s fake news, with the circuit selling more than 1 million tickets so far for the Jim Caviezel thriller. The pic is getting 450 theaters added to the current count of 2,852 theaters.
Red Door was third on Thursday with $2.5M, -1% from Wednesday and a first week of $45M at 3,188 locations.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny did $2.3M on Thursday at 4,600 theaters, even with Wednesday, for a second-week take of $38.6M and a running total of $133.3M.
‘Elemental’ Disney
Disney has fifth place with Elemental and a fourth Thursday of $1.6M, +6% from Wednesday, with a $17M fourth week; its running total is $116.5M at 3,440 theaters. Get a load of this: Despite the Pixar movie opening lower than Lightyear, $29.6M to $50.5M, it’s going to outstrip that Toy Story spinoff’s final domestic total of $118.3M.
UPDATED THURSDAY AM: Paramount reported $15.5M for the Wednesday opening day of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which includes previews. The studio isn’t reporting a 3 and 5-day projection as those type of forecasts can be wonky and it ultimately boils down to Friday business.
Rivals, however, are betting at this point in time that Dead Reckoning isn’t as big as the $90M tracking purported it to be. More like $47M for the 3-day and $70.5M per industry estimates right now. The worry here is if this is Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny all over again with a very expensive film near $300M production cost, long-running time and older dude skewing franchise falling short of expectations. There’s a chance on a five-day basis, this could still be a franchise record start: Mission: Impossible II has the best five-day opening for the Cruise series at $78.8M.
With a running time of 2 hours and 43 minutes, it’s clear that Dead Reckoning is appointment viewing for moviegoers like Avatar: The Way of Water and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. However, it’s a fast 2 hours and 43 minutes given the awesome action set pieces in the movie.
Last night on Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak, Dead Reckoning looked similar to Indy‘s Thursday night demos with 34% over 45, 74% over 25 and heavily male at 65%.
However, here’s the box office viagra that Ethan Hunt has over Indiana Jones, and hopefully this will bode well in spreading word of mouth, especially with the younger demos: Dead Reckoning has an A CinemaScore to Dial of Destiny‘s B+. That’s the second A for a Mission movie after 2018’s Fallout. The franchise counts three A- grades for Rogue Nation, Mission Impossible III and Ghost Protocol. Mission: Impossible did B+ while Mission: Impossible II got a B. It’s also one of the best reviewed Missions of all-time at 96% certified fresh to Fallout‘s 97% certified fresh. In addition, Mission‘s edge over Indy is that Cruise and the franchise are more of a draw at the overseas boxoffice than the Lucasfilm IP (which isn’t even known in certain big markets like China). Korea and Japan are expected to be big for Dead Reckoning. It’s overseas in the end that could possibly bail this very pricey Mission movie out. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny opened to $130M WW, with a domestic 3-day of $60.3M. The Friday-Tuesday five day was $83.8M. Current global on the Lucasfilm franchise finale is north of $256M WW.
On social media, RelishMix spots, “Convo tone on Dead Reckoning runs positive as fans acknowledge Tom Cruise’s tireless tenacity as Hollywood’s modern daredevil, proclaiming he’s ‘hauling modern cinema on his back.’ Paired with filmmaker Christoper McQuarrie’s daring direction and newcomer Hayley Atwell, some already herald it as potentially ‘the best action movie of all time.’ This series is being elevated above competitors, notably Fast X and The Fast and Furious franchise, with fans assertively favoring its consistently epic entries — ‘This franchise is the movie embodiment of aged fine wine.’ Even with a chorus of praise, a handful of viewers yearn for fresh elements, countering the franchise’s predictable beats. Yet, the Mission: Impossible saga continues its powerful performance, captivating its loyal audience and igniting anticipation for this new chapter.”
UPDATED WEDNESDAY PM: Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One‘s opening day is looking like $16 million, which includes the $7M in previews.
Yes, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Mission: Impossible – Fallout both posted first days in the $22M-$23M range, but those were Fridays. This is about the long play of the movie, and Tom Cruise fare is back-loaded. The reason why this pic is going for the five-day record is due to its length, at 2 hours and 43 minutes. It’s expected, especially with a current great Rotten Tomatoes audience score of 94%, to get to $90M, a franchise record opening, by Sunday. Again, it’s still early. These numbers could go up.
Sound of Freedom is looking at second place with $3.9M and a running total of $53.4M. That daily gross is holding steady with Monday and Tuesday. Very impressive.
UPDATE AFTER EXCLUSIVE: Paramount/Skydance’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One came in at the high end of expectations with $7M in previews. Pic was booked at 3,300 locations and hikes its theater count up to 4,000-plus today including Imax and PLF.
I’m told that the fan PLF money from Monday shows isn’t included in that $7M figure. The previous chapter, Mission: Impossible – Fallout posted Thursday previews of $6M, a record for the franchise. Next to other summer comps, Disney/Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny posted $7.2M in previews.
The Rotten Tomatoes audience score out of the gate after previews is 94%.
Tom Cruise and filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie have been touring the film; the duo making stops in Toronto, Atlanta, Miami, and Washington DC, greeting fans at cinemas.

In early estimates this morning, Angel Studio’ Jim Caviezel thriller Sound of Freedom won another weekday with $4M yesterday, beating Sony/Blumhouse/Stage 6 Films’ Insidious: The Red Door which had $3.48M. Both pics had even holds from Monday percent-wise. Sound of Freedom raises its running total to $49.7M in its eight-day run. Wow. It’s expected that the pic will post a -30% ease in weekend 2 with around $13M-$14M after a $19.6M reported 3-day last week. Red Door‘s five day run rises to $40M.
EXCLUSIVE: Paramount/Skydance’s Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning – Part One is looking at $6M-$7M in previews so far, which is bound to be higher than the Thursday previews of the last Mission Impossible – Fallout back in 2018 which did $6M. This is according to sources. The figures we’re seeing now could go higher or lower.
Dead Reckoning previews began at 2PM today, however, I hear there were PLF fan screenings on Monday and that handful of bucks is accounted for in the estimate.
Dead Reckoning is one of the longer films of the summer at 2 hours and 43 minutes with credits. Not as long as Oppenheimer‘s 3 hours (opening on July 21), but longer than Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2 hours and 34 minutes) and The Flash (2 hours and 24 minutes). However, the action is unlike anything any Mission Impossible or Fast and Furious movie has ever delivered before. Seriously, that Rome, Italy car chase will make you want to see the movie again. Paramount is going for a Mission:Impossible franchise five-day record here with a Wednesday start, which is smart given this sequel’s length and the limited amount of showtimes exhibitors can program. Disney did not execute a Wednesday start with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, another older dude skewing film, the studio opting for a Friday launch and seeing $60.3M over three days before July 4.
The best reviewed Mission: Impossible of all-time at 98% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, Dead Reckoning is projected to have a $90M five-day stateside, $250M+ worldwide.
Last year, the decades long-awaited sequel Top Gun: Maverick posted the best box office results of Cruise’s career with $19.3M in U.S. previews, $126.7M domestic opening, and $256.4M WW start. The pic finaled at $718.7M domestic (No. 1 pic for 2023 domestic), $1.49 billion WW (No 2 global for 2023 after Avatar: The Way of Water).
Mission: Impossible – Fallout opened to $61.2M domestic, and legged out to $220.1M domestic, and $791.6M WW. Even if Mission comes up short this weekend, remember, Cruise’s movies are always backloaded at the B.O.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvYm94LW9mZmljZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctdG9tLWNydWlzZS0xMjM1NDM0ODIxL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvYm94LW9mZmljZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctdG9tLWNydWlzZS0xMjM1NDM0ODIxL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
7/16/2023 16:34,"‘Mission: Impossible’ debuts with $80M over five days, igniting box office but missing expectations","After a globe-trotting publicity blitz by star Tom Cruise, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” launched with a franchise-best $80 million over five days, though it came in shy of industry expectations with a $56.2 million haul over the three-day weekend.","NEW YORK (AP) — After a globe-trotting publicity blitz by star Tom Cruise, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” launched with a franchise-best $80 million over five days, though it came in shy of industry expectations with a $56.2 million haul over the three-day weekend, according to studio estimates.
The Paramount Pictures debut was boosted by strong overseas sales of $155 million from 70 markets. But while a $235 million worldwide launch marked one of the best global openings of the year, “Dead Reckoning” couldn’t approach the high-speed velocity of last summer’s top film, “Top Gun: Maverick.”
“Dead Reckoning Part One,” the seventh film in the 27-year-old series, had been forecast to better the franchise high of the previous installment, “Fallout,” which opened with $61 million domestically in 2018. Instead, it also fell short of the $57.8 million “Mission: Impossible II” debuted with in 2000.
That puts the film’s opening-weekend tally very close to the tepid launch of Disney’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which opened in U.S. and Canadian theaters with $82 million over five days and $60 million over the three-day weekend. Paramount and Skydance had higher hopes for the action extravaganza of “Dead Reckoning,” which cost $290 million to make, not counting marketing expenses.
Those costs were inflated, in part, by the pandemic. “Dead Reckoning,” directed by Christopher McQuarrie, was among the first major productions shut down by COVID-19. It was preparing to shoot in Italy in March 2020. When the film got back on track, McQuarrie and Cruise helped lead the industry-wide recovery back to film sets – albeit with some well-publicized friction over protocols along the way.
Still, “Dead Reckoning” was hailed as a high point in the franchise. Critics (96% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and fans (an “A” CinemaScore) alike came away awed by the stunts and chases of the latest “Mission: Impossible” film. Though the coming competition of “Barbenheimer” — the much-anticipated debuts of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” — looms, “Mission: Impossible” should play well for weeks to come.
“This is a global franchise. It’s going gangbusters and its going to play for a long time. Quality always wins in the end,” said Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount.
“Dead Reckoning,” Aronson said, met or exceeded the studio’s expectations.
“In international markets, in like-for-like markets, we’re 15% ahead of ‘Fallout,’ and that’s taking China out,” added Aronson. “Domestically, we’re over 3% ahead of ‘Fallout’ for the first five days. To beat its predecessor is phenomenal, especially in this environment.”
Cruise, the so-called savior of movie theaters last year, traveled tirelessly to again pump life back into a summer box office that’s been sluggish. After a splashy world premiere in Rome with a red-carpet on the Spanish Steps, Cruise and McQuarrie surprised theaters in Atlanta, Miami, Toronto and Washington D.C. in the days ahead of opening.
“Dead Reckoning” hit theaters at a crucial mid-summer period for Hollywood, and not just because of the SAG-AFTRA strike which began Thursday. “Mission: Impossible” launched a week before one of the biggest box-office showdowns of the year.
Though “Dead Reckoning” and “Oppenheimer” have vied for some of the same IMAX screens, each film has publicly endorsed the idea that a rising tide lifts all blockbusters. Cruise and McQuarrie in early July even bought opening-weekend tickets to both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.” “Barbie” director Greta Gerwig and “Oppenheimer” filmmaker Christopher Nolan reciprocated with their own gestures of support.
However that trio of films performs over the next few weeks will do a lot to determine the fate of the summer box office.
“These are a crucial couple of weeks for the industry starting this weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. “I think it’s going to be a fun reinvigoration of the box office because we have had a few films underperforming. Really, the summer movie season restarts this week with ‘Mission’ leading into ‘Barbenheimer.’”
No other new wide release challenged “Mission: Impossible” over the weekend. Second place went to Angel Studios’ faith-based political thriller “Sound of Freedom” which increased 37% in its second with $27 million. Jim Caveziel stars in the child trafficking drama.
Last week’s top film, “ Insidious: The Red Door "" slid to third with $13 million in its second weekend. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is dropping quickly with $12 million its third weekend, with a domestical total so far of $145.4 million.
In limited release, the Searchlight Pictures’ mockumentary “Theater Camp” opened to $270,000 from six theaters in New York and Los Angeles.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.
1. “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” $56.2 million.
2. “Sound of Freedom,” $27 million.
3. “Insidious: The Red Door,” $13 million.
4. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” $12 million.
5. “Elemental,” $8.7 million.
6. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” $6.1 million.
7. “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” $3.4 million.
8. “No Hard Feelings,” $3.3 million.
9. “Joy Ride,” $2.6 million.
10. “The Little Mermaid,” $2.4 million.

,Is Tom Cruise the last action hero?,"Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford and Sylvester Stallone are among today's leading action heroes – is Hollywood too dependent on the ageing stars of the 1980s, asks Nicholas Barber.","Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One: Is Tom Cruise the last action hero?
By Nicholas Barber Features correspondent
Paramount
Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford and Sylvester Stallone are among today's leading action heroes – is Hollywood too dependent on the ageing stars of the 1980s, asks Nicholas Barber.
Judging by the success of the new Mission: Impossible film on its opening weekend, audiences still love Tom Cruise. Specifically, they love to see him fight, drive fast cars and leap from terrifying heights, which is lucky, because that's what he loves to do. Over the last decade, Cruise has concentrated almost exclusively on becoming an action megastar, applying his famously intense focus to devising and executing ever more elaborate stunts: in Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One, he speeds off a cliff on a motorbike, and parachutes down to the valley below.
More like this:
What is so impressive about these energetic and frankly dangerous feats is that Cruise is 61, which seems like a ripe old age for such undertakings. But in fact he is a mere stripling compared to Hollywood's other leading action heroes. The main selling point of The Flash was the return of Michael Keaton (71) as Batman, Sylvester Stallone (77) and Dolph Lundgren (65) will soon be in the fourth Expendables film, Arnold Schwarzenegger (75) has a hit action-comedy series, FUBAR, on Netflix, Liam Neeson (71) will be in Retribution, releasing in August, and Denzel Washington (68) will be in The Equalizer 3, which is out in September. And they're all spring chickens compared to Indiana Jones himself, Harrison Ford, who turned 81 last Thursday. Why is Hollywood so dependent on grey-haired actors being violent?
There's a real nostalgic appeal to them, because they hark back to the 80s when things seemed a bit simpler – Nick de Semlyen
""There's something comforting about seeing these guys,"" says Nick de Semlyen, author of The Last Action Heroes, a chronicle of the action-movie boom of the 1980s. ""There's a real nostalgic appeal to them, because they hark back to the 80s when things seemed a bit simpler. And they give you hope that when you hit that age, you might be as active as they are.""
Not that this is a new phenomenon. It was 10 years ago that Matt Patches coined the term ""geri-action movies"" when the likes of Red, Taken, Escape Plan and The Expendables showed that stars in their 50s and above could still throw punches and fire machine guns. ""Thanks to the wonders of endless TV repeats, the classics from the Stallone-Schwarzenegger-era are still weaning young audiences on action,"" wrote Patches in Vulture. ""They're instantly recognisable to the entire world - a priority for studios looking to rake in the box office dollars overseas.""
Brands before stars
Today, Hollywood is even more fixated on well known ""intellectual property"", that is, brand names that audiences will be aware of before they go to the cinema. ""Steered by the shareholders and moneymen,"" wrote Wendy Ide in The Observer recently, ""studios are more likely than ever to invest in the familiar, supposedly safe bets such as remakes of proven properties, franchises, movie adaptations of board and video games – anything, in fact, with a degree of name recognition.""
There's so much content being pumped out that it's really hard for one franchise or star to stand out – Nick de Semleyn
Cruise and his contemporaries have that name recognition. In the 1980s, they showcased their personas in so many different roles that they became intellectual property in their own right. ""You went to see the new Arnie film,"" remembers De Semleyn, ""whatever character he was playing."" The next generation of actors haven't had the chance to turn themselves into brand names in the same way. The luckiest of them may have made their fortunes in superhero franchises, but they haven't been able to progress beyond specific lycra-wearing, world-saving characters. Would anyone go to see a film just because it had Tom Holland in it? How can viewers learn to love his own persona when he is locked into so many Spider-Man and Avengers movies? ""Younger actors are starring in franchises whose brands overshadow them,"" explained Patches, ""[whereas] older actors have familiar star power and are reliable global box-office draws.""

There have been attempts to build non-superhero action franchises around younger actors, especially actors named Chris, eg The Gray Man with Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans, Extraction with Chris Hemsworth, and The Tomorrow War with Chris Pratt. But none of these has taken off, partly because they debuted on streaming services rather than at cinemas. ""There's so much content being pumped out that it's really hard for one franchise or star to stand out,"" De Semlyen says. ""In the 80s, a blockbuster could be in the cinema all summer and people would keep talking about it. That's different from turning on your TV and seeing Chris Hemsworth killing 1,000 people.""
Still, while we're feeling sorry for those youthful actors who can't establish themselves as action superstars, we should spare a thought for those less youthful actors who can't establish themselves as anything else. As far as mainstream cinema is concerned, they have almost no option but to sign up for action movies, because Hollywood has pretty much abandoned the quieter mid-budget films that might have allowed them to deliver dialogue without throwing bad guys through windows at the same time. The John Wick series, with Keanu Reeves (58), has demonstrated that action movies are currently the only way to revive an ailing career. Just think about Cruise. He can get audiences to watch him sprinting along the top of a train, but could he persuade them to watch him in a gentle romantic comedy or a political drama? That might be a mission impossible, even for him.

7/6/2023 13:29,An already full-tilt movie franchise turns it up a notch in ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning’,"There are, as a rule, only so many places you can go as an action movie after leaving Tom Cruise clinging to the side of an Airbus A400M and flinging him out a cargo plane at 25,000 feet.","NEW YORK (AP) — There are, as a rule, only so many places you can go as an action movie after leaving Tom Cruise clinging to the side of an Airbus A400M and flinging him out a cargo plane at 25,000 feet.
But in the kinetic, headlong world of “Mission: Impossible,” the pressure to keep upping the ante — like the films’ always-running star — never stops.
“Every time we finish a movie, the first thing Tom says to me is: We can do better,” says Christopher McQuarrie.
McQuarrie, the writer-director of 2015’s “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation” and the 2018 franchise high point, “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” was working with Cruise on “Top Gun: Maverick ” (which McQuarrie co-wrote and co-produced) when they started talking about their ambitions for the next iteration of “Mission: Impossible.”
Their plan was to make not one but two sequels: Back-to-back blockbusters that would feature even bigger stunts — Cruise envisioned a motorcycle jump-slash-skydive — and a massive train sequence that McQuarrie pined to realize. The heady experience on “Maverick,” a pop-culture juggernaut that grossed nearly $1.5 billion worldwide, only further ratcheted up their aspirations.
“‘Top Gun: Maverick’ really taught us a lot in terms of character dynamics and the emotional payoff of the movie overall,” McQuarrie said in a recent interview. “To be making movies on this scale, you really need to think about, more than anything, the feeling that the audience is left with going away.”
A year after the box-office dominance of “Maverick”, McQuarrie and Cruise are back with another high-flying spectacle of daring-do. Similar to “Maverick,” “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is a state-of-the-art action extravaganza of old-school technique, made with star power, practical effects and stunt work designed to prompt exclamations of “He did what?”
It was also their most nearly impossible mission yet – and not just because of, according to Paramount Pictures, the 500 skydives and 13,000 motocross jumps that Cruise did in preparation for his climactic stunt. “Dead Reckoning” was just days away from beginning production in Venice when COVID-19 cases began skyrocketing in Italy, an early epicenter.
“Mission: Impossible” was one of the first major productions to be shut down by the pandemic. Months later, Cruise and “Dead Reckoning” – a globe-trotting $290 million movie so logistically complicated that it prompted controversy for initial plans to blow up a century-old bridge in Poland – led an industry-wide effort to get movie business back on line during the pandemic. An already high-stress production became even more tense. In December 2020, an audio recording leaked of Cruise yelling at two crew members for not obeying COVID-19 protocols.
“We are the gold standard,” Cruise said in the recording. “They’re back there in Hollywood making movies right now because of us. Because they believe in us and what we’re doing.”
There were numerous delays and pivots along the way. But McQuarrie says he never thought “Dead Reckoning” wouldn’t get finished.
“We just kept moving forward because if you stopped, if you were trying to find the end of the tunnel, you would just reach a place of such despair,” says McQuarrie.
McQuarrie and Cruise first collaborated on the 2008 Hitler assassination drama “Valkyrie.” McQuarrie, the famed screenwriter of “The Usual Suspects,” was then in proverbial movie jail for his poorly received directorial debut, “The Way of the Gun.”
“When I met Tom in 2006, I had not directed a film in seven years,” McQuarrie says. “I wouldn’t direct a film again for another five years. I had really put any ambitions I had to direct out of my mind. I certainly never imagined being considered an action director, let alone directing four action films.”
“In ‘Dead Reckoning,’ you’re seeing the ghosts of all the movies that I was never allowed to make,” he adds.
Unlikely as it may be, McQuarrie (who’s also directing the already-shooting part two of “Dead Reckoning”) has emerged as the architect of one of the most visceral action franchises.
In “Dead Reckoning,” Ethan Hunt faces off with a rogue artificial intelligence, a prescient and well-suited antagonist for a movie universe built less on CGI than practical effects. McQuarrie told Cruise he wanted to wanted to take “Mission: Impossible” beyond the threat of a terrorist getting hold of a deadly weapon.
“Another lesson we took from ‘Top Gun’ was: What is the audience bringing to the movie? ‘Top Gun’ came out of Cold War anxieties. I said to Tom in 2019: What anxiety is it now?” says McQuarrie. “What we didn’t anticipate was the level to which it would accelerate.”
In “Mission: Impossible,” what you see is rarely what you get. Hunt and his team of spies are masters of deception. At the same time, McQuarrie and his crew, including cinematographer Fraser Taggart, go to considerable lengths to ensure what the audience is watching feels authentic and immersive.
“The challenge normally is hiding the fact that it’s not the actor doing it,” says McQuarrie. “And here the reverse is the case. You’re actually going to great lengths to show that Tom’s actually doing it.”
Taggart, who had shot the helicopter sequence in “Fallout,” says he’s never worked with an actor so resistant to stunt doubles as Cruise — even in the most innocuous of shots.
“Tom won’t do it. He just refuses, even to the extent of you’ll do an insert of hand,” says Taggart. “It can’t be anyone else doing it, as you would on other projects. Tom will insist that’s him.”
Just as “Top Gun: Maverick” strove to get as many cameras in the cockpits of fighter jets, the set-pieces of “Mission: Impossible” are choreographed to get cameras as close to Cruise and the cast — here that includes Hayley Atwell, Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby — as possible.
For Taggart, that meant getting his head around often dizzying challenges like shooting a scene involving a train moving 60 miles an hour through a mountainous Scandinavian landscape with uncontrollable weather conditions. He didn’t want just fixed cameras.
“So now we’ve got to get a whole camera crew involved and some lighting and we’ll probably end up with 10 people strapped to the top of a train carriage, including an old-fashioned physical camera up there,” says Taggart. “You think: Can we actually get 10 people on top of the train doing 60 miles an hour? That’s the challenge because you’d really like all of your crew and actors to survive the shoot.”
In another sequence with characters inside a falling train cabin, they suspended a camera operator, Chunky Richmond, on stunt wires so he was hanging alongside the actors. For a nighttime chase through the byzantine passageways of Venice — for Taggart one of the most complex tasks of “Dead Reckoning” because of the inherent darkness of the city — they knocked on doors everywhere along the route to get cameras on terraces and pointed out windows.
For an elaborate car chase in Rome, Taggart used robotic arms on vehicles that were mounted but could also move.
“We always try technology but we usually break it all,” he says.
McQuarrie has said he likes to write “Mission: Impossible” movies as they’re shooting; “Fallout” began without just an outline. Production on “Part Two” has been paused during the promotion on “Part One,” and it’s unclear if the ongoing writers strike would threaten production on the sequel. But for McQuarrie and company, the only way to make a “Mission: Impossible” movie is full tilt.
“Everything we’re doing is by the seat of our pants,” says McQuarrie. “We want you to come to the movie and experience it the same way the characters are, which is: I don’t know what’s going to happen next.”

2023-06-19 20:46:00+00:00,"‘Mission: Impossible 7’ First Reactions: Tom Cruise Conquers Critics With ‘Impeccably Made,’ ‘Exhilarating’ Action Film","The first reactions for ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" are in after the Tom Cruise blockbuster's world premiere in Rome.","“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” was finally unveiled at a starry world premiere in Rome on Monday evening, drawing a packed gala screening in the Auditorium della Conciliazione, a stone’s throw from the Vatican.
The gala screening was delayed by more than 90 minutes as Tom Cruise was holding an apparently impromptu meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at the Palazzo Chigi, seat of the Italian government.
The crowd in the auditorium grew increasingly annoyed with having to watch interviews from the red carpet held earlier on the Spanish Steps in what started seeming like an endless loop on the venue’s screen, equipped with a Dolby Atmos sound system for the special occasion.
However there was warm applause when Cruise, director Christopher McQuarrie, and a large contingent of the film’s ensemble – including Hayley Atwell; Rebecca Ferguson; Simon Pegg; Vanessa Kirby; Pom Klementieff, Esai Morales, Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis – finally arrived.
And as soon as Rome appeared on screen the audience started breaking into cheers and shouting out: “Bravo Tom!” which happened quite frequently through the screening.
The event was held in tandem with the Rome Film Festival’s independently run Alice in the City section, dedicated to films for youth audiences. The film’s local distributor is Eagle Pictures, which has a local distribution partnership with Paramount. A substantial amount of the hotly anticipated action film was shot in the Italian capital.
“Dead Reckoning Part One” follows the events of “Fallout,” where Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt and his crew of secret agents saved the world from a nuclear apocalypse amid a series of double-crosses. The 2018 release was the highest-grossing entry in the franchise yet, earning nearly $800 million at the global box office.
The new film stars Cruise once again, alongside returning franchise players Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Henry Czerny and Vanessa Kirby. Series newcomers include Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, Cary Elwes, Rob Delaney, Indira Varma, Shea Whigham, Mark Gatiss, Esai Morales and Charles Parnell.
As expected, the film drew strong notices out of its premiere for its impressive stunts. One of the most prominent death-defying acts pushed in the marketing features Cruise actually riding a motorcycle off the edge of a cliff.
Simon Pegg, who returns for “Dead Reckoning” after featuring in the previous five installments told Variety that the film’s core is the rapport between Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie, which began in 2011 with “Ghost Protocol” on which McQuarrie served as an uncredited writer.
“It’s become a kind of self-perpetuating evolving relationship where they’ve just egged each other on and challenged each other to move the story forward; to increase the scale; increase the ambition,” Pegg pointed out.
The seventh “Mission: Impossible” entry will be released by Paramount on July 12. See reactions to the film below.
Collider’s Perri Nemiroff said it was “another winner for the franchise” with production values “through the roof” and “well-defined and exhilarating set pieces.”
Uproxx writer Mike Ryan said “‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’ works as Christopher McQuarrie’s ambitious examination of/meditation on AI and the dangerous path we might be on.”

Screenrant’s Joe Deckelmeier said “Hayley Atwell STEALS every scene she’s in.”
Gizmodo and io9 writer Germain Lussier called it “fantastic,” with a final set piece ranking in the top two to three of the franchise, despite being “a little dense at times.”
Dynamite, timely story. Excellent new characters. Huge variety of action and a final set piece that ranks top 2-3 all-time for the franchise.

Indiewire executive editor Kate Erbland said “it does the best job yet of recent part 1 of 2 features in feeling like its own film while setting up for the next half.”
After the insanity of the last few films, #MissionImpossible7 has a tremendous amount to live up to, but one thing I’ll say now in quick reaction format: it does the best job yet of recent “part 1 of 2!!” features in feeling like its own film while setting up for the next half. — Kate Erbland (@katerbland) June 19, 2023
Fandango’s Erik Davis called it “an impeccably made action film that does not stop entertaining.”
I had the absolute best time watching #MissionImpossible – an impeccably made action film that does not stop entertaining. Each action sequence is long, crazy & intense.

2023-07-06 14:34:00+00:00,How Tom Cruise Trained for the 'Biggest Stunt in Cinema History',Here's how movie star Tom Cruise prepared for a hugely ambitious action sequence in 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning.',Tom Cruise is known for committing fully to the part in each of his movies", including doing much of his own flying in Top Gun: Maverick and throwing himself into doing his own stunt work on the increasingly explosive action sequences in the Mission: Impossible franchise. The latest installment in the spy thriller series, due to be released on July 12, features the actor's most ambitious stunt yet," and has been dubbed the """"biggest stunt in cinema history.""""",,,,,,
A mini-documentary released on YouTube by Paramount Pictures follows the months of preparation that went into planning and executing a heart-stopping chase scene in Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One, in which Cruise's character, secret agent Ethan Hunt, rides a motorcycle off the edge of a cliff and goes into a base jump, free-falling towards the earth before pulling his parachute cord.,,,,,,,,,
There's a lot going into this stunt," says director Christopher McQuarrie. """"So Tom put together this master plan to coordinate all of these experts in each of the particular disciplines involved", to make this whole thing happen.,,,,,,,,,,,
Prior to the shoot in Hellesylt, Norway in 2020, Cruise undertook a year of training to master motocross, base jumping and advanced skydiving, including working on his strength and stability to ensure he can control his own position mid-air, and manoeuver the parachute canopy in the right way.,,,,,,,,
You train and drill every little aspect over and over and over and over again, says Cruise.,,,,,,,,,,,,
When the prep for the shoot was at its most intense, Cruise was doing 30 jumps per day, and he racked up more than 500 skydives and 13,000 motocross jumps over the course of rehearsal. Throughout this entire process, Cruise also wore a GPS chip so that they were able to track his speed and location in three-dimensional space at every stage of the stunt, which then enabled them to plan exactly where the drone cameras needed to be for the shoot.,,,,,,,,
The key is me hitting certain speeds and being consistent with that," says Cruise. """"There's no speedometer", so I do it by sound and feel of the bike. And then as I depart the bike, I'm using the wind that's hitting me, I'm pumping my chest," that will give me lift.""""",,,,,,,,
On the day of the shoot, all conditions have to be perfect for Cruise to pull off the staggering feat, and things are tense behind the camera as the actor shoots off the edge of the precipice and plummets into the valley below... a total of six times.,,,,,,,,,,,
We've been working on this for years," says Cruise. """"I've wanted to do it since I was a little kid.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Tom Cruise has no plans to stop playing Ethan Hunt anytime soon.
The actor, 61, has said that he wants to keep making Mission: Impossible films until he is Harrison Ford’s age, comparing his franchise with Ford’s Indiana Jones.
Cruise told the Sydney Morning Herald: “Harrison Ford is a legend. I hope to still be going. I’ve got 20 years to catch up with him.”
He continued: “I hope to keep making Mission: Impossible films until I’m his age.”
Cruise was 34 years old when he first played super spy Ethan Hunt in 1996’s Mission: Impossible. The character was two years younger than the actor.
In the years since, he has starred in seven sequels, the most recent of which – titled Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One – is out later this week.
In comparison, Ford was 38 when he played Indiana Jones for the first time in 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark.
He was 80 years old in the fifth and most recent addition to the franchise, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which was released on 28 June.

Cruise now appears to have ruled out any notion that the forthcoming sequel, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two – which is due for release sometime next year – will be his last outing in the role.
At 61 years old, Cruise appears to be in superb health. He continues to perform his own extreme stunts for the action franchise and does so also in Mission Impossible 7.
In the new film, Cruise is seen speed flying – a sport in which participants use a small paraglider wing to rapidly descend great heights, such as mountains.

Cruise spent years training for the sequence, which is described as one of the most dangerous the actor has ever undertaken. The crew were said to have watched him speed fly in “absolute terror”.
Elsewhere in the interview with Sydney Herald, Cruise addressed his recent social media post urging cinemagoers to watch two of his summer box office rivals: Barbie and Oppenheimer.

The two films – directed by Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan, respectively – are due for release on the same day (21 July).
“I want to see both Barbie and Oppenheimer,” he said. “I’ll see them opening weekend. Friday, I’ll see Oppenheimer first and then Barbie on Saturday.
“I grew up seeing movies on the big screen. That’s how I make them, and I like that experience; it’s immersive, and to have that as a community and an industry, it’s important.”
Initial reviews for Dead Reckoning are overwhelmingly positive. In a four-star review of the film, The Independent’s film critic Clarisse Loughrey writes: “The film is a mirror image of its star – a muscular, extravagant, thoroughly old-school work of ingenuity and craft.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL2FydHMtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9maWxtcy9uZXdzL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1tb3ZpZXMtdG9tLWNydWlzZS1iMjM3MDg4MS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-06-28 14:06:22+00:00,Tom Cruise discusses 'Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One' and that stunt: 'I don't mind being scared',"After Covid setbacks, the spy franchise returns to new heights. Cruise, director Christopher McQuarrie and cast unpack their high-octane new film.","CNN —
Tom Cruise – he’s just like us.
Speaking in London ahead of the release of “Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One,” Cruise shared that, yes, he feels fear.
“It’s not that I don’t get scared,” the actor said. “It’s that I don’t mind being scared.”
And there ends our delusion.
Cruise, who famously does his own stunts, has put his body on the line time and again for the multibillion-dollar franchise. As superspy Ethan Hunt he’s dangled from the world’s tallest building, clung on to the outside of a plane during take-off, and performed a military-level high altitude, low opening (HALO) skydive no less than 100 times.
In the latest movie Cruise can be seen riding a motorcycle off a cliff before BASE jumping on to … actually, let’s keep this spoiler-free. The stunt was filmed in Norway back in 2020 on the first day of the film’s arduous, Covid-stricken production. It was one thing for Cruise to perform the stunt, quite another to watch, powerless to intervene, said writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, Cruise’s long-term creative partner affectionately known as “McQ.”
“I was just staring at the crosshairs on the screen, and I was waiting to see blue – blue was the color of his parachute,” he recalled. “Once I saw blue, I was just making sure it was a square, because if it wasn’t a square, it meant there was a malfunction. There was no coming back from it.”
Cruise put his director through the experience six times to capture the stunt from all the necessary angles, which looks even more spectacular in the finished movie than the marketing material suggests.
With all that heart-in-mouth action, is McQuarrie still able to have fun? “It’s more fun to finish a ‘Mission Impossible’ movie, for sure,” he said. “It’s a huge relief when it’s all behind you and everybody’s safe.”

“Dead Reckoning” sees “Mission: Impossible” lean into 21st century anxieties in the form of its villain. Dubbed The Entity, this faceless, stateless antagonist is an artificial intelligence capable of infiltrating pretty much any digital network to chaotic ends. (Yes, Tom Cruise hates streaming so much he’s now squaring up to an algorithm.)
The star was reluctant to say much about the AI baddie, but when CNN’s Becky Anderson caught up with the cast and crew in Abu Dhabi – the next stop on the film’s globetrotting promotional tour – McQuarrie was more candid.
“We were talking about it probably in early 2018, as something that even a few years prior would have been an intellectual or an abstract idea,” he explained. “I felt that people were starting to become aware of the way information and information technology was affecting their lives.”
As for AI’s impact on the movie industry itself, McQuarrie was diplomatic. “Like any of the technologies that have been used in previous ‘Mission Impossible’ movies, it’s less about the technology and more about who’s using (it),” he said. “What we’re presenting here is just what happens when the technology potentially falls into the wrong hands.”

For resident gadget man Benji Dunn, The Entity is “his worst nightmare,” shared actor Simon Pegg. A series veteran who’s known Cruise for 17 years, Pegg saw the actor-producer forced to go through more off-screen action than either would have liked when the film became the first major production impacted by Covid, while on location in Venice, Italy in February 2020.
“We kind of wrote the rulebook on how to make a film in a pandemic,” he said. “The time that that took was challenging, because often we’d have to stop, and there’d be pauses in shooting, but we wanted to be as safe as possible.
“Tom is never reckless with the stunts; with everything he’s always very careful. But that was a challenge. It took much longer than it would normally do. But I think it’s all up there on the screen.”
Pegg did point to one upside, however: because of lockdowns, the cast, which included newcomers Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff, bonded quickly.
For Klementieff, a childhood fan of “Mission Impossible,” it was “a dream come true” to sign on as Paris, who puts Hunt through his paces, including a thrilling hand-to-hand fight scene down a dark alley.
Delivering a similarly athletic performance, Atwell described it as “an all-encompassing experience that asked everything of me physically,” adding, “I think I’ll probably never have the experience again.”

Never say never, because as the movie title suggests, Part Two is coming. “It was McQ’s idea,” said Cruise. “When we were there (on shoot) I was like, ‘remember, this is your idea.’ There’s so much story … it won’t be confined by one film.”
“Everything is on track,” McQuarrie divulged of the sequel, slated for release in June 2024. “We’ve shot in Africa, we’ve shot in the Arctic, we’re back here in London. Everything is standing by for us to go back to work after we’re done promoting this movie.
“We’ve done some amazing, amazing things – and the biggest is yet to come.”
Cruise, arguably working in a category of one when it comes to Hollywood action heroes, is only competing with himself these days. “I strive for excellence,” he said. “There’s always another story to tell, there’s always another mountain to climb. And I always feel like I can do it better.”
“I’m not the kind of person that will beat myself up,” he added, “but I’m constantly working to become competent and strive to understand my craft and the world, and just keep pushing myself.”
As for what happens after Part Two, the cast and crew are keeping mum. “I have been misquoted many times – I don’t know what happens next,” said McQuarrie.
Pegg is a little surer about Cruise, Ethan Hunt and the franchise’s fate. “I don’t see this story stopping,” he said. “I think he’ll be jumping off things when he’s 100.”

,"Hayley Atwell says working with Tom Cruise in new ""Mission: Impossible"" film was a ""masterclass""","The film hits theaters this Wednesday, July 12.","Actor Hayley Atwell co-stars in ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" alongside Tom Cruise — and working with him was a ""masterclass,"" she said.
""It was a masterclass in not only work ethic and his incredible manners, he's so gracious and so polite to everyone, and hardworking, but then also his understanding of every technical aspect of filmmaking,"" Atwell told ""CBS Mornings.""
Atwell plays Grace, a pickpocket and thief who accidentally finds herself in the middle of a high-stakes mission. She performs breathtaking stunts with Cruise, who plays protagonist Ethan Hunt and also performs his own stunts in the ""Mission: Impossible"" series.
She described Cruise as ""very attentive"" and said he ""can kind of read people,"" recalling a moment where they were filming a train scene and she was ""slumped in a corner"" looking tired.
""He's like, 'How you doing? ... I think you have adrenal fatigue,'"" Atwell said. ""And he presented me with this beautiful box of chocolate, like out of nowhere, and said ... 'You need some chocolate. That's going to wake you up.'""
She said it made a difference.
""Chocolate's gonna make a difference in my life in any context,"" she said, laughing.
The film hits theaters this Wednesday, July 12. It is a production of Paramount Pictures, a division of CBS News' parent company. Its highly-anticipated release follows a four-year gap since the release of the previous installment, ""Mission: Impossible – Fallout.""
To prepare for the role, Atwell trained for months to learn skills including martial arts and drifting, a driving maneuver that allows a car to glide through turns.
Atwell said she is proud of the film and that it was made with the audience in mind.
""We're so proud of it. But even the whole filmmaking process, every single frame and scene was designed, executed, edited with the audience in mind,"" Atwell said. ""And you know, when I said to Tom, you know, 'What is the running time of this going to be?' and he said, 'It's going to be as long as it is entertaining.' And it's true, it goes by so fast.""

,"""Mission: Impossible"" co-star Simon Pegg talks watching Tom Cruise's stunt: ""We were all a bit hysterical""","Cruise's character rode a motorcycle off a cliff, then jumped off the bike — in front of his stunned castmates.","For actor Simon Pegg, the first day on the set of ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" involved watching a friend and co-star attempting one of the biggest stunts in movie history.
The co-star was of course Tom Cruise, whose stuntwork in movies like ""Top Gun: Maverick"" and the ""Mission: Impossible"" series has audiences clamoring to see what he's capable of. In the newest ""Mission: Impossible"" movie, Cruise's character Ethan Hunt rides a motorcycle off a cliff, then jumps off the bike and performs a terrifying BASE jump to land safely.
Despite the high-stakes stunt, Pegg said the day was ""the opposite of chaos.""
""Tom is very, very diligent when it comes to preparing for these things. He's not crazy. Everyone says, oh, he must be crazy. He does, you know, but he trains hard. Everything is in place. It's a well-oiled machine,"" Pegg explained.
Despite knowing the actor was prepared, Pegg said it was ""scary"" to see the stunt happen. He even filmed the moment on his phone.
""We were up there just to see it. ... We were all a bit hysterical because, I mean, we trust him and we trust the system. We trust everything involved,"" Pegg explained. ""But still, it's nerve-wracking, and he would disappear, and then we'd wait and there'd be a big sort of pause. And then you'd hear good canopy, which meant his chute had opened at least. But he still had to get down to the boom. So it was exhilarating, to say the least.""

While that stunt may have made ""Mission: Impossible"" history, Pegg has been in the franchise since its third chapter as Benji Dunn. His character started as a lab technician, but grew to become a field agent and a close friend of Cruise's character. In all, Pegg has spent about 15 years in the role.
""It's a real treat as an actor to be able to evolve a character like that and play him over a series of different films and build on whatever's gone before. As an actor, that's a privilege to be able to do that,"" Pegg said.
While the character has only become more familiar to Pegg, filming the newest ""Mission: Impossible"" chapter meant working in a totally new environment: The cast started working on the movie during the coronavirus pandemic, and had to navigate quarantines and on-set protocols to make the film.
""Tom just was determined that it wasn't going to beat him. I think he saw COVID and the pandemic as a sort of existential threat to movies, to the theatrical experience. It was stopping us all from being together, watching films, and for Tom, that's so important, you know? That's his life. And I think he was like 'This isn't going to beat us. We're going to figure it out,'"" Pegg said. ""And that's what we did. He kind of wrote the rules on how to make a film in that situation as we went along and yes, it took longer. It took a little longer than usual, but we got through it. And I think that is reflected in the movie itself. We were on our own little mission impossible whilst we were making 'Mission: Impossible.'""
Now, another existential threat is facing the movie industry: On Thursday, SAG-AFTRA, the acting labor union, called a strike, meaning most actors cannot work on films and grinding Hollywood to a halt. This compounds a strike by Hollywood writers. As part of the strike, actors can no longer promote their work, but his interview was filmed before the actors' strike began.

""Things need to be fair,"" Pegg said. ""The infrastructure needs to be adapted to accommodate the new, the new ways we watch film and TV streaming, and the tech companies need to understand that for things to continue, everyone needs to be treated fairly. ... We need to just talk sensibly and get it all sorted out.""
Pegg, who is also a screenwriter, said that the strike is necessary, especially as movie studios push to use artificial intelligence in the filmmaking process.
""The only thing A.I. can do is create mediocrity, because all it can do is aggregate what's out there,"" Pegg said. ""So, yes, it can write a script, but it'll be rubbish. Do you know what I mean? A.I. has had no childhood trauma. A.I.'s never had a boyfriend or girlfriend, never had its heart broken, it's never been through anything that would give it the impetus to create art. ... To rely on it would be to just make everything mediocre, and we have to fight mediocrity in order to create great art.""

Simon Pegg said Cruise is far more generous and fun than that rumor suggests, and that he even “took us go-karting and zip-lining” during off hours on “Dead Reckoning Part One.”
“I’ve been able to hack my way through all the bizarre mythology that surrounds him,” added Pegg, who has starred in every “Mission: Impossible” movie opposite Cruise since 2006’s “Mission: Impossible III.” “On one side he’s Tom Cruise — this enigmatic film star everyone wants to know about. And on the other he’s just a guy. I like being normal with him.”
Pegg previously said on BBC’s “Desert Island Discs” radio show that he does not ask Cruise about anything related to his “personal beliefs” when they are together because “that would be me abusing my privileged access that I get to him.” That means Scientology questions are off the table. So what does Pegg talk to Cruise about on set? Cruise’s fame.
“We joke about it,” Pegg said. “I mean, I always make fun of him for it, you know, about the things that he can access. We were filming in South Africa recently on this mountain and then he decided he wanted to swim with sharks. He flew us in a helicopter to this seaside part and we dived with sharks. At the end of the day we said, ‘That was a real Tom Cruise kind of day.’ He kind of appreciates the ridiculousness of it sometimes.”
Pegg added, “My relationship with him is just very simple and amiable. It’s always been a very easy relationship. I think you realize, when you meet the person rather than the thicket of mythology that’s built up around them, it’s a different experience. I mean, he loves [the fame] and he really relishes it, it’s all he knows. It energizes him and spurs him on. I don’t think I would appreciate that particularly.

2023-07-12 18:31:23.264000+00:00,Tom Cruise Killed 6 Motorcycles in One Day Because He Loves Movies So Damn Much,Tom Cruise killed six motorcycles in one day while shooting Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One because he loves movies so damn much.,"Tom Cruise loves movies. This isn’t always the case with actors or even movie stars, some of whom may be good at faking it but really are more interested in fame and fortune than they are the cinematic experience. And while Cruise may be one of our last, true movie stars, it’s pretty hard to question that his feelings for the art of moviemaking are real.
I mean, Steven Spielberg himself gave Cruise credit for saving “Hollywood’s ass” after the pandemic.
In that particular case, Spielberg was talking about Cruise’s insistence on releasing Top Gun: Maverick in theaters during a time of great uncertainty in the industry. A billion and a half dollars later, Cruise clearly made the right call there. But there’s another key ingredient to the once and future Ethan Hunt’s strategy to keeping cinema alive – and that’s his frankly insane stunt work. So with Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One hitting theaters, let’s look at how Tom Cruise approaches stunts in the Mission: Impossible movies, and how his lifelong love of film has fueled that methodology.
Ranking Tom Cruise's Mission: Impossible Team From Worst to Best 21 Images
Tom Cruise has been making movies since 1981, and became a star within two years of that with the release of Risky Business. He’s had his ups and downs over the decades of course, but one thing that audiences have come to expect from the actor in recent years is him doing his own stunts. And not just that, but one-upping himself with each subsequent Mission: Impossible movie.
Director Christopher McQuarrie, who is currently on his third film in the series, with a fourth in the works, says that there’s a simple reason why Cruise does these huge stunts himself.
“Immersion, plain and simple,” McQuarrie told IGN. “It connects you to the characters and to the story in a way that you couldn't do otherwise. The challenge of that obviously is putting the camera in a place where you can see that the actor is actually doing it. For us, it's really important not that you are watching a stunt, but that you are experiencing that stunt with the protagonist.”
But where does this dedication to the art of the stunt come from? In Dead Reckoning, we see Ethan Hunt’s oath to the IMF, so we asked Cruise what his personal oath to Hollywood would be. He had thoughts.
“I'm first and foremost the audience. The audience,” Cruise responded. “So when you look at the films that I have, it's not about me. It's about us. It's about that experience together. … That's why Top Gun: Maverick, I was like, no, this movie's coming out in the theaters. And when we were going through that time period, I kept calling the distributors and the theaters. I said, no, it's coming. And I showed them the movie and I said this will be in the theaters. I want you to have that experience. And, you know, in the ’80s I was the first guy, again in modern cinema, to shoot 65 mm [film] for Far and Away. I want that big-screen experience for an audience. I want it for myself to watch. I want other filmmakers, and also I want actors to have that opportunity where their movies come out in the cinemas. And I want to show them how to do it.”
“ I want that big-screen experience for an audience. I want it for myself to watch.
And that comes back to the stunts, whether he’s hanging from the side of a plane or climbing the side of a building or pulling off a HALO skydive. Cruise, and McQuarrie with him, are looking for ways to make the cinema the way to experience these films.
“We're finding ways to immerse an audience into a movie,” Cruise told IGN. “Everything, my whole training, and when I watch movies, I want to feel connected with that character. And how do we do it? That's one way. You know, I enjoy doing it. I enjoy the challenges of it, but it all comes down to story. How do we invest the audience in the story?”
In the case of Dead Reckoning Part One, the big – capital B – stunt to get that investment involved a motorcycle jump off a cliff which then leads into a base jump. Easy-peasy, right? But Cruise figured the best plan was to film it on day one of production… just in case he got killed doing it.
“Either we will continue with the film or we’re not,” he laughed in an interview with ET . “Let’s know day one! Let us know day one what is going to happen. Do we all continue or is it a major rewrite?”

Of course, that doesn’t include all the prep that Cruise and the team did to get the stunt right – and to make sure the actor didn’t get killed in the process. This meant Cruise did over 500 skydives and over 13,000 motocross jumps just during rehearsals and while planning the stunt. 500 skydives! And then when the actual shoot came, Cruise rode a motorcycle off a cliff six times that day. Or rather, six motorcycles, since they didn’t have parachutes like he did.
McQuarrie admits that this was the scariest stunt to execute… for this movie anyway. But Dead Reckoning Part Two isn’t done yet, either.
“In terms of this movie, definitely the motorcycle jump,” McQuarrie said when asked about the scariest stunt they’ve shot. “But we have continued and we've pushed ourselves even further in Part Two. And you'll see. It's terrifying.”
It all goes back to Tom Cruise’s Hollywood oath, doesn’t it?
“I love this industry, and I've been blessed to be able to live my dreams since I was a kid,” Cruise said. “I was four years old and I wanted to travel the world, make movies. I wanted to go to different cultures and not just visit as a tourist. I wanted to work there. I wanted to be there. And this has given me my dream and afforded me to be able to share it and put it on screen. And I've dedicated my life to this art form. … I make movies for audiences. I don't really think about awards either. For me, it's about the audience. It's not about all of that other stuff. When I'm making movies, I'm not thinking about that. I'm literally thinking about that family that are going out to the theater. For them to have that experience. That's what's important.”

“I want to see both Barbie and Oppenheimer. I’ll see them opening weekend,” he said per The Sydney Morning Herald. “Friday I’ll see Oppenheimer first and then Barbie on Saturday.”
Both films are set to hit theaters on July 21 and will compete for audiences at the box office. Cruise is a big proponent of watching movies in the theaters as that’s the way he grew up.
“I grew up seeing movies on the big screen. That’s how I make them, and I like that experience; it’s immersive, and to have that as a community and an industry, it’s important,” Cruise added. “I still go the movies.”
Cruise has made it no secret of his intentions to hit the Cineplex to see Oppenheimer and Barbie and recently showed off his tickets as proof.
“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,” he tweeted. “Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indy and one of the most iconic characters in history. I love a double feature, and it doesn’t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Oppenheimer and Barbie.”

2023-06-22 04:45:56+00:00,Hayley Atwell Recalls Tom Cruise Taking Her Grandmother on Helicopter Tour of London: “Totally Disarmed Her Fear”,Hayley Atwell is recalling the memorable experience her 'Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One' co-star Tom Cruise gave her grandmother.,"Hayley Atwell and Tom Cruise at the global premiere of 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One'
Hayley Atwell is recalling quite the memorable experience her Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One co-star Tom Cruise helped give her grandmother.
During an interview with Entertainment Tonight, published online Wednesday, the actress revealed that the Top Gun: Maverick star took her loved one “in a helicopter on Christmas Eve and gave her a tour of London.”
“I didn’t tell her it was coming, because I knew that she wouldn’t — there’s no way she would get into a helicopter,” she added.
Atwell went on to explain just how the epic surprise went down, saying she had initially taken her grandmother to a helicopter base that had a cafe attached to it.
“We’re having a cup of tea and I said, ‘Oh, some helicopters out there,’ and she went, ‘Oh, you wouldn’t get me in one of those things,'” the actress recalled. “We surprised her and Tom came walking around the car. It was so sweet, because my grandmother was like, ‘Hiya, Tom, how are you darling?!’ and talked to him like he was one of her own.”
The Avengers: Endgame actress noted that she was “so relaxed” with Cruise before going up in the air. She even said that the effect Cruise had on her grandmother had “totally disarmed her fear.”
“Then he said, ‘I would love to take you on the helicopter, on a ride of London,'” she explained. “And she was like, ‘Oh, fantastic! Yes, I’ll just put me walking stick down here!'”
Cruise also chimed in to express what a pleasure the whole experience was.
“I knew her grandmother’s never been in a helicopter, so [I said] I’m going to take you at sunset,” the actor said. “It was beautiful…. I said, ‘Don’t worry, Hayley. We’re gonna just take our time. It’s gonna be a lovely family outing.'”
Atwell added that “it was cute” seeing her grandmother have “the most wonderful time.”

2023-07-20 16:18:06+00:00,12 of Tom Cruise’s Most Jaw-Dropping Stunts,"From scaling a skyscraper to hanging on to the outside of an airplane as it takes off, THR has compiled a list of some of Tom Cruise's wildest stunts.","Tom Cruise has never steered away from challenging himself in his roles for projects. Especially since 1986’s Top Gun, he has continued to push the limits of his body and acting, taking on his own stunts in most of his top films, including Mission: Impossible, The Last Samurai and Jack Reacher.
Most recently, Cruise took on several death-defying stunts in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, including speed-flying down a mountainside as well as driving a motorcycle off a cliff and parachuting to safety.
The actor has previously said during an appearance on The Graham Norton Show that he has been “doing different stunts” since he was a child and that once he got into acting, he wanted to keep doing it to help with the “storytelling.”
“I feel that [when] acting you’re bringing everything, you know, physically and emotionally, to a character in a story,” he explained at the time. “And I’m able to do it [stunts], and I’ve trained for 30 years doing things like this that it allows us to put cameras in places where you normally are not able to.”
More recently, during a conversation at Cannes in 2022, Cruise reiterated that he enjoys performing his own stunts despite the danger, only this time he referenced one of the best athletes of Hollywood’s golden era.
“No one asked Gene Kelly, ‘Why do you dance?’” the actor said. “Why do you do your own dancing?’”

,Mission: Impossible’s inadvertently smart take on AI policy,,"Mission: Impossible’s inadvertently smart take on AI policy Presented by Google & BCG

This week, apparently, DFD goes to the movies: “Oppenheimer” wasn’t the only film released this summer blockbuster season that has a lot to say about AI.
The other one is “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” which, in addition to its title absolutely rolling off the tongue, happens to deal head-on with the growing fear in both Silicon Valley and Washington that AI could pose an existential threat to humanity.
In the film a rogue AI known only as “the entity” manipulates human actors to do its mysterious bidding, insinuating itself into the world’s defense and financial systems and setting off a global race to control the software by any means necessary.
It’s not the first Hollywood film with an AI villain , but it is the first to land amid the current wave of anxiety and hype about the technology. And while it delivers (and then some) on its promised action spectacle, the way the film actually deals with the threats posed by AI is revealing in a very different way. It’s a window into why AI is such a slippery policy issue in the real world.
The main threat posed by the movie’s rogue AI isn’t its intention to launch the world’s nukes, or endlessly reproduce itself at the expense of humanity, or bring down the global banking system, all of which are risks being pondered by serious people, and even addressed in some policy ideas . It’s in its power to manipulate “the truth” — the film’s protagonists breathlessly describe the entity’s ability to manipulate all digitally-transmitted communications and media, plunging the world into a morass of uncertainty and mistrust.
Sound familiar? There’s a cynical argument to be made that we’ve already gotten ourselves pretty far down the road to such an outcome without the help of AI. There’s a non-cynical argument that generative models are poised to make this much, much worse; they’re already creating eerily lifelike audio and video of public figures . The futuristic threat the “M:I7” screenwriters conjure is, like an episode of “Black Mirror,” not much more than our current reality skewed a few more degrees toward the fantastical.
I won’t spoil the story after that, but you could say the most fantastical plot point of all is the hope that we could successfully do anything about this problem. The fight against “misinformation,” despite spawning a lucrative cottage industry , has proved maddeningly resistant to technical or policy fixes since its modern inception roughly a decade ago. The film, in this sense, ultimately serves as a reminder of how powerless humanity has already proven itself in that fight.
It does raise another specter of AI-related doom. Or, rather, one that AI enables: The global Easter egg hunt that Tom Cruise’s superspy Ethan Hunt undertakes is to track down a key (yes, a physical key) that will unlock the power of the AI “entity,” something that every government on Earth, including America’s, now desperately covets. The AI, seemingly omnipotent, will not only grant the state that wields it a nebulous “truth”-establishing power but total digital supremacy over all of its rivals.
In an exaggerated form, that’s a threat about which real-world actors both public and private are keenly aware, with the U.S. framing the race for AI supremacy over China as a global zero-sum competition. “How is it in our interest to allow them to get technology that they may turn around and use against us?” Secretary of State Anthony Blinken asked the Council on Foreign Relations in June.
In the real world, that means narrowly targeted trade controls to prevent U.S. companies from selling high-end semiconductors to our economic rivals — not exactly the stuff of summer blockbusters.
Aside from drawing into sharp relief just how maddening and diffuse AI is as a real-world policy issue, the film also serves as a useful parable about how developers or policymakers should respond to AI — it turns out the world doesn’t necessarily need to be protected from the AI itself, but from the avaricious and power-hungry humans who want to use it. Our real-life efforts toward “AI safety” might ultimately not be about taming a wild and dangerous sci-fi technology, but making a very powerful computer effectively user-proof.

the skeptical spectator
Tech-nerd Twitter — gah, sorry, X, we’ll get used to it soon — blew up this morning after the publication of a pre-print from a South Korean research team that claims it discovered a way for superconductors to work at room temperature , a discovery with massive implications for everything from energy to computer science.
Most superconductors need to be kept at extremely low temperatures to work — around -284 degrees Fahrenheit — making them impractical for everyday purposes. For context, that’s 140 degrees colder than the coldest place on earth, according to NASA . Finding a way to run them under normal environmental conditions would bring a massive reduction in their operation cost, and provide cheap power storage.
Science takes time, and only reproduction and verification will tell whether the Korean researchers’ work is legit. But studies about superconductivity like this get published a lot, and are accompanied by scandal almost as frequently, including in the case of one completely separate study the New York Times reported on just today. And at least one writer is already skeptical: Matt Ridley, a British science writer and former member of the United Kingdom House of Lords, wrote in The Spectator that “the paper comes from an unknown team at a start-up institute with little track record in the field, it has not been peer reviewed and its charts are frankly a mess,” and it will likely “prove to be just a familiar hype-and-disappoint cycle of the kind that plagues the field of energy physics.”
A certain amount of such skepticism is fair enough in a world where the promise of, say, unlimited cheap fusion-generated energy always seems right around the corner without ever arriving. But don’t take Ridley’s word for it: He quotes superconductivity expert professor Jorge Hirsch at University of California at San Diego, who told him the paper is “...not superconductivity. It’s experimental artifacts, wishful thinking and poor judgment (in the best scenario).”

Can AI be held accountable for union-busting?
The hospitality workers union UNITE HERE Local 11 is trying to answer that question in a complaint targeting gig-economy app Instawork, as POLITICO’s Alfred Ng reported in today’s Morning Tech newsletter. The union claims that while helping a Los Angeles-area hotel replace striking workers, the app violated labor laws by automatically penalizing a replacement worker who decided to join the strike instead.
Alfred points out that in a memo published last year , a lawyer for the National Labor Relations Board urged NLRB leadership to protect workers from the kind of “automated management practices” like the one that penalized the Instawork worker. UNITE HERE Local 11 said it will continue its strike against both the hotel and Instawork itself until the NLRB reaches a decision on the complaint.
It’s one of several different ways that workers have started to target AI specifically in public; the Hollywood writers’ strike is another. Sarah Myers West, managing director of the AI Now Institute, told Alfred the systems tend to “work out very well for employers,” but do not “serve workers’ needs.”

Tom Cruise is currently on a press tour, giving interviews for Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One, scheduled for release on July 12. The movie brings him back as the iconic Ethan Hunt, pulling off a few more daring stunts to save the world. During one interview, the actor had a great time speaking with the interviewer and she even got him to speak a little Hindi.
‘Aap Kaise Hain?’
In a clip from Etalk, Tom is seen in a happy mood. The interviewer made Tom laugh while speaking about his French in the movie. “Is there anything you cannot do? Is he going to speak in Hindi with me?” she asked. Tom eagerly said, “If you want me to speak in Hindi with you I will. Let's try it."" She got him to say the cutest ‘Namaste. Aap kaise hain (How are you)’. Tom, as expected, aced the pronunciation. He was then even more impressed that the interviewer could also speak Punjabi and Farsi and wanted to keep talking about her. Watch the clip here:
‘He’s so charming'
Fans of the actor thought he was too charming in the video. A fan wrote, “He is so cute while speaking ‘namaste aap kaise ho’ & Is there anything he can't do,” wrote one. “Namaste Tom Cruise Sir,” wrote another. “Is there anything #TomCruise can't do? He spoke ‘Namaste! Aap Kaise Hain?’ in my mother tongue Hindi with an Indian accent,” said another.

2023-07-15 14:00:00+00:00,How Tom Cruise Got Us to Forget About His Scientology Ties,Star of ‘Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One’ has avoided any and all Scientology questions and instead painted himself as Movie Savior.,"There are movie stars and then there is Tom Cruise. Forty years a star, enough classics to make listing even a few here pointless, and, now, someone who can stake a legitimate claim to saving Hollywood (or at least jolting some life into that lazy, bloated monstrosity). Last year’s Top Gun: Maverick, with its millions at the box office, helped rescue the movies and movie theaters from the brink of Covid-19 and streaming. This year’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, the seventh and ostensibly penultimate installment of the secret agent series, should reach similar heights. Tom Cruise is as big as he’s ever been — a feat as staggering as any Ethan Hunt stunt.
Because then there’s all the other stuff. The Scientology of it all. The Church’s interminable history of alleged abuses and misconduct and Cruise’s status as its most prominent figure, a high-ranking member with deep ties to leader David Miscavige. Cruise has been a Scientologist for nearly as long as he’s been a star, his introduction to the Church reportedly brokered around 1986 (the same year Top Gun came out) by his first wife Mimi Rogers. A lot has allegedly happened in that time, from the harrowing accusations against the Church itself (abuse, trafficking, forced labor, to name a few, all of which the Church has denied), to the various claims about Cruise’s relationship with it (the alleged arrangement of romantic partners, for one, which the Church has also denied).
And yet, none of it’s ever really caught up with Cruise, let alone dragged him down. Even Alex Gibney, who directed the damning Scientology doc Going Clear (based on Lawrence Wright’s book of the same name), admitted to Rolling Stone recently that he was “surprised” Cruise had avoided any kind of reckoning.
“There are stories about him that, if one could get people to go on the record, would be shocking,” Gibney said. “But they have to be willing to do it. And so far, they haven’t been.” (Cruise did not respond to a request for comment.) Editor’s picks

It’s easy to let one’s imagination run wild with known unknowns (just ask Donald Rumsfeld — or don’t, actually); but the thing is, there’s already a lot we do know about Tom Cruise and Scientology. It’s not some nasty secret stashed away. It barely qualifies as dirty laundry at this point. We’ve had years of tell-alls, exposés, memoirs, documentaries, lawsuits, even one unforgettable episode of South Park. At the most recent Oscars and Golden Globes, where Top Gun: Maverick was fêted with multiple nominations (and even won an Academy Award for Best Sound), hosts Jimmy Kimmel and Jerrod Carmichael both joked about it. They weren’t even subtle or winking, like the kind of jokes 30 Rock made about Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein years before the full extent of their alleged transgressions were revealed. Carmichael flat-out said the three Golden Globes Cruise returned in protest of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association should be exchanged for Shelly Miscavige — David’s wife, who hasn’t been seen in public since 2007.
With Tom Cruise, it’s yet to reach the point where we, as a culture, are devastated, disheveled, distraught, screaming, “He can’t keep getting away with it!” He remains deeply beloved, and not even in an unsettling, upsetting way, like some of our other prominent problematic actors. And it has everything to do with the way Cruise has thrown himself completely into his work over the past 10 years or so — the way he’s effectively replaced Scientology with a different public-facing religion: The Movies.
There was a brief window where it was possible the Tom Cruise/Scientology partnership would end in some kind of mutual assured destruction. The man was on an absolute tear in the mid-2000s, railing against psychology and pharmaceuticals, scolding Brooke Shields for taking antidepressants, then doubling down during a contentious interview with Matt Lauer. It was a time when Cruise was willing to sit down with a major publication like Rolling Stone for a wide-ranging, on-the-record interview, and give quotes like: “If you really want to know, get What Is Scientology?, the book, and look at it, because that’s what Scientology is. It’s a very large body of knowledge with tools that are available. It’s ah… it really is the shit, man.” Related
Shockingly, this didn’t exactly endear Cruise or the Church to the culture at large. A 2008 incident is telling: Hackers obtained and leaked an internal Church video that featured Cruise, full Steve Jobs mode in a black turtleneck, extolling the virtues of Scientology; there was also footage of Cruise accepting the Church’s “Freedom Medal of Valor” and saluting Miscavige. In response, the Church not only tried to wipe the video from the web, but cast doubt on its authenticity, claiming it was “pirated and edited.” By the end of that year, Cruise was apologizing to Lauer for acting “arrogant” and declining to answer interviewer questions about Scientology.
The first half of the 2010s saw more bad press with the release of Wright’s book and Gibney’s doc, as well as the high-profile defection of Leah Remini. Cruise even endured some self-inflicted wounds after filing a defamation suit against the tabloid Life & Style, which had run a story claiming Cruise had abandoned his daughter, Suri, with ex-wife Katie Holmes. In a 2013 deposition, he was forced to admit that Scientology had played a role in his divorce from Holmes, and that Holmes told him she wanted to protect their daughter from the Church. (The lawsuit ultimately settled out of court.)
But by that point, Cruise had weathered the worst of the storm he’d largely wrought upon himself. His M.O. was simple: keep quiet and make movies — and the movies he made were good. Thanks to a creative partnership with writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, he revived the Mission: Impossible franchise and also dropped a few fan favorites, like Jack Reacher and Edge of Tomorrow. (The two also worked together on The Mummy, though, so clearly no one’s perfect.)
Action flicks have always been a core component of the Cruise oeuvre; but after a versatile first 20 years as an actor, his focus narrowed on them in the 2000s, and since then, that focus seems to have only hardened into a raison d’être. There’s little doubt Cruise loves these kinds of movies and the work that goes into not only doing the stunts, but building the characters and stories to make those set pieces worthwhile. But “Tom Cruise, Action Hero” is also an appealing prospect and PR win: If you’re an organization beset by controversy and accusation, why wouldn’t you want your poster boy constantly saving the world?
But action flicks have suited Cruise similarly well in this era of muted public association with Scientology. Amidst the ceaseless rise of green screen tech and CGI tricks, and the Marvel-ization of blockbuster cinema, Cruise remains one of the crazy, blessed few still willing to throw himself out of a plane in service of the noble causes of storytelling and entertainment. That willingness to fully embody Ethan Hunt or Pete “Maverick” Mitchell is a great way to make people not necessarily forget, but stop worrying so much about L. Ron Hubbard, or Xenu, or Shelly Miscavige. Or from wondering, when was the last time Tom Cruise saw his daughter?
It certainly helped, too, that whenever Cruise went out to promote one of his new movies, he was never asked about any of that. Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation came out just a few months after Gibney’s Going Clear in 2015, and there’s nothing in the press cycle to suggest the doc was ever broached with Cruise on record. (One reporter got a very generic comment from Cruise the following year at the London premiere of Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, the actor calling Scientology a “beautiful religion” and “something that has helped me incredibly in my life.”) Instead, in these heavily moderated interviews and red carpet chats, he mostly talked about The Movies — his current movie, his next movie, his old movies, other people’s movies, and, maybe his favorite topic of all, the process of making movies.
Cruise would’ve probably kept chugging along like this, but Covid-19 added a new dimension. When audio leaked in late 2020 of Cruise upbraiding Mission: Impossible crew members for not following pandemic protocols, the overall reaction was less shock, more awe. His dedication to making this movie was absolute, imbued with a clear-eyed understanding of the existential threat Covid-19 posed to the film industry. He backed up those words with the fight to keep Top Gun: Maverick off streaming and ensure it safely landed in theaters. He was handsomely rewarded with box office receipts, rave reviews, and respect from his peers. “You saved Hollywood’s ass,” Steven Spielberg told him at an Oscars luncheon earlier this year, “you might have saved theatrical distribution. Seriously.”
Even at the height of his public association with Scientology, The Movies were like a kind of religion for Cruise. In 2002, when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences needed someone to validate the existence and value of film and the film industry after 9/11, it called on Cruise, and he delivered. You can see shades of it as far back as 1984, two years before his introduction to Scientology, in the way he discusses movies as a vehicle for betterment and serenity: “I’m interested in my personal growth, what’s going to make me happy. Not how much money am I gonna make, not what film is gonna really make me more visible.”
But without the pandemic, Cruise’s embrace of The Movies as his public-facing religion may not have reached such a full expression. What he says about The Movies hasn’t really changed that much, but now it’s shot through with the aura of the savior. With that irrepressible conviction and charisma, he has that preacher’s ability to turn repeated platitudes into mantras or prayers. (Seriously, his reliance on the bit about how, ever since he was four he wanted nothing more than to make movies and travel the world, has arguably surpassed Lady Gaga/100-people-in-a-room levels of ridiculousness — and yet it’s still kinda charming). And what other way is there to look at Cruise’s stunt work than the fearless devotions of a man willing to martyr himself for the thing he loves?
This is not to argue that The Movies has supplanted the Church of Scientology in Cruise’s private life, too. Despite the public distance, there’s no evidence that Cruise has recently drifted from, left, or ever intends to leave the Church. And therein lies the obvious complication: Tom Cruise, Action Hero was already a reliable way to take people’s minds off Tom Cruise, Scientologist; Tom Cruise, Action Hero and Savior of The Movies, is even better. The benefit to Cruise is clear — the continuation of his career and copious amounts of goodwill. You can even speculate as to the benefit for the Church itself: After all the bad press, investigations, and lawsuits, with membership reportedly declining, Cruise’s success may still be a beacon for those in it, a totem to clutch and claim only they understand its true value and power.
As for the rest of us, we seem to have reached a cordial stalemate with Cruise. We’ve delayed his reckoning — maybe forever, maybe only for now — allowed him to float above the level of a Mark Wahlberg, or worse, a Mel Gibson. And that’s because, as much as Tom Cruise, Action Hero and Savior of the Movies is good PR, it’s also who he is, who he’s always been. Despite everything else he believes, he still believes in The Movies.
There’s a famous tidbit about how Thomas Cruise Mapother IV spent a year in seminary school as a teenager before he started acting. Tom Cruise has always insisted Thomas Mapother was never actually close to becoming a priest, but the episode still encapsulates the zealous streak in his character, an irrepressible yearning for knowledge and understanding, his belief in, or need for, a higher calling or power. And before he found an outlet for all that in Scientology, he found it in acting and making movies. It’s still there. The proof is everywhere, even when he’s just looking a camera dead in the eye, smiling, and saying, “I love my popcorn. Movies, popcorn.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yb2xsaW5nc3RvbmUuY29tL3R2LW1vdmllcy90di1tb3ZpZS1mZWF0dXJlcy90b20tY3J1aXNlLXNjaWVudG9sb2d5LW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1tb3ZpZS1zYXZpb3ItMTIzNDc4OTAxNS_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucm9sbGluZ3N0b25lLmNvbS90di1tb3ZpZXMvdHYtbW92aWUtZmVhdHVyZXMvdG9tLWNydWlzZS1zY2llbnRvbG9neS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctbW92aWUtc2F2aW9yLTEyMzQ3ODkwMTUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Tom Cruise's film faced obstacles
The film faced many setbacks caused by Covid-19 pandemic during its multi-year shoot. Filming was put on hold at least five times due to the pandemic, with Tom and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie ultimately contracting the virus. An audio of Tom insisting that the crew abide by Covid-19 restrictions went viral.
Tom Cruise talks about film
On returning to the Mission Impossible franchise, Tom told The Hollywood Reporter, “We talked about it. We dreamed about it. It’s very, very special. On Top Gun: Maverick, they kept pushing the movie and pushing the movie, and for (McQuarrie) and I, this is such an ambitious movie. And it was a very challenging film to produce, and then everything happened, and it was even more challenging. So to have this response…is very, very special.”
When asked if he felt pressure for his latest film to perform well at the box office, Cruise said, “I’m just going to make the best films that I can make, and I want them all to perform well, and I want all of the other films to perform well. I think about a movie in terms of the quality and longevity, I invest everything in it. So, really, my job is just to try to make the best film I possibly can to entertain the audience for that particular genre.""
Variety reported that MI 7 is expected to make around $85 million to $95 million in North America and $160 million internationally in its first five days of release. This would result in a global opening of $250 million. Mission: Impossible – Fallout currently holds the record with $61 million, followed by 2000’s Mission: Impossible II with $57.8 million, Variety informed.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9ob2xseXdvb2QvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLXBhcnQtb25lLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtY29sbGVjdGlvbi10b20tY3J1aXNlLTEwMTY4OTI5OTk5OTU5Ni5odG1s0gGbAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2hvbGx5d29vZC9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctcGFydC1vbmUtYm94LW9mZmljZS1jb2xsZWN0aW9uLXRvbS1jcnVpc2UtMTAxNjg5Mjk5OTk5NTk2LWFtcC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

GROWING UP, Greg Davis was a wild child. “My family used to say I was bad,” says Davis, “but I say I had a lot of energy!” With all that energy and long, curly hair down to his back that he later styled into dreads, he got the nickname “Tarzan” from his family. It’s since become his middle name in his credits as an actor in action films like Top Gun: Maverick and this summer’s Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One.
Shooting back-to-back projects with Tom Cruise requires every ounce of that Tarzan energy, something Davis knew from the grueling prep for Maverick, during which he withstood up to eight g’s of force and underwent intensive swim training. This time, a mere two weeks after he got the call for Mission: Impossible, Davis was on set—the “set” being a mountaintop in Norway—waiting to watch Cruise shoot a stunt involving a cliffside motorcycle BASE jump. “Tom flies over us hanging off the end of a helicopter, gets to the edge of the cliff, and just jumps off,” he says. “And that was his warmup for the actual stunt!”
Davis—who spent his youth dabbling in football, basketball, baseball, track, and tae kwon do—found kindred spirits and mentors in Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie. They all share a similar can’t-stop-won’t-stop attitude. But Davis knows how to relax, too, like on a trip to Jamaica last summer. “I’m a pool guy,” he says. “And I do enjoy swimming, now that I’ve learned from Top Gun.”
At a tucked away booth at the Heimat Fitness Concept Club in Los Angeles, where Davis had just wrapped a Men's Health photoshoot sporting the summer's most versatile shorts and shirts—get the look below!—he described his wild first day on set with Cruise for Mission: Impossible, how the movies pull their intense stunts together, and why he hopes we never see the unreleased footage of the now-iconic Maverick football beach scene.

Men's Health: Your father is a boxer and so is one of your brothers, but you've taken up a lot of sports and types of exercise over the years. What's been your exercise of choice to get into Mission: Impossible shape?
Greg Tarzan Davis: Boxing is currently is my exercise of choice. For Mission: Impossible, I did a lot of physical training that required me to learn different techniques, so I've taken up kickboxing on top of boxing. I mean, it's Mission: Impossible—it's an action film to the biggest degree. We do all our own stunts because that's what you do with Tom Cruise, and there are sequences where my character shows a background in martial arts. Something I think is so cool about this film is that each character has their own specific fighting style or way of moving. Rebecca [Ferguson] has more more of fluid style of fighting, whereas I have more of a brute force style, and Tom has his own style, which we all saw in the amazing Mission: Impossible—Fallout bathroom fight scene. So if you go back and watch all the Mission: Impossible movies, you'll see that each character has developed their own physicality.
Tom Cruise is known for going hard in his movies, whether it's for stunts or fight scenes or chase sequences. Did you feel a lot of pressure to keep up?
There's no pressure necessarily. But you're always thinking, What is he going to have me do next? But he's so good at preparing you for what you're about to take on. So I've never been scared because I've been so prepared. He sets up all these training regimens in order for you to be able to do what you need to do. My training consistent of martial arts, weapons training, skydiving, drifting, motorcycle riding, and flying planes. It was like a crash course of every wild thing you can do in an action movie.

This is your first Mission: Impossible movie. What was your first impression when you got on set?
Okay, so, the stunts that we have in this movie are insane. The motorcycle stunt is insane. And to see it in person is really insane. I went to set every day, even when I wasn't working, because I was shadowing McQ. I want to learn from him and Tom. They've been great mentors, teaching me all the intricate details of how things work, whether it's on set or in the editing room.
On top of that, we're all always on set when there's a big stunt. So I remember on the very first day, we were in Norway, filming on top of a mountain cliff. I asked how we were going to get to set, and they said, ""Oh, a helicopter."" So they send everybody to the top of the mountain by helicopter. It's me, Haley Atwell, Simon Pegg, Pom Klementieff, Shea Whigham. We get up to the top of this mountain, and everyone is setting up for Tom to do a BASE jump off the cliff. So I asked, ""Where's Tom?"" Then Tom flies over us hanging off the end of a helicopter, gets to the edge of the cliff, and just jumps off. And that was his warmup for the actual stunt!

Were there any sequences that you had to hype yourself up for?
My first day of shooting was actually to shoot my big stunt. I was like, ""Damn, so this is how you ease people into the world of Mission: Impossible?"" When you're shooting stunts at these great heights, there's something that kicks in, that happens in your mind: you just don't want to fall. So you have to fight the urge to hang on for dear life. You have to look cool! You have to look like this is something you do all the time. In one particular shot, I lost my shoe and it just fell out of sight. I thought, That could have been me! Goddamn! Then I had to shoot the rest of the scene without a shoe. There was nothing we could do. The cameraman just had to try to hide my bare foot. It was a weird shot. But I couldn't stop the whole production to go get my shoe. You keep going, you get something, and you see what they can do with it. It was the same kind of thing with Maverick. You're up there in a cockpit by yourself, and you have to get the shot. You want to use every second available to you.

Tom and director McQ have made a lot of these movies over the years and developed their own approach to creating big action movie tentpoles. What was the process of creating a Mission: Impossible movie?
So I got my first actual, full script for Mission: Impossible two weeks before I wrapped the film. Izzy, the AD, came to my trailer and she said, ""Hey, I have a gift for you!"" And she handed me this big old printed script. But during most of the filming, you get pages throughout the process. When you're shooting scenes with dialogue and you get the script for those scenes the night before, you have to adjust quickly and you have to trust McQ and Tom. But they also have to trust us. I think it's incredible that they have so much faith in their actors to handle an unorthodox process, to be able to adapt, and to make the most of the freedom you get to help create your character and contribute. And I will say that Simon and Rebecca were also great at helping usher us in to the Mission way. We would go into a scene, we would do something, and McQ would say, ""That's really good. Do more of that."" Then the next day, he would come to you and say, ""That thing you did yesterday, we were watching dailies, and we loved it and now we're doing this new thing with your character."" And I'd seen this in Maverick too. My part was basically a background character, but I did one thing in one scene and they said, ""Okay, let's give him more."" So I was able to understand the process going into Mission.
Speaking of Maverick, it would be journalistic malpractice not to ask you about the beach football scene. What was it like to shoot that and try to live up to the beach volleyball scene in the original Top Gun?
That was an intense time. We killed ourselves for that beach scene because we knew how important it was, and how many people love the iconic volleyball scene from the first Top Gun. So we starved and worked out three times a day. We were angry campers—hangry campers.
Then we found out two weeks after we shot the scene—after everybody had just pigged out—that we had to shoot the scene again. So then we had to go through an expedited version of preparations. It was terrible!

Well, the results speak for themselves: the scene was so popular that last Christmas, Paramount+ looped the scene into a three hour yule log-style video for the holidays. Is there any more footage that you're holding out on us?
Oh, there's a lot of the footage that we did not want to put out from the beach scene in Maverick—out in fear of embarrassment!
Why was it so embarrassing?
There's just one shot of all of us, oiled up, shirtless, doing the most erotic dances on the tarmac before even going to the beach. We're not even on the beach yet! It started out with us all just working out, and someone started playing some music, so we all started getting into it. And suddenly there's this raunchy Magic Mike moment happening on the tarmac of a naval base. Someone still has the footage! But we were supposed to be these hotshot pilots, so I'm pretty sure the studio just couldn't put out a lot of the content that they recorded. And I am thankful for that!

7/25/2023 19:00,"Tom Cruise, our messy messiah of movies","Op-ed about Tom Cruise as savior of movies, enemy to AI","Over the span of his 40-year career, Tom Cruise has been many things: Hollywood heartthrob, celebrated Short King (he's 5-foot-7), Scientology spokesperson, reticent actor and now . . . the savior of cinema. Earlier this year, Steven Spielberg made the decree at the annual Oscars luncheon, telling the actor he ""saved the entire theatrical industry,"" as ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" Cruise's highest grossing movie ever ($1.49 billion globally), achieved the rare and coveted task of bringing moviegoers back to the theaters. The claim has regained traction now that the star has joined negotiations with SAG-AFTRA in order to protect actors from being replaced by artificial intelligence — nevermind the fact that he has declined to join the picket line for the unions' ongoing strike.
He's famously known for performing his own stunts no matter how terrifying, just one of the many reasons people refer to him as the last remaining movie star.
It's no mere coincidence then that the villain in Cruise's latest movie, ""Mission Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,"" is, of all things, AI. In the seventh installment, notoriously rogue spy Ethan Hunt is tasked with finding the key that controls the sentient AI called ""The Entity"" that can manipulate digital reality. Good guy that he is, Ethan doesn't stop at obtaining the key, he sets out to destroy The Entity for the sake of mankind.
Like his character, Cruise is fighting to preserve reality by tackling AI, merging his persona with his performance and reinforcing himself as the movie messiah. Since the pandemic, the public has been awoken to his staunch defense of The Movies. In a leaked clip captured while filming ""Dead Reckoning"" during the pandemic, he was heard yelling at crew members who were not following COVID-19 precautions. While he was audibly angry and intense, the clip was widely interpreted as Cruise being dedicated to the craft that is moviemaking. To top it off, he's famously known for performing his own stunts no matter how terrifying, just one of the many reasons people refer to him as the last remaining movie star.
In an era where Hollywood is ruled by IP and franchises in place of actors, Cruise feels like the last of his kind. What allowed his stardom to endure and evolve in ways Brad Pitt's, Sandra Bullock's and so many others' did not?
Unlike other celebrities, the persona of Hollywood's last star has always loomed larger than life. It's not always a tidy reputation, but it is always intriguing and full-on — even his fall from publicity grace. The early aughts through to 2012 were dark times for the actor's public image. In 2004, he opened up about joining the Church of Scientology, an organization suspiciously structured like a pyramid scheme, purported to be a religion, founded by the science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard. The cult-like group comes with many controversies, including allegedly profiting from human trafficking and forced labor and practicing abusive behavior. The optics for Cruise at the time weren't great, but they were still surrounded by buzz and an intense need to know more about the actor.
The more investigations and self-reports from the actor about his ties to Scientology, the more complex and unhinged he appeared to be. There was the time he criticized Brooke Shields for taking antidepressants because psychiatry is not within the church's belief. Or, that time when a former Scientologist alleged that he had not seen his daughter Suri Cruise for 10 years because she is not a Scientologist. At one point, he also used the church to find new love interests, as Scientologists reportedly recruited actress Nazanin Boniadi, giving her a makeover to Cruise's preferences, to become the actor's girlfriend. He dated her for a while before letting the church break up with her for him. When she told a friend what happened, she was punished by the church with months of menial labor.

Even when he's not speaking about Scientology, everything about Cruise is sensational. His infamous 2005 couch-jumping Oprah Winfrey interview (which he's since enthusiastically reenacted) is case in point. Looking back, the interview feels like an ""I Think You Should Leave"" skit with Cruise, the Tim Robinson stand-in, taking emotions to the unsettling extreme until they cross social norms. He randomly and repeatedly jumps up onto the couch, grabs Oprah by both shoulders and shakes her, drops to his knees and then, when Katie Holmes is invited onto the stage, finds the actress, restrains both of her arms and almost drags her to the stage; all because he's just so passionate about his love for her. Perhaps what's even more perplexing than the actor's behavior is how the live audience uproariously cheers him on.
Such is the power of Tom Cruise.
After watching the interview, it's easy to see how Cruise was the character inspiration for the onscreen take on sociopathic killer Patrick Bateman in ""American Psycho,"" which Christian Bale came to realize after watching a 1999 appearance of Cruise on ""Late Show with David Letterman."" During his appearance, the actor recounted a story about co-piloting a private plane and turning off a passenger's oxygen supply. When Letterman asks him if that's attempted manslaughter, he laughs so hard he can't string a full sentence together to finish the story. Creepy as this interview is, it adds yet another conundrum to the puzzle that is Tom Cruise. Attempting to solve that puzzle keeps us coming back. His eerie antics keep us glued to the screen, like witnessing something horrific you just can't look away from.
It's almost as if Tom Cruise The Person and Tom Cruise The Character are one and the same.
Eventually, the star learned to shut up about Scientology, entering a newly reticent era and becoming known for turning down in-depth interviews. Who he is now and what he gets up to has become so mysterious that the New York Times recently went on their own impossible mission to find him in the wild. His increasingly private life and determination to keep making movies has essentially repaired his hurt reputation. As Rolling Stone points out, Cruise ""effectively replaced Scientology with a different public-facing religion: The Movies.""
Shielding his private life only added fuel to the fire that his mysterious, larger-than-life persona created. Now, when people hear any details they can about the star, they revere it and pick it over. He has a signature white chocolate coconut cake bundt cake and he sends it to celebrities every year? He taught Zac Efron to ride a motorcycle? He rescued a family from a burning sailboat? Wow, he's so fearless and heroic, like a real-life Ethan Hunt and all the other action heroes he's fully leaned into playing and that don't at all try to distract from his Scientology scandals . . .
It's almost as if Tom Cruise The Person and Tom Cruise The Character are one and the same. The conflation has bolstered the star's allure and ability to bring people to theaters, as his deep lore and real heroics draw people to see him, and specifically him, in films — and we eat it up. Journalist Justine Smith puts it best, ""People didn't come back to the cinema to watch a new 'Top Gun' movie, a sequel 30 years in the making — they came to the cinema to watch Tom Cruise.""
Whether or not you believe this one white man, who stood with SAG-AFTRA most when it benefits his own movies, can fix a systemic issue of exploitation and capitalism is irrelevant, because Cruise will act like he did. That's the whole point of the latest ""Mission Impossible."" And we watched it, we enjoyed it if its Rotten Tomatoes score (96% for critics and 94% for the audience) is any indication, and we will continue to watch when Cruise puts on another performance. While he is many things, no one can accuse him of not committing to the bit.
Cruise's allure can be best captured by his acceptance speech video for ""Top Gun"" at the MTV Movie & TV Awards. He didn't just accept his speech, he got into a helicopter and thanked the audience for going to the movies. Right before he jumps out of the helicopter to finish his speech mid-fall, he shouts, ""I love entertaining you!"" From Scientology to Movie Savior, Cruise does exactly that. He is a star because he never stops entertaining, and we love him all the more for it.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3LzI1L3RvbS1jcnVpc2UtbW92aWUtaGVyby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Tom Cruise checks in to promote latest Mission Impossible movie
Hollywood star Tom Cruise is visiting Korea for the 11th time and said Thursday that he went to grab Korean barbeque as soon as he arrived the night before.Since his first visit to Korea in 1994 for “Interview with the Vampire,” Cruise has paid a visit almost every time his film premiered, such as in 2001 for “Vanilla Sky,"" 2008 for “Valkyrie,"" 2013 for “Jack Reacher” and last year for “Top Gun: Maverick."" Cruise said he is so comfortable and well-received in the country that this time, he ""got to meet and talk to people on the streets of Seoul."" He also added that he is ""happy to be able to show Korea to his colleagues here today.""Cruise is not just here to enjoy Korean food with his friends, but to promote his latest film “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One."" On Thursday, he attended the press conference for the film at Lotte Cinema's World Tower branch in Songpa District, southern Seoul and talked about how traveling around the world and making movies is his dream come true.“I was very passionate about storytelling from when I was very young,” Cruise said. “I wanted to make movies and travel the world from when I was four, and started auditioning at age 18.”Reflecting on his three-decade-long career, Cruise said that a passion for acting was what made him the globally famous actor today. “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” tells the story of Ethan Hunt, played by Cruise, who must track down a new weapon that threatens to wipe out all of humanity.“I lived in hotels and worked part-time jobs to get through auditions,” Cruise said. “One of those jobs was sweeping snow off of someone’s lawn. I didn’t study acting professionally and had my share of struggles. A strong passion for acting was what made me the actor I am today.”Cruise famously does all of his stunts in his action films, and “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” was no exception. In this new installment, there is one particular scene where Cruise falls off of a cliff in Norway that is exceptional.“When I do those stunts, I focus on the story first,” Cruise said. “I talk to the director and see what needs to be done to elevate the story that we are trying to tell. I drive my own planes, helicopters and jets, and do my own parachuting too. For this movie, I trained again for parachuting and biking.”Watching Cruise do his own stunts is terrifying yet at the same time gratifying to watch, said Simon Pegg, who has played the supporting character Benji Dunn in the Mission: Impossible series.“Preparations for the stunts are done extensively, so it’s not something you’d call reckless – nevertheless it’s terrifying to watch Tom do all those things,” Pegg said during the press conference. “We film with the best experts from around the world and train with the best for the most amazing shots. Of course, unexpected things happen during filming and everyone is on edge, but I have got some great shots of Tom performing stunts on my phone that I will post on social media once the film is out.”“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” opens in local theaters on July 12.BY LIM JEONG-WON [lim.jeongwon@joongang.co.kr]",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8va29yZWFqb29uZ2FuZ2RhaWx5LmpvaW5zLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2LzI5L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbW92aWVzL0tvcmVhLVRvbS1DcnVpc2UtTWlzc2lvbi1JbXBvc3NpYmxlLzIwMjMwNjI5MTcyNjQwODM4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' Costars Reveal His 'Generous' Gifts: From Shark Trips to Skydiving (Exclusive),"Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' costars Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff reveal the wildest gifts the actor-producer has given them, including everything from shark-diving expeditions to skydiving lessons","Tom Cruise famously sends his friends in Hollywood a coconut cake every year for the holidays — but for his Mission: Impossible costars, the actor-producer is even more generous.
Cruise, 61, is back in theaters with the seventh installment in the hit action series, Dead Reckoning Part One, with many returning cast members (Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Vanessa Kirby and Rebecca Ferguson) as well as new ones (including Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff).
As one of the franchise's newcomers, Atwell, 41, tells PEOPLE she was especially touched by her costar's ""very thoughtful gifts.""

""I'm on my fourth Christmas cake,"" the English actress says. ""I've had a few birthdays as well because we've been working together nearly, what, over three and a half years now.""
For one of her special days, she recalls receiving ""a beautiful amphora"" from Cruise, which she describes as ""this beautiful old clay pot, which is a natural filtering system.""
""I'm like, 'It's a water jug. Nice,' "" she continues. ""And then you taste it and you compare it to normal filtered water or tap water, and it's really light and kind of creamy. It's just a different level of clarity. It's beautiful.""

Klementieff, who goes head-to-head with Cruise in Dead Reckoning as one of the film's villains, is also a fan of the coconut cake.
""I freeze it and then I eat it frozen, so I just eat it every day,"" she shares. ""That's what I did last year for Christmas. I started it when I got it and I ate it every morning, so I had a sugar rush. It was not good for my health, but it was delicious.""
Another gift from Cruise was even more addictive.
""Another beautiful gift that was so thoughtful is that I wanted to skydive with him and also the stunt team, but they said that I needed to get my license,"" recalls the French actress, 37. ""So when I wrapped the movie, he gifted me, as my wrap gift, the lessons of learning how to skydive.""
""He found a teacher for me and I learned how to skydive and I got my license and we even did jumps together. And now I'm addicted, so that's my new thing now!""

Despite having worked with Cruise since the third Mission: Impossible film in 2006, Pegg, 53, continues to be surprised with what his costar does for his cast.
""He's always very keen to show his appreciation,"" says Pegg. ""I think he's so used to being the focus of attention, it's naturally his instinct to kind of reflect everything back. And he's always incredibly sort of generous in terms of his gratitude to us and how he thanks us and how he lets us know that we're valued.""

One way Cruise showed his appreciation for his crew, as Pegg recalls, was taking the team shark-diving on a break from filming.
""We were filming somewhere near some coastal waters where there were sharks and we had the afternoon off and we all jumped,"" says Pegg.
""It's such a Tom Cruise thing. We've been filming in a helicopter and he flew us in the helicopter to this place where you could go into a cage and feed sharks. It was one of those days that we got to the end of the day and we were like, 'That was a real Tom Cruise kind of day.' ""

,Hayley Atwell and Simon Pegg Rave About 'Mission: Impossible' Costar Tom Cruise: 'He's Just a Guy',"Hayley Atwell, Simon Pegg and director Chris McQuarrie open up about their relationships with Tom Cruise — and how he's ""just a guy"" who loves making movies","Tom Cruise may be a worldwide movie star, but he’s also “just a guy,"" according to his Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One collaborators.
Despite his enduring fame, Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell and director Chris McQuarrie insist that the actor, 61, is just a man who loves making movies.
Pegg, 53, who plays Benji Dunn in the iconic spy series, told The Times that Cruise is involved “in every part of a film” — from filling its lead role to helping out on-set caterers. “I just don’t think anybody else can be as arsed as he can,” he told the outlet.
The star, who met the Jerry Maguire actor nearly two decades ago, cited the actor’s tendency to do his own stunts while describing his intense dedication to the movies he creates.
“With special effects, you know something is artificial — it removes a degree of tension — so Tom pushes things to the limit, to the point of risking his life,” Pegg said of Cruise.

Atwell, 41, seconded Pegg’s claims of Cruise’s dedication to making movies that audiences will love.
""It’s very rare,"" she told The Times of the Risky Business star’s attention to detail on set, recalling when he gave a runner-slash-aspiring-cinematographer a laminated cinematography guide.
The actress, who plays Grace in the action film, added that — similar to his treatment of everyone on a film set — Cruise values viewers and their experience with a movie above all else.
“He doesn’t want to make movies now to punish an audience,” Atwell told the publication. “He doesn’t want films with the message that if you do not understand this, you’re not smart.”

The Marvel star continued, “I can tell when I watch some movies that the director has made it for themselves. I don’t feel involved or I think, ‘Am I stupid?’ Tom’s not a snob.”
An example of this, Atwell said, was during a script read for a Mission: Impossible film — not Dead Reckoning Part One — when Cruise told the crew that he “didn’t get” a line, which translated to “the audience will not get it” — and thus it was cut.

McQuarrie, 54, the director of several Mission: Impossible movies and a longtime friend of Cruise, echoed Pegg and Atwell’s statements about Cruise’s desire to make movies that are fun for audiences.
“There is an outsized importance placed on Oscars [and] films that not many people are going to see,” he told The Times, noting that it is a phenomenon that he says is a “wedge has been driven into the [film] industry.”
“Are you an artist or an entertainer?” McQuarrie posed, before adding that Cruise — who introduced himself to McQuarrie as a maker of “mass entertainment” in 2006 — does not see these titles as “mutually exclusive.”

Pegg also raved to the publication about Tom’s intense love of movies — the intersection of art and entertainment — and what it means for the future of film.
“People can argue that cinema is frivolous, but it’s not,” he told The Times. “Cinema brings people together at a time we’re pulling apart, and that just added to Tom’s determination to put people in a room together.”
He continued, “The power of cinema is, for him, precious and it’s vital we sustain it.”
The Shaun of the Dead actor also opened up about his personal relationship with Cruise, telling the outlet that he was able to “hack my way through all the bizarre mythology” surrounding the Top Gun star.
“On one side he’s Tom Cruise — this enigmatic film star everyone wants to know about — and on the other he’s just a guy,” Pegg said. “I like being normal with him.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9oYXlsZXktYXR3ZWxsLXNpbW9uLXBlZ2ctcmF2ZS1hYm91dC1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtY29zdGFyLXRvbS1jcnVpc2UtNzU1ODM0NdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-20 10:27:33+00:00,‘Mission: Impossible’,"“Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, some language and suggestive material.","In December, Paramount Pictures released an enthralling behind-the-scenes video for its upcoming big-budget release “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” detailing a high-stakes stunt.
In it, Tom Cruise — not a stuntman, but Cruise, the enduring and ageless Hollywood heavyweight — jumps a motorcycle off a mountain in Norway.
It’s crazy.
Crazier? The perfectionist Cruise executed the jump seven more times.
The first couple of pages of production notes for the movie — now in theaters — are devoted to the stunt as well. Shot on the first day of principal photography in September 2020, the effort was the culmination of a year of prep work by Cruise, a skydiver who’d dreamt about executing the daredevil move for decades.
The good news is the work pays off, as it and other large-scale action sequences in “Part One” — the seventh installment in the popular “Mission: Impossible” big-screen franchise — are constantly thrilling and impressive.
The bad news: Almost anytime the movie isn’t in the midst of one “Dead Reckoning” comes pretty close to becoming deadly boring.
It’s surprising just how stagnant the film feels in several stretches given Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie’s penchant for collaborating on winning projects, including the most recent installments in this series. (McQuarrie co-wrote 2011’s “Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol” and since has directed and co-written 2015’s “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation” and 2018’s “Mission: Impossible — Fallout.”)
McQuarrie and co-writer Erik Jendresen have crafted an exposition-heavy tale of an artificial intelligence gone rogue that never feels as if it needs two parts to tell. (“Dead Reckoning Part Two” is set for a theatrical release June 28.) At more than two and a half hours, “Part One” is plenty long enough for a self-contained story.
We meet the persistently pesky AI aboard a Russian sub, a state-of-the-art war machine that runs into problems thanks to what becomes known as “The Entity.”
We then catch up with the franchise’s central figure, Cruise’s Ethan Hunt, operative extraordinaire with the top-secret Impossible Mission Force. He’s lying low in Amsterdam, but he accepts a mission from Henry Czerny’s Eugene Kittridge — not seen since 1996’s franchise-launching “Mission Impossible,” the character is now the director of the CIA — that takes him to the Arabian Desert.
And so begins Ethan’s reconnecting with friends, enemies and frenemies, including Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Alanna Mitsopolis (Vanessa Kirby), aka The White Widow.
The Entity sees Ethan as such a threat that it has recruited an old nemesis to work on its behalf, Esai Morales’ Gabriel. The movie leans so hard into flashbacks involving the pair that you have to convince yourself that you’ve never seen these scenes, their dalliance set prior to Ethan becoming an IMF agent. McQuarrie simply needs to FEEL just how much Gabriel-related baggage Ethan apparently has been carrying around this whole time, but this works only so well.
Also new to the mix — and adding more to it than Gabriel — is Hayley Atwell’s Grace, a high-priced thief hired to steal a key that could be, well, the key to controlling The Entity. Grace is both ambitious and in over her head, a combination that helps keep you guessing as to what she will do at any given time when paired with Ethan, and Atwell (“Agent Carter”) proves to be a solid addition.
They are chased through the streets of Rome — another of the movie’s international shooting locales along with, among others, Venice and the aforementioned Norway, standing in for the Austrian Alps — by Gabriel’s French henchwoman, Paris (Pom Klementieff of “Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3”). The latter is in a giant armored vehicle and Ethan and Grace in a very small car, which allows for a nice amount of humor to be infused into what otherwise is a well-executed but familiar-feeling sequence. (The recently released “Fast X” boasts an even crazier, if less satisfying, sequence set in the streets of the Italian capital.)
Give credit to McQuarrie and others for a well-timed AI-centric story, but it’s simply hard to become invested in it. In part, that’s because it provides no real food for thought beyond what if an AI did this or that horrifying thing? It doesn’t help that this greatest of enemies is represented by visuals that often feel like Windows screensavers.
And there’s the movie’s MacGuffin, the all-important key. It consists of two separated halves that must be united to have any worth. That “Dead Reckoning” uses a central plot device so similar to that of the recently released and entirely mind-numbing “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” is an unfortunate coincidence.
Part of the secret sauce of movies such as those in the “Mission: Impossible” and James Bond series are plots so convoluted that you feel like you’re barely keeping up. If nothing else, it makes them seem a little smarter than they actually are.
“Dead Reckoning Part One” is ultimately so simple — unite key, stop AI — that you wish characters would at least spend less time explaining everything.
There’s so much explaining.
“I’m going to need just a few more details,” Grace tells Ethan, Luther and Benji when they try to recruit her into helping her with a nearly impossible mission.
“They tend to just get in the way,” counters Benji.
How right you are, sir.
We do get a pretty nifty action sequence before the closing credits in “Part One,” leaving us at least a little hungry for “Part Two.”
And we know we’ll accept that “Mission, too, as it’s impossible to believe we won’t see Cruise do something even crazier in that one.

,‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’ was made for the love of movies,Tom Cruise reaffirms his determination to entertain the audience at all costs in “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning – Part One.”,"Tom Cruise loves only one thing: movies.
In his latest big-screen foray, “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” the seventh film in the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, Cruise reaffirms his determination to entertain the audience at all costs. But “Dead Reckoning” adds extra substance to the typical “I can’t believe he actually did that” stunts the franchise is known for, serving as a tribute to past “Mission: Impossible” films and a warning about potential downturns in moviemaking.
“Dead Reckoning” follows Cruise’s Ethan Hunt as he, yet again, must travel the globe and track down an object that may determine the fate of the world before a villain with unclear motivations — aside from a desire for world destruction — can acquire it. Plus, Hunt is isolated from and being hunted by his own government, who assumes that this time Hunt has really turned evil, unlike the past six times.
As with many “Mission: Impossible” movies, the plot is borderline incomprehensible at times. But the occasional confusion doesn’t make the moments where Cruise comes to the slow realization that he’ll have to perform some crazy stunt, like climbing the world’s tallest building, to get to the next step in his journey any less satisfying.
While not the franchise’s best — that title still belongs to 2018’s “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” — “Dead Reckoning” succeeds as one of Cruise’s better over-the-top globetrotting adventures in no small part because of the film’s locations. Much of the movie’s action occurs in Rome, Venice and the Austrian Alps, three of the most scenic places in the world, making spending time with Hunt and company a delight.
The set piece in Venice is a particularly inspired use of location to further the story. Cruise and costars Hayley Atwell and Rebecca Ferguson are forced to run around the famously confusing, moonlit and claustrophobic stone alleyways of Venice while receiving baffling and often incorrect directions — the only possible improvement would have been a gondola stunt.
“Dead Reckoning” is also probably the funniest movie in the franchise, with Simon Pegg’s portrayal of the doddering Benji, Hunt’s friend, getting many of the best laugh lines. On multiple occasions, he cracks meta-narrative jokes about how he, Hunt and the rest of their team always end up going rogue, saving the day with just milliseconds left and other franchise tropes.
The entire supporting cast of the film turns in strong performances, with franchise newcomers Atwell and Pom Klementieff standing out through their boatloads of charm and intensity in action scenes. Atwell even accomplishes the task that has eluded Cruise’s female co-stars for 40 years — she’s so charismatic that she manages to have some semblance of chemistry with him.
But as incredible as these developments are, there was only ever going to be one highlight of “Dead Reckoning,” the so-called “biggest stunt in cinema history”: Tom Cruise driving a motorcycle off a cliff to do a base jump. After well over a year of the stunt being promoted in trailers ahead of every movie, my expectations were quite high.
Unsurprisingly, the jump completely delivers. The moment is tense and shot breathtakingly, and the whole time one can’t help but think “I can’t believe he’s actually doing this.”
Between the big stunt, classic “Mission: Impossible” mask switcheroos and other brilliantly choreographed action I can’t spoil here, the finale of the movie does not disappoint. It’s a long film, clocking in at more than two and a half hours, but the third act is worth the wait due to the thrilling action.
Perhaps more unexpectedly, “Dead Reckoning” comments on the current state of blockbuster moviemaking. Cruise, who has shown time and again that he will do anything to further cinema, uses the movie as a chance to comment on the rise of artificial intelligence in filmmaking.
The villain of the film is the “Entity,” a sentient piece of artificial intelligence Hunt is determined to destroy, while every world government and a foe from Hunt’s past, Gabriel played by Esai Morales, is determined to use it to their advantage. Coming in the midst of both writers and actors strikes in Hollywood where AI is a central issue and in the middle of a summer full of blockbusters criticized for poor CGI like “The Flash” and “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” the subtext of the plot is hard to miss.
The movie also acts as a throwback to the original “Mission: Impossible,” released in 1996 before every blockbuster was made almost entirely in front of the green screen. The near-constant use of close-up, angled shots evokes director Brian De Palma’s style from that first movie, and plot elements from the late-night scene in Venice to the return of CIA director Eugene Kittridge recall Ethan Hunt’s first mission going rogue.
“Dead Reckoning” is one part tribute and another part eulogy to this nearly extinct style of filmmaking. The follow-up to the film, “Dead Reckoning — Part Two” is expected to be Cruise’s final go-round as Ethan Hunt, marking the end of an era for a franchise that has bucked many of the trends in blockbuster filmmaking over the past 30 years.
Cruise is doing all he can through his bonkers stunts and unexpectedly layered plots to remind audiences one last time of the power action movies hold. He’s even willing to drive motorcycles off cliffs for it.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZ3doYXRjaGV0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3LzIxL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1wYXJ0LW9uZS13YXMtbWFkZS1mb3ItdGhlLWxvdmUtb2YtbW92aWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Like the Eye of Sauron from Lord of the Rings, this all-seeing, sentient technology now makes decisions on its own with global consequences. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his merry band of spies embark on a mission to acquire a key that can shut the A.I. down. Think Frodo, Mount Doom, the Ring, and you're on the right track. Dead Reckoning Part One is the seventh film in a nearly 30-year-long franchise, and if Tom Cruise wants to turn it into James Bond meets Lord of the Rings, I'm all here for it.

Still, that doesn't stop everyone from constantly explaining how computers work to us as if we've never even owned an email address. Mission Impossible's writing has not improved, but its seventh entry, at the very least. hits an entertaining level of camp. Ethan, I think the Entity knows all of our passwords?! Luckily, the A.I. puts a human face to its plan, by choosing newcomer Gabriel (Esai Morales) to act on its behalf. Gabriel has a secret past with Ethan Hunt as well.
Story continues
Incidentally, another random plot decision makes the film feel incredibly relevant. Unbeknownst to any of our central characters, Dead Reckoning Part One's first scene clues us in on a submarine disaster in which the the Entity killed its entire crew. It wouldn't be too farfetched for audiences to connect this scene to the recent OceanGate disaster, where a tourist submarine imploded on its way to explore the wreck of the Titanic. But Cruise and co. couldn't have known any of this when they set out to make Dead Reckoning Part One. Hell, they couldn't have even known how bogged down the entertainment landscape would be by A.I. adversaries by the time their film finally premiered.
Still, Cruise does know action. And that's where, if you're interested in seeing MI's seventh entry, you should buy a ticket right now. The motorcycle jump that we mentioned? It's breathtaking. Of course, Cruise doesn't stop there. His mission, should he choose to accept it, is to challenge death by making these movies for us. Dead Reckoning Part One also features a long car chase through Rome, a fistfight in a tiny alley, an airport heist, and a final escape—which I won't spoil. Fans and critics often say this of the MI films, but the stunts alone truly make the entire experience worthwhile.
Christian Black - Paramount
Far more entertaining that Gabriel or the Entity is their assassin: Paris, who is played by Pom Klementieff. Howling and laughing on her way to kill Ethan Hunt, the crew is completely shaken by a Looney Tunes, Harley Quinn-esque murderer. Especially since the Entity is such a static, unphysical villain, it's a stroke of genius to cast Klementieff as a human fighting like she's made of knives.

Still, the star is Mr. Cruise himself. It may not surprise you that what drives the excitement for Dead Reckoning Part Two isn't how they'll stop the Entity from controlling the world—but how Tom Cruise will top himself yet again. Maybe he needs to know how long he can breathe in space? Or Cruise wants to parachute into a volcano? Hell, I'd like to see him drive a car straight up the Empire State Building. Either way, he'll continue sparring with the Entity. Our 61-year-old hero is clearly on a mission to look at this digital god in the eye and ask, ""What else do you have for me?!"" Of course, we're often asking the same of Cruise—and he delivers time and time again.

2023-07-03 20:30:00+00:00,Tom Cruise Showcases Cartier and Vacheron Constantin Watches While Promoting the New ‘Mission: Impossible’,Tom Cruise has worn two watches—a Cartier Santos and a Vacheron Constantin Overseas Perpetual Calendar—while promoting 'Mission: Impossible 7.',"After four decades in the spotlight, Tom Cruise knows that newer isn’t always better.

Just look at the star’s left wrist during the international press tour for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. He could probably get ahold of one of the year’s hottest watches, like the IWC Ingenieur, if he wanted to, but he’s instead opted to wear two old favorites—a Cartier Santos de Cartier and a Vacheron Constantin Overseas Perpetual Calendar Ultra-Thin.

Cruise wore the first of the two watches while promoting his seventh turn as Ethan Hunt in Seoul last Thursday. The rectangular-shaped Santos was designed at the behest of pilot Alberto Santos-Dumont during the first decade of the 20th century. It has a 39.8 mm rectangular case made from stainless steel that houses a silvered opaline dial with Roman numerals, a date window at 6 o’clock and blue sword-shaped hands. The water-resistant timepiece comes with a matching bracelet and is powered by the calibre 1847 MC automatic winding movement. It’s available now directly from the jeweler for $7,750.

Three days later, while appearing at a press event in Sydney, Cruise went with his Overseas Perpetual Calendar. The sports watch is a descendant of the legendary Ref. 222 and has a 41.5 mm case made of 18-karat white gold that is just 8.1 mm thick and connected to an integrated bracelet made from the same material. Underneath its crystal, you’ll find a blue sunburst dial with a moon-phase complication at 6 o’clock, along with three sub-dials. It’s powered by the caliber 1120 which keeps its sub-dials accurate for up to 78 years. It’s pricier, though, with the watchmaker asking $102,000 for the model.

WATCH

If you paid attention to the publicity blitz for Top Gun: Maverick last year both watches should look familiar. Cruise showed off the Overseas’s remarkable versatility when he paired it with a tuxedo at the Cannes Film Festival. He could also be seen wearing the Santos at an event for fans in Seoul a month later.

Of course, Cruise’s latest press tour is just getting started, so there is plenty of time for him to wear other watches before the film hits theaters on Wednesday, Julye 12. There’s also the press tour for Dead Reckoning Part Two, which will open next June, to think about as well.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3JvYmJyZXBvcnQuY29tL3N0eWxlL3dhdGNoLWNvbGxlY3Rvci90b20tY3J1aXNlLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy13YXRjaGVzLWNhcnRpZXItdmFjaGVyb24tY29uc3RhbnRpbi0xMjM0ODYzNzc1L9IBjQFodHRwczovL3JvYmJyZXBvcnQuY29tL3N0eWxlL3dhdGNoLWNvbGxlY3Rvci90b20tY3J1aXNlLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy13YXRjaGVzLWNhcnRpZXItdmFjaGVyb24tY29uc3RhbnRpbi0xMjM0ODYzNzc1L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-21 14:18:22+00:00,The ‘Impossible’ spirituality of Tom Cruise,"While best known for his more galactic approach to spirituality, Cruise is a baptized Catholic and attended the seminary for a year.","“Your mission, should you choose to accept it.”

These are words that separate the “Mission: Impossible” series from every other spy franchise. It’s not the masks, it’s not the theme song, it’s not even the thrilling complicity of watching Tom Cruise risk his life for our entertainment. It’s that every installment begins not with an assignment, but a moral decision.

When James Bond is called into action, he’s yanked from whatever casino he’s wasting taxpayer dollars at and shuffled into M’s office, where he harasses the secretary before getting his mission. That’s the distinction; James Bond is forced to save the world while “Mission: Impossible’s” Ethan Hunt desires it.

Cruise, star of the recently released blockbuster and grammatical rollercoaster “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” does not immediately jump to mind as a “moral actor” in either sense of the term. But while best known for his more galactic approach to spirituality, Cruise is a baptized Catholic and attended the seminary for a year. He thus joins the exclusive club of former seminarians such as Joseph Stalin and Levar Burton.

One ponders just how swiftly he’d have ascended the hierarchy had he stayed the course, as Cruise’s charisma could make even St. Pope John Paul II look like a damp dishrag. Two of Tom’s ex-wives have also returned to Catholicism following their divorces. One soul lost to two gained is still a net profit in the ledger, right?

But if Cruise’s Scientology dominates his personal life, those Catholic roots seem to be harder to uproot in the “Mission: Impossible” films.

The franchise is littered with Christian references. In the first film, Hunt finds the answer to the mystery in a Gideon Bible (albeit on the inside flap rather than in the Gospels). In the third film, he infiltrates the Vatican in priestly garb, giving us a brief visual snippet of that road untraveled.

But starting with “Ghost Protocol,” the fourth in the series, the Hunt character begins to evolve. Having romantic entanglements in the previous three films, he is now conspicuously single. Whenever he crosses paths with a bodacious babe — not an infrequent occurrence in the world of espionage — he’s rather chaste in their interactions. Rogue MI6 agent Ilsa Faust spends three movies batting her eyelashes just to earn a side hug.

The little we see of Hunt in his free time has him living in a safehouse where a military cot is its least spartan feature. He reminds us of a monastic type, with saving the world as his charism. It is reflected in his ethos. In “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” Ethan refuses to sacrifice his friend’s life to secure enriched uranium, risking nuclear war. His superiors chastise him for missing the bigger picture, for what man leaves a hundred sheep alone to save but one?

“Dead Reckoning” takes the leap from subtext to text, becoming explicitly theological in its aims. The main villain is a rogue AI called the Entity, which after easily hacking into the world’s financial and military institutions turns its attention to protecting its own existence. It identifies only two possible threats: a cruciform key with its original source code embedded inside, and agent Hunt. Both governments and criminals are frightened of the Entity, seeking the key to control or serve it. The Entity singles out Ethan because he’s the only one who wants to destroy it, or perhaps the only one who thinks it possible.

The Entity has human help in the form of Gabriel, a shadowy figure from Hunt’s past. In the opening flashback we see Gabriel shoot a woman named Maria, who then dies in Hunt’s arms. It’s the Antichrist’s take on the Annunciation, where instead of God’s emissary sharing the good news with Mary, he brings death instead. This Gabriel is sincere in his faith to this anti-god, but it’s service at the expense of others, reigning in hell rather than serving in heaven.

“I will kill you and your god,” Hunt snarls at one point, sounding like St. Boniface approaching the pagan tree with an ax in hand. This is more than merely saving the world; it’s a holy war.

The cruciform key is seized by a thief named Grace (Haley Atwell), which means our hero and his team need grace if they are to find the cross (there is no Oscar for subtlety). Grace needs grace of her own, seeking a way to leave her own sinful past behind her. She wishes to simply have her criminal record erased, but Hunt refuses. Forgiveness without repentance is just putting a bandage on gangrene. He instead makes a more interesting offer: join the team.

The IMF (Impossible Missions Force) is apparently full of former criminals given the chance to earn their penance one mission at a time. This isn’t a penal battalion by any means, all are there willingly. After all, it’s only your mission if you choose to accept. One team member who strayed and came back, the same man Hunt risked the world for, puts it concisely: “freedom isn’t always free.” Theirs is a community brought together by a common mission, helping one another achieve salvation through good works and faith in their higher calling. Sounds almost familiar.

Grace, of course, runs away from this opportunity every chance she can, but then who among us hasn’t? In another thwarted pitch, Hunt promises hard work and low pay. But he makes one final offer: “I will always value your life over mine.”

“You don’t even know me,” counters Grace.

“Why should that matter?”

Tom Cruise could have been pope in another life, but here he becomes Jesus. Blasphemous?

Cruise was asked about the currently untitled film at the premiere for Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One, and revealed that he still wanted to partake in the space walk for the shoot.

“We’ve been working on it diligently and we’ll see where we go,” he said (via Variety), before confirming that the film was yet to have a production date. Doug Liman, who worked with Cruise on Edge of Tomorrow, is currently slated to direct the film.

Whilst Cruise will set foot into the next frontier for that film, the star undertook numerous stunts for the seventh film in the M:I franchise, opening to rave reviews and solid box office takings.

Ahead of the film’s release, co-star Hayley Atwell spoke exclusively with Digital Spy, and revealed she wanted to film some stunts alongside Cruise.

“You don't come in as the leading lady opposite Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible if you don't want to do your own stunts or you're like, 'I'm going to sit this one out.' He'll be like, 'What? But you can do it,’” she explained.

“We had this expert team of stuntmen and women who oversaw all my training, so it meant I was fit for purpose. It meant on any given day, my physical behaviour and what I'd built up to physically be able to do was dynamic - it was safe enough so I could change elements of the performance so I could make her seem more reckless or more full of self-doubt.

“Part of the reason why the fearlessness came in was because Tom is so prepared and disciplined and will drill every physical move he needs to make, knowing where the obstacles are, double-checking the harness and such,” she added.

2023-07-07 21:49:20+00:00,Simon Pegg Says Tom Cruise Stunts a 'Terrifying Experience',"""No one ever thinks about the people that have to stand by and watch him do this stuff,"" Pegg told TheWrap about watching Tom Cruise's stunt.","Audiences have seen Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt do all manner of death-defying stunts while filming the various installments of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise. In Cruise’s latest, “Dead Reckoning Part One” the actor’s biggest stunt involves him motorcycling off a cliff before parachuting into a chasm onto a moving train. To say it’s overwhelming to watch is an understatement.

For actor Simon Pegg, who has played Hunt’s go-to tech man Benji for five films now, the fear for the actor never goes away. “No one ever thinks about the people that have to stand by and watch him do this stuff,” Pegg told TheWrap.

Because, by this point, the “Mission: Impossible” team has bonded as a family and, for the actor, watching Cruise do all manner of dangerous things stresses out cast members who are witnessing their friend take the plunge. “This is my fifth film and I’ve seen Tom do a lot of stunts,” Pegg said. “Every single time it’s a terrifying experience for us watching, as his friends.”

But there’s no stopping now, according to Pegg, because the franchise (and Cruise, specifically) aren’t content to rest on their laurels. The goal is to always take things one step further. And before you go to label Cruise as insane for doing all the things he’s done, Pegg disagrees. “He trains hard. He’s committed. He’s not crazy,” Pegg said. “People say, ‘Oh, he’s crazy.’ He’s not crazy. He is the opposite of crazy. He is the most diligent and careful guy. He makes sure everything’s safe because it’s not just his safety he’s dealing with. Other people are involved in this.”

It never alleviates the fear, though. “There are so many variables that can happen on the day,” said Pegg. “And in those moments when we’re waiting to hear the radio or his chute opening, or whatever. It can be absolutely terrifying.”

2023-07-14 17:08:30+00:00,"The story behind Barbenheimer, the summer’s most online movie showdown","The very online showdown between Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” all started with a date: July 21. It’s not uncommon for studios to counterprogram films in different genres on a big weekend, but the stark differences between an intense, serious-minded picture about the man who oversaw the development of the atomic bomb and […]","The very online showdown between Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” all started with a date: July 21.

It’s not uncommon for studios to counterprogram films in different genres on a big weekend, but the stark differences between an intense, serious-minded picture about the man who oversaw the development of the atomic bomb and a lighthearted, candy-colored anthropomorphizing of a childhood doll quickly became the stuff of viral fodder.

There’s even some disagreement over whether it’s “Barbieheimer” or “Barbenheimer” or “Boppenheimer” or yet another tortured portmanteau — a phenomenon on which the AP Stylebook has yet to offer guidance, but for the purposes of this article will be “Barbenheimer.”

It didn’t hurt that both Nolan and Gerwig have very passionate and very online fandoms eager to join in. Never mind that many of those fans overlap — the memes, allegiances, and T-shirts were just too fun.

Both movies often trend on social media when the other releases a new asset — a trailer, a picture, an interview. On one level, it’s a marketing department’s dream. Awareness could not be higher, the conversation couldn’t be louder, and neither film even has official reviews out yet.

“’Barbenheimer’ is a marketing gift borne out of social media and I think it’s benefiting both films,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for analytics firm Comscore. “You’re certainly aware of both movies in a more profound and compelling way than I think might have otherwise happened had they been released on different weekends.”

AMC Theaters reported that 20,000 of its AMC Stubs members had purchased tickets for a double feature. If you’re counting, that’s 294 minutes of moviewatching. Even Margot Robbie — Barbie herself — and Tom Cruise, the star of another summer blockbuster, have started plotting the ideal “Barbenheimer” day.

“It’s a perfect double bill,” said Robbie at her movie’s London premiere Wednesday. “I think actually start your day with ‘Barbie,’ then go straight into ‘Oppenheimer’ and then a ‘Barbie’ chaser.”

Cruise — whose “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” opened a little over a week before the “Barbenheimer” showdown — said at his premiere he’d plan to see both on their opening day, likely starting with “Oppenheimer,” which seems to be the internet’s preferred viewing order as well.

“Barbie” actor Issa Rae thinks there’s a reason for that.

“I think that there’s a very specific order that if you see them in. If you see ‘Oppenheimer’ last then you might be a bit of a psychopath,” she diagnosed at the London premiere.

The showdown has made armchair marketing experts out of everyone, quick to scrutinize every move by Warner Bros. and Universal — as though it’s possible to compare two extraordinarily different campaigns.

One has infinite opportunities for very pink, sparkly photo opportunities, whimsical brand partnerships for seemingly everything from underwear to pool floats, large-scale fan events with autograph signings and pop stars like Billie Eilish posting about the soundtrack. In other words, the “Barbie” campaign can go nuclear.

“Oppenheimer” has the bomb, the alluring mystery and the big screen hook, but it’s not the kind of movie that lends itself to, say, a frozen yogurt collaboration.

Is the competition real, though, or just a meme? Some in Hollywood wondered if Warner Bros. plopped “Barbie” on the weekend as a slight to Nolan, who had opened many films for the studio in that corridor including “Inception” and “Dunkirk.” He left Warner Bros. amid its controversial decision to send a year’s worth of movies to streaming and made “Oppenheimer” with Universal instead. But a pointed box office war doesn’t exactly make sense for a studio that has talked recently about wanting to lure Nolan back.

There is an unspoken code of conduct: Never badmouth another studio’s film, publicly at least. This is partly decorum, especially when it comes to “box office showdowns” which all will say are a creation of the press and sideline spectators. But it’s also rooted in some truth: The conventional thinking is that having eyes on one movie is good for other movies — you see their posters and trailers and on some level everyone benefits.

And social media has allowed movie stars to get in on the game, too. Following reports that Cruise was irked the latest “Mission: Impossible” was going to lose its IMAX screens to “Oppenheimer” after only a week, Cruise posted photos of himself and director Christopher McQuarrie standing in front of posters for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” holding tickets for each.

“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters. These are just a few that we can’t wait to see on the big screen,” Cruise’s Instagram caption read.

The official accounts for “Indiana Jones,” “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” responded with supportive notes. Gerwig and Robbie even followed with a similar photo series a few days later, which the official “Oppenheimer” Instagram account reposted in its stories. Charged with playing Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy told the AP at his movie’s London premiere that “of course” he’d be seeing “Barbie.” The sporting cross-promotion between four studios — Universal, Warner Bros., Disney and Paramount — is something the film business has not quite seen before.

“Not only is Tom Cruise the biggest box office star in the world, but he’s also an incredible ambassador for the movie theater, for the movie theater experience and boosting other movies,” Dergarabedian said. “And that collegial atmosphere within the framework of what is seen as the very competitive box office derby is kind of a nice thing.”

Still, everyone likes a No. 1 debut, and both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” reportedly carry $100 million production price tags (not including the millions spent on marketing). As far as box office tracking goes, “Barbie” has it in the bag with forecasts showing that it could open above $90 million in North America. “Oppenheimer” meanwhile is tracking in the $40 million range. Then there’s the wild card of “Mission: Impossible 7’s” second weekend, which could snag second place.

Still even with a second- or third-place start, “Oppenheimer” could be destined for a long, steady, profitable run into awards season. Adult audiences for R-rated movies are not often the ones who pack theaters the first weekend.

Back in 2008, in the midst of the recession, Warner Bros. and Universal faced off on the same July weekend with another Nolan film that went up against a lighthearted confection: “The Dark Knight” and “Mamma Mia!” — both of which went on to be enormously profitable (though Nolan did win the first weekend).

The bigger worry is that what’s been heralded as Hollywood’s post-pandemic comeback summer has had more ups and downs than anyone might have hoped. That’s putting quite a bit of pressure on “Barbenheimer” to overperform and boost the lagging summer box office, which pales in comparison to the bigger issues facing the industry as actors join the writers on strike.

But with just over a week to go, it’s still a source of amusement. Even “Barbie” co-star Will Ferrell threw the gauntlet in his winking way at the London premiere.

“I think the world maybe wants to see ‘Barbie’ a little bit more right now,” Ferrell said. “Just saying!”

2023-07-14 18:00:44+00:00,Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning's Shea Whigham On Chasing Ethan Hunt And Paying Homage [Exclusive Interview],'I can't wait to get back on the floor with McQ and Tom and the rest of the gang.',"I do feel like, watching the movie, there's something between Briggs and Hunt that's left up in the air. Degas (Greg Tarzan Davis) has that line to your character about this being personal between you and Hunt. Was there any previous version of this movie where that was made more explicit, that you do have some sort of backstory with Hunt?
In true ""Mission"" fashion, I'm not at liberty to say [laughs]. But I'm sure that — yes, yes. Yes.
With your character, how much exactly did he change over the development of this movie? I'm sure, like you mentioned, aspects were cut or shifted over to ""Part Two,"" that sort of thing. How much exactly did he evolve?
Yeah. If you've seen my work, I love the process of finding a character. I love that more than the actual shooting. Or when I was doing plays, I loved the rehearsal process and the discovery. So for me to find — I don't know how much I'm giving away if I say certain things, but when we're entering the party in Venice and how I enter the party, or what I do to the guys that I think might be Ethan in the first act of the piece, those kind of things just popped up. And then it starts to carry itself through the whole film. Hopefully it's not just for a laugh. I have to still play it serious, even though there's a lot of levity. So for that, yeah, it was ever-evolving, man. That's what kept me interested in Briggs.
As an actor, how do you handle that process of not having everything in a script prepared beforehand? You can't learn your lines weeks ahead of time, you're sort of on the fly with these movies.
I love having the script and letting it get in the bones, really marinate. Because then, what you don't want to do is try to force something on it. So if you have something ahead of time, you can ruminate on it, let it live in you. Sometimes you're getting up in the middle of the night and something comes to you. But I will say, we were on this long enough that I had time. Those things just, they came to me. When I tell my boss, when I tell Henry [Czerny] at the end of the piece ... you start to know your characters and you can't force that. If you force it or try to be funny or wink at the camera, it doesn't work.
I don't mean literally wink the camera. I mean, you just don't want to get caught. You never want to see the actor working. You know what I mean, Jeremy? You never want to see me working really hard to try to be funny or try to be serious or try to be — but I really enjoy it. I can't wait to get back on the floor with McQ and Tom and the rest of the gang. It's a talented bunch, man.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTMzODgxNy9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctc2hlYS13aGlnaGFtLWV4Y2x1c2l2ZS1pbnRlcnZpZXcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-06 13:00:26+00:00,"Chris McQuarrie opens up on Dead Reckoning: ""I’m more frightened now than I was on my first Mission: Impossible""",An interview with Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One director Chris McQuarrie,"Christopher McQuarrie didn’t want to make movies anymore. After taking up producing and writing duties on the Tom Cruise-starring Valkyrie in 2008, the director admitted to being frustrated with ""taking a lot of meetings"" and not making movies.
""I was fully confident every day was my last day on the job,"" McQuarrie tells GamesRadar+ and Total Film. ""I was waiting for them to figure out that I didn’t know how to produce movies. I had never produced one before. I was waiting to be fired – and wouldn’t blame them for doing so.""
Fast forward 15 years and McQuarrie is Hollywood’s premiere action director. Dead Reckoning Parts One and Two will mark his third and fourth Mission: Impossible movies – and the continuation of a Midas-like relationship with his leading man Tom Cruise.
It’s an impossible turnaround that would make Ethan Hunt – Cruise’s IMF agent, who regularly risks life and limb for the greater good – blush.
Ahead of McQuarrie is the biggest Mission yet. Encompassing multiple continents, hundreds of crew members, and a motorbike drop over a ravine that McQuarrie previously called ""the most dangerous thing"" he’s ever filmed – it’s a project that’s too big for just one movie.
""Instead of fighting the running time, I said let’s just cut the movie in half and give ourselves the breathing room to tell that story – not anticipating, then, that Part One would expand to the size that it did, the epic scale that it did,"" McQuarrie reveals. ""I was hoping to make a four-hour epic and just cut it in half and everybody could have a two-hour movie, but here we are.""
McQuarrie, though, isn’t resting on his laurels for the two-parter. While he is acutely aware of the cliffhanger trend permeating Hollywood (Across the Spider-Verse and Fast X both left fans with unanswered questions earlier this year), he’s keen to point out there’s no sense of complacency on his part in ensuring audiences return for Dead Reckoning Part Two.
""If [the other two-parters] do [trust them to come back], I envy them. I don’t. I saw that trend and the first instinct is [for us] not to do that because it’s happening,"" McQuarrie says.
Again, McQuarrie returned to the freedom of no longer having to fight an increasingly longer runtime: ""I don’t want to be sitting here cutting things out of the movie because it’s too long. I want to be cutting things out of the movie because they can go. I don’t want to be struggling with the number of screenings per day. I don’t know what the rationale is for the other movies that were doing it, but that was mine.""
Pushing the envelope

With a franchise such as Mission: Impossible, however, there runs the risk of diminishing returns with its big set-pieces. In truth, it’s a trend that Cruise, especially, has warded off in emphatic fashion.
How do you top that breathless wire sequence from the first movie? You hold on to a plane while it takes off. But then how do you top that? You skydive from 25,000 feet. While Cruise’s stunt exploits (rightfully) grab attention, it’s McQuarrie – and the world-class stunt team and crew – who have to put the pieces together. Despite making over a half-dozen films, it’s clear the Mission: Impossible team isn’t running out of ideas – or steam.
""It’s always a process of elimination,"" McQuarrie explains. ""The more movies there are, the more you come up with solutions that are: 'You can’t do that, they did that in this one or that one'.""
He continues: ""At the same time, we don’t get so religious about it like 'Ah, you can’t have a train sequence because there was a train sequence in [the first] Mission: Impossible.' What we try to do is apply everything we’ve learned from the previous movies to the movies we’re doing now and the movies we’re doing next. It tends to be a more refined process. The scenario boils down to this: what an audience wants in a big tentpole movie like this is exactly what they expect in a way they never see coming.""
But it’s not all action and bombast. McQuarrie is using the extra space to dive deeper into Ethan’s motivations this time around. That’s through not only expanding on the work done in previous movies, but bringing in elements from both Hunt and Cruise’s past into the present. Henry Czerny’s Kittridge returns for the first time since the very first Mission: Impossible, while Esai Morales – who plays villain Gabriel – is someone who has known Cruise since the ""very beginning of his career.""
""In Fallout, we reached into his inner world a little more than we had in Ghost Protocol and found there was more to explore. [Here] we reached deeper still, in bringing back Henry Czerny and Esai Morales coming in. A door was opening into Ethan’s past and we started exploring how we could tell that story and how you could tell it in the present – rather than delving back into the past.”
""I don't want to let the franchise down""
(Image credit: Paramount)
It’s clear from talking to McQuarrie that an urgent anxiety exists: he doesn’t see Dead Reckoning as a surefire success – in an industry that desperately needs one. Instead, it’s the lessons he’s learned from Valkyrie that he carries with him to ensure he keeps delivering action classics.
""I’ve maintained that attitude ever since. I don’t take my position for granted. I don’t take the audience’s participation for granted,"" McQuarrie says. ""When we were making Top Gun: Maverick, I didn’t take for granted that people loved that movie or that it was a 35-year-old cultural institution. I looked at it with a very suspicious and cynical eye towards Hollywood’s tendency to make it a cash grab.
""So, everything I do is to constantly check myself and remind myself that it does not matter what you did before, this is the one you’re doing now. I’m terrified of the result of Dead Reckoning, which lives in the shadow of Fallout, which lives in the shadow of Rogue [Nation], and Ghost [Protocol], and all the other movies that came before it. I don’t want to let the franchise down. I’m more frightened now than I was on my first Mission.""

2023-07-07 09:08:37+00:00,Q&A: Christopher McQuarrie on directing ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning’,"McQuarrie shares how he sets out to make not just the greatest mission yet, but a cinematic experience unlike any other with Tom Cruise at the helm","McQuarrie shares how he sets out to make not just the greatest mission yet, but a cinematic experience unlike any other with Tom Cruise at the helm
MANILA, Philippines – Christopher McQuarrie, affectionately known to his cast as McQ, has been at the helm of the Mission: Impossible series since Rogue Nation.
With that film and its follow-up, Fallout, he changed the course of the franchise. Where the first four films were each guided by a different visionary director with a revolving cast of IMF agents, McQuarrie now homed in on a close team – Ethan, Benji, Ilsa, and Luther. The story built around these four has led to Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, where the stakes are both global and intensely personal.
The story of Dead Reckoning is so big, in fact, that it is made up of two parts. (Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two arrives in 2024.) Following Ethan Hunt as his past comes back to haunt him and all those he loves are put at risk, it’s an adventure that travels across the world, from Abu Dhabi to Rome to Venice to Norway. In collaboration with Tom Cruise, McQuarrie set out to make not just the greatest mission yet, but a cinematic experience unlike any other.
The following interview is courtesy of Paramount Pictures.
Q: You’ve already directed two Mission: Impossible movies. What made you decide that your next was going to be a two-parter?
“When we made Fallout, we were building on lessons we had learned from Rogue Nation, in terms of the character dynamics and story. We’ve had real success with the relationship between Ethan and Ilsa and we discovered there was as much to be mined from the characters as there was from the action. We pushed that in Fallout and ended up with a longer movie, simply because we weren’t going to skimp on the action.

“Going into these movies, I said, ‘If I’m going to do it yet again, I want to expand on that further. I want to go deeper into Ethan’s character and deeper into the characters around him’, which we knew would generate a bigger story. So then it was, ‘Let’s not kid ourselves and try to jam all of that into two hours 20 minutes, where we’re always feeling the pressure to deliver a tighter movie. Let’s just make the bigger movie and cut it in half and give ourselves the breathing room to do it justice.’ I always like to say that Mission has a mind of its own. We almost felt the franchise wanting to spread its wings and fly, wanting to grow into something even bigger. And it certainly has.”
Q: How do you tell a two-part story but make both movies feel complete in their own right?
“We really just stuck to the rule that we’ve written for ourselves on Mission: Impossible, which is that every movie has to stand alone. You can’t ask the audience to leave one movie, mentally, and try to remember another. To us, that breaks the spell. So, Part One had to work all by itself, as a complete movie with a satisfying ending. It needed to end in such a way that if there was no Part Two, you would be okay. At the same time, it needed to leave you wanting a continuation to that adventure. And then Part Two had to stand on its own, whether or not you had seen Part One. That was it. Those were the rules, to make them self-contained. Tom and I are focused entirely on an immersive experience for the audience. We don’t want you doing the work. We want you having an emotional ride and then think about it after, not during the movie.”
Q: You’ve said that you want this film to feel “adventuresome.” What do you mean by that?
“The challenge with these movies, for every director that comes on board – in my case, four times now – is that you have to expand and build upon what’s come before you, but you have to hold onto that original DNA. I knew when we were going into a two-part installment that we were going to have to justify a two-part saga. That meant that you needed that spirit of adventure. It felt like the obvious ingredient that you needed, to justify the size.

“Across these two movies, you’ll feel their world constantly expanding and you’ll go places the franchise has never been, to parts of the world you’ve never seen this way. And, frankly, some of them won’t exist for much longer. It really has been, both in the making of the film and in the narrative itself, quite an adventure. We’ve truly taken this one to the edge of the world.”
Q: Tell us about Gabriel, the villain of the piece. What makes him such a great adversary for Ethan?
“Gabriel is a character from deep in Ethan’s past, from before Ethan was the Ethan Hunt we know. And he represents something that is far and away the biggest, most insurmountable threat Ethan has faced. The stakes are as global as stakes can get. But the stakes between Gabriel and Ethan are also distinctly personal. They know each other from long, long ago with a shared event in their past that has made both of them who they are.”
Q: Tom has said that you and he were both train geeks as kids. Is that where the train sequence came from?
“Basically, we love David Lean, Buster Keaton, and John Frankenheimer. All of them at one stage or another filmed some sort of spectacular train wreck. I really wanted to apply all the franchise has taught me toward wrecking a train. That was pretty much it. Of course, on Mission, everything tends to expand. For other movies a train wreck would be a climactic event. In this case the actual train wreck is merely the inciting incident of the climax.”
Q: The huge motorbike jump is the biggest stunt in Mission: Impossible history. That’s an enormous, dangerous feat for Tom Cruise to do. But what’s it like being the man directing him to do it?
PARACHUTE STUNT. Courtesy of Paramount Pictures
“I think Simon has told the story in Fallout, when he and Rebecca were watching Tom falling onto the payload under the helicopter. Neither of them understood what the stunt was. They had just shown up in New Zealand and they thought Tom had actually fallen. Rebecca was stunned. There were local crew who didn’t understand what the stunt was either and somebody got on the radio and said, ‘I think we just lost Tom’. That’s when you know stunts are really working, when the people making the movie think that it’s real. As for the motorbike, we were on the ragged edge. There were so many unknowns that we simply could not predict what would happen when he went off the ramp. But it’s all relative. I’ve since had far more terrifying experiences with Tom, as you’ll see.” – Rappler.com",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhcHBsZXIuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbW92aWVzL2NocmlzdG9waGVyLW1jcXVhcnJpZS1pbnRlcnZpZXctbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

The event took place on the Spanish Steps of the Italian capital, where much of the latest franchise installment takes place, and fitting because of the value Cruise places on overseas markets for his movies, saying, getting emotional as he described the “artform” and how it “bridges walls, it breaks them down and allows people to be able to share that kind of commonality and experience.”

“I’m very grateful to be here,” he said of Rome. “And to be part of this, this whole time period, had we not had the community here to say we will support you in making what we wanted to do. Because I want to make movies, I make movies for the big screen, that is what I do. I understand. There’s other areas and other platforms, I understand that I’ve studied everything up down and center, from making movies to studios to distribution. And I understand that I make movies for audiences, first and foremost, and to be able to have that kind of help.

“Believe me, every day I was dealing and working with this community of governments and the people in my crew, to make it so that we could all have this and be here today, and it would not have happened at enough in film and enough in Venice, Norway, Abu Dhabi, everyone and the whole industry to be able to support it make this happen. So this is a moment this is very exciting.”

“I brought my movies and I watched my movies with them to understand the universality of humanity, the things that bring us together,” he said. “And that’s why it’s not just a cinema experience – it is about all of us together from all walks of life, and being there together in the theater and having a common experience. And that is what cinema does. It bridges walls, it breaks them down and allows people to be able to share that kind of commonality and experience… . And I used to go meet with the students.

,10 Spoiler Facts We Learned About Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One From Christopher McQuarrie,Christopher McQuarrie sat down with Empire for an epic spoiler conversation on his latest mission with Tom Cruise. Here are some gems we learned along the way.,"Contains spoilers for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One
It’s finally here. No, not just Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One – though its arrival once again confirms that Tom Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie are an absolute force to be reckoned with when delivering breath-taking cinematic spectacle. No, the completion of (part one of) another Mission also means another dizzying deep-dive into the dramatic making of a Hollywood blockbuster like no other on the Empire Spoiler Special Podcast. Following in the footsteps of Fallout and Rogue Nation, McQuarrie – or, McQ – sat down with Empire’s Chris Hewitt for a lengthy, no-holds-barred, spoiler-filled conversation about his experiences of making Dead Reckoning Part One – from its lengthy production through COVID, to its narrative twists and turns, astonishing action sequences, and excised material.
The first part of that epic (and ongoing) spoiler conversation has now dropped on the Spoiler Special Podcast feed – a three-and-a-half-hour exploration of Ethan Hunt’s latest thunderous IMF mission. And believe us, this is only the beginning. There are hundreds of gems to be found in this instalment alone – be sure to listen to the full episode for a deeply incisive, honest, in-depth conversation. And here you’ll find just a smattering of the diamonds McQuarrie dropped along the way – delve into 10 fascinating facts from that first part here.
1) The actors ‘risked their lives’ for a sequence that was cut from the film
One of the most astonishing things about McQuarrie’s Mission movies is that, for all the incredible stuff you see on screen, you know that there was equally impressive stuff that hit the cutting room floor. Take, for instance, an entire sequence from the thunderous steam-train finale that was edited out. “It was supposed to be something we did with a resettable rig where everything could be very predictable, and nothing we did worked, and ultimately the actors had to risk their lives and do it practically,” McQ explains.
But when test notes came back with feedback on the pace and length of the movie, it had to go. “The train was a little bit like the car chase in Jack Reacher, where we couldn’t understand why we kept getting this note about length,” he says. “Finally, there was one shot in the Jack Reacher chase I pulled out, and it taught me everything about shooting action.” He had a sense a similar thing was affecting Dead Reckoning Part One’s finale. “With the train, I kept thinking, ‘Is this the shot?’ And we kept pulling and we kept getting the note, and eventually we identified what it was.” It was a shame to lose it, though. “The work that went into what was holding back the sequence was extraordinary – it was days, and it was a struggle, and it was very, very risky,” he says. “We took it out, and the scene just sang.”
2) The flashback Marie could have been a de-aged Julia Roberts
A key sequence in Dead Reckoning Part One has Ethan looking back to his own past, before the first Mission: Impossible film – in which Esai Morales’ villain Gabriel kills Ethan’s partner Marie. The role (originally due to be a bigger part of Part One, and set to be expanded in Part Two) went to Mariela Garriga. But, given the time-period there were thoughts of casting a de-aged actor appropriate to the late-‘80s, early-‘90s time period. “We started thinking, ‘What would it look like if Tony Scott had shot this, and who would it have been? Who was the ingénue, who was the breakout star in 1989?’,” recalls McQ. “And right around then was Mystic Pizza, and I was like, ‘Oh my god, Julia Roberts – a then pre-Pretty Woman Julia Roberts.” Ultimately, it didn’t come to pass – not only because of the expense (and distraction) of de-ageing everybody for the scene, but because McQ would have “to somehow convince Julia Roberts to come in and be this small role at the beginning of this story”.
3) Young Ethan Hunt’s file photo is Mission: Impossible-era Cruise with Days Of Thunder hair
Speaking of Ethan’s past, this time we see the picture in his IMF folder, hinting at some kind of troubled history that he’s been working to erase. And the image of the young Hunt was a simple combination of two historic Tom Cruise eras. “It just so happens Tom has one sensational photo of him looking directly at the camera and that happens to be in his dossier in Mission: Impossible,” says McQuarrie. It needed some tweaks, though, to fit the 1989 time period. “I had found a picture of Tom from Days Of Thunder, with that hair. And we took his Days Of Thunder hair and stuck it on his Mission: Impossible dossier photo, put some vertical lines behind it and created it in about 15 minutes. We made young Ethan Hunt without any kind of de-aging or special effects or anything else.” Mission complete.
4) McQ fixed the movie after a ‘brutal’ post-screening email
As ever, test screenings and bits of feedback from filmmaker friends were a vital part of bringing Dead Reckoning Part One together – with the likes of Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, and Alfonso Cuaron offering notes. And one bit of feedback, from a friend of editor Eddie Hamilton, was especially helpful for not holding back. “He wrote the most brutal email I've ever read – not hostile, but just both barrels right to the chin, things that were not working for him in the movie, things that were really bugging him, and that he was not a big franchise action movie guy to begin with. He was not a huge fan of Mission: Impossible,” explains McQ. “And I woke up that morning and read this email and just wanted to vomit. It was so brutal.” As it turned out, it was exactly what the filmmaker needed to hear – and led to the removal of scenes, some involving Marie, that were holding the film back. “It just forced me to look at things through another person's eyes, which is really what the value of testing is,” he says. As for Eddie’s friend? He got his credit. “He's in the special thanks.”
5) Tom Cruise decided where the title sequence should drop
There’s a specific thrill when a film drops its title sequence surprisingly late into the runtime – almost at the point you’d assumed it wouldn’t even have any opening credits. Dead Reckoning Part One holds out 28 minutes before running that iconic theme music, as decreed by Cruise – who knew exactly when the sequence would work best.
It felt odd coming straight from the submarine opener, and played a bit subdued when positioned after the desert shootout too. “You went into the credits with a very down note,” says McQ. “[Tom] just said, ‘The credits are in the wrong place’. He looked at the whole first act and said, ‘The first act is great, it’s the best it’s ever been, you’ve fixed all those issues. But the credits are in the wrong place – they’ve got to go after the scene with Kittridge.’” As skeptical as McQuarrie was, when he tried it the filmmaker agreed with Cruise that it was “just the right place” for them to be. “So they go 28 minutes into the movie – who cares! It’s the right vibe. You go into the credits with a win. He was right.”
6) McQ and Cruise lived together while shooting during COVID
How’s this for a sitcom set-up: one of the biggest movie stars in the world and his long-time director, holed up together while shooting a behemoth action blockbuster. While you can imagine the laugh-track and slap-bass now, that’s exactly the position Cruise and McQuarrie found themselves in here, thanks to the intervention of COVID. “We’d wake up in the morning, we'd meet in the living room for breakfast, we'd talk about the movie, we would drive to work in the car together, we’d work all day, we’d drive back to the apartment together at the end of the night. And that was our life.” It’s the material the 22-minute network formula was made for.
7) Tom Cruise was adamant not to end Part One on a cliffhanger
Dead Reckoning is one of several summer movies in 2023 that’s actually just ‘Part One’ of a bigger story – see also Across The Spider-Verse, and Fast X. And while there’s plenty more story to come in Part Two of Mission, it was Cruise who was particularly adamant that this film have its own ending. “Tom was fixated day and night on the ending of the movie,” says McQuarrie. “He had great anxiety about the end of the film – that the end of a ‘Part One’ was going to be a cliffhanger, and that cliffhangers by their very nature tend to be deeply, deeply unsatisfying. You feel like the camera just stopped and you're not there. You're not given that release. ‘I have to wait a year? I have to wait two years, for whatever that release is?’” Cue the reveal that Ethan has the key (Mission: Accomplished!), and that Part Two will be all about heading to the very thing it unlocks. “He said, ‘We gotta give them that sense of completion, and yet the story has to feel like it needs a place to go.’”
8) The title Dead Reckoning didn’t arrive until after Part Two had started shooting
One of the benefits, though, of having a Part Two? It gave them time to, er, come up with the title of the film. It wasn’t until work began on the next film that Dead Reckoning emerged as the title for Ethan’s latest mission. “Somewhere along the line, the title of this movie – which did not exist until we were in Africa shooting Part Two – became both fitting for the story, and the making of the story itself,” muses McQuarrie. “We were quite literally navigating via dead reckoning for most of the production, it's the most aptly named [movie].”
9) Tom Cruise is basically like Gromit in The Wrong Trousers
You wouldn’t necessarily expect to compare Tom Cruise – the most American of all-American action stars – to Aardman’s Lancashire legends Wallace and Gromit. And yet, the process of making a Mission movie – where the action literally comes first, and the rest of the film is built around it, with Ethan’s arc coming into place right at the very end – brings to mind an iconic scene from The Wrong Trousers. “[Tom] is a train in front of which you must lay track,” McQ explains. “There's that little GIF of Wallace And Gromit, and Gromit is putting the track in front of the train. That's very much what making Mission: Impossible is.” Did he watch a version of The Wrong Trousers where the train crashes down a ravine?
10) Cruise and McQ are still working on ‘The Gnarly Movie’
Back in 2020, in an interview looking back on Jack Reacher, McQuarrie told Empire that he and Cruise had been looking to make a hard-R movie together with “a very un-Tom character” in it. And while the two-part Mission has taken precedent, they’re still planning to make that together, under the codename ‘The Gnarly Movie’. “There's a movie that Cruise and I are talking about doing next or in some probable next, that Erik [Jendresen, writer] and I developed together – what has been referred to on the internet as ‘The Gnarly Movie’,” McQ teases. “It's that movie that they're all asking for, and that we want to do.” First, they just have to get through the gnarliest movie of all: Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtcGlyZW9ubGluZS5jb20vbW92aWVzL2ZlYXR1cmVzL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1wYXJ0LW9uZS0xMC1zcG9pbGVyLWZhY3RzLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW1jcXVhcnJpZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

From hanging out of planes to scaling the world’s tallest building - the actor’s death-defying stunts get riskier with every Mission: Impossible release.

And now, ahead of the release of new film Dead Reckoning Part One on Monday, the Ethan Hunt actor has offered a peek behind his most jaw dropping stunts.
In the special interview for Sky, Tom Cruise: Impossible Missions, the Hollywood star jokes: “What’s my secret?
""I am just trying not to get it wrong.
When I first said I wanted to do Mission Impossible, there was some scepticism – it was a TV show, but a cancelled TV show.
“But there was something about being able to produce a movie where I could create a different kind of action.
""Luckily, they trusted me and here we are.”
Here, Jessica Lester looks at some of Tom’s biggest stunts as the movie daredevil and co-stars Simon Pegg and Hayley Atwell chart his maddest.
Fallout (2018), Plane Jump
Tom said: “The jump was at 25,000ft. It was all one shot. I had to pull off (my oxygen), and if I have a problem with oxygen, that’s a real problem.
""I’m travelling at a high speed – I have to move within a few inches. I am framing myself into this close up and I’m looking down.
""It was very challenging, we had about a minute every day to figure out how to do it.
""Crew was like, ‘Did we get the shot or not?’ Something like 108 jumps just to get that. You want that real shot.”

Tom said: “We wrote this scene right before we shot it; this tank blowing up, look at how much water.
""Because of the glass, (we did it) only once.
""We are getting out and a piece of glass cut my ankle while I was sprinting out.”

Tom said: ""There was a wire, a hard pull slamming me into the car.
""There was a piece of tape, and I knew when I hit that piece of tape, I got pulled. Slam!
""I was like, ‘Get rid of the tape’, beause in earlier takes I flinched.
""I’ll start running, you slam me into the car.
""Just get it over with’. It really hurt!”

Tom said: “It was so much fun the studio did NOT want me shooting this.
""I literally jumped from one cliff to the other. That was tricky. It was fun to hang off the rock.
""There wasn’t a radio where I could communicate to anyone if there was a problem so they couldn’t see it. It was awesome.”
Ghost Protocol (2011), Scaling the Burj Khalifa

Tom said: “You can’t fake this. To train for it, I built three storeys of the Burj Khalifa on a sound stage.
""They lifted the windows out, originally they only approved us taking out two windows but as it went through I said, ‘If you lift this out I can get the camera here and I can jump over the camera’.
""We ended up taking out 24 windows. Safety officers did not want us to do that.
""So we found a safety officer that would say yes.”

Tom said: “I couldn’t even keep my eyes open because of the fuel.
""Any kind of particle when you’re travelling at that speed, it can go through you.
""When I first did it, I had a rock come through and luckily it just hit my ribs.
""Had it gone up it could’ve gone through my skull. It was like, ‘What’s going to happen?’”

Tom said: “The first day of filming was this jump.

""And I’m acting too, I’m thinking about what I’m doing, I have to hold on long enough for the cameras before I let go.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay90di8yMjk3NzY3My90b20tY3J1aXNlLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1zdHVudHMv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc3VuLmNvLnVrL3R2LzIyOTc3NjczL3RvbS1jcnVpc2UtbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLXN0dW50cy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

During an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Cruise explained why he was so keen to get that particular stunt out of the way.
“Well, we know either we will continue with the film or we’re not. Let’s know day one!” he explained. “Let us know day one what is going to happen: Do we all continue or is it a major rewrite?”

The now-infamous stunt sees Tom Cruise ride a motorbike off a cliff before parachuting to safety. It was revealed by Empire Magazine to have been filmed on the production’s very first day.
“Doing that on day one gave us all the time in the world to understand why he [Ethan] was doing what he was doing,” said director, Christopher McQuarrie. “If we sat around and tried to figure out these movies the old-fashioned way, you’d never find it, simply because it’s such a living, breathing thing.”
Cruise, however, saw things a bit more practically. If they shot the stunt on day one, there was no risk of grinding the production to a halt halfway through the shoot. If Cruise was injured or killed doing the stunt deep into production, it could have cost the studio time and money to put it right.
“I was training and I was ready,” added Cruise. “You have to be razor sharp when you’re doing something like that. It was very important as we were prepping the film that it was actually the first thing. I don’t want to drop that and go shoot other things and have my mind somewhere else. Everyone was prepped. Let’s just get it done.”
Still, Cruise's Mission: Impossible co-stars also admit they worry about his big set pieces. In a separate interview, Simon Pegg explained why he fears Cruise’s increasingly reckless stunts will one day go wrong.
“There’s always a sense that, you know, one day, something might go wrong, we might lose Tom, you know,” explained Pegg. “Anytime there’s a big stunt, we all have that sense of, you know, fear, but he always pulls it off.”

2023-07-13 13:00:00+00:00,How ‘Mission: Impossible’ Fan Pom Klementieff Became ‘Insane’ Baddie – IndieWire,Interview: The game-for-anything actress told IndieWire all about building her wild new on-screen turn as the nutty Paris.,"[Editor’s note: The following interview contains light spoilers for “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.”]
Before newly minted “Mission: Impossible” star Pom Klementieff can get started chatting about her role as the franchise’s “insane” new baddie, she’s got just one teensy bit of housekeeping to attend to: she’s got to text back her co-star Simon Pegg. The long-time series star dropped her a line a few hours ago (post-New York City premiere), and she’s just suddenly remembered she never responded to it and can’t rest until she does. Talk about cast bonding.
That out of the way, the French actress is ready to talk all about her latest role in a franchise that she has literally adored since she was a kid (she was just ten when the first film came out), which allows the Marvel Cinematic Universe star to tap into some of her wildest impulses. In “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” the seventh film in the beloved action series, Klementieff stars as Paris, the unhinged sidekick of Esai Morales’ Gabriel, himself tasked with serving a much higher master (all of them are, of course, obsessed with taking out Tom Cruise’s venerable spy Ethan Hunt).
In just her first outing in the series, the game-for-anything actress leaves quite a mark, as her Paris careens around (under, through, over, etc.) various European hot spots in pursuit of Ethan Hunt and pals, barely stopping to take a breath, let alone to consider the consequences of driving over a bunch of Vespas (or people), growling her way through insane stunt sequences, and basically having the time of her damn life.
Ahead, Klementieff tells IndieWire about creating her character, if Paris really is just nuts, her favorite stunt scenes, what’s next for the franchise, and the other big summer film she can’t wait to see.
The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
IndieWire: Before you were cast in this film, what was your favorite “Mission: Impossible” film? Did you have one?
Pom Klementieff: Ooh, that’s a tough one. I mean, I love “Fallout.” I love all the ones that Christopher McQuarrie has directed, to be honest with you. I think they’re so amazing and sharp, amazing pace, amazing action.
I always have a soft spot for the first one, because it was the first one and there’s something nostalgic about it. There’s also two French actors in it, Jean Reno and Emmanuelle Béart. The third one is amazing too, and Philip Seymour Hoffman is just incredible. I miss him. I mean, I miss him in movies. I miss him. I never knew him! The second one is really fun also, all the motorcycle stuff, like with the doves. There’s something a little bit more corny about it, but still so charming and so good. I love them all.
Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, Vanessa Kirby, and Christopher McQuarrie on the set of “Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning — Part One” Christian Black
You played a big role in shaping this character, but where did it start? What were your initial meetings like before you got the part?
I had dinner with Christopher McQuarrie, it was just a first meeting. Then a few months later, I had this screen test with Tom and McQ and they told me that they’re looking for an actor and then they build the character around the conversations that they have with the actors. They cast a person and then build the character around the person, so it’s different from other movies. Usually it’s something that is written in the script and then you have to put yourself in this character.
It was a very interesting and freeing way of working, but it can be daunting too. It’s like, “Oh my God, what is it? I don’t know.” But you just trust them. They have such incredible taste and elegance and they’re such incredible filmmakers that they know. You just get to just freestyle and dance. It’s like a dance with them.
What was your intention in building her? You said in another interview she’s “completely insane,” but it’s more than that.
The main idea was to give this sense of danger and a lot of pressure against Ethan, so it translates into something that looks insane, but she really just enjoys driving over Vespas and destroying people. It was very cathartic and very fun to play as well, because sometimes you want to do that in real life, but you’re not going to do it because you don’t want to go to jail, right?
What is fun about this character too is that it can be very quiet and [then] very violent in one split second. I think what I was looking for is to bring something very unexpected, you don’t know how she’s going to react, so it’s very scary actually. At some point in the movie, I just draw a heart on the window [before a fight scene], that was also unscripted. I came up with the idea and I thought it would be interesting. “Oh, she’s going to kill someone, but actually it’s like, oh, a cute act of love, but actually she smashed his face.” It’s always look for the unexpected.
What would you say are her motivations in life? Is it just fuck stuff up?
I think there’s a lot of suffering underneath and, obviously, no therapy. I’m kidding! There’s a lot of suffering underneath and a big feeling of betrayal, there is some loneliness too. It translates into wanting to destroy everything.
What was the first scene that you shot for the film?
Oh, my God, it was such a long time ago. I think it was in Norway, so I think it was supposed to be jumping on top of the train. You just do it. You just trust the stunt coordinator, Wade Eastwood, and you just go for it. It was so much fun to get to run on top of the moving train. I would hum the [“Mission: Impossible” them] song right before the take to just give me a boost.
Pom Klementieff in “Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning — Part One” Christian Black
What was your favorite stunt to shoot?
It was amazing to do the alley-way fight with Tom. It was very intricate, very precise, and very challenging to shoot because it’s so narrow. We’re like stuck, but it was fun.
Then there was this scene, when I fight the two guys at the same time, so it was really fun to do. But it’s hard too, because it’s harder to do kicks in movies, because it’s harder to control and to not actually hit the person and to recoil and to just have the right distance to make it real, but to not actually hurt someone.
Right, because it’s easier to pull a punch.
Yeah, it’s so much easier. But that’s why usually in action movies, they do a lot of punches, because it’s so much easier. Yeah, so it’s just snap kick, but you have to have this distance and make it sharp enough and quick enough so it looks strong, but controlled still. But I love doing that, but it’s hard.
You must have gotten banged up a bit.
You always have bruises when you do movies and action movies. Sometimes when you wear harnesses too, it just digs into your body, and so it creates bruises. But it’s fun, I like to have bruises, it’s like good memories.
Most audiences in America obviously know you from your Marvel films, did your Marvel training help you prepare for this or was it a completely different animal?
Yeah, Marvel training, but also, I’ve been always training, like stunt training and fight training. Even when I was not doing the Marvel movies, just on my “time off” or whatever that means, I’m always training and learning new skills or getting better at the things that I know already. There’s always room to improve. It’s just like a lifestyle. I mean, it sounds cheesy, but it’s just, it is!
Pom Klementieff in “Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning — Part One” Paramount Pictures and Skydance
Tom gave you skydiving lessons as a wrap gift, and you’ve gotten super into that, right?
I love learning new skills, and I love pushing myself and taking risks, so now I’m kind of hooked on skydiving. When I have some time off, I have to go back to skydive.
And you’re also into horseback riding?
Yes, I love horses. I would love to do a movie with horses. I keep asking Tom and McQ, “Can I have horses in the movie?” Fucking love horses.
Like the Marvel films, there’s a tremendous amount of hype involving the release. Is that something you think about?
Most of all, I’m just very grateful to be working with such amazing filmmakers, because it’s not just about being in a big movie, it’s about such beautiful quality and cinema. It’s filmmakers with such a beautiful vision. Then it happens to be seen by a lot of people, which is even better. But first of all, the movie’s incredible. I’ve been a fan of “Mission: Impossible” since I was a child.
Pom Klementieff in “Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning — Part One” Christian Black
What can fans possibly anticipate for “Part Two”?
I mean, the thing is Tom and McQ already shot the most incredible stunt again for the next one. So that’s going to blow your mind. But there’s not much I can tell you about the movie. I’m not really allowed!
It’s nice to keep some mystery. Nowadays, everything is so raw and there’s barely any privacy and everyone wants to know everything and just reveal everything. It’s just nice to take the time, you’ll see when you’ll see it, when it will be ready and we’ll talk about it, but [it’s nice to] just have a little bit of suspense and something a little bit like exciting, like oh, you’ll see later, be patient.
There are a lot of other really big movies coming out this summer, which one are you most excited to go see just as an audience member?
I would love to see “Oppenheimer.” I love Christopher Nolan, so I’m curious about that one.

,Pom Klementieff Is the Most Likable Villain Ever in 'Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part 1',"Pom Klementieff speaks to 'InStyle' about Paris, her character in the newest installment of 'Mission: Impossible,' currently in theaters.","This interview took place before SAG-AFTRA strike activity.
While villains typically tend to be unanimously reviled characters — from Scar and Pennywise to Hannibal Lecter — the best actors find a way to make even the worst bad guys likable. In the seventh installment of Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible series (Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, currently in theaters), Pom Klementieff plays the fiery Paris, whose sole directive is to sabotage everybody else’s efforts (by all means necessary — and we mean all means) to retrieve a key that unlocks an all-powerful artificial intelligence nicknamed ""The Entity.""
And yet, the audience can’t help but fall in love with the rambunctious French firecracker, whose grunge-inspired outfits, platinum bob haircut, and intricate fight sequences make her the film’s resident cool girl.
“She's on a path of destruction and you're still rooting for her, like, ‘I love this girl,’” Klementieff tells InStyle about her character, a Harley Quinn type who drops roundhouse kicks in plaid miniskirts and runs a military-grade tank through the tourist-filled streets of Venice, Italy, with a maniacal smile on her face. Her character is a woman of few words, relying on action and fashion to speak for her, which Klementieff calls “freeing, because it was just all about behavior and all about just movement.”
She also says she drew inspiration from iconic silent characters of the past, played by some of the greats like Clint Eastwood, Japanese comedian Takeshi Kitano, and French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo.
“But the beauty of it is that when she speaks, everyone listens,” she adds.
Klementieff is no stranger to the genre, with a stacked résumé that includes high-action projects like Thunder Force (starring Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer) and Guardians of the Galaxy. Although Paris is a far cry from her beloved Marvel character Mantis, likability is something Klementieff excels at bringing to her characters both good and bad. She also appeared as Haeng-Bok in Spike Lee's 2013 mystery Old Boy alongside Josh Brolin, Elizabeth Olsen, Samuel L. Jackson, and Michael Imperioli.
Paramount Pictures
The latest installment of the wildly popular franchise — which also marks the series’s second-to-last volume (Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part 2 is slated to hit theaters next summer) — delivers all the makings of the espionage franchise that loyal fans have come to know and love: action-packed scenes, over-the-top fight sequences, and the thrill of taking on things that are, well, impossible.
“It was such an honor to join this franchise,” Klementieff gushes. “I've been a fan since I was a child, so I saw all the other movies so many times. It was just incredible to get to work on this movie and to work with Tom and McQ [director Christopher McQuarrie].”
But this film is also sure to draw in a whole new generation with its reinvented approach to the spy movie, which weaves together modern technological advancements (we’re talking an AI entity that has the world’s superpowers clamoring for control), moments of comedic relief, a whirlwind romance, and a set of new characters, like Paris and Grace (played by fellow Marvel alumnae Hayley Atwell). Even moviegoers who aren’t die-hard Mission: Impossible fans can prepare to be captivated for the film’s entire 2 hour and 43 minute run, which seems long, but is stacked with exciting content from start to finish. In other words, it’s quite literally a movie that feels like a real movie (thank you, Harry Styles, for these profound words) and deserves to be experienced in theaters.
“There's some lightness to it and there's drama. Sometimes it's rom-com, sometimes it's film noir. It's so many things at the same time,” Klementieff says, explaining the film’s diverse landscape. “I think this movie is so rich, it feels like several movies at the same time in several genres at the same time. There's also some very charming and funny moments, right? With Ethan [Cruise] and Grace. as well, you see a comedy that you haven't seen in the previous movies.”
Paramount Pictures
Unlike the majority of action movies, M:I 7 taps into current style trends for costuming (something for the fashion girlies) — especially when it comes to Paris and her punk-rock aesthetic. Klementieff worked with the movie’s costume designer, Jill Taylor, to develop something “fresh and different” for the rebellious character while also keeping her “grounded” during her intense action sequences.
“We're going to bring something different for this character, some vibe that was a little bit more punk, which is cool to do, because I think it was really different from the other female characters from the franchise,” she says. “What was very important to me is that she was not wearing heels because she knows she's going to fight, so wearing heels just doesn't make sense.”
During one scene, Paris, along with everyone else searching for the coveted key, attends a party at a nightclub in Venice. Paris’s makeup look, which included a drawn-on white mask with a black teardrop, was influenced by the 17th century pantomime staple Pierrot from the commedia dell'arte.
“It's kind of cute but creepy at the same time,” she said describing Paris’s less-than-incognito ensemble. “[There’s] something melancholic about the teardrop that really connected with the character, that made sense.”

Klementieff admits that her style IRL isn’t that entirely different from her latest on-screen persona. ”My style is eclectic and it depends on the mood, but for everyday, of course it's going to be more relaxed and more chill. But, for events I like to have fun and just take risks.”
The actress arrived at the movie’s Seoul, South Korea, premiere in a head-turning strapless leather gown made from motorcycle gear (found by her stylist Jonathan Huguet), which she paired with platform boots and a slicked-back hairdo that included nail embellishments, executed by her hairstylist Marcia Lee.
“It's fun to do things that are unexpected, go from one vibe to another, and not take it too seriously,” she says. “Life is short and you want to have a good time too, so I do that with fashion, as well.”

At 61 years old, Cruise has starred in six Mission: Impossible films already, beginning with the inaugural movie in 1996. Later this month will mark the release of the seventh, part one of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning. And next year, the second part of the Dead Reckoning, which was shot back to back with the first, will follow up with its own premiere.
Speaking about the upcoming release in a recent interview with the Sydney Morning Herald, Cruise shared how he wants to keep starring in Mission: Impossible movies for many years to come.
“Harrison Ford is a legend, I hope to be still going, I’ve got 20 years to catch up with him,” Cruise said. “I hope to keep making Mission: Impossible films until I’m his age.”
Ford, who is 80, recently wrapped filming on the fifth Indiana Jones installment. As for Cruise, 27 years after the debut Mission: Impossible film, he impressively continues to do his own stunts, including riding a motorcycle over the side of a cliff.

2023-07-17 21:30:00+00:00,"Rebecca Ferguson Holds Her Own with Cruise, Chalamet, and the Secret Forces Behind ‘Silo’","The star of both ""Mission: Impossible"" and ""Dune"" franchise was shooting ""Silo"" Season 2, until the actors strike. She tells IndieWire what's next.","[Editor’s note: The following interview was conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike began on July 14, 2023.]
Rebecca Ferguson is ready for a break. She’s finished her A.D.R. (additional dialogue) on “Dune: Part Two,” the promotion chores on “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” (her third in the series), and is on her way home to hang with her 16-year-old son and still-friendly first husband in Sweden.
She was prepared to go back to England’s Hoddesdon Studios to shoot the second season of “Silo,” the most popular series on AppleTV+, returning her to the lead role of Sheriff. Not necessary, as the day after we spoke, July 13, SAG-AFTRA announced they were going on strike. “The percentage of people fortunate enough to have a good life as actors have to fight for the other percentage,” she said on the phone.
The 39-year-old actress, who grew up in Stockholm, attended a bilingual English school, and trained as a dancer, has steadily built herself into a major star. Who else goes toe-to-toe with Tom Cruise and returns to do it again, twice, without simply being a romantic appendage? It makes perfect sense that her best friend on the set of “Dune” was Charlotte Rampling. “She’s absolutely exquisite,” she said. “I look up to and admire her ridiculously.”
Ferguson shares Rampling’s elegant athleticism, and carries a similar taciturn mystery and danger, whether as former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust in the “Mission: Impossible” movies, Lady Jessica Atreides in “Dune,” or Juliette Nichols, the muscular mechanic-turned-sheriff in “Silo.” Ferguson doesn’t talk much in her movies. It’s a pleasure to watch her move, react, and when the dams break, emote. And you can’t take your eyes off her — especially when Faust turns up in a black eye patch. (Ferguson wasn’t able to close one eye when she was looking down a rifle sight.)
The actress rejects the notion of ever “going up against” Tom Cruise, who wanted her for Ilsa after seeing her in the “War of the Roses” mini-series “The White Queen.” “It’s not a battle,” she said. “You go in with the mission of trying to survive. It is written by the incredible Christopher McQuarrie, and Tom is part of that journey. They want phenomenal characters. It merged beautifully, the character [Ilsa] with me: the time, the place, the relationship with Tom all worked with well. The trajectory of this character is so complex and interesting to work with. I asked for a continuation. The story writes itself.”
The actress does not even try to keep up with Cruise. For one thing, she doesn’t perform all her own stunts. If she has to fall out of a speeding car, she leaves that to her beloved stunt double Lucy Cork.
Ferguson did, however, handle the climactic “Dead Reckoning” fight on the bridge herself, she said. “I tend to be running far behind, but I try. Tom is the movie. He represents ‘Mission,’ everything that’s good, and thankfully nothing bad has come from it. You are offered a palette of knowledge: you learn it and do it and embrace it. You also can choose to say ‘no.’ They will find a solution around it, you’re never forced to do it.”

She gamely tried to master riding a motorcycle, and had to earn a license. “You have to learn quickly,” she said. “I had to be ready to shoot soon. It was a 760 Triumph, a big motorbike. I am very strong, but being on one of these on a road in England going fast — the trainer said I was going too slow. ‘I need to get off; it’s not safe. I don’t trust myself.’ No worries! They had other options: Jennie [Tinmouth], the best motorcycle bike rider in the world.”
This “Mission: Impossible” installment boasts more women than usual including Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Pom Klementieff, and Hayley Atwell. “‘Mission’ is probably the one franchise that knows how to write storylines for women,” said Ferguson, who takes the scripts as they come. “They break things down; there’s not a lot of going into detail about what happened. You do not talk about it. There’s always reasons why arcs go a certain way,” she said. I control my own destiny [as Ilsa], there are reasons why things happen.” (A very compelling notation, given what happens to Ilsa in the latest film.)
“Silo” has turned out to be the happiest experience of Ferguson’s career, partly because she is an executive producer, but mostly, she said, because showrunner-creator Graham Yost (“Speed”) runs a non-hierarchical set. “I don’t like it when people are more important than others,” she said. “A happy set becomes creative and a safe set becomes a safe space.”

Based on the series of sci-fi novels by Hugh Howey, the character Juliette Nichols starts out as a mechanic at the bottom of the 144-floor silo, in the depths where the poorest support staff live. She keeps heroically fixing the massive generator that powers the silo, climbing inside its blazing interior with a huge wrench, her muscles gleaming; she almost drowns aiming a firehouse at an overheating vent.
She’s fearless, tenacious, wily, and incredibly strong, which gets her past most of the obstacles heading her way in the silo, which was built to save humans from a destroyed and poisonous earth. But the powers that be keep the population ignorant and unaware of their past history. That’s what Juliette is bent on discovering.
What’s most important with each character for Ferguson, besides building up the right physique, is to “create a silhouette,” she said. “Then you’ve nailed a memorable figure, say, Cruella de Vil, through movement.” Working with movement coach Alexandra Reynolds (“The Theory of Everything”) she expressed the trauma Juliette stores in her body. “She carries a lot of internal grief and internally, and is socially uncomfortable, and is walking away when people touch her. She’s tactile with her own tools and her own world,” Ferguson said. “I often take on powerful characters and portray regal princesses and countesses and concubines, so my agenda was to completely break down and find in myself the capacity to do something else with Juliette.”
At first when the mechanic is named sheriff, she wants to solve the mystery of her lover’s death. “I find Juliette selfish in the beginning, she’s a broken heroine who gradually realizes there are things bigger than herself,” she said. “I love where we are going to in Season 2. She definitely learns new tricks and things get very wet.”

Next up: “Dune: Part Two” (November 3, Warner Bros.) is in the hands of the editors and composer Hans Zimmer. Assuming the strikes are resolved by October, Ferguson will be back on the promo trail.
Returning to Lady Jessica offered a character in transition. “She starts as a powerful, knowledgeable, magical mother and protector on a quest and a journey to make Paul into the leader,” she said. “She’s on a path to see the creation she has made and how is this new Jessica in relation to what her son has become? He’s more forceful, what does she do? She’s a significantly important person to the Fremen.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvaW50ZXJ2aWV3cy9yZWJlY2NhLWZlcmd1c29uLWludGVydmlldy1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZHVuZS1zaWxvLTEyMzQ4ODQ4OTQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-17 09:00:10+00:00,My Impossible Mission to Find Tom Cruise,The action star has gone to great lengths to avoid the press for more than a decade. But maybe our writer could track him down anyway?,"In the same venue, a man so young he might have been a teenager, who at one time worked inside the airport, revealed to me that Cruise had a parking spot there, though it was unclear if he meant for a car or a helicopter. Most of the good people of Biggin Hill, when grilled about Cruise’s living arrangements, seemed genuinely to have no idea what I was talking about. These were the two camps into which, without fail, every respondent fell: Either they had never so much as heard the rumor that Cruise walked among them, or they were 100 percent certain that he did.
Upon reaching Keston Park, the only gated community in the area matching The Sun’s description, I discovered two things: first, that there appeared to be an illegally locked gate obstructing public access to the footpath that cuts through the neighborhood — whether the gate is impenetrable is a matter of ongoing dispute among the Bromley borough council, myself and many other aspiring path-takers who have submitted complaints about the locked gate to the borough website — and, second, that the biggest movie star in the world did not live there. That was evident through holes that carpenter bees had bored into the barbed-wire-topped fences protecting Keston Park from the wider world. The stately houses faced one another too directly. Their trees could drop acorns into another’s gardens. There was nowhere to conveniently land a helicopter.
Oh, well. These were Keston Park’s problems — not mine and probably not Tom Cruise’s. Tom Cruise, as he and I both now knew, was most likely secretly living at another estate I had turned up in my research — one that was even closer to the airport.
The distance between any two points within the general environs of Biggin Hill is insignificant by car, which is probably why I was unable to persuade any taxi driver to transport me between them. It is less insignificant by foot, and even longer, though much more scenic, if one attempts to traverse it by way of the aforementioned footpaths. These meandering trails tended to be spectacularly beautiful, bursting with a vernal lushness that was nearly pornographic. House-high frozen fountains of eensy white hawthorn blossoms shaded dusty walkways. Wild roses as pink as Country Time lemonade exploded from leafy hedges. Fragile sapphire speedwells, fat purple clover tops and buttercups strewn like gold confetti — these were merely the things it was impossible not to step on. The fluorescent green of the meadows recalled the grasses of another royal province — Super Mario’s Mushroom Kingdom. Poppies and toadflax sprang out obscenely from stone walls. Tom Cruise would be crazy not to live here, I thought as I stroked the soft, sun-warmed mane of a little white donkey. Let’s all live here.
Except, upon my arrival at the end of an idyllic woodland stroll, I discovered that Cruise did not live there either. There was, in the front yard of this residence, a garden gnome lugging buckets on a yoke, which didn’t seem like Cruise’s style, and the gnome was overturned, lying on its side — definitely not his style. I righted the gnome and ambled on, in search of another public footpath that would, I hoped, lead me to where Cruise actually lived. Instead, I accidentally wandered into what (I learned through being yelled this information) was not a public right of way but a field privately owned by a woman who berated me until I ran into traffic on a nearby road.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTcvbWFnYXppbmUvdG9tLWNydWlzZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtaW50ZXJ2aWV3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-06-23 11:18:10.446000+00:00,Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Director on Decision to Split It Into Two Parts,"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning helmer Christopher McQuarrie has explained the rationale behind splitting the film into two parts, citing the story's emotional depth and expanding cast as contributing factors.","Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning helmer Christopher McQuarrie has explained the rationale behind splitting the film into two parts, citing the story's action and expanding cast as contributing factors.
Dead Reckoning Part One will clock in at two hours and 36 minutes without credits, pushing it past 2018's Mission: Impossible Fallout, which had a runtime of two hours and 27 minutes. Speaking to IGN's Stella Chung at the film's junket in Rome, McQuarrie explained that it had ""nothing to do with a trend of any kind,"" referring to the amount of two-part movies hitting theaters these days.
""We knew the movie was so big, and rather than trying to contain it all in a two-hour movie, we just very early on said, 'let's break this up into two parts,' "" he explains. ""A lot of characters, a lot of action. It was a very big story that needed two parts.""
McQuarrie told Collider, meanwhile, that he always knew the next chapter would be bigger than Fallout.
""Fallout really grew because of all the character and emotion we were putting into the story,"" he said. ""I knew I wanted to expand the cast, and I knew I wanted to give each one of those characters more to do, so I knew the movie was going to be bigger and longer than Fallout.
""At which point I said, 'Why are we fighting this? Why are we going to try to jam this into two hours? Let's just break it in half and make it two movies,'"" he added, reflecting on the decision. ""That really was the rationale behind it being a two-part movie. It wasn't just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie.""
McQuarrie said Paramount Pictures were receptive to the idea of splitting the story across two films, but production of the two titles didn't come without its challenges. There was a lot of planning, coordinating, and managing that needed time on the logistics side of the shoot.
""It was complicated by the fact that certain things in Part Two required stopping Part One to shoot them, whether it was because of weather or actor availability,"" he said. ""And so, with all the other challenges that were confronting this movie while we were making it, there was the challenge of stopping in the middle, not even knowing what the full movie was, and trying to predict what it was in the second film.""
The two films were supposed to be filmed back-to-back, but the production faced multiple setbacks amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Principal photography on Part Two eventually kicked off in March 2022, though McQuarrie admits they still haven't figured out the ending.
""I don't know what the ending of Part Two is, so I couldn't tell you,"" he confessed to Collider. ""I'm not being evasive. I could tell you that I know what the end of Part Two is, but I can't guarantee that that will be the ending when we get there. Tom and I never obsess about executing the plan. We always have a direction, we always have a place we're going.
""In retrospect, it sounds as though what we do is just flying by the seat of our pants and making it up as we go along,"" he continued. ""That's not an accurate description. You are definitely flying in a direction, you're definitely prepared. You couldn't be that cavalier without somebody getting seriously physically hurt. These things are planned within an inch of their life. Along the way, we see a shiny object and go for it.""
There's a lot of hype building for Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, as the two-part movie will reportedly serve as a send-off for Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt. Part One will hit theaters on July 12, 2023, with Part Two expected to follow less than a year later, on June 28, 2024.

,Henry Czerny says new Mission: Impossible is 'gobsmacking good',"Canadian actor Henry Czerny tells guest host Talia Schlanger about returning to the Mission: Impossible universe, working with Tom Cruise, and the future of cinema.","Q 18:39 Henry Czerny says the new “Mission: Impossible” movie is “gobsmacking good”
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One isn't just a fun summer blockbuster, according to Henry Czerny. It's an ""extraordinary event.""
The veteran Canadian actor returns to the Mission: Impossible franchise after a 27-year hiatus, reprising the role of Impossible Mission Force Director Eugene Kittridge. He last played Kittridge in the first Mission: Impossible film, way back in 1996. In an interview with guest host Talia Schlanger recorded before the SAG-AFTRA strike, Czerny said that from the moment studio execs showed him the sizzle reel for Dead Reckoning, he knew it was going to be ""gobsmacking good.""
""If you thought you were coming to the film with your bar high enough, you just got schooled,"" he says. ""Raise your bar a little higher. The final product clearly is more extraordinary than I thought it was going to be.""
It is also, in the tradition of the six Mission: Impossible films that went before it, a film that needs to be experienced on the big screen. To watch it at home, Czerny says, would be the equivalent of ""getting takeout from [famous Parisian restaurant] Lucas Carton … you're getting half the meal made."" He adds that the people who make these movies, starting with star Tom Cruise and director Chris McQuarrie, go out of their way to ""[take] care of their audience in a way that's just extraordinary in my experience."" He is consistently impressed by the way that Cruise, now 61 years old, continues to insist on doing his own stunts.
""He loves doing that stuff,"" says Czerny. ""Maybe he's got a bucket list — 'I want to drive a motorbike off a cliff.' But [why] he does it? It's for his audience, because he can get a stunt person to do it.""
WATCH | Official trailer for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One:
He adds that in an age where filmmakers can use CGI to do just about anything, there's still a lot of value in practical effects and real stunts.
""If you watch great filmmaking, there is an analog element to it,"" he says. ""We have digital, we have CGI. That's all great, and it works. It's really good. But when you see the person do [a stunt], there's something that's transmitted that cannot be transmitted through digital.… It keeps you engaged in a way that you wouldn't normally.""
Czerny says he didn't start acting with dreams of being in blockbuster action movies. After finishing his training at the National Theatre School in Montreal, he spent a decade as a stage actor before appearing in the two-part docudrama The Boys of St. Vincent, a fictionalized telling of the Mount Cashel Orphanage story. From there, he got his first action-thriller role working alongside Harrison Ford in Clear and Present Danger, the sequel to The Hunt for Red October. It was shortly after that when he got the call about Mission: Impossible.
Stunningly, he almost passed on the film.
""I was in Brazil shooting a film, and I hadn't slept,"" he says. ""We were shooting nights and just for some reason or other … when I got the call, I was not feeling like I could do it. [The casting director said] 'Brian and Tom want you to come and play Kittridge,' because I auditioned for it. And I said 'Ah, I dunno.' And they said, 'No, no, no, Henry, I don't care what you think. You're doing it.'""
The decision, or lack thereof, to take the role of Kittridge helped turn Czerny into a highly recognizable face, and set his life on a trajectory that he still struggles to comprehend.
""Back when I was in theater school in Montreal, if you had put me on a hallucinogenic trip for a week and then asked me to describe what [my] life will be like, this eclipses that tenfold,"" he says.
Czerny has one piece of advice for young actors, people who are where he was when he was thinking about passing on Mission: Impossible: ""Enjoy the [rollercoaster] ride. Hold onto the lap bar or put your arms in the air. It matters not. Straightaways will be there for you to take a breath.""

The “Mission Impossible” franchise has pulled off some of the biggest stunts in cinematic history. On many top ten lists of most dangerous stunts of all time is a scene from “Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol” (2011) in which Tom Cruise's death-defying Ethan Hunt scales a skyscraper using suction gloves and makes a nerve-wracking jump, which leaves him hanging by one foot.

“I kept telling him to just kick me here,” the actress said in an interview with EW, pointing to her midsection. “I was squeezing abs. ‘You can just go for it. He was like ‘No, no, no, no, no.’ I was like, ‘But it’s going to help me!’ But he wouldn’t do it.”
Klementieff plays Paris in the new Mission Impossible, partnered with the main villain, Gabriel, played by Esai Morales. The request for the stomach kick came during her fight with Cruise’s Ethan Hunt character.
The actress, who also played Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, says her character is someone who “destroys everything in her path. She’s a rebel, she’s a killer, she’s extremely skilled and quite lonely too.”
Klementieff said her film name is an homage to Leonard Nimoy, who played the Great Paris on the original Mission: Impossible TV show. “When Christopher McQuarrie cast me for the role, he didn’t know which name the character would have,” she says. “It was cool to name me Paris, me being from France, and then they decided that I would speak French because I speak French in real life.”

Tom Cruise: Man, I love that too.
With that love, do you have an earliest memory of going to the movies? Or if there was one particular film that started that passion for you?
Tom Cruise: There wasn’t one in particular. There was just so many. I would just absorb cinema as a kid. I remember being 4-years-old and wanting to make movies. There was just such a large range of pictures that I saw. Starting from the black-and-white movies on television, and then growing up I would just take jobs… you know, cutting grass or delivering newspapers, since I was 8-years-old, just so I had the money to go to the movies. That’s what I did. That was my life. I just wanted to know who was making them (too), so when I was 18, and I didn’t have the money to go to acting class or film school, I just started auditioning. I used to write characters and create stories, and I was creating my own stunts and action from when I was a kid. Jumping off roofs, climbing trees…
It seems to have worked out for you.
Tom Cruise: (Laughs) Man, thank you so much.
Christopher McQuarrie: It’s interesting you ask that, because I always hear filmmakers talk about that vivid, formative moment. I don’t have one. Movies exist before my earliest memory. I don’t remember the first thing I wrote. I don’t remember the first movie I saw. I remember the moment I wanted to be a writer, but I never thought about writing film. I love movies and I love writing, but I never had related the two.
It all came about organically through friends that I grew up with who were all so into film. I went to school with Ethan Hawke and a lot of creative people. James Murphy from the LCD Soundsystem was a high-school buddy… I was very lucky to be raised around a core of extremely creative people who believed it was real. No one ever thought about it as “that was someone else’s dream”, to them it was all extremely possible. And having that kind of friendship and kind of support never (made it seem) like a daunting thing.
When I’m introduced to people or I see people online who say that they are an aspiring filmmaker, I say “Take aspiring out of your title!” You’re a filmmaker. You’re a writer. You’re doing it. It’s just the level at which you’re doing it. I never expected to be a director. I never expected to direct action movies. I never expected to direct four Mission: Impossible movies. I just went through the door that opened, and I learned, probably too late in my career, that you have to focus on execution and not on result. Focus on your swing and not where the ball is going. And here I am talking to you.
Simon Pegg: Mine would probably be going to see Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger at the Gloucester ABC, and then my first time seeing Star Wars, obviously, which I saw in the same theatre, like two years later. That was life-changing.
Hayley Atwell: Gosh, the first thing that comes to mind is E.T. It was so transportative and magical and moving… and it didn’t occur to me that you could do that. I was just lost in this world. I also remember my best friend had not seen a movie before, and my mum was like, “That’s a form of abuse!” (laughs). We had to take her to the cinema, so we took her to see Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. So watching her experience cinema for the first time, and seeing her eyes just become like saucers… that really set me off on a path to watch many different genres.
Pom Klementieff: I remember the first movie I saw that made me want to work in the industry was Oldboy by Park Chan-wook. Kill Bill by Tarantino was another one. I think it might’ve been my age at the time too, but I was just blown away by the images and the characters, and how these movies can move you and change your vision of the world.
And before you collaborated with Tom, was there a Tom Cruise movie or role that stood out for you?
Christopher McQuarrie: Oh man, Tom Cruise moments or performances? I mean, Collateral was such an extraordinary performance. I’m a child of the Cold War so I remember seeing Top Gun in the theatre. I remember seeing The Colour of Money, and after that all you wanted to do was play pool like Tom Cruise. But, I gotta say, probably my most vivid, indelible one is Risky Business. I very distinctly remember seeing that movie in the theatre. I grew up just outside of Princeton where (his character) ends up going to school, in that type of suburbia. So I very much identified with that movie. What I never expected was to be working with him.
Simon Pegg: The first Tom Cruise movie I saw was probably Ridley Scott’s Legend. But I think my favourite Tom Cruise performance is Jerry Maguire. I think it’s just amazing.
Hayley Atwell: I mean, I loved him in Tropic Thunder. And Magnolia. Talk about range! What (he) does in that? He’s the real thing. Born on the Fourth of July? Come on! I remember my mum watching Cocktail on VHS, and I was supposed to be in bed and having a little peak like…
Pom Klementieff: I love Tropic Thunder (laughs). I asked (Tom) to do the dance a few times on set, the one he does in that (laughs). He’s so cute (laughs).
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is screening exclusively in Australian theatres from July 8th, 2023.

,Tom Cruise’s ‘Mission: Impossible’ director says actor revealed ‘weirdest’ story about himself,"Tom Cruise's ""Mission: Impossible"" director asked the actor what the ""weirdest"" rumor was that he'd ever heard about himself, and Cruise shared it was a bizarre no eye contact rule.","Even Tom Cruise can’t believe some of the things he hears about himself.
Cruise’s ""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 1"" director, Chris McQuarrie, revealed in a new interview with the Times of London that the actor has heard some crazy rumors about himself, but was happy to debunk them.
According to McQuarrie, he asked Cruise when they first met what the ""weirdest story you’ve heard about yourself"" was.
Cruise laughed and said it was the myth that people on set ""were not allowed to look me in the eye.""
TOM CRUISE WANTS 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE' MOVIES TO KEEP GOING UNTIL HE’S 80, FOLLOW IN HARRISON FORD'S FOOTSTEPS
The first time the actor and director worked together was 2008’s ""Valkyrie,"" and McQuarrie has directed Cruise in the last three ""Mission: Impossible"" films, as well as produced ""Top Gun: Maverick.""
Simon Pegg, who joined the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise in 2006’s ""Mission: Impossible III,"" agreed that the stories surrounding Cruise are overblown.
""I’ve been able to hack my way through all the bizarre mythology that surrounds him,"" Pegg told the outlet. ""On one side he’s Tom Cruise – this enigmatic film star everyone wants to know about. And on the other he’s just a guy. I like being normal with him.""
Pegg also praised Cruise’s dedication to stunt work, which has seen him jump off cliffs for dozens of takes.
""With special effects you know something is artificial – it removes a degree of tension. So Tom pushes things to the limit, to the point of risking his life,"" he said.
Hayley Atwell added that Cruise isn’t ""a snob,"" both personally and with the action-based movies he’s been making the past several years.

""He doesn’t want to make movies now to punish an audience,"" Atwell said. ""He doesn’t want films with the message that if you do not understand this you’re not smart. I can tell when I watch some movies that the director has made it for themselves. I don’t feel involved or I think, ‘Am I stupid?’ Tom’s not a snob.""
Atwell was also the subject of dating rumors with Cruise, and in a recent interview with The Independent, she revealed that the 61-year-old calmed her concerns.

""When I’ve talked to him about it, he’d be like, 'You know exactly who you are. You know what you’re about. And that is the only thing that matters. It doesn’t matter what people think of you, if you are in integrity with yourself, if you know what your value system is,’"" she said.

7/11/2023 16:41,How Tom Cruise makes work for reporters easier as he promotes M:I – Dead Reckoning Part 1,,"I was in New York last Thursday and Friday for the Oppenheimer junket. More on that in the coming days because I can’t actually remember if there’s an embargo; I can tell you, however, that Cillian Murphy will probably be nominated for an Oscar for his performance, he’s really, really good, and that I interviewed Emily Blunt and Matt Damon together and they were hilarious.
Before Oppenheimer, though, there’s Tom Cruise and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 1, and the reason I’m talking about Oppenheimer in relation to Tom is because many of the other reporters at the Oppenheimer junket had recently come back from Rome and the big M:I premiere and junket and they were still talking about how great it was.
Sure, a work trip to Italy is fun, but reporters are there to do their jobs. Their job is to bring back an interview, to deliver for your network or your outlet. And the challenge there where movie stars are involved is that, well, not all movie stars are as accommodating. But then again, not all movie stars are Tom Cruise. Some of them resent having to promote their movies, and that resentment comes through in the interviews – that resentment is transferred onto the reporter, we can sometimes become the misplaced target of that resentment. Even if they’re not resentful, they can often get bored, and when they’re bored they can’t be bothered to be engaging. Sometimes they’re just assholes, like that’s the default setting and now you’re sitting across from someone for four minutes who you would never, ever choose to talk to in real life because they’re a dick.
The point is, even when the junket is happening in a cool destination, it’s almost always a crapshoot with what you might get from the celebrities once you’re working – there is no guarantee that you’ll be met with a sure thing, slam dunk good interview on the other end… unless it’s Tom Cruise on the other end.
I know, I know. He’s a Scientologist and they’ve done some f-cked up sh-t in that cult and I’m not here to sugarcoat that. At the same time, for me and my colleagues, he makes our jobs easier. He actually respects our jobs and wants to help us do a good job. And when you work in an industry where there’s an established hierarchy between celebrity and media, and media is basically treated like servants at the beck and call and whim of the stars, you can’t help but feel appreciative and even grateful when someone like Tom Cruise is there and not only isn’t trying to step on you, he’s there to lift you up.
Everyone in Rome had a story about how he remembered the smallest details about them even though they only spoke for a few minutes. Many had stories about how he came over on the red carpet and greeted everyone personally by name. And all of them left with a good interview. Including my colleague Sonia on ETALK. They’re laughing, they’re joking, and he tries to speak Hindi.
But also… we might have just identified one thing that Tom Cruise can’t do: navigate Toronto traffic. If you’re from Toronto, you know the traffic here is a total sh-t show. If you’re not from Toronto, you know the traffic here is a total sh-t show. Even Tom Cruise hates Toronto traffic! Traffic here is so impossible that six months ago I stopped driving. I refuse. I go out of my way to ride transit now, not that transit is all that better in this city. Surface transit, like streetcars and buses, still have to sit in traffic. Which is why for me it’s subway only. I’m putting in an extra 20 minutes in the morning and afternoon to walk to the subway stations to and from work, which has added 40 minutes total to my overall commute because I’d actually rather it take longer than be in a car having to deal with this mess. If Tom Cruise can’t deal with it, how are the rest of us supposed to!
Here are Tom and the cast of M:I – Dead Reckoning Part 1 in New York for the premiere last night.

2023-06-25 07:00:30+00:00,"‘I’m not that geeky guy any more’: Simon Pegg on comedy, action heroes and staying at home","Simon Pegg has called time on the nerdy stuff, and says he’d rather watch Succession than sci-fi. As for his A-list status, friendship with Tom Cruise and box-office pulling power – well, he’d take Hertfordshire over Hollywood any time","Last summer, the actor and writer Simon Pegg and the writer-director Edgar Wright holed up for a week at Pegg’s home in Hertfordshire to see if they could break ground on a fourth feature film together. Their previous three, aka the Cornetto Trilogy – Shaun of the Dead (2004), Hot Fuzz (2007) and The World’s End (2013) – are all standards on any list of the best British films of the 21st century, and have made both Pegg and Wright bona-fide Hollywood heavyweights. (The pair also created Spaced, one of the all-time great sitcoms, which Pegg wrote and starred in with Jessica Hynes.) But progress on film number four, Pegg admits, wrinkling his nose, was slow.
Was it the pressure of following those previous iconic films? Pegg shakes his head. “Edgar bought his dog, Peter, and Peter was very distracting,” he replies, in his West Country-inflected half-drawl. “I have three dogs; they are schnauzers, too. Well, two now, but I had three then, and they’re quite well-behaved. But Peter’s a little rascal.”
Pegg and Wright did, though, make some decisions last summer and it’s bad news for anyone hoping for a Cornetto quadrilogy. “Whatever Edgar and I do next, we’re not going to rely on what we’ve done before,” says Pegg, whose hair is slicked back, beard neatly trimmed, and is wearing oversized, retro glasses with amber-tinted lenses. “I like the idea of pissing people off. There’s something fun about torching everything. Everything that people think we are, that’s what we won’t be. We should just do something that no one’s expecting.” Pegg laughs, “But no one wants!”
Or at least they don’t realise they want yet. “If I ever do an Instagram Live or whatever, people are always like, ‘I need Shaun of the Dead 2 in my life.’ And I’m like, ‘No, you don’t fucking need Shaun of the Dead 2! The last thing you need is Shaun of the Dead 2! It’s done. Move on!’”

Pegg is sort-of joking, but also sort-of-very-much not. He wrote Spaced and Shaun of the Dead in his late 20s and early 30s because he believed – probably accurately – that the only way to snag the acting roles he wanted in first TV then films was to create those parts himself. He lived in flatshares in north London and had been obsessed since childhood with sci-fi, zombies, video games and action movies, and all these elements found their way into the scripts. Pegg drank a bit too much and had a slightly chaotic life; so did his characters.
But Pegg, these days, is very different. He’s 53 now and lives with his wife, Mo, and their teenage daughter, Tilly, in a house surrounded by fields. He’s teetotal and in confoundingly good nick: Tom Cruise once called him “Eight-Pack Peggles.” Yes, Tom Cruise, he’s a pal, the pair having worked together for more than 15 years on the Mission: Impossible series, the seventh installment of which, Dead Reckoning, Part One, is the reason we are here today. Pegg knows he no longer has to write parts to be asked – often by his boyhood heroes – to act in them: he’s been Scotty in three Star Trek films, appeared in 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Steven Spielberg cast him as one of the Thompson Twins in The Adventures of Tintin.
“I say no to a lot of things,” says Pegg, in the garden of a grand house in Hertfordshire (not his) that is the backdrop for the photographs on these pages. “I made a name for myself as a comedic actor, but I’d quite like to flex different muscles. And I didn’t plan to be a comedic actor. Comedy was just something I enjoyed and seemed to be able to do. Now if I get offered comedies I turn them down, because I want to do it with Edgar and nobody else.”
The changes have been more profound than film choices. Pegg has come to look at nostalgia as almost “a neurological disorder” that makes us resistant to change. “This culture of infantilised adulthood, all these grown-ass men arguing about fucking superheroes online, and meanwhile the world is falling apart in so many different ways,” he says. “And that’s why we will all go to hell. Because no one will grow the fuck up any more. Everybody’s so plugged into being a child, you know?”

Back in 2009, he called his autobiography Nerd Do Well. That title doesn’t fit any more. “I’ve aged out of a lot of what people assume I’m about. I don’t feel like I’m that geeky guy any more, particularly. I don’t have the same interests I had when I was 35 or 40 even. I’d much rather watch Succession than some sci-fi.”
Pegg’s ascent remains one of the great, recent Hollywood creation stories. In one of the most entertaining parts of it, he and Wright were asked in an interview, after Shaun of the Dead, whether they planned to leave the UK behind and make action films in the US. Pegg responded, “It’s not like we’re going to go away and do, I don’t know” – scanning his brain for an imaginary, and unimaginable, blockbuster – “Mission: Impossible III.”
The reply was honest. Pegg had not long before done an audition for a small part in the Mission: Impossible franchise, something involving a helicopter, and heard nothing. But then, the original director, Joe Carnahan, left the project and Cruise brought in Alias creator JJ Abrams, who was a huge fan of… Shaun of the Dead! Ricky Gervais was set to play Cruise’s sidekick Benji Dunn, but dropped out and Pegg was given the nod. “So it was a huge irony that I’d said, ‘I’m not going to go off and do this,’” says Pegg. “But then, at that time, there was this attitude that anyone who went off to Hollywood was betraying their roots in some sense or selling out. It’s not like you cross some misty bridge at night and never come home again. So many people assume that I live over there. But, you know, I live in Hertfordshire.”
Pegg’s big-movie break in Mission: Impossible III proved to be intense and unsettling. For the child who had grown up obsessed with film in first Gloucester, then Stratford-upon-Avon – his father was a musician, his mother acted in local theatre; they separated when he was six – it should have felt like everything falling into place. But Pegg was starting to unravel mentally. He had suffered bouts of depression since he was 18 and his fall-back coping mechanism was to drink heavily. By 2005, when he landed in Los Angeles to start the shoot, he could barely hold it together.

“I was not in a good place, emotionally and physically,” Pegg recalls. “It was a weird thing as well, because the dreams I’d had as a kid were manifesting and I wasn’t happy and I couldn’t figure out why. And that was down to personal things, depression. I had to get happy in myself before I could start enjoying anything else. Which I did. But at that time it was very frustrating to be there and not be able to fully enjoy it, because I just felt all at sea.”
Pegg had been accustomed, on the projects he wrote, to working every day. Now, on Mission: Impossible III, he had to be always available, but was little used. “I was put in a hotel in Beverly Hills and I waited for eight days before anyone called me and told me what I was doing or gave me any lines,” he says. “I went completely stir crazy and I was drinking to pass the time. Then you get hungover and you wind up not feeling great. I didn’t have a car. And I remember the hotel had a car service and I got them take me down to the coast, to Santa Monica and I sat in Ye Olde King’s Head, this British pub, and drank Stellas to feel some semblance of normality.”
It would be a few more years before Pegg sought help and went to rehab: rock bottom came in July 2011 after a chaotic four days at the Comic-Con convention in San Diego, California. He insists he can see the effects of the drinking in his performances around this time, but nevertheless, Benji Dunn became a key character in Mission: Impossible, an irreverent comic foil to Cruise’s intense Ethan Hunt. With each film, Pegg was given more to do and, perhaps not coincidentally, the franchise has not only not tailed off, but ramped up the action and the jeopardy with each installment.
Part of the thrill, undeniably, is the vicarious pleasure of watching the world’s most famous movie star engage in high-stakes lunacy. The Mission: Impossible films tend to use real locations – rather than green screen or soundstages – and Cruise does the stunts without camera trickery. These have included scaling the half-mile-high Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai without a harness in 2011’s Ghost Protocol, and clinging on to the outside of an aeroplane as it took off in Rogue Nation (2015). In Dead Reckoning, Part One, we can see from the trailer that Cruise careens off a cliff on a motorcycle. “This is far and away the most dangerous thing I’ve attempted,” Cruise has said.

Pegg, who was on location in Norway that day, agrees. “I’ve only ever seen him nervous a few times: one, when he was hanging off the plane in Rogue Nation and this time,” he says. “And yeah, he did it, I think, six times in one day. And we were up there when he did it. And it was scary, because we’d see him go off and he’d disappear and we’d just wait and then there would be silence until we heard the canopy and we’d know the chute had opened.”
Off-screen, Pegg and Cruise have become genuine friends. They don’t talk about religion – Cruise is a Scientologist, Pegg an atheist – and it hasn’t stopped being weird, at least for Pegg, that they might jump in a helicopter one afternoon, for example, and go swimming with sharks off the coast of South Africa. But the admiration is obvious. “What you get with the Mission films is the presence of true danger,” says Pegg. “It delivers an authenticity, which I think is absent from almost every other action franchise, because not only are those stunts being done, they’re being done by him.
“It’s like Buster Keaton, when the house front falls down and he goes through the window,” Pegg continues. “That’s still more exciting to look at than 1,000 CGI aliens coming at you. And that’s what Tom really understands. He understands film. He understands the audience. He probably knows more about filmmaking than anyone in the business. He’s been around longer than anyone that’s in power at a studio. He’s the real deal.”
Pegg remains highly ambitious for his career, but he does admit that, otherwise, he finds it harder to leave home these days. He has a cinema room and he’s working through a list of the 100 best horror movies with his daughter, Tilly. “Everything from Killer Klowns from Outer Space to Hereditary and The Human Centipede.” Erm, how old is she? Pegg smiles, “She’s just about to turn 14, but she loves it. She really loved The Shining. She’s very interested in the actual filmmaking process, and performing as well, so I feel like she’ll probably drift into the family business in some capacity.

“I love, love, love my home life,” Pegg goes on. “And it’s what I want to maintain through my job. If I can keep that, I’ll be happy. I never want to leave the house, really. I don’t go to parties. I don’t like going out. I’ll avoid having to go anywhere if I possibly can. The happiest place for me is in my armchair watching TV with my dogs and my daughter.”
One event that does get Pegg out of the house is a Coldplay gig. He met the band in the late 1990s, and became close with Chris Martin. They would go to the pub and then come home and Martin would sit in the kitchen playing acoustic guitar. At the V Festival 2001, Martin asked Pegg if he wanted to come onstage and play the harmonica and it’s become a rolling invitation over the years. Last summer, Pegg joined the band on tambourine at Wembley Stadium for their song A Sky Full of Stars. About a minute in, Martin stopped the music. After apologising to the 90,000 crowd, he introduced Pegg as “the world’s number one tambourine player” and said, “He’s our brother, and we love him so much.”
“With the harmonica, you’re always worried you’re going to hit a bum note,” says Pegg. “But it’s such a low-pressure gig. They handed me the tambourine on a cushion. It was so much fun. He’s such a sweet… they are four very, very cool guys. And I’ve seen them go from indie darlings to stadium fillers, and they’ve not really changed at all as people.”
For Pegg, that’s a high compliment. He certainly has changed over the years, but he hopes that his “core fundamental personality” has been unaltered by the unexpected ride he’s been on. “Fame doesn’t necessarily turn you into an arsehole, but it brings out the arsehole you’ve always been,” says Pegg. “I think you have to be smart to be famous. Because you have to constantly understand that it doesn’t really mean anything.”
Does Pegg think he’s managed that: not being an arsehole? “Well, I hope so,” he says, with a grin. “You tell me!”

How Tom Cruise impressed Indians with his Hindi
Tom has a massive fan following in India. In a recent promotional interview with Canadian news outlet ETalk, Tom was praised by an Indian-origin journalist for his fluency in various languages in his movies, especially the Mission: Impossible franchise. ""Is there anything you cannot do? Is he going to speak in Hindi with me?"" asked the journalist. Tom was a sport and wanted to test his Hindi speaking skills. He said, “If you want me to speak in Hindi with you, I will. Let's try it.”

Earlier this year, the “Top Gun: Maverick” star was praised by Steven Spielberg for having “saved Hollywood’s ass” at the box office. Now, Cruise has taken to Twitter to encourage audiences to see this year’s summer blockbusters on the big screen.
“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,” Cruise tweeted. “Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indy and one of the most iconic characters in history. I love a double feature, and it doesn’t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with ‘Oppenheimer‘ and ‘Barbie.'”
Cruise allegedly also applauded DC tentpole film “The Flash” ahead of its premiere. His own summer action film “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” has already received positive critical reactions ahead of its July 12 debut in theaters.
The next month sees the summer movie season ramping up. Harrison Ford’s presumed final appearance as Indy in “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” hits theaters June 30. “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” are set to battle it out at the box office with a shared July 21 release date.
“Vanilla Sky” and “Eyes Wide Shut” actor Cruise’s expansive Hollywood career has seen him become a advocate for the sanctity of theaters. Cruise allegedly convinced Paramount to give “Dead Reckoning” a theatrical release without undercutting the box office with a 30-day streaming window premiere on Paramount+.
A recent Puck report also claimed that Cruise has personally called rival studio executives and exhibitors in hopes of convincing them to relinquish PLF (premium large-format) screens for “Dead Reckoning” screenings. PLF screens come with an upcharge fee. “Oppenheimer” is already confirmed to be taking over all IMAX screens in North America for three weeks, which could kick out “Dead Reckoning” screenings.
An IMAX representative told IndieWire that IMAX will still house a three-week “Oppenheimer” plan for 1,550 out of IMAX’s total 1,700 venues worldwide while the Christopher Nolan film premieres later in China and Japan. “Oppenheimer” was entirely shot in IMAX.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9icmVha2luZy1uZXdzL3RvbS1jcnVpc2UtYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWRvdWJsZS1mZWF0dXJlLTEyMzQ4Nzk1Mzkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Interview Time: The Oscar-nominated actress CBS Mornings, Kirby was interviewed by one of the show's co-hosts Gayle King to discuss her return as 'The White Widow' in the new film Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One
Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, is the seventh film of the Mission: Impossible franchise, with first film being released in 1996.
In the Mission Impossible film franchise, Kirby plays Alanna Mitsopolis/White Widow, a powerful and dangerous international arms dealer. Kirby made her debut in the sixth movie of the film series, the 2018 film Mission: Impossible – Fallout.
When asked by Dokoupil about her character in the film, the British actress elaborated more on the building process that the film's director Christopher McQuarrie uses for the franchise where he finds actors he wants to work with and builds characters around them.
'[When I joined Mission: Impossible – Fallout], one of the first things [McQuarrie] said was that [he] love having a kind of thread between the films that started 30 years ago with the first Mission: Impossible film and Vanessa Redgrave plays my mom Max,' Kirby stated.
The British actress also expressed how lucky she was able to study Redgrave's portrayal of Max in the first film (the only one in the franchise that Redgrave appears in).
'[Vanessa Redgrave] was so charming with Tom [Cruise] and they sort of loved each other in those scenes [from Mission: Impossible] and I just wanted to try and capture the essence of what she had done,' Kirby said of how she tried incorporate some of Redgrave's character in her own character in the franchise.
'She had this incredible... I would never have thought of myself to be somebody that's sort of in charge of this really dark, hugely powerful organization, but to [portray the character] with lightness and play rather than as [Gayle said] assertive or menacing,' the 35-year-old actress added.
When asked by King, Kirby said she initially portrayed Alanna as 'quite strong and aggressive' until McQuarrie and other higher up producers of the Mission: Impossible films told her to tone it down, which she described as a huge acting challenge.

NYC Premiere: At the NYC Premiere of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning - Part One, Kirby avoided a near wardrobe malfunction while posing for pictures on the red carpet
'They said, ""Remember that the most powerful don't need to assert [that they are in charge] because [they] don't have to. So, it was a big acting challenge and lesson. It was wonderful to learn that you can actually do [assert that you are in charge] quietly,""' Kirby recalled.
The Oscar-nominated actress' appearance on CBS Mornings was the latest one by a cast and/or crew member to promote the release of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning - Part One and comes just two days after the film's star-studded premiere in New York City.
For the NYC premiere, Kirby nearly suffered a wardrobe malfunction as she posed for photos on the red carpet. Despite this, the 35-year-old showed off her incredible figure in a bronze colored slip dress and a black silk cape garment that she placed her hands through as gloves.
The Mission: Impossible franchise stars Cruise as its protagonist Ethan Hunt, a highly skilled field agent and operative for the Impossible Mission Force (IMF), a secret government agency that handles dangerous and high-stakes missions.
In the latest Mission: Impossible movie, when Hunt (Cruise), and his IMF team being confronted by a mysterious yet all-powerful foe known as 'The Entity', he is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than his mission.
The film's direct sequel, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part Two, is scheduled to be released in June 2024. Kirby will reprise her role in the eighth installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjI5MTY0NS9WYW5lc3NhLUtpcmJ5LW1vZGVscy1zdWl0LWFwcGVhcmFuY2UtQ0JTLU1vcm5pbmdzLmh0bWzSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtMTIyOTE2NDUvYW1wL1ZhbmVzc2EtS2lyYnktbW9kZWxzLXN1aXQtYXBwZWFyYW5jZS1DQlMtTW9ybmluZ3MuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-23 13:45:12+00:00,Simon Pegg Wouldn't Be Surprised If Benji Died In Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part Two,The mission comes first.,"Simon Pegg Wouldn't Be Surprised If Benji Died In Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part Two
Brian De Palma's 1996 ""Mission: Impossible"" movie subverted everything the TV show was about. A lot of ""Mission: Impossible"" focused on the team dynamic, with each member of the IMF working together to undo the week's hideous act of terrorism or espionage. De Palma's movie assembled a team, set them up on a mission, and then shockingly killed them all off. The only survivor was Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), a new character that hadn't been part of the show. Cruise has become the mastermind of the ""Mission: Impossible"" movies ever since, standing in as the film series' unflappable and indestructible leader. The TV show was never about heroes of that ilk, and it took several sequels before an IMF team began to form again.
J.J. Abrams' ""Mission: Impossible III,"" for instance, introduced the character of Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), a pencil-pusher back at the IMF home office who, during the course of the film, becomes one of the only people Ethan Hunt can trust. Benji isn't in the movie much, but provides valuable intel by the climax, assuring that Ethan may call on him again in the future.
Which, of course, he does — Benji has appeared in all the subsequent sequels. In the most recent film, ""Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One,"" The team includes Ethan, Benji, Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), and the reliable Luther (Ving Rhames).
Of course, at this late date, the stakes are higher than ever in the ""Mission: Impossible"" universe, and Cruise's immortal heroism may be cracking. It's entirely possible, then, that the team — for the first time since 1996 — may start getting picked off. Pegg certainly feels that way. In a recent interview with CinemaBlend, he admitted that Benji may not make it out of the next film alive.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTM0MzAzOC9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctMi1zaW1vbi1wZWdnLWJlbmppLWNvdWxkLWRpZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-17 20:14:27+00:00,Greg Tarzan Davis Didn’t Tell His ‘Top Gun’ Co-Stars About His ‘Mission: Impossible’ Casting,"Mission: Impossible star Greg Tarzan Davis kept his involvement in the film a secret, until people saw him atop a train with Tom Cruise.","Greg Tarzan Davis is the only actor who can say that his first three films were Tom Cruise-led blockbusters, beginning with Top Gun: Maverick and now, Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One and Part Two. Davis bonded with Maverick co-writer and Mission: Impossible co-mastermind Christopher “McQ” McQuarrie on the set of Joseph Kosinski’s smash hit, and so McQ later conceived Dead Reckoning Part One with Davis in mind for a role.
Overall, Davis is grateful to his seasoned collaborators for passing on their knowledge to him, starting with his Dead Reckoning Part One scene partner, Shea Whigham. Whigham not only taught him the value of providing a variety of different takes, but he also helped him with his self-tapes during their downtime. The lessons didn’t stop there as Davis once again shadowed McQ on set, as well as in the editing room, alongside Cruise and editor Eddie Hamilton.
“I really appreciate that McQ and Tom allowed me to come to set and also sit in the editing room with them to see how [Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One] was made,” Davis tells The Hollywood Reporter during a conversation prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike. “They’ve really become great mentors for me in trying to teach me filmmaking, and Tom compared it to passing a baton to me and other filmmakers by saying, ‘Hey, we want you to continue to make these great films.’ So they’re not secretive about their magic.”
During the making of Maverick, Davis created a lifelong connection with his fellow co-stars and F-18 pilots, as they all risked their lives in order to achieve the most realistic and immersive flying scenes possible. However, despite all of them being members of Cruise and McQ’s club, Davis still kept his Mission: Impossible cards close to his vest.
“I am big on holding secrets. I hate spoilers. So when I booked Mission, they found out later from a press release photo of me on top of the train with Tom, Esai [Morales] and Shea. They were like, ‘You didn’t tell us that you were on Mission!’ And I was like, ‘My bad, my bad,’” Davis shares.
In Dead Reckoning Part One, Davis plays Degas, who’s a part of the CIA’s Clandestine Services, and he, along with Whigham’s Briggs, is tasked with chasing down Ethan Hunt and retrieving a highly valued key. While Briggs is firmly committed to catching Hunt, Degas is a bit more open-minded about the situation, something Davis expects to continue in Part Two.
“[Degas is] the voice for the audience by saying, ‘No, maybe [IMF] is doing something right. Maybe we’re the ones who have it wrong,’” Davis says. “And you can probably see Degas’ questioning leading him to potentially make different choices down the line. Degas’ questions of, ‘Is [Ethan] doing something right, and should I be doing something different?’ may be explored in the future.”
Below, during a conversation with THR, Davis also talks about the terrifying moment he had in the middle of filming Dead Reckoning Part One’s thrilling train sequence.
So did your leftover Dramamine from Top Gun: Maverick come in handy during the train sequence?
(Laughs.) I don’t think anything was gonna prepare me for the train sequence. I didn’t even realize that I was gonna be on top of a train. I had never been on a train before, let alone on top of one. So I’m still trying to process that, and the Dramamine does not help.
We covered your casting process in detail last year, so I want to cut to the very first day where you hung out on set to watch the motorcycle jump. I saw a video of you guys watching it go down and then almost everybody started laughing once it happened. Was that your way of processing or coping with your collective fear and anxiety?
Have you ever heard the expression “laugh at my pain”? I wasn’t even in pain, but I was dying laughing. Like you said, it’s a coping mechanism in order to calm yourself down from the craziness that this man just did. And let me tell you, when we first got up there on top of the mountain, we were walking on the bridge, and then Tom came flying over in a helicopter, hanging outside of it and waving down at us. And all of a sudden, he just dropped, and it looked like he just jumped out of the helicopter and committed suicide. That was him warming up! So when we got to see him do the ramp jump and hear that buzzing go past us, it was like, “Oh, this is really happening.” I also saw that video earlier today for the first time in three years, and it brought back some memories.
McQ tends to write these movies and develop these characters on the fly, in response to the action, so when did you start to learn concrete details about your character?
When I saw the film. (Laughs.) Honestly, when I saw the film, I was like, “Oh, that’s the direction my character is supposed to go in. Now it makes sense.” The way McQ shoots can be very nerve-racking for people who are just entering into his process and his world of how he creates. And that goes for every director who has a particular type of filmmaking style. So it can be very nerve-racking, but at the same time, it’s very comforting because he covers all his bases. You’ll do different takes and different ways that your character can play something, so you never know exactly how it’s going to end up in the editing room. It almost gives you room to change the story yourself. So if I’m giving a performance in a particular way and I’m doing it multiple different times in different variations, I’m kind of telling the story myself, which is very interesting.
Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis in Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One Paramount Pictures and Skydance
Degas and Briggs (Shea Whigham) are a part of the CIA’s Clandestine Services, but do you consider them to be a Training Day-type situation where an idealistic rookie cop is paired with the cynical veteran cop? [Writer’s Note: At the New York premiere following this interview, Davis called Training Day one of his favorite films.]
Shea and I watched some films together. We discussed the type of dynamics that we wanted, but not initially though. Before we even started filming, we tried to figure out who we were because we obviously didn’t know. So we came to set with an idea of what we wanted, but McQ came up with a different take on it and we were like, “Okay, let’s go with that.” And then, when we started performing, it went in a different direction. McQ said, “This is way better. This is the direction we’re gonna go in.” So then we started watching films like Training Day, Starsky & Hutch and Midnight Run. We started watching those types of things, and that was the realm that we wanted to be in with our characters.
There’s a great deal of comedy in the film, especially when Shea’s character has to check random people for masks by pulling on their cheeks or sticking his fingers in their mouth. Was it tough to keep a straight face while watching Shea do those bits of business?

Yes, because you never know what Shea is gonna do. He’s a loose cannon. He doesn’t tell you, “This is what I’m going to do.” He’ll just touch my chest and say, “Hey, stay with me. Stay with me.” And I’m like, “Okay, let’s see where this is gonna go.” So when they called action, he did all the … (Davis pulls his cheek and sticks his fingers in his mouth.) So I tried my best to stay in character, and every take is so different from the last take. He’s very good at giving these drastically different takes when you’re expecting him to do the exact same thing. There was one take that didn’t make it — and it couldn’t make it because it just wasn’t right for the film — but it was so funny. He took it to the next level. Shea’s a character and a great actor.

You told me previously how Shea improved your self-tapes during filming, and he told me that he was quite proud that one led to Grey’s Anatomy. Are his lessons still making a difference?

They are. Shea is very kind as well. He loves the craft so much, and he told me, “I love when someone else loves it just as much as me.” So that’s why he was so willing to help me out, and he gave me his 30 years of experience. So I don’t have to spend as much time as him learning what he’s learned over that time period. He’s a great scene partner to work off of, and like I mentioned, he does different takes all the time. So I was like, “Let me start doing that as well.” I just love being around him and watching him work.

Degas speaks a bit of Italian and maybe even some French. Did you learn anything beyond those phrases you had to speak?

Duolingo helped me. I was in these places for months at a time, so I got a chance to pick up on some of the languages, which was really fun. If I didn’t, then I would’ve been a butthole for living in these beautiful countries and not trying to learn their cultures.

I’ve always mocked fictional governments whenever they question the likes of Ethan Hunt or Jack Bauer, considering they’ve both saved the world countless times. What more do they have to do?

(Laughs.)

So I love when Degas basically voices a similar point. He argued with Briggs that maybe Ethan has had a good reason to go rogue each and every time. So what did you make of Degas’ optimism there?

That’s actually a great question, and it’s him basically taking a stance and a point of view on right and wrong. What’s the moral question? He’s the voice for the audience by saying, “No, maybe [IMF] is doing something right. Maybe we’re the ones who have it wrong.” And you can probably see Degas’ questioning leading him to potentially make different choices down the line. Degas’ questions of, “Is [Ethan] doing something right, and should I be doing something different?” may be explored in the future.

Greg Tarzan Davis and Shea Whigham in Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One Paramount Pictures and Skydance

Besides being the voice of the audience, Degas and Briggs function almost like a shoulder angel and devil, only they’re debating Ethan’s choices from the outside.

That’s a great way to put it. Shea and I looked at Briggs as being the old-school way of thinking. He’s someone who’s been in this scene for so long, and he’s done it his way and is stuck in his ways. And Degas is more of the newer way of thinking. He does things by the book, but he’s also more of a free thinker by saying, “Well, maybe this isn’t right.” So you put it a great way with the devil and the angel on the shoulder. Briggs is all the way left and Degas is all the way right, although I wouldn’t say that Degas is all the way right. Briggs is definitely on one side and I don’t think there’s any convincing him otherwise. Whereas Degas can potentially be convinced to go in either direction, depending on what he feels is the right move to make.

So I did something of a travelogue with Shea, and I thought it’d be cool to get your own highlights from each location and sequence, starting with Abu Dhabi International Airport.

Filming in Abu Dhabi, I remember the huge, beautiful airport that we had to ourselves. It’s a massive airport, and we were running up and down that mothersucker. The Osprey was also a special experience. To go from F-18s in Maverick to the Osprey, that was pretty cool.

I thought for sure that you and Shea would have had ample time to get your cardio up in order to do the impossible and chase Tom Cruise for an entire movie, but that wasn’t the case. Shea said that your pursuit was decided last minute in Venice.

Yeah, you know how these things are done. They’re trying to figure out what exactly we’ll be doing, so I wasn’t properly prepared to know that this was what I was gonna be doing. If I did know, I would’ve hired an Olympic running coach to prepare me for it, but it was all in good fun. I can now say that I was a part of Tom’s iconic [slogan of] “running in movies since 1981.”

And what was your takeaway from the escapades in Rome?

Oh man, being in the alley and having a shootout, I thought that was the coolest thing ever. As a young boy, I would play cops and robbers in my mom’s living room and act like I was having shootouts, and now I was finally doing it on the biggest possible scale. So it was my childhood playground coming to life, and that was the most exciting part for me in Rome.

Venice …

I can’t say I have a favorite location because every location has a special place in my heart, but Venice felt like we were all at summer camp. We would all go out late at night and film, and sometimes, we would just walk the streets of Venice or run through the alleyways. It was like we were playing freeze tag. Venice had this mystical feeling like we were in another dimension. It was that magical.

And lastly, the standoff atop a moving train in Norway …

Honestly, Tom would be like, “It’s not going fast enough.” And I remember sitting on top of the train, saying, “What do you mean it’s not going fast enough!?” We were up there with these thin wires attached to our hips from both sides of the train. I think the top speed was 50 miles per hour, I could be wrong, but we were hauling in this valley between mountains. You’re expected to stay in character and act like this is normal, but I can’t say it was the easiest thing to do. There was one take where something happened and I lost my shoe. It fell off the train and off a bridge into a river, and that really scared me. I was like, “Wow, that could have been me.” We never found that shoe, so R.I.P. Nike Air Max.

A PA did everything they could.

Yes, and unfortunately, they couldn’t find it.

Hopefully, there was room in the budget to buy you another pair of shoes.

(Laughs.) Did we? I think it all went towards building the train. So I was barefoot for the rest of the shoot. (Laughs.)

So, Shea said that you still have a ways to go on Part Two. Are you itching to get back? [Writer’s Note: This interview was conducted prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike.]

I’m ready to get back to it. After watching Part One, I immediately texted Tom and McQ to ask, “When do we get back to work?” What McQ and Tom did so well with Part One was complete the story where you’re not left with this giant cliffhanger that feels unfulfilled. You feel like, “Oh wow, I got everything I needed, and if this was the end of just one movie, I would be satisfied.” But at the same time, McQ ends it with just enough of a cliffhanger for you to want more. And despite me being very closely attached to Part One and being in it, I was of two minds while watching it as an audience member. I was like, “I want to see more, so let’s get back to work so that I can see more.”



So I am ready to get back to work and show the world what McQ has cooked up in his head. I have bits and pieces of the story, and I’m excited to put that on screen. Everybody who’s seen it has asked me all these questions, and I want to say, “Stop asking me questions. Just watch Part Two and you’ll get all your answers.” So, once we’re done filming Part Two, everybody will be satisfied. We’re on the verge of topping Part One based on what we’ve filmed so far.

I don’t know how you’re going to top Part One, but I believe that you will.

I was the same way. I didn’t know how, but we’re now on the verge of topping it.

On Top Gun: Maverick, you got to hang out and listen to Tom’s stories. You also shadowed McQ a bit. Did protocols make those extracurriculars rather impossible on Part One?

No, I actually got a chance to really get in there with McQ and Tom, and when I wasn’t filming, I was on set with them. There was never a day that I wasn’t on set. So, while I was watching the film for the first time, I was having these flashback moments of, “Oh wait, I know how this was done even though I wasn’t in the scene.” And it was because I was there. So I really appreciate that McQ and Tom allowed me to come to set and also sit in the editing room with them to see how this was made. They’ve really become great mentors for me in trying to teach me filmmaking, and Tom compared it to passing a baton to me and other filmmakers by saying, “Hey, we want you to continue to make these great films.” So they’re not secretive about their magic. They want to share so that we can continue to have films like this on the big screen, and I thank them for that. I spent a lot of hours just following McQ. He wouldn’t get annoyed, but I would always ask, “Am I annoying you now? Am I annoying you now?” I’d be up against his back everywhere he went and he’d turn around and go, “Tarzan, you’re here.” And I was like, “Yes, I am.” (Laughs.)

Is the Maverick group text still pretty active?

It’s never quiet. It’s probably not as active, but it’s never quiet. We’re all doing our own things, which is great, but it’s hard for us to see each other in person. Jay [Ellis] is in one country. I’m here in New York with Danny [Ramirez] for the premiere, but he was filming somewhere recently. Lewis [Pullman] and Monica [Barbaro] have also been filming, but we still find time to say, “Hey, what’s up? Hey, congratulations. I saw this. Hey, are you in town?” Glen hit us up to say, “Hey, I just got back to L.A. Who’s in town? Can we link up?” Unfortunately, only Lewis was in town at the time, so I believe he went to see him. So we’re still a family, and that won’t change. That was a special, special group.

Did you send them photos from the Mission set?

No, I didn’t! I am big on holding secrets. I hate spoilers. I hate when people give me spoilers. I hate spoiling things for other people. So when I booked Mission, they found out later from a press release photo of me on top of the train with Tom, Esai [Morales] and Shea. They were like, “You didn’t tell us that you were on Mission!” And I was like, “My bad, my bad.” So I’ve kept all of that secret, but I think Monica and Lewis are gonna see Mission today in L.A. and Danny is gonna watch the film with me at the New York premiere.

In the realm of big-budget movies, we often assume that every detail is meticulously planned and has a purpose. However, Brando's bucket had a simple explanation: he saw it on set, put it on his head, and refused to take it off. Interestingly, Mission:Impossible actress Rebecca Ferguson has a similar story behind her character's use of an eyepatch in Dead Reckoning Part One, and the practical reason for the eyewear is far from what you would probably guess.

In the world of cinema, and especially action movies , it's not uncommon for actors to sport unique accessories or don unconventional costumes to enhance their characters. These additions can add intrigue and a distinct look, especially for antagonists. In an interview with Hey U Guys , the Ilsa Faust actress shared the practical reason behind her M:I character's eyepatch. Humorously, she revealed:

You'd think that the reason for the eyepatch is a cool one. It is not, alas... It's because I can't fucking wink. [Christopher McQuarrie] lined up the shot, I took [the gun], I was ready, I was breathing, and he goes, 'Now close your eye.' And I went [struggles to close one eye], And he went, 'Now, close the one eye... Ok, other shot, other angle. Close the eye!' [Struggles to close one eye] 'Can we get an eyepatch? Anyone?' There's nothing more to it than that.

The incident is a prime example of unforeseen challenges that can arise during a film shoot. Perhaps no one anticipated Rebecca's difficulty in closing just one eye, but a quick solution became necessary with the scene ready to be filmed. And according to the Doctor Sleep actress's costar, Simon Pegg, that’s par for the course regarding the popular spy series. In the same interview, he added:

But out of circumstances, beautiful things are born. That's 'Mission' all the way ... We hit an obstacle, we pivot, and the pivot always makes it better.

Despite her inability to blink, it hasn't stopped the Dune star from becoming a fashion icon . During the world tour premieres of Mission: Impossible 7 (which included Tom Cruise flying to four cities in 24 hours ) Rebecca Ferguson, alongside the rest of the talented cast , made stunning style statements. She opted for an extravagant white ensemble for the London premiere instead of the typical dark attire. Rocking a remarkable Vivienne Westwood Spring 2023 gown from their bridal collection, she captured everyone's attention with her impeccable fashion sense. Who needs to be able to close one eye at a time when they can make such a remarkable fashion statement?

The first half of Ethan Hunt and Cruise's final installment in the franchise is now showing in theaters. While CinemaBlend's Eric Eisenberg found it less than satisfying , critical reception has been very positive, with a current Rotten Tomatoes score of 96% after 272 reviews. So, take your own time to watch it and witness Ferguson's exceptional eyepatch use for yourself to form your own opinion.

As the movie hits theaters, viewers can immerse themselves in Ethan Hunt's latest adventure or revisit past missions. All six previous movies are now streaming with a Paramount+ subscription .

Doing My Nails

I love when nail polish has a name that makes me laugh — Natural Connection, Sexy Divide. Usually I do the same color on every nail, or sometimes I do lilac on one hand but with the ring finger green, and then the other hand I do green with a lilac ring finger.

Horseback Riding

I found a ranch in Colorado that I love to go to — it’s my happy place. I have a horse there I love called Mister T. He’s amazing. He goes so fast, but he listens, too. There are dunes so it looks like Star Wars; it looks like you’re almost on the moon. It’s just stunning.

There’s this incredible artist in Korea I love — his Instagram handle is @tattooist_doy. He makes such delicate, intricate, beautiful tattoos. Years ago when I was in Korea to promote “Avengers,” he inked a sweet violet on my forearm. It’s a little flower I used to pick with my uncle in the woods when I was little. I’m planning to get another one with him the next time I go to Asia.

2023-06-25 18:10:00.700000+00:00,Christopher McQuarrie on the Two-Part Challenges of Dead Reckoning,"Making a Mission: Impossible movie is already a big effort, so you can imagine how difficult that is for one that's been split into two parts.","Splitting films into multiple parts is still a fairly recent phenomenon, and 2023 has multiple “Chapter One” movies playing in theaters. In addition to Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, the first movie in Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon saga is coming in December, Fast X was its own “Part One” back in May, and next month will see the release of Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One.



Speaking to IGN and Collider during the film’s premiere, writer/director Christopher McQuarrie talked about some of the challenges that come with making a multi-part movie. Prior to Covid, Dead Reckoning was originally meant to be shot back-to-back, but according to him, one of the bigger issues was stopping production on one film in order to focus on the other part. “There was the challenge of stopping in the middle,” he said, “not even knowing what the full movie was, and trying to predict what it was in the second film.” Because of factors like an actor’s availability and the weather, for example, “certain things” in Part Two required Part One production to be stopped.

Production on Part Two began in March 2022, and is set to start back up again one the production circuit for Part One has fully ended. By McQuarrie’s own admission, he still hasn’t entirely locked down the ending, saying he and longtime collaborator Tom Cruise tend to figure things out as they go along. “Tom and I never obsess about executing the plan,” he said. “I could tell you that I know what the end of Part Two is, but I can’t guarantee that that will be the ending when we get there. [...] We always have a direction, we always have a place we’re going.”

Splitting Dead Reckoning into two parts wasn’t originally McQuarrie’s plan, but naturally, it apparently became “so big”—bigger than 2018's Mission: Impossible—Fallout, even—that all the moving parts and players couldn’t fit into a single movie. He chalked that up mainly to the characters: the movie has a larger cast than earlier installments, and he wanted each of them to have a sizable part to play in the story. It wasn’t in response to a trend, he said, but because it has “a lot of characters, a lot of action. [...] It wasn’t just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie.”

We’ll see how that claim holds up when Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning arrives in theaters on July 12, with Part Two currently slated to come out on June 28, 2024. Look for our review of the first film closer to release.

2023-07-11 06:51:06+00:00,Did Tom Cruise Ban Peter Overton From The 'Mission Impossible' Premiere?,"Journalist Peter Overton has come out in defence of Tom Cruise, hailing both his skills as an actor and his role in reviving cinema.","Nine Network journalist Peter Overton has come out in defence of Tom Cruise, hailing both his skills as an actors and his role in reviving cinema.

The endorsement of the Hollywood icon comes after rumours that Cruise and his team banned Overton from attending the “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” premiere in Sydney last week and from interviewing Cruise on the red carpet.

The feud reportedly stems from a 2005 “60 Minutes” interview between the two, in which tensions flare over Overton’s line of questioning about Cruise’s split from Nicole Kidman and how the two will continue to communicate and care for their children.

During the interview, which occasionally resurfaces in the tabloids and social media, Cruise told Overton he was “stepping over the line” and implored him to “take responsibility” for his line of questioning. He also told Overton to “put your manners back in”.

Overton was absent from the film’s premiere this year, which was attended by many other news anchors, entertainment reporters and media identities. His absense has given rise to a rumour that he was ‘banned’ from attending due to his conduct in 2005.

Overton has now spoken about the rumours and conceded that he was not invited.

“I wouldn’t have a clue,” he told Nova Sydney’s breakfast radio program “Fitzy and Wippa with Kate Ritchie” when asked if he was banned from the event. “No, we didn’t get an invite, but I also had another thing to do – the 6 o’clock news,” he said, in reference to his role as anchor of Nine’s nightly news bulletin.

Overton conceded that he hadn’t spoken to Cruise in the 18 years since the interview, but said he continued to admire his work and what he had achieved for cinema from a distance.

“Every now and then [the interview] pops up, but you know, I’ve always said, I like Tom. I think it’s amazing what he’s done with “Top Gun: Maverick“. I’ve seen that a couple of times. “Mission Impossible”, I can’t wait to see.

“And the bottom line is, he’s a great actor, what he’s done for Hollywood in a really tough period with COVID and so on, is he has put the big-screen movies back in the cinema in a huge way, and we’re all going to see them.”

Overton told the trio he would definitely be attending the “Mission Impossible” film and thought Cruise was fantastic to still be doing his own stunts and creating the kind of cinema he is today.

The film’s writer and director Christopher McQuarrie has been similarly impassioned about Cruise’s role in saving big cinema.

“The person I want to compliment is the person who will always dodge the compliments. It’s this man, Mr. Tom Cruise. When this whole process started four years ago, we were entering a period where it looked like this event was headed for extinction. It was a very real possibility that this medium that we loved so much was on its way out. One person said, ‘No, we’re gonna keep it going’. And that’s this man right here,” McQuarrie said.

When approached by Variety Australia, Nine denied its star presenter was banned from the premiere. Paramount Pictures, the distributor of the film, did not respond to a request for comment.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vYXUudmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvdG9tLWNydWlzZS1wZXRlci1vdmVydG9uLTk1NTAv0gFKaHR0cHM6Ly9hdS52YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy90b20tY3J1aXNlLXBldGVyLW92ZXJ0b24tOTU1MC8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-11 18:17:08+00:00,Tom Cruise ‘Working Diligently’ on His Next Movie Shot in Space: ‘We’ll See Where We Go’,Tom Cruise teases his next movie set in space and 'Dead Reckoning Part Two.',"Tom Cruise is still preparing to boldly go where no actor has gone before.

He and his “Edge of Tomorrow” director Doug Liman are set to film a movie in space and make Cruise the first civilian to perform a spacewalk. Universal is backing the film, which has a budget of around $200 million.

When asked about his space-set movie at the “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” premiere in New York on Monday, Cruise said he didn’t have a production start date set, but, “We’ve been working on it diligently and we’ll see where we go.”

Of course, Cruise still needs to finish making “Dead Reckoning Part Two,” the potential finale of his “Mission: Impossible” series, before he can plot his next movie. Writer and director Christopher McQuarrie, who’s overseeing both “Dead Reckoning” movies, said he and Cruise are getting right back to work on “Part Two” as soon as the “Part One” press tour ends.

“We finish this tour, and on our way back to the U.K. we stop to scout along the way. We hit the ground running as soon as we get back,” McQuarrie told Variety. “I get two days of vacation between here and Tokyo and I’m back on.”

The latest “Mission: Impossible” film, which opens in theaters Wednesday, pits Cruise’s IMF agent Ethan Hunt against a mysterious villain from his past, and reunites him with allies Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson).

But the greatest draw of any “Mission: Impossible” movie is, of course, the stunts, and “Dead Reckoning Part One” doesn’t disappoint. In the film, Cruise drives a motorcycle off a massive cliff and parachutes safely down to the ground. When asked about that morning on set, Cruise said it was just a “usual day.”

“I keep things pretty calm, nothing unusual. The usual day for me,” he told Variety. “We wake up, and I remember that morning McQuarrie and I came to set, and normally we’re talking about story and the characters, just keep it real casual — as casual as possible. We know what’s happening. I remember getting there in the morning and the ramp was ice. You can see in the EPK as I’m jumping out of the helicopter to test the wind down there, they’re cleaning the ramp of ice. You just go through it nice and easy, no changes.”

Pegg, who has starred opposite Cruise in five “Mission: Impossible” films so far, said the one-of-a-kind action star carried “cinema itself” on his shoulders while making “Dead Reckoning Part One” during the pandemic.

“I’m very driven, I am ambitious, I care deeply about my job, but I don’t have cinema itself on my shoulders,” Pegg told Variety. “I feel like Tom, particularly during the making of this movie, felt like that. I felt like he was facing an existential crisis in the form of the pandemic, and he just wouldn’t be cared by it. I don’t know if I have it in me to do what he does, I literally don’t. There’s a reason why he’s the only one who does this stuff. There isn’t an actor working who does what he does.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvdG9tLWNydWlzZS1zcGFjZS1tb3ZpZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy0xMjM1NjY2ODA3L9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvdG9tLWNydWlzZS1zcGFjZS1tb3ZpZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy0xMjM1NjY2ODA3L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-23 11:19:08+00:00,ET Exclusive Interview With Pom Klementieff: The Pretty Deadly Force Of Mission Impossible,Pom Klementieff joins the Mission: Impossible world as the mysterious Paris.,"Pom Klementieff joins the Mission: Impossible world as the mysterious Paris.



An associate of Gabriel (Esai Morales), a man who shares a dangerous history with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), Paris is a woman of few words and deadly actions.



She will let nothing – and nobody – get in her way as she pursues her quarry across the globe.

Beginning her career in her native France, Klementieff became beloved by international audiences with her breakout role as Mantis in the Guardians Of The Galaxy series, a part that combined her gifts for comedy and physical action.



A long-time student of multiple martials arts, Klementieff puts all her combat skills to use in Mission Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One as one of Hunt’s mostly dangerous rivals ever.

Egypt Today exclusively interviewed Mission Impossible _ Dead Reckoning's star about her first experience in Mission Impossible world and her collaboration with Tom Cruise and McQ.

1-You’re new to the Mission team. How would you describe your experience ?

“The whole filming experience has been incredible and it is inspiring to work with filmmakers like Tom and McQ. Their vision is so beautiful and cinematic, and the action sequences and locations are stunning. It was a dream of mine to be part of this franchise. Before I was cast in the film, I was training and learning martial arts. When I would block off the training in my calendar, instead of writing in ‘stunt training’ or ‘martial arts class’, I sometimes would write ‘Mission: Impossible’ instead. I did that for fun, but also as a way to manifest the type of movies I want to be a part of.”

2-Why have you wanted to do a Mission: Impossible movie for so long?

“I have always been a huge fan. I was quite young when I saw the first Mission: Impossible movie. I saw it on an old black and white TV. Even though the TV wasn’t working that well, I was mesmerised by the action and Ethan hanging from that wire. The cast included Jean Reno and Emanuelle Beart, and it was the first big Hollywood movie I remember seeing French actors in. It opened the door in my mind that French actors could be in these big American movies, and maybe I could be in a movie like Mission: Impossible one day. I have been wanting to make an action movie for a while now. It is one of the reasons I do martial arts in my spare time. And Mission: Impossible films are amazing examples of great action films. Plus, the females in the film are very strong characters and have their own agency. They are fighters and equals – not just the girlfriend waiting to be saved.”

3-What can you tell us about your character, Paris? She seems like a pretty deadly force.

“Paris works with Esai Morales’ character, Gabriel. She’s a mysterious, enigmatic presence with many layers to her personality. And she’s a fighter. On these movies they develop the fighting styles of each character around each actor’s ability. Because I have been training in martial arts for quite a while, doing things like kickboxing and taekwondo and other disciplines, we came up with a way of fighting that incorporated all of that. So, she has different action abilities.”

4-What was it like to work with Tom Cruise?

“Tom inspires me and challenges me every day. He works so hard and is a very generous human being, both on and off screen. While he is the star of the film, he is very collaborative and always makes sure other characters have their moment to shine.”

5-What’s the process of building your character on a Mission: Impossible movie?

“Unlike other films, the character doesn’t start on the page. It evolves. It can be a scary process because there is nothing on the page at first. Finding Paris was a team effort with all the departments involved. We did a lot of camera tests, trying different variations of hair, make-up and costumes. We played around with how I carried myself and the physicality of the character. As an actor it was fascinating and I am not sure any other filmmakers could pull it off. It was scary at times, but also very freeing as well.”

6-Why is McQ such a great director for these movies?

“McQ is a visionary. He has such a sense of the frame, composition and movement. He works just as hard at the dialogue as the angle and composition of a shot. He can get his actors to convey emotions without speaking and directs us physically in ways that feel organic. Each character in this film is special and he makes everyone strong in their own way. I have learned so much working with him.”

7-Where did you look for inspiration when preparing to play Paris?

“When it came to Paris, I was inspired by watching animals. Weird animals – prehistoric birds, like the shoebill stork. I would watch videos of them when it came to figuring out how she moves. Because this is such a physical role, I also worked out a lot with Sam Eastwood, and did Pilates, to build up my core to prevent injuries. I also learned sword fighting – and I loved it!”

8-What can audiences expect from the biggest Mission: Impossible yet?

“They can expect to be blown away. There are so many really cool action scenes. The fights are stunning. The car chase in Rome is amazing. The tone of the movie is really different. There is something mystical and haunting about it. But it’s also fun, touching and an amazing action film.”

9-What's was your favourite scene to shoot in this movie, and why?

“There are so many amazing scenes in the movie, but my favourite scene to shoot was an action sequence in Venice. We trained for almost a year choreographing the scene. It was intricate to shoot because of how narrow the alleyway is. It meant we had to get creative with movements and camera placement. We played with heights instead of widths, to make the fight scene unique.”

10-What would you say to any other actors who may join the Mission: Impossible franchise in the future? What can they expect from their experience?

“It is one of the most exciting and unique experiences. With Tom and McQ leading, it creates a domino effect with everyone inspiring and complementing each other. And you might get addicted to sky diving.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVneXB0dG9kYXkuY29tL0FydGljbGUvNC8xMjU4MDEvRVQtRXhjbHVzaXZlLUludGVydmlldy1XaXRoLVBvbS1LbGVtZW50aWVmZi1UaGUtUHJldHR5LURlYWRseS1Gb3JjZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

AND HE AND HIS IMF TEAM ARE TRYING TO TRACK DOWN A WEAPON BEFORE IT GETS INTO THE WRONG HANDS. REBECCA FERGUSON AS ILSA FAUST HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE PART OF THIS FRANCHISE EVER SINCE SHE WAS INTRODUCED IN ROGUE NATION. AND SHE AND TOM CRUISE JUST HAVE SO MUCH CHEMISTRY. SIMON PEGG, VING RHAMES, VANESSA KIRBY, THEY’RE ALL BACK. AND IN THIS FILM, HAYLEY ATWELL AND POM KLEMENTIEFF PLAY NEW CHARACTERS THIS TIME AROUND TO I’M NOT GOING TO GET INTO TOO MUCH BECAUSE LIKE I SAID, I DON’T WANT TO GET INTO TOO MANY SPOILERS. I WANT PEOPLE TO JUST SEE THE TRAILER AND GO IN AND HAVE A GREAT TIME. THE FILM IS ALMOST THREE HOURS, BUT IT GOES BY VERY, VERY FAST. THE STUNTS ARE A FIVE OUT OF FIVE. OKAY, TOM CRUISE DROVE A MOTORCYCLE OFF OF THAT CLIFF THAT YOU SEE RIGHT HERE, SIX TIMES TO GET THE SHOT RIGHT. AND HE JUST LOOKS FANTASTIC DOING IT. THE TRAIN SEQUENCE IN THE CLIMAX OF THE FILM IS NONSTOP AND LIKE I SAID, THE STUNTS ARE JUST FANTASTIC. I COULD WATCH ALL THOSE ACTION SCENES ALL OVER AGAIN. THERE’S ONE THING THAT HAPPENS IN THIS FILM, ONE SPECIFIC PLOT POINT THAT I WAS NOT A FAN OF AT ALL, AND THAT’S WHY MY RATING IS WHERE IT IS. I ALSO THOUGHT THERE WAS WAY TOO MUCH EXPOSITION OF SAYING THE MISSION OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE SAME TYPE OF VERBIAGE AND LANGUAGE WAS SAID THROUGHOUT I’M GIVING MISSION IMPOSSIBLE DEAD RECKONING PART 1A3 AND A HALF OUT OF FIVE. I’M LOOKING FORWARD TO PART TWO COMING OUT NEXT SUMMER. HOPEFULLY NEXT SUMMER. WITH EVERYTHING YOU KNOW, WITH THE STRIKE TO SEE HOW THEY FINISH THIS STORY. BUT DEFINITELY SEE IT ON THE BIGGEST AND LOUDEST SCREEN YOU CAN FIND IMAX OR DOLBY FOR SURE. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND SEEING IT IN EITHER OF THOSE THEATERS. SO I LOVE THE ACTION PART. SO THAT PART YOU GAVE A FIVE OUT OF FIVE STILL HAVE TO GO CHECK IT OUT. BUT NEXT UP, THE SUMMER I TURNED PRETTY. YES, THE SUMMER I TURNED PRETTY. SEASON TWO HAS PREMIERED ON AMAZON PRIME. THE FIRST EPISODES ARE NOW STREAMING. IF YOU’RE A FAN OF TEEN ANGST, YOUNG LOVE TRIANGLES, FAMILY DRAMA, THEN THIS IS YOUR SHOW SEASON TWO CONTINUES WITH OUR HEROINE BELLY STORY AND THE LOVE TRIANGLE BETWEEN TWO BROTHERS SHE GREW UP WITH. ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE SHOW, THOUGH, IS THE SOUNDTRACK CREATOR JENNY HAN, WHO OF COURSE DID TO ALL THE BOYS I LOVE BEFORE FRANCHISE ON NETFLIX. SHE MADE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE SONG IN THIS SERIES WAS A HIT. IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN INSANE BUDGET FOR THE SOUNDTRACK BECAUSE THERE’S SEVERAL TAYLOR SWIFT SONGS, ONE DIRECTION. ALL OF THE HITS ARE IN THERE. THE SOUNDTRACK IS A BIG PART OF THE SERIES. I’VE SEEN ALL EIGHT EPISODES AND I DO SAY I ENJOYED THE LAST HALF OF THE SEASON A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THE FIRST HALF. BUT YES, I THINK IT’S A FANTASTIC SERIES FOR THIS YOUNG LOVE AND TEEN ANGST AND ALL OF THE ACTORS. LOLA TUNG, GAVIN CASTELLANO, THEY’RE A FANTASTIC TOGETHER. SO I’M GIVING SEASON TWO OF THE SUMMER I TURN PRETTY A FOUR OUT OF FIVE STARS. OH, THAT’S A LOT OF STARS. DO WE HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT? THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. LAUREN.

,Tom Cruise surprises cinemagoers at Mission: Impossible 7 screenings across US,"‘You definitely dream of moments like this,’ actor told crowds","Tom Cruise surprised cinemagoers as he showed up at a number of screenings for the new Mission: Impossible film.

The 61-year-old stars in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, the seventh film in the action franchise, which is in cinemas now.

On Tuesday (11 July), just days after the film hit screens, Cruise made a number of appearances in cinemas across the US and Canada.

He attended screenings at destinations including AMC Georgetown in Washington, DC, AMC Sunset Place 24 in South Miami, Florida, Regal Atlantic Station in Atlanta, Georgia and Scotiabank Theatre in Toronto.

Cruise was joined by director Christopher McQuarrie, with the pair speaking to the packed-out cinemas before each screening.

“You definitely dream of moments like this,” Cruise explained, describing the experience as “amazing”.

“Hope you enjoy the film, ‘cause we made it for you,” he said, before posing for photos with attendees.

Cruise stars in the latest Mission: Impossible film opposite Hayley Atwell, Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby.

In an interview with The Independent, Atwell spoke about joining the franchise and the rumours that had suggested she and Cruise were dating. Atwell recently got engaged to composer Ned Wolfgang Kelly.

Insisting that she saw McQuarrie and Cruise as “sort of two uncles”, Atwell said: “I would be like, ‘Ooh, there’s some weird rumours, and it feels base, it feels a little dirty, it feels grubby, it’s not what I’m about.’ Why are things being assumed or projected onto me about my relationship with my work colleague and boss?”

Cruise also visited the AMC Sunset Place in Miami, Florida (Getty Images for Paramount Pictu)

Atwell said that she found it “upsetting” because “it’s involving people in my actual life, my personal life, who have to be on the receiving end of that. It becomes invasive”.

2023-07-21 19:53:01+00:00,Mission: Impossible's Kittridge Almost Returned In Rogue Nation Before Dead Reckoning,But we're glad it worked out the way it did.,"Mission: Impossible's Kittridge Almost Returned In Rogue Nation Before Dead Reckoning

Brian De Palma's original ""Mission: Impossible"" subverted just about everything about the TV series it was based on. Ordinarily, the show would follow a skilled team of spies who use gadgets, wit, and impressive espionage skills to track down enemy spies and ultra-powerful criminals. In the movie, the team was assembled and the objectives were clear when De Palma elected to murder the entire team. The only survivor was a new character, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) whom the audience hadn't previously known. It was later revealed that the man behind the slaying of Ethan's team was none other than Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), the hero of the original TV series. This would be like if a ""Star Trek"" movie killed the main cast, leaving Ensign Jones as the main character. And then it was revealed that Captain Kirk was the one who betrayed everyone.

In a notable scene in ""Mission: Impossible,"" Ethan Hunt reconnoitered at a Prague restaurant after his IMF team was killed. Ethan, confused and sweaty, talks to Agent Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny) who lays out the actual plot of the movie. It seems that IMF had been infiltrated by a mole keen on selling IMF secrets on the black market. Kittridge knew that someone on Ethan's team was the mole, but not who. Given that Ethan was the only survivor, the finger was pointed directly at him. Uh oh.

Kittridge becomes the film's antagonist after that scene, aiming to apprehend Ethan at all costs. He was a good character and Czerny gave an intense performance.

To the pleasure of ""M:I"" fans, Kittridge returns in the new film ""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One"" to provide portent. According to a recent interview in ""Variety,"" however, Kittridge almost returned in an earlier chapter in the series.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTMzOTIwMi9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUta2l0dHJpZGdlLWFsbW9zdC1yZXR1cm5lZC1pbi1yb2d1ZS1uYXRpb24tYmVmb3JlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

And is there any Doctor Who role he hasn’t played? Ask all this and more of the actor and writer,"If you were going to invite anyone to your fantasy dinner party table, actor and writer Mark Gatiss would be perfect. He’d have some stories about the BBC’s The League of Gentlemen – perhaps letting us in on the secret of what exactly is Hilary Briss the butcher’s “special stuff” added ingredient. He could let you know what it’s like being Sherlock Holmes’ older brother Mycroft (and what their parents were thinking when they were dishing out forenames), after starring in and co-writing four series of Sherlock with Steven Moffat. Gatiss has also appeared in Game of Thrones and written and acted in multiple episodes of Doctor Who, playing a mad scientist opposite David Tennant, a creepy alien with Matt Smith and a first world war captain opposite Peter Capaldi.

On film (which is why we’re all here, of course), he has been in Shaun of the Dead, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, Dad’s Army (the 2016 film), Christopher Robin, Operation Mincemeat and now features in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One as the head of the NSA.

The actress is one of many names currently being speculated to take on the role of Sue Storm (aka Invisible Woman) in the next MCU outing, and Kirby certainly hinted she'd be keen to follow in the footsteps of Jessica Alba and Kate Mara, who both brought the character to life in previous Fantastic Four movies.

""It would be an honour,"" Kirby told Comicbook.com in an interview alongside her Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning, Part One co-star Pom Klementieff, though she didn't give away too much more.

Klementieff, who plays Mantis in the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, was pretty excited at the prospect of Kirby joining her in the MCU, though.

""We could work together!"" she exclaimed.

But if all the casting rumours are to be believed, The Crown actress could face some tough competition for the Marvel role. Pam & Tommy star Lily James, Killing Eve's Jodie Comer and The Dropout's Amanda Seyfried have all also been linked to the part.

But that's not all. Amsterdam actress Saoirse Ronan, Hamilton's Phillipa Soo and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel star Rachel Brosnahan are three other actors fans believe could be the next Sue Storm.

The rumour mill is also going into overdrive around the casting for Mr Fantastic. To date, Star Wars star Adam Driver, You's Penn Badgeley, Slumdog Millionaire star Dev Patel and Andor's Diego Luna are names speculated for the leading role.

One person we know for sure will be working on the project though? WandaVision director Matt Shakman. He's on board to direct the next much-anticipated Fantastic Four movie (which is now scheduled for a 2025 release) alongside scriptwriters Jeff Kaplan and Ian Springer.

Back in February, Shakman addressed the Fantastic Four casting theories from fans, telling Comicbook.com: ""I love these characters. I love the chance that we have to bring them to the MCU and I really want to get it right and I know that everybody out there is really excited and feels passionate in the same way wanting to get it right.

,Pom Klementieff and Simon Pegg Hilariously Prank MTV UK Reporter,"With Simon Pegg in her ear, ""Mission: Impossible"" star Pom Klementieff leaves MTV UK reporter Harriet Rose reeling with some of her ridiculous claims, like falling in love with a horse and that a Millennial killed her dog.","MTV UK

Simon Pegg was in his ""Mission: Impossible"" co-star Pom Klementieff's ear the whole time she was being interviewed by MTV's Harriet Rose leading to some hilariously uncomfortable moments.

It's a classic prank format that never gets old, with Pom Klementieff turning in an award-worthy performance. During a recent UK interview with MTV UK's Harriet Rose, Pom had her ""Mission: Impossible"" co-star Simon Pegg in her ear feeding her nonsense the whole time.

It was about as perfectly executed as a prank like this can be, with Pom not just delivering the ridiculous lines Simon was feeding her, but actually digging deep and emoting. When she had to say that a Millennial killed her dog, she made us feel that loss.

Honestly, we're not sure if we've seen a funnier execution of this prank, as Harriet was so sweet and concerned throughout, both for the sad and strange things Pom kept saying and at times, perhaps, for Pom's mental well-being.

Simon really put his ""Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning, Part One"" co-star through the wringer on this one, not only having her have to share that her dog was killed by a Millennial in a brutally savage way, which Pom teared up while saying (chef's kiss!), but she had to drop hashtags in her movie description, mess up Harriet's name and get super-giddy while miming action sequences.

At one point, she even had to express that she'd fallen in love with a horse. We're not sure who was having more fun in these sequences, Pom really selling the nonsense while somehow keeping a (mostly) straight face, or Simon dying on the other side of the monitor.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdG9vZmFiLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3LzEzL3BvbS1rbGVtZW50aWVmZi1zaW1vbi1wZWdnLXByYW5rLWJyaXRpc2gtbXR2LXJlcG9ydGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

2023-07-25 09:07:09+00:00,Pom Klementieff Deserves an Oscar for This ‘Mission: Impossible’ Interview Alone,Let’s hope this prank leads Klementieff and Pegg to be cast in more movies together ASAP!,"Interviews are a staple of promoting movies. The stars of the film, both big and small, are contractually obligated to attend different junkets and individual interviews in order to talk the movie up to get fans excited to see it.

As these types of interactions are standard practice, these interviews and junkets are pretty straightforward with the interviewer asking questions about the film and the actors answering them with their normal amount of charm and charisma.

However, when it comes to the press tour for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, two of the stars—Pom Klementieff and Simon Pegg—decided to mix things up as they pulled off a hilarious prank during one interview.

Mission: Impossible 7 interview derailed by hidden earpiece

This particular interview was held by MTV UK and was hosted by their pop culture reporter Harriet Rose. Things got off the rails in the first few seconds when it was revealed that all of the answers Klementieff will give during this particular interaction would be fed to her through an earpiece controlled by Pegg.

Pegg starts off small by getting Klementieff to act confused by Rose’s name and continuously ask her how to pronounce it. Then, when Rose asks Klementieff to describe her character, Paris, Pegg gets her to use the word “hashtag” as much as possible, which leads to Klementieff almost breaking with laughter when she uses the phrase “#Rome” when describing a chase scene her character has with Tom Cruise and Hayley Atwell.

But, the truly best moment comes towards the middle of the interview when Rose says that she’s a millennial to which Klementieff responds by saying that she hates millennials because “one beat her dog to death with his phone.” The look on Rose’s face was absolutely priceless and, much like Pegg, I couldn’t stop laughing for a long, long time.

You can check out the full hilarious interview below:

Unsurprisingly, Twitter absolutely ate this interview up with people particularly praising Klementieff’s comedic talent, which isn’t much of a surprise as she was part of the funniest Marvel franchise—Guardians of the Galaxy—for almost a decade.

Below are some of the best responses to the interview:

7/16/2023 16:34,"‘Mission: Impossible’ debuts with $80M over five days, igniting box office but missing expectations","After a globe-trotting publicity blitz by star Tom Cruise, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” launched with a franchise-best $80 million over five days, though it came in shy of industry expectations with a $56.2 million haul over the three-day weekend.","NEW YORK (AP) — After a globe-trotting publicity blitz by star Tom Cruise, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” launched with a franchise-best $80 million over five days, though it came in shy of industry expectations with a $56.2 million haul over the three-day weekend, according to studio estimates.
The Paramount Pictures debut was boosted by strong overseas sales of $155 million from 70 markets. But while a $235 million worldwide launch marked one of the best global openings of the year, “Dead Reckoning” couldn’t approach the high-speed velocity of last summer’s top film, “Top Gun: Maverick.”
“Dead Reckoning Part One,” the seventh film in the 27-year-old series, had been forecast to better the franchise high of the previous installment, “Fallout,” which opened with $61 million domestically in 2018. Instead, it also fell short of the $57.8 million “Mission: Impossible II” debuted with in 2000.
That puts the film’s opening-weekend tally very close to the tepid launch of Disney’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which opened in U.S. and Canadian theaters with $82 million over five days and $60 million over the three-day weekend. Paramount and Skydance had higher hopes for the action extravaganza of “Dead Reckoning,” which cost $290 million to make, not counting marketing expenses.
Those costs were inflated, in part, by the pandemic. “Dead Reckoning,” directed by Christopher McQuarrie, was among the first major productions shut down by COVID-19. It was preparing to shoot in Italy in March 2020. When the film got back on track, McQuarrie and Cruise helped lead the industry-wide recovery back to film sets – albeit with some well-publicized friction over protocols along the way.
Still, “Dead Reckoning” was hailed as a high point in the franchise. Critics (96% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and fans (an “A” CinemaScore) alike came away awed by the stunts and chases of the latest “Mission: Impossible” film. Though the coming competition of “Barbenheimer” — the much-anticipated debuts of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” — looms, “Mission: Impossible” should play well for weeks to come.
“This is a global franchise. It’s going gangbusters and its going to play for a long time. Quality always wins in the end,” said Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount.
“Dead Reckoning,” Aronson said, met or exceeded the studio’s expectations.
“In international markets, in like-for-like markets, we’re 15% ahead of ‘Fallout,’ and that’s taking China out,” added Aronson. “Domestically, we’re over 3% ahead of ‘Fallout’ for the first five days. To beat its predecessor is phenomenal, especially in this environment.”
Cruise, the so-called savior of movie theaters last year, traveled tirelessly to again pump life back into a summer box office that’s been sluggish. After a splashy world premiere in Rome with a red-carpet on the Spanish Steps, Cruise and McQuarrie surprised theaters in Atlanta, Miami, Toronto and Washington D.C. in the days ahead of opening.
“Dead Reckoning” hit theaters at a crucial mid-summer period for Hollywood, and not just because of the SAG-AFTRA strike which began Thursday. “Mission: Impossible” launched a week before one of the biggest box-office showdowns of the year.
Though “Dead Reckoning” and “Oppenheimer” have vied for some of the same IMAX screens, each film has publicly endorsed the idea that a rising tide lifts all blockbusters. Cruise and McQuarrie in early July even bought opening-weekend tickets to both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.” “Barbie” director Greta Gerwig and “Oppenheimer” filmmaker Christopher Nolan reciprocated with their own gestures of support.
However that trio of films performs over the next few weeks will do a lot to determine the fate of the summer box office.
“These are a crucial couple of weeks for the industry starting this weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. “I think it’s going to be a fun reinvigoration of the box office because we have had a few films underperforming. Really, the summer movie season restarts this week with ‘Mission’ leading into ‘Barbenheimer.’”
No other new wide release challenged “Mission: Impossible” over the weekend. Second place went to Angel Studios’ faith-based political thriller “Sound of Freedom” which increased 37% in its second with $27 million. Jim Caveziel stars in the child trafficking drama.
Last week’s top film, “ Insidious: The Red Door "" slid to third with $13 million in its second weekend. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is dropping quickly with $12 million its third weekend, with a domestical total so far of $145.4 million.
In limited release, the Searchlight Pictures’ mockumentary “Theater Camp” opened to $270,000 from six theaters in New York and Los Angeles.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.
1. “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” $56.2 million.
2. “Sound of Freedom,” $27 million.
3. “Insidious: The Red Door,” $13 million.
4. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” $12 million.
5. “Elemental,” $8.7 million.

2023-07-17 15:11:00+00:00,"'Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part 2' Release Date, Spoilers, Details",It's Tom Cruise versus the machine once 'Dead Reckoning Part Two' hits theaters.,"There's something inherently sold to audiences with a title like Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One. The dead will reckon, of course. That's a given. But every Part One needs a Part Two. It's the first time in the Mission: Impossible series that a major plotline will move from one film to it next installment. It's an emerging trend in Hollywood, with both Fast X and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse splitting up their respective stories. This probably stems back to the success of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Either that, or filmmakers just realized that cliffhangers are cool. (Sometimes.)
Regardless, when the seventh Mission: Impossible film ends, we're left with only half the story. Even something as silly as the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) can get complicated, of course. And make no mistake, Dead Reckoning goes full Lord of the Rings. There's a new powerful A.I. villain called ""The Entity,"" which has access to the world's technology—and Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) must take a special key to its home and destroy it.
Of course, it's not so simple. Every major power in the world wants that key, and The Entity has also employed the work of a dark figure from Hunt's past named Gabriel (Esai Morales). Who is this guy, and why is Hunt so afraid of him? All will presumably be answered in Part Two—granted that they don't surprise us with a whole trilogy. Below, here's everything we know so far about Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part Two.
Tom Cruise will have to top this motorcycle stunt again... somehow. Christian Black // Paramount
What Will Dead Reckoning Part Two Be About?
Much has gone unsolved since the end of Dead Reckoning Part One. Ethan Hunt may have the key, but he has no idea that The Entity lives thousands of miles underwater in an abandoned submarine. Well, we do! Sadly, we can't just yell it at the screen, Dora the Explorer-style. He'll have to figure that one out himself. We'll also (likely) learn about the event that caused Ethan Hunt and Gabriel to become enemies. It seems as if he stabbed and killed a woman—possibly someone close to Ethan, or maybe an associate that they both worked with before Gabriel betrayed them. Oh, and Part Two will also have the destroy The Entity. That A.I. just has to go!
Who Will Return for Part Two?
If you survived Part Two, my best guess is that you'll be back the second installment. Even Pom Klementieff—who barely made it out of this one alive, apparently—will return in Part Two as a new IMF agent. Additionally, Nick Offerman will join as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Tom Cruise, of course, isn't finished. He'll have a new crazy stunt for us—and he'll do it himself. Bravo, sir.
When Will Part Two Premiere in Theaters?
Luckily, we won't have to wait very long. Barring major delays from the WGA and SAG strikes, Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part Two will premiere in theaters on June 28, 2024. It's just a year away, people.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcXVpcmUuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbW92aWVzL2E0NDU2MTIxMi9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctcGFydC0yLXBsb3QtY2FzdC1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-17 14:38:46-04:00,When will Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One come to streaming?,"Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One will soon be streaming on Paramount Plus, here’s our best estimation of its home release date.","Ethan Hunt and his crew have only just broken into theaters for their latest adventures, but that doesn’t mean it’s too soon to think about when you might be able to enjoy Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One at home.
There’s no official streaming date for Dead Reckoning Part One just yet, but we do know it’s a Paramount movie, and based on that we can put together a pretty good estimation of when it might arrive on Paramount Plus.
When will Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One come to streaming?
The movie is most likely to arrive on Paramount Plus some time around February 2024. Paramount likes to give its biggest box office movies a pretty long tail before they reach streaming — with Top Gun: Maverick being a particularly clear example. Of course, if Dead Reckoning Part One underperforms at the box office, it’s still possible we could see it pop up on the platform a little sooner than that.
Where will Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One be streaming?
This is a surprisingly complicated question, thanks to a few different rights agreements, acquisitions, and streaming deals. As it happens, this movie will eventually be streaming in three different places: MGM Plus, Paramount Plus, and Amazon Prime Video. When each of these will happen is a little more unclear.
When the movie first arrives on streaming, it will be available on Paramount Plus. It might also be available on MGM Plus, due to an agreement Paramount had to stream movies on the platform back when it was called Epix and was part-owned by Paramount. Either way, Dead Reckoning Part One will also find its way to Amazon Prime Video a few months after its debut on Paramount Plus, probably around May 2024.
Before its arrival on Paramount Plus and other subscription streaming services, Dead Reckoning Part One will be available for digital rental or purchase from VOD vendors. When an official date has been announced, we will add it to this post.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIzNzk3ODA1L21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1wYXJ0LW9uZS1zdHJlYW1pbmctcGFyYW1vdW50LXBsdXPSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb2x5Z29uLmNvbS9wbGF0Zm9ybS9hbXAvMjM3OTc4MDUvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLXBhcnQtb25lLXN0cmVhbWluZy1wYXJhbW91bnQtcGx1cw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-12 14:46:29+00:00,"Tom Cruise’s ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One’ Delivers $7M in Box Office Previews",The Paramount and Skydance movie is rolling out midweek.,"Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One, starring Tom Cruise, has started off its box office run in North America with a franchise-best $7 million in Tuesday previews. The last installment in the series, Mission: Impossible — Fallout, earned $6 million in previews.
Hopes are high Dead Reckoning, Part One will reverse a summer slump at the box office, with the Paramount and Skydance tentpole tracking to open to a franchise-best $90 million or more in North America alone. The movie, which has every chance of scoring a franchise-best bow, is opening midweek in order to get a jump on the competition.
Dead Reckoning is directed by Christopher McQuarrie. The cast also includes Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg.
Cruise is a favorite of theater owners. He resisted putting 2022’s Top Gun: Maverick on streaming, and it ended up being the top-grossing domestic feature released in 2022 with $774.7 million domestic, for a total of $1.49 billion globally.
The actor has become a moviegoing ambassador of sorts. In recent days, he urged his fans to support all summer films, including Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, both of which open in cinemas July 21.
The new Mission: Impossible movie dealt with multiple setbacks caused by COVID-19. Filming shut down at least five times due to the pandemic, with Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie ultimately contracting the disease, and audio of Cruise insisting that the crew abide by COVID restrictions went viral.
Earlier this week, Cruise told The Hollywood Reporter how “amazing” it was to get through those challenges and open the tentpole on the big screen. “We talked about it. We dreamed about it. It’s very, very special,” Cruise said at the movie’s New York City premiere. “On Top Gun: Maverick, they kept pushing the movie and pushing the movie, and for [McQuarrie] and I, this is such an ambitious movie. And it was a very challenging film to produce, and then everything happened, and it was even more challenging. So to have this response … is very, very special.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctYm94LW9mZmljZS1wcmV2aWV3cy0xMjM1NTMzODUzL9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctYm94LW9mZmljZS1wcmV2aWV3cy0xMjM1NTMzODUzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-13 14:16:22+00:00,Box Office: ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning’ Ignites to $15.5 Million Opening Day,"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" kicked off to $16 million on opening day.","“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” kicked off to $15.5 million on opening day, including $7 million in previews on Tuesday.
Paramount and Skydance’s big-budget tentpole, which is the seventh installment in the Tom Cruise-led action franchise, is projected to collect at least $60 million over the traditional Friday to Sunday weekend. In its first five days of release, ticket sales for “Dead Reckoning Part One” are expected to reach $85 million to $95 million in North America and $160 million at the international box office for a strong global start of around $250 million.
Cruise’s previous adventure as the stealth operative Ethan Hunt, 2018’s “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” ignited to $22 million its first day in theaters, but that’s not a great comparison since that entry launched on a Friday while “Dead Reckoning” premiered on a Wednesday. “Fallout” collected $61 million in its debut, establishing a franchise record.
“Mission: Impossible” movies don’t have a history of huge opening weekends, but they tend to enjoy a long life on the big screen. In the case of “Fallout,” the movie ended its run with $791 million to stand as the highest-grossing entry in the 27-year-old series.
“Dead Reckoning Part One” needs to have endurance at the global box office because it cost $290 million. The budget was inflated due to COVID-related starts and stops and other pandemic-era safety measures, so there’s a chance that next summer’s sequel, “Dead Reckoning Part Two,” will be less expensive.
Christopher McQuarrie returned to direct the latest installment, which follows Ethan Hunt and his team at the Impossible Mission Force as they work to take down a mysterious, all-powerful artificial intelligence force known as “The Entity.” Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Esai Morales, Vanessa Kirby and Pom Klementieff round out the cast.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYm94LW9mZmljZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtNy1vcGVuaW5nLWRheS0xMjM1NjY5MjkyL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYm94LW9mZmljZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtNy1vcGVuaW5nLWRheS0xMjM1NjY5MjkyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,Choose to accept this ‘Mission’,Tom Cruise takes “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” to new heights.,"“Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” (henceforth “M:I—DR1″) arrives just in time to save this season from unsatisfying actioners. Unlike “ Fast X ” and “ Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse ,” this movie tells you before you spend your money that its story will not be resolved by the closing credits. Even better, its cliffhanger is narratively satisfying as a standalone ending, something those other films failed to achieve.
“Mission” opens Wednesday. “Part Two″ arrives in 2024.
Despite its 163-minute runtime — longer than “Fast X,” “Spidey,” or “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” — this film moves faster than its 2023 summer movie predecessors. I would wager that the script by director Christopher McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen has more scenes of exposition as well. In fact, there’s as much action as there is explanation of the plot, yet somehow that doesn’t slow down the story.

“M:I—DR1″ is the seventh installment of the series where Tom Cruise trolls Father Time by doing crazy stunts while working the espionage missions that give the series its title. In this one, he drives a motorcycle off a cliff, a death-defying stunt the filmmakers shot on the first day of production in case Cruise pulled a Wile E. Coyote.

Cruise made it, of course, and the production averted the need for “a major rewrite.” The stunt itself is not only spectacular; it’s also a very funny comic punchline.
Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg also return as Luther Stickell and Benji Dunn, respectively. They’re Hunt’s righthand men, the guys who provide the cool disguises he uses to impersonate other people to get information. Luther and Benji are also Hunt’s eyes in the sky, unlocking doors for him through their computers and keeping him aware of his surroundings at all times.

As always, Rhames and Pegg are a lot of fun. The two actors play off each other well in this series, and it’s amusing to see the physically imposing Rhames as a computer geek. The rapport between them and Hunt is similar to the chemistry among the crew of the “Fast & Furious” series, but Hunt appears even more concerned about “fammm’ly” as Vin Diesel’s Dom Toretto. With his moist eyes and his face a mask of perpetual worry, Cruise makes his devotion even more cloying than Diesel does.
But I digress. Ethan Hunt’s latest mission, should he choose to accept it, is to discover what’s going on with an AI program gone rogue. “M:I—DR1″ opens in the Bering Sea where a submarine called the Sevastopol is a victim of that artificial intelligence. It takes over the sub’s computer systems and makes the crew think they’re under attack. Considering the Sevastopol has been designed to avoid detection, its members are rightfully rattled.
Turns out, it’s a false alarm, but tragedy ensues as the crew accidentally blow themselves up. As their bodies float to the surface, we get a glimpse of this film’s MacGuffin, a two-part key on a necklace that is literally the key to solving Hunt’s mission.
Back on land, Hunt sees a ghost from his past while navigating an airport with Luther and Benji’s help. We meet Gabriel (Esai Morales), who shows up for a split second, glimpsed through Hunt’s surveillance spectacles, then disappears. Benji will later describe this phenomenon as a “ghost in the machine,” an indication that the team’s hardware has been infected by the AI, which the film constantly refers to as “The Entity.”

The Entity has the power to confuse and shut down entire systems. Whatever country controls it will become the most powerful government in the world.
Apparently, Gabriel is the representative for The Entity; that is, in addition to being the reason Hunt joined the Impossible Missions Force. Morales is more than a formidable foe. He gives a smooth but intimidating performance, cutting a striking figure as a silver fox who’s as easy on the eyes as he is rough on our protagonists.
Gabriel appears to be everywhere and nowhere at once, making him unpredictable. In doing The Entity’s bidding outside the technological realm, his mission is to kill everyone Hunt cares about, forcing Hunt into a showdown that’s a major Catch-22.
Characters from previous installments have supporting roles here. Vanessa Kirby returns (as the deadly arms dealer White Widow), as does Rebecca Ferguson (as M16 agent Ilsa Faust). Newcomer Hayley Atwell gets in on the fun as Grace, a master pickpocket who is in way over her head.

Everyone’s gunning for that two-part key, which we’re told is the only thing that can stop and destroy The Entity. The techie in me had some serious questions about the dialogue involving The Entity’s source code; he was overruled by the part of me that loves when movie dialogue devolves into scientific mumbo jumbo.

As if mocking the latest “Indiana Jones” film, “M:I—DR1″ climaxes with an extended sequence aboard a runaway train. Cruise, without any need for the de-aging techniques that marred Indy, battles Gabriel on top of the train while multiple dramas occur within it. Kirby is especially good here, as is Atwell. While the two men battle for the title of quién es más macho?, the two women are engaged in an equally exciting battle of wits.

“Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” ends one mission but leaves us at the beginning of its next one. To my surprise, I found myself choosing to accept it.

2023-06-22 16:09:41+00:00,"Tom Cruise’s ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One’ Sprinting Toward Franchise-Best $90M Opening","Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt in Paramount and Skydance's July tentpole, which opens three weeks from now.","Tom Cruise‘s Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One is tracking for a franchise-best opening in the $90 million range at the domestic box office in its first five days, a huge start for the July tentpole. And there’s plenty of upside, according to polling.
Cruise is in Europe this week for the Rome and London premieres of the movie. The Paramount and Skydance film begins opening in cinemas across the globe three weeks from now, including Wednesday, July 12, in North America. The $90 million projection includes a three-day weekend estimate of $65 million or more.
The latest installment in the famous action franchise is expected to be another win for Cruise after Paramount and Skydance blockbuster Top Gun: Maverick, which grossed nearly $1.5 billion at the worldwide box office last year despite ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic. Box office pundits believe moviegoers view the new Mission: Impossible pic as a sort-of spiritual sequel to Maverick, even though the two movies aren’t part of the same franchise.
In terms of the Mission series, 2018’s Mission: Impossible — Fallout holds the record for top three-day weekend opening ($61.2 million) at the domestic box office, followed by 2000’s Mission: Impossible II ($57.8 million), 2015’s Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation ($55.5 million), 2006’s Mission: Impossible III ($47.7 million), 1996’s Mission: Impossible ($45.4 million) and 2011’s Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol ($12.8 million), not adjusted for inflation.
Cruise is a favorite of cinema owners for promoting theatrical over streaming. His was also lauded by Steven Spielberg for his efforts. “You saved Hollywood’s ass, and you might have saved theatrical distribution,” Spielberg told Cruise during a private exchange at the 2023 Oscars luncheon that a bystander captured on video. “Seriously, Maverick might have saved the entire theatrical industry.”
Dead Reckoning, Part One is directed by Cruise good-luck charm Christopher McQuarrie, who has directed the star in a number of his films. McQuarrie also helms Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part Two, which is set to open June 28, 2024.
Footage screened at CinemaCon in late April included an inventive chase scene in which Cruise’s Ethan Hunt is handcuffed to Hayley Atwell’s Grace as they flee police and multiple factions of people who want them, most notably a character played by Pom Klementieff, whose most frightening feature is how much she seems to enjoy the chase and its ensuing mayhem.
In years past, Cruise debuted stunts from previous movies, such as hanging from the side of a plane, skydiving or jumping a motorbike off a cliff in Norway.
Other stars in Dead Reckoning include Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Henry Czerny, Simon Pegg, Vanessa Kirby, Angela Bassett, Cary Elwes, Indira Varma, Rob Delaney and Charles Parnell.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3MvdG9tLWNydWlzZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctYm94LW9mZmljZS10cmFja2luZy0xMjM1NTIxNTk4L9IBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3MvdG9tLWNydWlzZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctYm94LW9mZmljZS10cmFja2luZy0xMjM1NTIxNTk4L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

We now know why Tom Cruise and his Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One team filmed his insane motorcycle-into-BASE jump stunt on day one. The short answer—the stunt was so complex and difficult that, if something had gone wrong, at least it would have happened before they’d spent millions of dollars and many days and nights filming other parts of the film. Once successfully completed, the cast and crew could focus their full attention on the rest of the film without the highly difficult sequence looming in their near future. And this is precisely what happened. Cruise and the talented stunt crew conceived pulled it off, and Dead Reckoning Part One continued filming thereafter.
Now, Paramount has made a huge cache of new images available, and quite a few of them detail what Cruise and co-writer/director Christopher McQuarrie are calling the most complex and challenging stunt in the franchise’s long, stunt-loving run. As mentioned, Cruise had to drive a motorcycle at top speed off the edge of a cliff and go directly into a successful BASE jump, requiring him to master motocross racing, motocross jumping, and, of course, piloting the parachute after successfully deploying at just the right time. [The massive ramp the crew built was later turned into a proper cliff in post-production by the visual effects team.] Here are images that give you a peek at what it looked like to be there:
The new images also reveal the hugely talented ensemble surrounding Cruise. Dead Reckoning Part One follows the seismic events in Fallout, where Cruise’s Hunt, along with his trusty team of Isla Faust (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg), and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), helped stave off a potential nuclear nightmare. Now, the weapon they’re deployed to keep out of the hands of the bad guys is more dangerous than ever—artificial intelligence. In the wrong hands, the AI has the potential to cause an entire system collapse of the known world order. Enter Ethan and the IMF squad.
The new images include the abovementioned stars, plus some key returning players like Vanessa Kirby’s White Widow and newcomers, too, including Pom Klementieff’s Paris, Hayley Atwell’s Grace, Shea Whigham’s Jasper Briggs, Indira Varma, Esai Morales, and Mariela Garriga.

2023-07-24 03:15:07+00:00,‘Mission: Impossible’ Box Office: Can ‘Dead Reckoning’ Rebound From Barbenheimer?,'Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning' tumbled a series-worst 64 percent as 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' turned into weapons of box office mass destruction.,"Tom Cruise, the star who is credited with saving the box office after Top Gun: Maverick flew to $1.5 billion in global ticket sales, is now facing another kind of reckoning — surviving the Barbenheimer effect.
His Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One tumbled a franchise-worst 64 percent to $19.5 million in its second weekend when going up against Barbie and Oppenheimer, whose dual arrivals transformed into a cultural phenomenon and propelled the domestic box office to historic heights. Revenue for the July 21-23 weekend was the fourth-biggest of all time; in addition, it was the first time ever that one movie opened to $100 million or more and another to $50 million or more. Barbie scored $155 million, followed by $80.5 million for Oppenheimer. No one in Hollywood anticipated such a staggering turnout.
The seventh installment in Paramount and Skydance’s storied Mission: Impossible series, which finished Sunday with a domestic total of $118.8 million, had hoped to earn as much as $25 million in its second outing.
The question now is whether Dead Reckoning Part One can level out and enjoy a long run as other series installments have done, and just as Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick did. Executives across Hollywood, and not just at Paramount, aren’t ruling Dead Reckoning out just yet, especially since it has a better critics’ score on Rotten Tomatoes than Barbie and Oppenheimer, as well as strong audience exit scores.
“I don’t think the story has yet been written,” says one executive at a rival studio.
Mission: Impossible pics have never sported mega-openings, yet expectations were high for Dead Reckoning after Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick opened to $160.5 million over Memorial Day weekend in 2022, including $126.7 million for the three days. Dead Reckoning had been tracking to open to $90 million in its first five days beginning July 12; instead, it took in a franchise-best $78.5 million, not adjusted for inflation.
Titles in the Mission franchise have always drawn a larger percentage of their global gross from the foreign box office. Dead Reckoning Part One is no exception. It earned another $55 million from 72 markets in its second weekend for a foreign tally of $252.1 million and $370.9 million globally through Sunday. It is doing especially well in Asia, where Barbie and Oppenheimer aren’t strong players. And in a number of markets, it is pacing 15 percent or more ahead of 2018’s Mission: Impossible — Fallout. In Japan, it debuted to $7.9 million, 23 percent ahead of Fallout, which earned a franchise-best $571.5 million overseas for a global total of $791.7 million, including $220.2 million in North America.
Mission: Impossible 7 had to contend with losing Imax screens for three weeks to Oppenheimer, in addition to losing premium large-format screens to both Oppenheimer and Barbie. The upcharge for Imax and PLFs is significant and can have a big impact on the bottom line. In early July, Imax screens were dedicated to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
Cruise’s latest movie, directed by Christopher McQuarrie, cost nearly $300 million to produce and saw its release date delayed numerous times because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was initially set to open in summer of 2021, then summer or fall of 2022. Its release date ultimately landed on mid-July of this year, a date dictated by the shooting schedule of Dead Reckoning Part Two and Cruise’s availability to promote Part One (the actor is known for his global marketing efforts).
Adds another observer: “Barbenheimer siphoned off MI7′s potential this weekend, with Oppenheimer drawing older males away from Dead Reckoning. Not only that, Sound of Freedom is an unexpected force to be reckoned with and is presenting competition from an unlikely source.”
Estimates for the U.S. box office show Angel Studios’ faith-based political thriller Sound of Freedom beating Dead Reckoning for the weekend with $20.1 million for a cume of $123.4 million (Sound of Freedom opened July 4), according to Comscore. Paramount and other studios show Dead Reckoning beating Sound of Freedom; Monday actuals will determine the order.
Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part Two is set to open in theaters June 28, 2024. McQuarrie and Cruise have shot much of the movie, but production is now halted because of the SAG-AFTRA strike in another moment of reckoning for the storied action franchise.
Things looked different in late June, when Cruise — Hollywood’s highest-profile advocate for the theatrical experience — urged audiences to see Dial of Destiny. And, yes, two other movies in a surprisingly effective plea. Wrote the actor on Instagram : “I love a double feature, and it doesn’t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiZW5oZWltZXItMTIzNTU0MzYwMi_SAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3MvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYmFyYmVuaGVpbWVyLTEyMzU1NDM2MDIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-06-28 17:01:22+00:00,Tom Cruise Urges Fans to See Rival Summer Movies ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’,"Tom Cruise, star of 'Mission Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One' is urging fans to see rival movies 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' this summer.","Tom Cruise really wants you to go see Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. And Barbie. And Oppenheimer.
Despite his own blockbuster opening in a few weeks (that would be Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One), Cruise is urging his fans to check out the summer movie competition.
“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,” Cruise wrote on Instagram post (below) that showed him standing with his Dead Reckoning writer-director Christopher McQuarrie in front of posters for Indy 5. “These are just a few that we can’t wait to see on the big screen.”
“Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indiana Jones and creating one of the most iconic characters in cinema history,” he continued. “You have given us countless hours of joy.”
“I love a double feature, and it doesn’t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie.”
The messaging suggests Cruise is once again hoping to save the summer box office — this time by bringing along a few other titles.
Last year, the massive success of Top Gun: Maverick (which made $1.5 billion globally) was credited as “saving Hollywood’s ass” by no less than Steven Spielberg himself.
This year, a few films have struggled to gain box office traction — such as The Flash and Elemental — though Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse successfully popped.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is facing headwinds with modest reviews, yet is tracking to open with a solid $60 million to $70 million over the June 30-July 2 weekend.
Meanwhile, Dead Reckoning is headed toward a franchise-best $90 million opening for its extended weekend, which gets underway Wednesday, July 12.
There’s no tracking yet for Barbie or Oppenheimer, which open head-to-head July 21, but both are considered highly anticipated — though, with respect to Cruise, would likely make for a rather odd back-to-back viewing experience.
The move follows a viral report from Puck that a “pissed” Cruise was had loudly complained to Paramount executives about the impact of Oppenheimer’s IMAX deal. Cruise was reportedly upset that IMAX was going to boot Dead Reckoning from its large-format screens after just one week in order to make room for its prior commitment to run Oppenheimer — which was entirely shot in the IMAX format – for three weeks.

2023-08-06 18:19:10+00:00,Is the ‘Mission: Impossible’ Series Due for a Reckoning?,"After an underwhelming box office performance for ""Dead Reckoning,"" Tom Cruise should return to the original ideas of ""Mission: Impossible.""","When did the “Mission: Impossible” films become action movies? I’m not sure when that happened, but I do know this much: For a series like the one in question, it’s live by the action, die by the action. For a few days there, people were chattering about all the great action in “Dead Reckoning Part One,” talking up the Fiat car chase or that train-dangling-from-a-cliff climax as if we’d never seen a sequence like that one before. But all I could think was, “Don’t we have the ‘Fast and Furious’ franchise for that?”
For 27 years, the “Mission: Impossible” films have been dotted with great action. That’s part of what these movies are. In a funny way, though, it can’t be the essence of what they are. Because then, no matter how spectacular Tom Cruise’s latest P.T. Barnum feat of star-in-the-air stunt work is (at this point how could he top himself short of doing a spacewalk?), the rest of the film inevitably recedes behind it. If “Dead Reckoning Part Two” weren’t already on the way (most of the movie was shot last year), I’d make the following recommendation to Cruise and his collaborator-auteur, director Christopher McQuarrie: If you really want to end this series on a high note, go back to the thing people loved about “Mission: Impossible” in the first place — the Russian-doll cleverness, the borderline insane trickiness, the way these movies are espionage thrillers turned inside out. If you made a great one of those, then instead of okay-to-disappointing box-office returns you might hold audiences in the palm of your hand as surely as they’re eating up “Oppenheimer.”
I grew up watching the original “Mission: Impossible” series on television with my father. I was 10, 11, 12 years old and could barely follow what was going on, but when those puzzle plots came together I still felt the rush. The series had almost no “action.” It was all deftly absurd, precision-cut, trap-door spy games. In 1996, when director Brian De Palma turned the show into a movie (at that point it wasn’t clear that he was spawning a franchise), he came up with a seductive hybrid: more action-driven than the show had been, but with enough narrative duplicity to bedazzle and pull the floor out from under the audience. The most memorable episode in the movie — Cruise hanging from that wire, performing the ultimate cat-burglar heist, a sequence so tense that a falling drop of sweat felt like a bomb — was at once pure action and pure intrigue.
The “M:I” movies have varied greatly, in tone and quality, to the point that there’s not a lot of consensus as to the highlights. Most of them are fun, and we all have our soft spots (I’m still awed by certain moments in John Woo’s “Mission: Impossible 2,” one of the least-loved entries in the series). But to me the greatest “M:I” film, the one extraordinary enough in its trickery to hypnotize and prank the audience, is Brad Bird’s “Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol.” I still think Cruise’s suction-cup spider crawl over the sleek surface of the Burj Khalifa is the most cinematic stunt of his career, and Bird orchestrated a grand illusion of perception in the rest of the movie.
I thought something like that might happen in “Dead Reckoning Part One” as I watched the early airport pickpocket chase sequence, which is the film’s most breathlessly effective episode. It’s all gambits and reversals, and it introduces a very “Ghost Protocol” idea: that the Entity — otherwise known as the Internet gone AI rogue — could virtually camouflage a character like Esai Morales’ Gabriel. That concept feels like it could be the next evolution of the “M:I” masks. But the film introduces the idea only to do next to nothing with it. On the technological-deception scale, the airport sequence is “Dead Reckoning’s” high point, which is another way of saying that the movie culminates too early.
Action will always be part of cinema, and the “Mission: Impossible” movies have every right to aim for stupendous action sequences. If it sounds like I’m begrudging the evolution of Cruise’s stuntman brand, on the contrary: I’d never deny the excitement, or fanatical bravado, of what he does. A few years ago, I wrote admiringly of how those stunts have become the measure of his stardom, and I stand by that assessment. Yet the ballpark-similar, barely-good-enough-to-get-by domestic box office grosses of “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” ($150 million), “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” ($170 million) and “Fast X” ($145 million) should be telling us something: that action, as a selling point, may have peaked, entering a period of overexposed exhaustion. Of all those franchises, the “M:I” films are the last ones that should be coasting on the coolness of a Fiat 500 zooming around Rome. Cruise and McQuarrie’s mission, should they choose to accept it, is to make this series fascinating again by remembering that the ultimate movie stunt is still the one that wows your brain.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2NvbHVtbnMvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLXNlcmllcy1mdXR1cmUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctZXNwaW9uYWdlLTEyMzU2ODg4Mzkv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vY29sdW1ucy9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtc2VyaWVzLWZ1dHVyZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1lc3Bpb25hZ2UtMTIzNTY4ODgzOS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

This week’s report takes an early look at possible box office trajectories for the seventh installment of the Mission: Impossible film franchise, alongside tracking updates for other upcoming releases.
Updates for No Hard Feelings; Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny; and Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, plus other forecast updates, are in the table below.
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One
Paramount Pictures
July 11, 2023 (WIDE)
3-Day Opening Weekend Range: $65M-$80M
Domestic Total Range: $250M-$320M
PROS:
Selling points for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One include not only the critical and commercial success of its 2018 predecessor, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, but the enormous goodwill earned by star Tom Cruise from last year’s Top Gun: Maverick. These two factors combine for a potentially significant wave of momentum heading into Dead Reckoning Part One‘s release, as audiences look forward to Cruise’s continuation of the long-running action franchise and its marquee real-life stunts.
Dead Reckoning‘s first day of pre-sales in sampled North American markets registered 8 percent above those of John Wick: Chapter 4 and just 15 percent behind Fast X. With the Mission: Impossible franchise typically being less frontloaded than the Fast and Furious films—and with the fact that several other high-profile films are competing for pre-sales dollars—that’s a very encouraging early sign.
Premium formats should be a strong component of the Mission: Impossible franchise’s box office once again. This is particularly true of Imax, which featured a special making-of sequence for Dead Reckoning running in front of Maverick as an early marketing piece last year.
Mission: Impossible films have historically played longer than moreyouth-driven franchises, positioning this sequel to enjoy a leggy run through the back half of summer.
Social media sentiment has been consistently enthusiastic with the release of each trailer and featurette. Christopher McQuarrie, director of this entry and the previous two, has played a significant role in helping drum up buzz by posting various behind-the-scenes tidbits and announcements over the past few years.
Dead Reckoning‘s recent push up from a Friday to Wednesday release, with various preview dates also in play, helps give the film some extra time in theaters—and on premium screens—before Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer opens the following week.
CONS:
With Oppenheimer slated to release nine days after Dead Reckoning, commanding most of the Imax and premium footprint for several weeks, crossover competition for both premium screens and the adult male audience will be notable. Fallout drew a 55 percent male and 59 percent age 35-plus opening weekend demographic share in 2018, while Nolan’s Dunkirk pulled a 60 percent male lead with 76 percent over the age of 25.
On a similar note, if Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny—out less than two weeks before Dead Reckoning‘s Wednesday opening—were to draw healthy word of mouth, its chase weeks at the box office could be a strong player for some of Dead Reckoning‘s target audience.
With the move to a Wednesday release, plus several instances of early access shows and previews, forecast models will be more volatile than when the film was slated for a traditional Friday opening.
As the first of what’s presumed to be the two-part finale of Cruise’s tenure with the franchise, it remains to be seen if word of mouth will be as strong as has it been for the last few entries. A cliffhanger ending, if that comes to pass, for a 163-minute movie could be a blow to the series’ typical crowd-pleasing nature, depending on the tone of the film’s denouement.

2023-07-26 21:00:00+00:00,Tom Cruise Wanted Sound He Could Feel in ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning’,Supervising sound editor James Mather discusses getting more intimate during the train wreck and creating a signature sound for the Entity.,"“Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” takes the spy franchise to a new level of high-octane action with the global threat of AI domination — and Tom Cruise wanted a visceral sound to the film while starring as legendary rogue agent Ethan Hunt.
“Tom wants to feel it, as only he can, having rehearsed it and filmed it many different ways as an actor and stuntman,” supervising sound editor James Mather told IndieWire. This is part of the “synaptic” philosophy of sound design that Cruse, Mather and the rest of the sound team have embraced, including last year’s Oscar-winning “Top Gun: Maverick.”
Take the brutal alley fight in Venice between Hunt and Pom Klementieff’s French assassin, Paris. The physicality of it becomes uncomfortable.
“You are in it so close to them, it feels like you’re trying to pull ’em apart,” Mather said. “And we went to town with that. And then Tom came and listened to it, and he was like, ‘It’s too clean, guys, it’s too specific, like a martial arts movie.’ He wanted it to be dirty and gritty and imperfect because that’s what makes it real.”
So Mather and re-recording mixer Chris Burdon remastered the production tracks, stripping out bits of dialog, breaths, and reactions, and then built it up again to emphasize “the sense of scuff and rough edge.”

But the greatest takeaway was leaning into a more intimate sound design: “I think the design for this movie was about following the eyeline with the audience’s, hearing with the ears, because everything was made purpose-built,” said Mather. “You’re always in the car or approximately just outside the window, but you are very close to them. So the hearing and the point of view of the soundtrack was very much about incorporating that sensitivity and sensibility.”
A good example is the wild car chase in Rome, where Ethan and Grace (Haley Atwell), a thief-turned-ally, are thrown together in a tiny Fiat, chugging along on narrow cobblestone streets, pursued by a giant Hummer, with cars flying around everywhere.
“It was a real ‘Tom and Jerry’ kind of thing,” Mather said. “And the fact that this Fiat had an electric engine meant that it didn’t really make any big motor sounds. It was the cobblestones and the wind, the whines and the whir of the electric motor, and the skids and the creeks. We had a lot of fun playing with the dynamic range in that. But we also found, as we got into the final mix, that less was much more in that scene.”
Multiple COVID delays provided the team extra time to iterate the soundtrack and shift the dynamics to make it more nuanced. They even benefited from a happy accident in 2021 when Mather got a call from his daughter complaining that the TV at home wasn’t working. Turns out the monitor and soundbar weren’t in sync, causing a strange crackling noise. Mather thought it sounded cool and recorded it. They were early into the mix, and director Christopher McQuarrie liked it too, so they experimented with the noise to evoke the AI villain called the Entity.
But it wasn’t until after a late screening attended by director Edgar Wright that the noise became much more prominent and improved the sound design. He recommended more of a signature cue for the Entity, which was evoked mostly through Lorne Bolfe’s score. “Once it felt right, we then populated the movie, and it became more and more of a character in the film,” Mather said. “And then we had to try and somehow replicate that process using modulators and EQ.”

The more intimate sound design achieved its greatest success during the roller coaster third act, featuring Ethan driving a motorcycle off a cliff, skydiving into the Orient Express train, and trying to hold on with Grace when the train falls off a broken bridge, one carriage at a time.
“The thing that made the big difference with this dive was the notion of negative sound,” Mather said. “So, when the bike goes off the cliff, and you’ve had everything building to that moment, and then you go into this kind of expansive surround air, and a tiny whistle of the wheels spinning on the bike, and a tiny flapping of Tom’s, and then the cut into him as he’s falling, he’s massive. With his arrival in the train, it was a very difficult balance to make work. We actually ended up putting the gunshot in with the smash in the window because the audience is expecting the gunshot.”
As for the wreck, which Mather calls “Buster Keaton on steroids,” it was important for the full-size train replicas to be custom-built for climbing around in them and for the camera operator [Jonathan Richmond] to dangle on wires in a harness close to Cruise and Atwell.
The highlight was the kitchen scene: “Everything has a moment to be totally isolated and experienced,” Mather said. “You get the hot oil, you get the fire, you get the plates. Watching the thing coming down, you’re also made aware that there’s still a train creaking and groaning and sliding down off the edge of this cliff.
“And, as we get to the piano room, once it’s gotten much quieter ’cause there’s nothing in there, you’ve got the creaking pin, which is the only thing stopping the piano from landing on them. You’ve got the twisting metal of the carriage, and then you cut to the exterior where you’ve got that single clunk of the thread on the carriage as it’s pulling under its weight. And it’s all just right. There’s just the last bit of debris falling down before the piano jeopardy — a bottle of fizz that lands and smashes. It’s about the courage of not overplaying stuff…and keeping the audience on the edge of their seat.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvY3JhZnQvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLXBhcnQtb25lLXNvdW5kLXRyYWluLXdyZWNrLTEyMzQ4ODc3MDkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-05 13:17:50+00:00,Mission Impossible: Paramount reckoning,"Paramount Global’s predicament is worthy of its successful “Mission: Impossible” franchise. The various parts of the entertainment conglomerate controlled by Shari Redstone are in theory worth far more than its $11 billion market capitalization suggests. Extracting the additional value, however, would be a formidable assignment for even the most highly skilled financial operatives.","NEW YORK, July 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Paramount Global’s (PARA.O) predicament is worthy of its successful “Mission: Impossible” franchise. The various parts of the entertainment conglomerate controlled by Shari Redstone are in theory worth far more than its $11 billion market capitalization suggests. Extracting the additional value, however, would be a formidable assignment for even the most highly skilled financial operatives.
Additional consolidation looms for the media industry, which has plowed billions of dollars into developing TV shows and films for competing online streaming services but struggled to make the money back. Warner Bros Discovery (WBD.O) will be free to explore more acquisitions or a sale next year after it passes a two-year waiting period to retain the tax benefits of Discovery combining with the storied Batman to Looney Tunes empire that was owned by AT&T (T.N). Netflix (NFLX.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) will have important decisions to make, while Walt Disney (DIS.N) and Comcast (CMCSA.O) will probably reimagine their portfolios. Even video-game developers Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO.O) and Electronic Arts (EA.O) might get involved, too.
Compared to those deep-pocketed giants, Paramount is small-time. The cutthroat competition and challenging economics make it more likely that Redstone, who is chairwoman, will have to merge, sell or carve up the empire built by her late father, Sumner.
In the meantime, she secured some blue-chip backing. Over the past year or so, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) has bought and increased its stake in Paramount to about 15%. And BDT & MSD Partners, the advisory and investment firm run by former Goldman Sachs (GS.N) banker Byron Trott, injected $125 million into Redstone’s National Amusements, which owns cinema chains and controls 77% of Paramount’s voting shares. Without the funding, her closely held firm might have needed to pledge more of its Paramount stock against a loan.
In theory, at least, Redstone has working in her favor that Paramount’s parts are worth more than the whole. In addition, the company has a rich, albeit tormented, breakup history.
After its founding in 1912, Paramount embarked on a series of deals that would make it home to Hollywood luminaries including Rudolph Valentino, Mae West and the Marx Brothers, as well as the owner of one of the largest U.S. cinema chains. Trustbusters took issue with the combination, and a landmark 1948 Supreme Court case ultimately forced the company to cleave theaters from the studios.
Nearly two decades later, Paramount would run into serious financial trouble. Just as it does today, however, the company harbored valuable and underappreciated assets, such as real estate and a film library. Industrial conglomerate Gulf and Western bought the business, lumping it in with a sprawling manufacturing enterprise. By the 1980s, the mishmash model fell out of favor with investors and boss Martin Davis largely dismantled the auto-parts-to-zinc operation. It would eventually be rechristened under the Paramount brand to focus on the retained media holdings.
Around the same time, Sumner Redstone took control of Viacom, short for Video and Audio Communications, which had been spun off from national broadcaster CBS. It would develop some of cable’s biggest networks, including Nickelodeon and MTV. In 1994, Viacom bought Paramount for $10 billion and then orchestrated a $36 billion merger with CBS in 1999 to make it the second biggest media company just behind Time Warner. Seven years later, Redstone decided to split it to free the faster-growing cable business from the plodding but profitable broadcast division. It didn’t exactly turn out as planned.
Reunited under the same roof in 2019, the company reverted to the Paramount name with a focus on streaming. The business has accumulated net debt equal to more than 5 times its 2023 estimated EBITDA with estimates gathered by Refinitiv projecting it will not swing to being cash flow positive for another year. Given all those dynamics, it may be time to consider yet another breakup, one that might prove far harder to execute.

CBS is the most-watched U.S. broadcaster, its 15th consecutive season in the No. 1 slot. The so-called Tiffany Network also carries popular National Football League games, alongside its portfolio of local broadcast stations, national cable networks and a TV studio.
Paramount’s TV assets are expected to generate nearly $5 billion in adjusted EBITDA, according to Refinitiv data. The division’s closest peer, Fox (FOXA.O), trades at 7 times 2024 forecast profit, but it also offloaded entertainment cable networks that were weighing it down. Using a discounted multiple of 5 times for Paramount’s comparable business implies it would be worth about $24 billion.
The movie studio, behind “Top Gun: Maverick,” is highly coveted. Amazon paid $8.5 billion, or 37 times EBITDA, to buy MGM last year. On Paramount’s $200 million of estimated 2024 EBITDA, the film arm would be worth some $7 billion.
Streaming service Paramount+ is similar to Netflix, whose enterprise is worth 5 times next year’s estimated revenue. Paramount’s smaller and unprofitable rival at best would command half that multiple, but it’s safer to figure the operation would have no value if separated from the studios. Book publisher Simon & Schuster is on the block again after the U.S. government blocked a sale to larger competitor Penguin Random House. It’s reasonable to assume another buyer will pay a similar $2 billion for it.
Put it altogether, and it imputes the Paramount enterprise is worth around $33 billion. Back out some $13.5 billion of net debt and its market value would be $20 billion, a more than 80% premium to where it trades today.
One of the stickiest problems would be unlocking television’s full value. Broadcast TV is a steadily declining business. It has limited appeal to digital native companies such as Amazon, while Walt Disney and Comcast are hamstrung by regulation because they already own competing national networks. Overseas suitors for public airwaves also would face close government scrutiny.
Despite Paramount and its predecessor companies having sliced and diced themselves multiple times over the past century, Redstone may be forced to sell it whole at a less desirable price tag. If nothing else, investors have indicated that they think they’re watching another installment of “Mission: Impossible.”

2023-06-21 12:19:29+00:00,Why Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” Motorcycle Stunt Was Filmed Day One,"Cruise and the crew knew if the stunt went badly, the entire movie could have been derailed, so best to find out on day one.","Why Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” Motorcycle Stunt Was Filmed Day One
Death, taxes, the physical laws of the universe, and Tom Cruise and his Mission: Impossible team topping whatever the craziest stunt in their previous film was with one even more death-defying—these are a few of the certain things in life. This is why, while it’s not surprising to hear that the most technically challenging and dangerous stunt Cruise and his team have attempted thus far is one they set up for Dead Reckoning Part One, the reasons behind them attempting the stunt on the very first day of filming are still quite chilling.
Co-writer and longtime M:I director Christopher McQuarrie told Empire this past May that Cruise’s biggest stunt for the upcoming film—riding a motorcycle off a cliff and into a BASE jump—was done on day one to give the cast and crew “all the time in the world to understand why [Ethan] was doing what he’s doing.” McQuarrie added: “If we sat around and tried to figure out these movies the old-fashioned way, you’d never find it, simply because it’s such a living, breathing thing.”
Yet Cruise himself was even more straightforward and darkly practical when he described the decision to do the stunt on day one—because it could have gone horribly wrong. Instead of filming a large portion of the movie and then losing Cruise to injury—or worse—Cruise and team figured that attempting to clear the hurdle right from the jump would have given them more flexibility going forward if it went awry.
“Well, we know either we will continue with the film, or we’re not. Let’s know day one!” Cruise told Entertainment Tonight. “Let us know day one what is going to happen: Do we all continue, or is it a major rewrite? I was training, and I was ready. You have to be razor-sharp when you’re doing something like that. It was very important as we were prepping the film that it was actually the first thing. I don’t want to drop that and go shoot other things and have my mind somewhere else. Everyone was prepped. Let’s just get it done.”
Being razor-sharp for massively complex stunts is the core ingredient of the Cruise-led franchise. He scaled Dubai’s half-mile-high Burj Khalifa tower in 2011’s Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol. Then in 2015’s Rogue Nation, Cruise topped that by hanging from the outside of an Airbus A400M Atlas airplane as it took off. There’s more. In 2018’s Fallout, we spoke to stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood about how he helped prepare Cruise for two wildly difficult sequences. One was his HALO jump (high-altitude low-open) from 25,000 feet. The second saw Cruise pilot his own helicopter in a dizzying, insanely daring chase scene for the movie’s climax.
The motorcycle-to-base-jump stunt tops all of those in complexity. It’ll be featured in the two-part Dead Reckoning story, which finds Ethan Hunt and his IMF team trying to track down an A.I.-based weapon that could destabilize the entire world.
Cruise is joined by familiar faces and newcomers alike. The returning champs are Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Henry Czerny, Vanessa Kirby, and Frederick Schmidt. Newcomers include Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, Cary Elwes, Rob Delaney, Indira Varma, Shea Whigham, Mark Gatiss, Esai Morales, and Charles Parnell.
You’ll be able to see the big stunt, which, happily, went off without a hitch, and a whole lot more when Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One opens in theaters on July 12.

2023-07-05 03:02:46+00:00,Tom Cruise Lays Out Plan To See ‘Oppenheimer’ & ‘Barbie’ On Their Opening Weekend,Tom Cruise is on a mission to watch both Oppenheimer and Barbie on their opening weekend and is opening up about how he'll make it happen.,"Tom Cruise is on a mission to watch both Oppenheimer and Barbie on their opening weekend and is opening up about how he’ll make it happen.
“I want to see both Barbie and Oppenheimer. I’ll see them opening weekend,” he said per The Sydney Morning Herald. “Friday I’ll see Oppenheimer first and then Barbie on Saturday.”
Both films are set to hit theaters on July 21 and will compete for audiences at the box office. Cruise is a big proponent of watching movies in the theaters as that’s the way he grew up.
“I grew up seeing movies on the big screen. That’s how I make them, and I like that experience; it’s immersive, and to have that as a community and an industry, it’s important,” Cruise added. “I still go the movies.”
Cruise has made it no secret of his intentions to hit the Cineplex to see Oppenheimer and Barbie and recently showed off his tickets as proof.
“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,” he tweeted. “Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indy and one of the most iconic characters in history. I love a double feature, and it doesn’t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Oppenheimer and Barbie.”

2023-07-05 18:12:58+00:00,Tom Cruise Plans to Make ‘Mission: Impossible’ Movies Into His 80s,The actor says he wants to play Ethan Hunt until he's Harrison Ford's age.,"Tom Cruise‘s toughest mission yet: To keep playing Ethan Hunt into his 80s.
The actor says in a new interview that he wants to keep making Mission: Impossible movies like 80-year-old Harrison Ford has kept making Indiana Jones films.
“Harrison Ford is a legend, I hope to be still going, I’ve got 20 years to catch up with him,” Cruise told the Sydney Morning Herald. “I hope to keep making Mission: Impossible films until I’m his age.”
At 61 years old, Cruise already seems to be defying time and space with his youthful looks and physical prowess, continuing to do his own extreme stunts in next week’s release of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. Part Two is slated for June 28, 2024. Cruise first played the unstoppable IMF agent 27 years ago in Mission: Impossible.
Cruise also addressed his recent social media post urging moviegoers to check out two of his summer box office rivals, Barbie and Oppenheimer, which open head to head on the same day (July 21).
“I want to see both Barbie and Oppenheimer,” he said. “I’ll see them opening weekend. Friday I’ll see Oppenheimer first and then Barbie on Saturday … I grew up seeing movies on the big screen. That’s how I make them, and I like that experience; it’s immersive, and to have that as a community and an industry, it’s important.”
Dead Reckoning Part One is tracking to open bigger than any previous Mission: Impossible movie yet, with the seventh installment eyeing a $90 million extended weekend opening. The previous biggest opening was the sixth film, Fallout, which holds the record for top three-day weekend opening ($61.2 million).

,Mission: Impossible's Hayley Atwell was proud of her bruises for Dead Reckoning,Hayley Atwell plays a thief named Grace opposite Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt in 'Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.',"Before starting to shoot her role of a professional thief named Grace in the just-released Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, Hayley Atwell spent five months working with stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood and his fitness trainer wife Sam.
""The bruises here and there that I would get were so minor and yet I would be very proud of them,"" says the British actress, 41, who spoke with EW on Wednesday, ahead of the SAG strike. ""I would be like, 'I've got proof of my battle scars!'""
Atwell explains that she not only embarked on an exercise program to prepare for her role in the seventh Mission: Impossible film, which once again finds Tom Cruise playing super spy Ethan Hunt, but also embarked on what she describes as a life-changing, sugar-free diet.
""It transformed my body in terms of my energy, my clarity of mind, and the natural by-products that come from living an incredibly healthy way and understanding about nutrition and rest and recovery and injury and prevention and mobility,"" Atwell says. ""The first time I had sugar again, I had this sort of sugar hangover the next day and felt awful."" Did a tiny, imaginary Tom Cruise appear on her shoulder to say, ""Told you""?
""No, he would never rub it in,"" she says.

In the film, Cruise's Hunt forges an at first uneasy partnership with Atwell's character in an attempt to combat ""the Entity,"" a new kind of artificial intelligence with essentially world-conquering powers. The actress is receiving rave reviews for her performance. (EW's Maureen Lee Lenker called Atwell ""the real jewel in the crown of this ensemble."") But the opportunity to perform opposite Cruise on screen has been a long time coming. In fact, filmmaker Chris McQuarrie, who has directed all of the Mission: Impossible movies since 2015's Rogue Nation, first came close to casting the actress over a decade ago.
""Hayley is someone we have been talking to, and talking about, going all the way back to Jack Reacher,"" McQuarrie says, referring to the Cruise-starring 2012 action-thriller, which the filmmaker also directed. ""She read for us for Jack Reacher, and she was somebody we were interested in for Rogue Nation. It took us a while to find just the right character, just the right opportunity for Hayley to really play to her strengths.""
In the years after she auditioned for Reacher, Atwell became well known to MCU fans for playing the role of Peggy Carter in a slew of films and the Agent Carter TV series. The actress most recently portrayed an alternative universe Peggy in last year's Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. The movie featured the actress as a version of the character who has become the superhero Captain Carter but is killed with her own shield by Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch, to Atwell's disappointment.
""It was great to see her in that outfit, seemingly taking a more active role,"" Atwell says. ""But it was a very underwhelming moment for her to say, 'I could do this all day,' and then get cut in half by a frisbee. Definitely don't think that set-up delivered what I would have loved to have seen for her.""

The actress is much happier talking about the shoot for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, despite its tough and frustrating nature. The COVID-19 outbreak delayed the production's start by six months, and caused Cruise and McQuarrie to pause proceedings on several occasions, extending an already lengthy shooting schedule. ""I think Hayley might have been on this movie for well over 100 days before she had her first dialogue scene,"" McQuarrie says.
A hundred days? What was the actress doing during that time? ""Fighting, a lot of the stunt work, a lot of the running through the streets in Venice, a lot of the work in Rome,"" she says. ""The big dialogue scenes, they came later on, once we had established the physicality of the character in all those bigger set pieces. Then we went, 'Okay, we've got to fill this in with some actual storytelling here. Let's work that out.'""
Much of ""the work in Rome"" to which Atwell refers involved shooting a car chase which found Grace and Ethan driving through the streets in a Fiat 500 while handcuffed together. In the finished film, Hunt almost immediately crashes that car after the pair get in the vehicle, a moment which, Atwell reveals, was not part of the day's shooting schedule.
""We nicknamed the car Trixie, because she had a life of her own,"" the actress says. ""It wasn't planned that Trixie crashes immediately when we set off in her, but we did by accident, and it ended up in the film. It's such a great comedic moment. I mean, how lovely to see Ethan Hunt back-footed and undermined by a little yellow cupcake car.""

Despite such moments, and Cruise's daredevil reputation, Atwell insists that her costar was always concerned about her safety on set and that she was having a good time.
""He wants to make sure that anyone that he's working with in those high-stakes environments that he's steering — literally and metaphorically — are capable but also safe and actually enjoying it,"" she says. ""That's one thing he said about the training: when you find the style that you like, you'll be able to get more advanced in it, because you physically enjoy doing it.""
Does Atwell think that the now-61-year-old Cruise will continue making these movies until he's, say, 150? ""Oh, I don't doubt it for a moment,"" the actress says. ""He loves it. He's an extrovert. He gets energy from being with people and making movies. His whole life is committed to this.""

Cruise will, of course, return for at least one more Ethan Hunt adventure, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two, which is set for release next June. McQuarrie and his cast had shot a chunk of the movie before breaking to embark on the publicity tour for Part One, but Atwell claims she is unable to tease the second half of the yarn.
""I can't, because I don't know what happens,"" she says. ""So much of 7, we weren't following a set script. We were finding things in the moment and then seeing what the scene owed in terms of the plot and the exposition and the character dynamic. That's their process. It's a very unique one that clearly works for Tom and McQ because of what they've been able to deliver. What's great for me as an actor is everything is sort of up for grabs in terms of what happens next.""
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is now screening in theaters.

2023-07-20 16:18:06+00:00,12 of Tom Cruise’s Most Jaw-Dropping Stunts,"From scaling a skyscraper to hanging on to the outside of an airplane as it takes off, THR has compiled a list of some of Tom Cruise's wildest stunts.","Tom Cruise has never steered away from challenging himself in his roles for projects. Especially since 1986’s Top Gun, he has continued to push the limits of his body and acting, taking on his own stunts in most of his top films, including Mission: Impossible, The Last Samurai and Jack Reacher.
Most recently, Cruise took on several death-defying stunts in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, including speed-flying down a mountainside as well as driving a motorcycle off a cliff and parachuting to safety.
The actor has previously said during an appearance on The Graham Norton Show that he has been “doing different stunts” since he was a child and that once he got into acting, he wanted to keep doing it to help with the “storytelling.”
“I feel that [when] acting you’re bringing everything, you know, physically and emotionally, to a character in a story,” he explained at the time. “And I’m able to do it [stunts], and I’ve trained for 30 years doing things like this that it allows us to put cameras in places where you normally are not able to.”
More recently, during a conversation at Cannes in 2022, Cruise reiterated that he enjoys performing his own stunts despite the danger, only this time he referenced one of the best athletes of Hollywood’s golden era.
“No one asked Gene Kelly, ‘Why do you dance?’” the actor said. “Why do you do your own dancing?’”

TOM CRUISE RUNNING IN MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE SINCE 1996
Tuxedo running. Slo-mo running. Gotta-catch-that-helicopter running. Evading-bullets running. Running while ripping away one of those eerily lifelike Mission: Impossible masks. Running while reloading a gun. Running into a terrifying leap out of a building. Running up the side of a building. Running into traffic. Running across rooftops. Running through tunnels. Running and diving through glass. Running through smoke. Lots of stairs and fireballs. All the while, his hair looks remarkably flawless and he barely seems to break a sweat—probably not the case for all the camera operators just trying to keep up with the guy.

,Review: Tom Cruise returns in 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One',"We are all things Seattle and the PNW, from food to fashion and entertainment to adventure.","The testosterone soap opera known as the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise has never been such a welcome sight for its weary fanbase. Few action blockbusters outside of the superhero genre have landed with audiences recently, and in a summer that has seen a slunk in numbers at the box office, Tom Cruise may be just the antidote the industry needs. That doesn't mean that is a perfect installment. In this year's second big-budget, franchise two-parter - it's debatable if this film or left audiences on a higher cliff by film's end - ""Dead Reckoning Part One"" forgoes the sadistic evil mastermind or sociopath seeking utter chaos. Instead, the film makes a bargain with an artificial devil known as The Entity. That's right. Ethan Hunt must harness his greatest assets, use every trick in his chapter book, use every ounce of knowledge and street smarts he can muster, all to face off against... a computer.
If you're rolling your eyes, it's for good reason. Hunt, an accomplished, well-filmed action hero, has had his fair share of complicated foes. But The Entity, as it's called, will divide audiences more than ever. AI is what keeps most tech junkies up at night these days, and there is reason to believe that such advanced technology could pose a threat to humans one day, but it is certainly an uncinematic opponent, to say the least. Skynet was, at the very least, a figment of the future; the Matrix was born of a dystopian alternative reality. The Entity is operating in the present day, beeping and bopping its way onto all the snarky ""Worst Villains"" lists the internet will inevitably contrive one day. And for good reason. It's a smart chip locked away at the bottom of the ocean, conveniently inaccessible and only destructible with a specific key. It will hardly instill global hysteria. Gabriel (Esai Morales), a mysterious, sinister villain from Hunt's past, enters stage right as a fleshy foe to appease the audience's need for human evil, but even he can't completely distract from The Entity's sometimes hilarious showboating.
Take, for instance, the scene in which Hunt learns exactly what The Entity is. He's crashed a Carnival-type party in Venice where a myriad of dancing guests wear masks and set a scene straight out of The party is hosted by the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), a carryover character known for her constant side-swapping and illegal dealings. The whole crew is gathered around: the White Widow, her entourage, Hunt, his trusty colleague Ilsa (Ferguson), a new acquaintance Grace (Hayley Atwell) whose stealthy pickpocket landed her in a hard drive of hot water (computer jokes really don't land the way you'd hope) and hovering nemesis Gabriel. As vague threats and intimidating glances course through the undercurrent of the dialogue, the final revelation allows a clear understanding: The Entity is everywhere, controlling everything, seeing everyone. It can compute every possible outcome and every imaginable scenario, outthinking and outwitting anyone attempting to stop it. The lights in the large, ancient venue turn an ominous green and flash to personify The Entity's possible evil cackle and to demonstrate its omnipresence.
Strobe lights! Panning camera shots! The look of realization on Cruise's face as he is surrounded by his body-less nemesis! Muah ha ha ha! It's The Entity!
It is by and far the film's most laughable sequence and one of the few that feels forced, farcical and calculated, an attempt to instill fear in viewers that would otherwise remain at giga-arm's length. Luckily, ""Dead Reckoning Part One"" has two weapons against audience disbelief and general premise fatigue: Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie. The twosome have been frequent collaborators over the years, with McQuarrie joining the ""Mission: Impossible"" family as director in 2015's ,"" and even though it's been a minute since Cruise last hopped onto his motorcycle for 2018's ,"" they return to the silver screen like no time has passed.
Speaking of moving vehicles, this film is full of them. The chase sequence through Rome - no you are not imagining it, ""Fast X"" also had an epic car chase through the Eternal City - is particularly fun and demonstrates the physicality and comedic timing that both Cruise and Atwell have mastered in their respective careers. You likely know Cruise's long filmography, but Atwell also has experience in big action flicks, having led a Marvel television series and starred in numerous MCU films as Captain America's significant other and government agent, Peggy Carter. McQuarrie knows how to write an entertaining, outrageous movie that may not have roots in reality, but that carries viewers happily through a saga that won't end (yet). Thankfully, it also doesn't slog like some other recent releases in the genre that have also pushed toward a 3-hour runtime.
The Entity won't keep viewers up at night, but the film is wound together by the chemistry between Cruise and his supporting troupe, including longtime castmates Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames and Ferguson, as well as newbie Atwell, whose wise-cracking, emotive performance steals the show. If you can let your inhibitions go out the moving train - yes, there is another moving train and rooftop battle sequence - then ""Dead Reckoning Part One"" will delight. Hunt and crew jetset around the globe, avoiding authorities, sticking the middle finger at government players and, of course, employing hyper-realistic masks, high-tech gadgets and the formidable stunt work that put ""Mission: Impossible"" on the map back in 1996.

2023-06-29 13:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE: Watch Tom Cruise Speedfly—His Most Dangerous 'Mission: Impossible' Stunt Ever,"Watch Tom Cruise ""speedfly,"" his most dangerous Mission: Impossible stunt ever, from Dead Reckoning Part One. He had to train for 3+ years to pull this off.","Tom Cruise is obscenely famous for so many things, but especially for performing death-defying stunts on the silver screen, each more ludicrous than the last.
To list all of Cruise’s formidable feats in the Mission: Impossible franchise feels like reciting from a fabricated resumé during a job interview for the position of World’s Most Badass Action Star: As indestructible spy Ethan Hunt, Cruise has leapt between buildings, hijacked a helicopter, hung from an Airbus A400M during takeoff, jumped out of a Boeing C-17 Globemaster III from 25,000 feet in the air, and scaled the friggin’ Burj Khalifa, among other perilous pursuits. References available upon request.
No surprise, then, that Cruise is upping the ante for the seventh Mission: Impossible installment, Dead Reckoning Part One, which hits theaters on July 12. “With Tom, there are no limits,” says director Christopher McQuarrie. “So we’ve become a little more adventurous every time.”

In Dead Reckoning, Cruise pulls off an especially complicated “speedflying” stunt, a sport in which you launch by foot with a small, wing-like canopy and glide down mountainsides. Very few people in the world even attempt speedflying, which is a bit like paragliding, only—duh—considerably more dangerous.
“One of the things that is particularly dangerous about speedflying is the close proximity to the ground that you’re flying,” says McQuarrie. “And the other is the risk that the canopy can collapse. It’s very unpredictable.”
Cruise says he wanted to give the audience the feeling of flight, so he trained for over three years in several countries, mastering different techniques, terrains, and weather conditions that could potentially stymie the stunt. The final stunt sees Cruise land at a blistering speed of over 80 kilometers per hour.
But devising the stunt was only one technical challenge, McQuarrie says. The other was developing new tech to actually show Cruise performing it: a gimbal rig with cameras hanging from both sides, operated from a helicopter chasing the hero while in flight. While the result is stunning, the process was stressful, to say the least.
“Flying very close to rocks looks quite beautiful,” says McQuarrie. “Behind the scenes, we were all in absolute terror.”

There is a stunt in the new Mission: Impossible in which Tom Cruise base jumps a motorcycle off a cliff and then free falls for a couple thousand feet. No big deal, right? Some are calling this particular stunt the biggest in cinema history. That can be debated. Cruise, however, says it's by far the most dangerous of his career.
Naturally then, behind-the-scenes footage of the stunt, which was shot in Norway, was released weeks prior to the film's opening, creating much buzz and conversation.
Larry Mantle who hosts FilmWeek on 89.3 FM and FilmWeek critic Amy Nicholson spoke with Wade Eastwood, the stunt coordinator for ""Mission Impossible"" about the pressure of orchestrating these stunts with one of Hollywood's biggest stars, his long career in stunt coordinating, and if he thinks it should get its own Oscar category.
The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full discussion here.
Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One, is the seventh film in a franchise that has spanned the past 27 years, opens this week in wide release.
About the pressure of high-level stunts
Larry Mantle: Wade Eastwood, thanks so much for joining us. Let me ask you about the challenge of doing a stunt-heavy film like this with a huge star and the risk that goes into that. Tom Cruise's death-defying stunts are legendary. Is there extra pressure when you're working with such a big star doing such dramatic stunts as are in this film?
You know, I approach it the same way to approach any sort of human being really. It's a life on the end of that line or on that motorbike. So I approach it in the same way. In some ways, I'm spoiled because I have Tom, who's very competent and is willing to put in the time and the training. It's not like I have an actor that just wants to do something but doesn't really have the skill or ability. This is with Tom, who understands the amount of training to make him so competent so that there's no one else that would be safer doing the stunt. Obviously, no one else can perform the character like he can. So it's a win-win situation.
The only thing I have to do is, once we've come up with a stunt, which we collaborate on, we write them, we beat sheet them and we find out what works for the characters and the story and what doesn't. And once we find a sequence that really works, then I work on a training schedule. Once that training schedule's in place we push ahead and Tom's on board. He's always a hundred percent. He puts that time and the hours in and we plug away. And then once we're ready, we film it.

What characters have to do with the stunts they perform
Amy Nicholson: I keep hearing you say the word character. And I'm curious, what makes an Ethan Hunt stunt different than a superhero stunt?
The way I approach the action and mission is if I was doing it. Ethan's character, he acts first and thinks last. It's all about saving lives and protecting his. If I was in that situation, where I had to protect my team or protect my family or whatever it was in real life, then yeah, you would do certain things, you know, and you'd react in a certain way. Tom's the sort of gut person that if someone was in trouble he would jump in first and then think about how to save himself after.
Tom's just one of those human beings in life that's geared that way. He wouldn't stand by and watch someone, you know, suffer or get hurt.
Tom's just one of those human beings in life that's geared that way. He wouldn't stand by and watch someone, you know, suffer or get hurt. — Wade Eastwood
I think that's easy to then bring across into the character because I look at things like the bathroom fight. If I'm ever going to the toilet in a public toilet at a hotel bathroom, I'm always looking at things that I could use as a weapon or things to escape. It's just the way I always have been with my creative process. And so, I'll just bring that into the Mission world and having Tom doing everything, the camera can follow him so subjectively on his journey that the audience are totally immersed in that moment with the character because there's no break. They take a breath when the character takes a breath, and they feel every little detail of what he's exploring in the space. I think that's what really keeps us captivated and keeps us on this emotional rollercoaster.

Let's talk about that motorcycle stunt
Nicholson: One of the moments that really made my jaw drop when I watched the film was, we know he does this big motorcycle jump, we know that he's done I think over 10,000 practice jumps to do it. But what still astonished me in the moment was that, I forgot that Tom Cruise would have to look to the camera, deliver a line as Ethan, then do the stunt and that he's acting while doing it. That kind of synergy of acting and, almost like the human accident of everything that's happening.
Tom's very good at playing and that's why the training is so key. So I will put the team together to train Tom to a very high level, a world-class level in some disciplines, and then once he's a hundred percent relaxed and competent at that level, he then starts training himself to play Ethan and play the character at that level. That's the really hard part, and that's what I try to get across too.
I can't emphasize it enough how hard that is to do. You have to be so competent at what you're doing in order to have enough relax in your brain to play something else. — Wade Eastwood
If I'm doing something as a stuntman, as Wade Eastwood, who no one knows, I just do my thing. I do a base jump or a speed flight or whatever. I'm doing a motorbike jump and it's just me. All I'm focused on is my eye line where I've got to look, my drills, my emergency procedures, my this, my that.
Playing somebody else and doing the right facial expressions and shouting and also finding the light...I can't emphasize it enough how hard that is to do. You have to be so competent at what you're doing in order to have enough relax in your brain to play something else.

How to handle an actor with a fear of heights
Mantle: Wade, you were describing how one of the stars of the film, Rebecca Ferguson, with a fear of heights, took her up to the top of the Vienna Opera House, for I think you said 15 feet. And then you were going to be doing something far more than that for the big scene in the film. So how did you transition from there?
You know, you have to respect their fears and understand them. They can't, just because they've been given this role, suddenly snap out of it.
You know, a lot of movies, they will use a stunt double for that. They'll have the actor land the last 10 feet and they'll use a stunt double for the rest and do it in a wide shot. Whereas the way Mission shoots, we want to be subjective. We want to be with that character. We want to feel the emotion of the step.
So it's my job to try and push them as much as I can and push their comfort zone and more importantly, their understanding and respect of, in this case, the height so that they trust the team, they trust the equipment, the wires, whatever rigging we're using. And they trust the whole process.
Once they do, they can relax and deliver whatever needs to be delivered as their character. So, in this case, what I normally do with heights and what I did with Rebecca was, I would just inch her up a little bit. And, you know, 15 feet we started at, and would drop her a little bit faster, have a little scream and catch your breath and then go up to 20 foot, and 25 foot, and then, you know, lie a little bit that we're at 30 feet when we're actually at 40 and then afterwards tell her we're actually at 40 and gain her trust back. We have a few little games. Then get to a height that she's comfortable at and stay there for a while.
With Rebecca, I would make her try and shout at me, say a full line before she touches the mat on the ground, or sing a song, or something to take her mind off it. It was a process that really worked with her and then in no time, we were at 70 foot and she was comfortable and she was doing it all day long and actually, Rebecca couldn't get enough of it.
Nicholson: In that moment right before something like that jump, is there anything you don't say? Is it just bad luck to say break a leg? Do you say good luck?
Yeah, I probably wouldn't say that at that moment. No, it's just, you make them fully relaxed. They know my process. I don't have a lot of sort of loud voices on set. It's very quiet. I give them the thumbs up, give them a look and I walk away so they can get immersed in their character and their performance and forget about the stunt.
The stunt is incidental. The stunt is just something that's happening to make the journey from A to B in this case. What's more important is the reason they're taking the journey and why their characters are doing this. So I want them to have that space to get the audience immersed and not just be looking at the spectacle of the stunt.

Should stunts get an Oscar?
Mantle: There's a move towards seeing if the Motion Picture Academy will include an Oscar category for stunt coordination. What progress are you and your fellow stunt coordinators making in that effort?
I think it's crazy that we're not included when these big action movies are all stunts. There's a category for everything: music, hair, makeup, special effects, visual effects. It's everything except stunts. Pretty much making a cup of tea or coffee gets an award except stunts, but saying all that, I'm not a big awards person myself. I'm not on any board or I'm not promoting it with anything. Truthfully, I don't really care. What I care about is putting bums in seats and making the audience leave talking about that movie, having the best experience. And to me, if I get a review or report that's like, 'Oh my God, that action sequence was off the charts, I went and watched it five times.' That's more important to me than a hundred awards.

2023-07-31 11:00:50+00:00,How Editor Eddie Hamilton Cut “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” to the Quick,"Editor Eddie Hamilton knows the ""Mission: Impossible"" formula better than almost anyone not named Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie.","How Editor Eddie Hamilton Cut “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” to the Quick
As it is, Tom Cruise’s new Mission: Impossible movie (now playing) runs a hefty two hours and forty-three minutes, but what people see in theaters actually represents a very slimmed-down version of the original cut that director Christopher McQuarrie screened for his friends. “It ran four hours,” says Cruise’s go-to editor Eddie Hamilton. “We watched it in a screening room with 40 people, and it was two and a half hours to Venice. Then we had snacks and came back for the last hour and a half.”
Hamilton, who earned an Oscar nomination for Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick and cut previous Mission: Impossible entries Rogue One and Fallout, faced an embarrassment of riches in the Dead Reckoning Part One rough cut. High-energy performances, eye-popping stunts, and locations like Abu Dubai, Rome, Venice, and Norway filled the screen. For the seasoned editor, the challenge came in streamlining all that footage into the summer popcorn movie that has so far grossed $370 million and critical acclaim.
Speaking from his home in London, Hamilton explains the tricks of the trade he used to reckon with Dead Reckoning‘s car chases, motorcycle stunts, and multiple character arcs.
Dead Reckoning throws many plates up in the air — new villains, old villains, the “cruciform key” Macguffin, Ethan Hunt’s gang, plus the addition of Hayley Atwell’s new pickpocket femme fatale character Grace. How do you balance all that plot information with emotional beats?
That’s the push-pull we deal with every single day. Especially on a long movie like this, you have to make sure that there’s no air. We discussed it all the time with Chris McQuarrie being like: “I’m feeling air, I’m feeling air.” I’ve been working on the movie for three years, I’ve watched it 700 times and seen it iterate day after day, compressing, compressing, compressing.
You like to keep things moving.
But you can get to the point where you compress it too much. Right at the end of the movie, Ethan Hunt’s talking to the henchwoman Paris, where she’s lying there going, “Why did you spare my life?” We did an ultra-tight version of that scene where I cut all the air out. I came back the next day and watched it again with Chris. We went, “Woah. There’s no emotion at all. I don’t feel anything. It’s just information,” And information is the death of emotion.
The movie’s first big set piece at the airport introduces Hayley Atwell’s character Grace, plus multiple bad guys, surveillance cameras, cutbacks to Luther and his laptop, and you’ve got Benji racing around trying to find a ticking bomb, and Ethan Hunt’s in the middle of it all. That’s a lot of moving parts!
The airport scene was filmed partially at a real airport in Abu Dhabi. It was phenomenally difficult, but Chris doesn’t worry too much about figuring everything out on the page or even on set. The actors give us a lot of flavors, he collects the ingredients, and then we bake the cake in the editing room. That sequence took weeks of work. We had to intercut between Luther and Ethan and Grace and Paris and the buyer while also making sure the graphics on Benji’s laptop are designed so that your eye is guided around the screen. The first time never works. We throw it all out, and it still doesn’t work. It’s an evolutionary process. Honestly, I was working on that scene for two years.
Complex sequences seem to have become part of Mission: Impossible’s DNA.
If you think back to the opera scene in Rogue Nation, there’s all this cross-cutting to keep each character “alive,” so it’s similar in that way to the airport sequence. Chris likes to challenge himself with complicated sequences because he knows that when we sit together in the edit, we will refine it until we eventually get there.
Can you give an example of what it means to “refine” the raw footage?
It often involves going back and getting little close-ups of people, little bits of information. Or in the case of Hayley Atwell, she was finding her character every day. Is Grace scared? Confident? Flirty with Tom? Wily? There were times when she was a bit too confident, a bit smug, and we dialed that down. We modulated Hayley’s performance all the way through.
Were you present on set to make edits during production?
Yes, some of the time. I’d have a feed on my iPad, and on day two of the production, I’m working on day one footage, knowing it’s going to be rough and everything’s going to change. But you’ve got to start somewhere. I went through dailies and watched everything. We had 780 hours of footage on this movie.
The car chases in Rome looked phenomenal. How did you piece that footage together?
I’m thrilled with the way it turned out, but the Rome sequence took weeks of careful work to make sure [the action] landed correctly. You have to understand that Tom Cruise and Hayley Atwell are in a two-shot the entire time. You’re not cutting to create chemistry — you’re allowing their behavior to play out in a two-shot. One of our touchstone movies was What’s Up Doc.
The screwball comedy with Barbara Streisand?
Yeah. Chris loved that film and really embraced that approach in the Fiat and, before that, the BMW chase where Ethan’s handcuffed to Grace, and he’s driving one-handed. We filmed so much cool stuff but ended up compressing it because we kept getting feedback from the audience that it was just too long. Tom would always tell us, “You’ve always got to leave the audience wanting more,” so that became our mantra. We said, “Okay, we’re going to dive back into the chase sequence and take out more until it’s the right length.” Chris and Tom listen to the audience very carefully. They want to make mass entertainment for people in every country on the planet.
Can you talk a bit more about editing the action in Rome so it would track for an audience?
The trick is any time you cut to Tom and Hayley reacting in the car, you can then jump to any location without losing the audience, apart from locals. We cut to Ethan, and he turns right; we’re in a different part of the city, and who cares? Sometimes we’d take one chase and combine it with another one, and you don’t even notice that we’re in two different parts of the city. So we do cheat. But we’re constantly trying to keep this dynamic energy going with pressure from the other characters and the gags while we’re balancing all of that with Tom’s precision driving, where he carefully knocks over scooters or drives into some tiny alley. We cut out quite a bit of cool stuff, so we’re going to do a deleted shots reel for the DVD where you can see all these bits in a montage.
For the grand finale, you’ve got Tom Cruise and his motorcycle flying through the air to land on a speeding train – – pretty spectacular. Were you on set when they shot that?
Yeah. In September 2020, I was in Norway when they filmed the jump, but it’s always about the emotional state, isn’t it? Because it doesn’t matter if someone does a stunt if you don’t have an emotional connection to the characters and the stakes, and why people are doing what they’re doing. How much of the story do we see before we see Ethan on the motorbike? How often do we cut to Grace and the White Widow on the train? To get all those pieces balanced correctly, you have to work really hard to make everything smooth and emotional, so you’re not bumped off the ride.
You clearly place a premium on paring the story down to its essence.
You have to be utterly ruthless. Even in the last week of the edit, I’d say to Chris, “We’ve got to cut this; we’ve got to cut that.” This was stuff that Chris was very fond of, but he was like, “If it can go, it must go.” It’s the art of getting the maximum amount of story into the minimum amount of screen time. That’s what you’re aiming for. That’s the holy grail.

Dead Reckoning Part One will clock in at two hours and 36 minutes without credits, pushing it past 2018's Mission: Impossible Fallout, which had a runtime of two hours and 27 minutes. Speaking to IGN's Stella Chung at the film's junket in Rome, McQuarrie explained that it had ""nothing to do with a trend of any kind,"" referring to the amount of two-part movies hitting theaters these days.
""We knew the movie was so big, and rather than trying to contain it all in a two-hour movie, we just very early on said, 'let's break this up into two parts,' "" he explains. ""A lot of characters, a lot of action. It was a very big story that needed two parts.""
McQuarrie told Collider, meanwhile, that he always knew the next chapter would be bigger than Fallout.
""Fallout really grew because of all the character and emotion we were putting into the story,"" he said. ""I knew I wanted to expand the cast, and I knew I wanted to give each one of those characters more to do, so I knew the movie was going to be bigger and longer than Fallout.
""At which point I said, 'Why are we fighting this? Why are we going to try to jam this into two hours? Let's just break it in half and make it two movies,'"" he added, reflecting on the decision. ""That really was the rationale behind it being a two-part movie. It wasn't just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie.""
McQuarrie said Paramount Pictures were receptive to the idea of splitting the story across two films, but production of the two titles didn't come without its challenges. There was a lot of planning, coordinating, and managing that needed time on the logistics side of the shoot.
""It was complicated by the fact that certain things in Part Two required stopping Part One to shoot them, whether it was because of weather or actor availability,"" he said. ""And so, with all the other challenges that were confronting this movie while we were making it, there was the challenge of stopping in the middle, not even knowing what the full movie was, and trying to predict what it was in the second film.""
The two films were supposed to be filmed back-to-back, but the production faced multiple setbacks amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Principal photography on Part Two eventually kicked off in March 2022, though McQuarrie admits they still haven't figured out the ending.
""I don't know what the ending of Part Two is, so I couldn't tell you,"" he confessed to Collider. ""I'm not being evasive. I could tell you that I know what the end of Part Two is, but I can't guarantee that that will be the ending when we get there. Tom and I never obsess about executing the plan. We always have a direction, we always have a place we're going.
""In retrospect, it sounds as though what we do is just flying by the seat of our pants and making it up as we go along,"" he continued. ""That's not an accurate description. You are definitely flying in a direction, you're definitely prepared. You couldn't be that cavalier without somebody getting seriously physically hurt. These things are planned within an inch of their life. Along the way, we see a shiny object and go for it.""
There's a lot of hype building for Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, as the two-part movie will reportedly serve as a send-off for Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt. Part One will hit theaters on July 12, 2023, with Part Two expected to follow less than a year later, on June 28, 2024.

DTC revenue of $1.66 billion beat forecasts, up 40% from a year ago, as did the traditional TV Media businesss (CBS and cable networks) where revenue of $5.1 billion was down 2%, less than expected. DTC subscription revenue rose 47%, ad sales were up 21%. Paramount+ revenue grew 47%. Total DTC losses narrowed to $424 million from $445 million for the quarter. Executives have called 2023 is the peak year for streaming losses and negative free cash cash after it joined the industry in a major pivot.
In TV Media, ad revenue dipped 10% to $1.95 billion. Affiliate and subscriptions revenue eased 2%. Licensing and other rose 17% to $1.2 billion. OIBDA (operating income before depreciation and amortization) fell 13% to $1.14 billion.
“In Q2, we maintained our focus on scaling our streaming platforms, maximizing our traditional business, and building a sustainable business model that will return the company to significant earnings growth in 2024,” said CEO Bob Bakish. “Notably, Paramount+ revenue grew 47%, total DTC ad revenue increased 21%, and global viewing hours on Paramount+ and Pluto TV were up 35% year-over-year. And despite the environment, TV Media continued to contribute significant earnings. As we look forward, we will continue to be guided by our content-first approach and seek to maximize its value across platforms and revenue streams, while also operating with the utmost efficiency through this year of peak streaming investment.”
Paramount Global’s total revenue of $7.6 billion was also down 2% but above forecasts of $7.4 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of 10 cents — down from 64 cents a year ago — also beat expectations that were flat to down a penny.
Filmed entertainment sales plunged nearly 40% to $831 million on the Top Gun comparison. Adjusted OIBDA dropped by almost 100% to $5 million from $181 million, reflecting the timing and mix of theatrical releases each year.
On a post-earnings conference call with analysts, CEO Bob Bakish said the company will direct proceeds of the Simon & Schuster deal to paying down debt and took questions, many of which dealt with the ongoing strikes byt the WGA and SAG-AFTFA. He’s “hopeful” for a resolution sooner rather than later and said the company’s TV and streaming in decent shape through the fall given content in the pipeline, “but it all depends on duration.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvcGFyYW1vdW50LWdsb2JhbC1jYnMtdHJhbnNmb3JtZXJzLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1lYXJuaW5ncy10b3AtZ3VuLTEyMzU0NTY2MTYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-17 20:33:14+00:00,Vanessa Kirby and Hayley Atwell Explain How ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning’ Pulled Off That Thrilling Mask Sequence,'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning' stars Vanessa Kirby and Hayley Atwell and editor Eddie Hamilton explain the franchise's thrilling mask reveal.,"SPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” now playing in theaters.
The “Mission: Impossible” movies have no shortage of death-defying stunts, but the Tom Cruise-starring action franchise is known for another iconic magic trick: its mask reveals.
“Dead Reckoning Part One” features two mask reveals — in the first, Cruise’s Ethan Hunt uses a mask to infiltrate a meeting between CIA director Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny) and officials from various intelligence agencies about a rogue artificial intelligence system, known as the Entity. The other is a face swap between Hayley Atwell’s Grace, a pickpocket who becomes embroiled in IMF’s hunt for the Entity, and Vanessa Kirby’s black-market arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis, aka the White Widow.
“It was so much fun. It was the first time two women have got to do that,” Kirby told Variety on the red carpet at the film’s New York premiere.
“It was such an amazing gift — because I love Hayley — to channel her and get to play her for a bit, and to get to play somebody that was totally out of control,” she continued. “My character is usually so restrained and composed and in control; it was really, really fun to play someone a bit scrappier and a bit messier. I’m naturally more messy in real life, so I felt more at home in that sense.”
In a separate interview, Atwell echoed Kirby’s excitement, sharing that the two became particularly close while training together for the film amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “We both have a background in theater, and we’re both British, and we had mutual friends,” Atwell said.
There’s something so satisfying about watching Ethan or another character (i.e. Simon Pegg’s IMF field agent Benji or the villainous Dougray Scott posing as Ethan) rip off their prosthetic disguise to reveal themselves to a shocked party. But pulling off those scenes requires as much technical skill from the filmmakers as it showcases the actor’s versatility. (The late Philip Seymour Hoffman’s take on Cruise’s super spy persona Ethan Hunt when they pull a switcheroo during “Mission: Impossible III” is an absolute master class.)
“We’re always trying to come up with new and original ways of doing it because it’s a signature ‘Mission: Impossible’ move,” said Oscar-winning film editor Eddie Hamilton, who boarded the franchise with 2015’s “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation” and continued on with 2018’s “Fallout” and the two-part “Dead Reckoning.”
Hamilton teased that there was a third mask reveal which landed on the cutting room floor “because it no longer had relevance” in the larger story. The scene was near the beginning of the movie and got nixed because it undercut the significance of Ethan’s big moment.
“It was the right decision, ultimately,” Hamilton said of scrapping the scene. “There are quite a lot of people who’ve never seen a ‘Mission: Impossible’ movie who might be coming to see this because of the goodwill of ‘Top Gun: Maverick,’ so that [first scene] is a great moment to have a mask reveal, because you’re like ‘What the hell is going on?’”

The mask moment between Grace and Alanna comes as part of “Dead Reckoning’s” complex final scheme, where Ethan and Grace must infiltrate a meeting between the White Widow and her mysterious buyer on board the Orient Express as a last ditch-effort to obtain the key to access the Entity’s source code.
The plan — Grace will go to the meeting disguised as Alanna, while Ethan assumes the identity of her brother, Zola. To do that, they must board the train without being recognized, tranquilize Alanna and Zola, meet the buyer, acquire the completed key and get off the train undetected. It’s a ruse that’d require everything to go perfectly to succeed, but when the mask machine breaks, the team must improvise, with Grace going in alone and Ethan boarding while the train is in motion.
Accomplishing the scene required some moviemaking tricks. The reason why Alanna’s face looks so perfect when being created by the mask machine is because it’s actually Kirby’s face, with her body hidden out of frame.
“Her body’s down there,” Hamilton said, motioning below the frame of his Zoom camera. “She’s keeping her eyes sharp, and the VFX team put the edge of the briefcase in across her neck and painted her out of the shot.”
Then there’s a hidden wipe between Atwell putting on the White Widow mask and Kirby standing in the mirror as “The Gray Widow” (the nickname filmmakers gave to the in-disguise character).
“What’s so elegant about it is there’s two stitches,” Hamilton said. “But you don’t realize what you’re seeing until [Grace] walks up to the mirror, and you’re like ‘Wait, what? How did that happen? That was completely seamless.'”
The trickery of the scene, Hamilton explained, is to make moviegoers feel like they’re starting their journey into the third act of the movie, but it’s a ruse. “We’re having fun with the audience’s expectations of how these films play out, which is great,” he adds.
Beyond the mechanics of the sequence, the White Widow mask moment allowed Kirby to flex her acting chops. When discussing the scene, Atwell heaped praise on Kirby’s mimicry of her mannerisms and pointed to a small tell in her co-star’s performance that distinguished the transition from Alanna to Grace.
“There’s an echo gesture that she does: when I fall backwards on the tracks in the little Fiat 500, I sort of blow hair out of my face, [Vanessa] then does it as she comes out of the cabin as Grace playing the White Widow,” Atwell explained. “She sees her brother there and she does it as well, and there’s a different kind of manic energy in her eyes. That’s all Vanessa studying me a little bit and having a great time. It is remarkable.”
In addition to being a fun visual gag, the sequence also serves as part of Grace’s redemption arc. (Originally, there was a version of this scene where Grace tranquilized Ethan, Luther [Ving Rhames] and Benji and boarded the train on her own to “try to get money from the buyer and maybe bargain her way out of the situation she’s in,” Hamilton said. “But the test audience didn’t really like that idea, so we came up with this idea.”)
Grace’s decision not to take the money was “her moment of reckoning,” Atwell said, crediting Kirby with pulling off that pivotal turn, which sets up the character’s future in part two. “I love that moment,” Atwell said of the way her fellow actor played the scene. “That’s Vanessa being brilliant and being able to show off her range.”
And the mask itself was also a helpful prop for Atwell to demonstrate Grace’s new state of mind. In fact, the way Grace strips off the Gray Widow mask at the end of the sequence was intended to feel a bit like “an exorcism.”
“It’s like I’m throwing [it] away. Like I just don’t like the version of myself I was when I had the mask on, and I’m getting it out of my system,” Atwell explained. “I’m taking off the old identity of who Grace was from the first half of the movie, when she realizes, ‘If I had taken the money, it would have been more than the key I was giving away.’”
These interviews were conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike began.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2ZlYXR1cmVzL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS03LXZhbmVzc2Eta2lyYnktaGF5bGV5LWF0d2VsbC1tYXNrLXNjZW5lLXRyYWluLTEyMzU2NzE1ODkv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vZmVhdHVyZXMvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLTctdmFuZXNzYS1raXJieS1oYXlsZXktYXR3ZWxsLW1hc2stc2NlbmUtdHJhaW4tMTIzNTY3MTU4OS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,'Mission Impossible 7' director explains why major character had to die,'Mission: Impossible 7' director Christopher McQuarrie explains the thinking behind the death of that major character: 'It was one of the earliest conversations.'x,"Warning: This article contains spoilers for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.
The most shocking event which occurs in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is arguably not the sight of Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt riding a motorbike off a cliff, but rather the death of Hunt's friend and fellow spy Ilsa Faust, a major part of the franchise since 2015's Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation. Portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson, Faust is killed on a Venice bridge by Esai Morales' villainous Gabriel while Hunt runs (of course!) through the Italian city, arriving too late to help her.
In a new podcast interview with Empire, the film's director and co-writer Christopher McQuarrie discusses why he and Cruise, who produced the movie with McQuarrie, felt the need to kill off Ferguson's character.

""It was one of the earliest conversations. We were on the set of Top Gun, we were already talking about it,"" says the filmmaker, referring to last year's Joseph Kosinski-directed Top Gun: Maverick, which McQuarrie co-wrote. ""We knew that that emotional arc was of a certain emotional tone... Ilsa is a wonderful character, and a character of which I am enormously proud, and Rebecca is an actor of such unmitigated power and presence.""
He continued, ""And yet, where we had gone with the character from Rogue to Fallout...[the] place you took that character would either make less of her, it would suddenly become frivolous... or she would just become a romantic interest, and it was never about creating a character who was defined by her love story with Ethan Hunt. Their relationship transcends a traditional loving story... They're doomed to be together and yet doomed never to be together... It felt like that story was looking for its resolution and so we said this has got to happen.""
McQuarrie goes on to explain that his and Cruise's decision to conclude Faust's story dovetailed with their desire to give a sense of genuine stakes to the movie.
""What really needs to happen in the story is the stakes have to be real, they can't be implied,"" says the director. ""We have to have the courage to let [Ethan] fail and it has to cost, the mission has to cost, and without that, the villain simply will not have a threat…what you're seeing in the escalation of the story is what it costs Ethan personally in Venice.""
When asked if the pair had considered the possibility of killing off Simon Pegg's Benji Dunn or Ving Rhames' Luther Stickell, the director said ""we explored them all"" before ominously pointing out that the recent film is, after all, just Part One of the tale.

2023-06-16 13:15:00+00:00,"The Fight for Imax: How Studios Beg and Barter to Get ‘Mission: Impossible,’ ‘Oppenheimer’ and More Blockbusters on Premium Screens","At the movies, there are tense negotiations between studios and Imax to secure all-important premium screens.","There’s been a battle brewing between two of Hollywood’s blockbuster talents.
In one corner, Tom Cruise is gearing to take a victory lap from the behemoth success of “Top Gun: Maverick” with a sequel to his other big action franchise, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.” It’s expected to be one of the biggest movies of the summer when it opens on July 12. In the other corner, Christopher Nolan, one of the few directors so famous that his name alone can draw crowds, is readying to release his highly anticipated “Oppenheimer.” The big-budget drama about the creation of the atomic bomb launches just a week later on July 21.
At the center of the drama is access to Imax, and how the company’s 401 North American screens will be divided between the two box office draws.
Except, in this case, there wasn’t much to negotiate. Paramount’s “Mission: Impossible 7” is only playing on Imax screens for one week, as first reported by Puck, a newsletter that covers the media business, before it has to relinquish all of its showtimes to “Oppenheimer.” That’s despite Cruise making a few calls around town to remind everyone that not even a year ago, “Maverick” earned more than $100 million from Imax alone. By shorting the Imax run of “Dead Reckoning,” he suggests, all involved parties risk losing out on serious coinage.
But long before the oft-delayed “MI” sequel moved to mid-July, Universal had already ironed out a rare agreement for “Oppenehimer” to control Imax’s entire North American footprint for three full weeks. (Directors like Nolan, who use Imax cameras to film their movies, are typically granted a two-week exclusive window.) Greta Gerwig’s star-studded “Barbie,” which also opens on July 21, isn’t playing in Imax at all as a result.
“I feel sad in a way we can’t accommodate all of them. I know ‘Mission: Impossible’ is going to be a really big movie,” Imax CEO Rich Gelfond tells Variety. “Nolan has a special place in Imax’s heart because he uses our cameras and promotes us. It’s not a matter of us saying which we can make more money on. I would hope after ‘Oppenheimer’s’ run, we can bring back ‘Mission.'”
There may be more of these fights brewing in the future. Here’s why: Attendance hasn’t rebounded in pandemic times, but the demand to watch certain movies on the biggest and brightest screens, known in the industry as premium large formats (PLF), has grown exponentially. Lest that sound like spin from PLF operators, there are stats to back up the idea that audiences are buying what they’re selling. Moviegoing is down 33% from 2019, but the market share for Imax, one of the art’s more recognizable forms, is up 50% without adding any new screens, according to the company. On a big-budget tentpole, those enhanced viewing experiences can account for as much as 30-40% of overall box office returns even though there are only about 900 PLF screens in the country. As a result, studios have more at stake in the battle for access to the finite number of screens that can generate outsized ticket sales.
To pluck a recent example of Imax’s box office heft, take Sony’s “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.” The animated comic book adventure opened to a mighty $120 million from 4,313 North American locations, and averaged $19,736 per location on standard 2D screens. In contrast, it brought in an average of $25,159 per location on PLF screens; and $34,214 per location on Imax screens.
Those figures defy conventional wisdom that price deters people from going to the movies. Tickets for PLF are significantly more expensive, costing up to $28 in major cities like New York City and Los Angeles compared to $18 for regular 2D seats. And yet, those formats are usually the first to sell out for visual effects-heavy movies like “Oppenheimer” and “Mission: Impossible,” with dazzling graphics, crazy stunts and talent that says – nay, insists – it’s not just the best, but the only, way to experience their films.
So how do studios ensure their movies are playing on as many premium large format screens as possible? They fight over them, of course. For distribution chiefs, who handle the theatrical rollout of a movie, an important part of the job is haggling and calling in favors with movie theater owners to guarantee their upcoming box office draw has more prime showtimes than rival offerings.
Imax operates differently than other PLF operators because it doesn’t take as much input from studios when scheduling showtimes. Studios, of course, set the release dates for their own movies. But when there’s a pileup of blockbusters, like the one-two-three punch of “Indiana Jones,” “Mission: Impossible” and “Oppenheimer” in late June and into July, it’s Imax who gets to dictate which of those it’ll be offering its patrons beyond opening weekend.
That’s not how it works for Dolby, ScreenX, 4DX and essentially any other premium large format. Bargaining for those screens is similar to the standard 2D operation, which is a more flexible arrangement that factors in the popularity of a movie as well as the rapport between exhibitors and studios or filmmakers.
Most movie theaters have at least one auditorium with PLF capabilities, with larger multiplexes housing two or three with those special projectors. After a film’s opening weekend, it typically cedes many, if not most, of its premium screens to whatever movie launches on the following weekend. However, if a film is an outsized success story, it stands a better chance at retaining more of those PLF auditoriums in subsequent weeks. And that’s, of course, assuming the movie has the right scale and scope to get people excited. No offense to “80 for Brady” or “Book Club: The Next Chapter,” but very little about those films require its audience to watch it in 3D. So even if “Oppenheimer” is rolling in to town, the latest “Mission: Impossible” movie will still be available in many theaters with enhanced sound and wider screens in its second, third, and even forth weekend.
This is where negotiations can effectively come into play. Studios can’t outright withhold or promise access to one blockbuster in exchange for another that may be riskier in terms of commercial appeal. But they can certainly remind the exhibitors of past successes in hopes that they will want to reward the studio or creative talent with more screens on future projects. This is where Paramount will get to leverage the enduring appeal of “Top Gun: Maverick” as “Dead Reckoning” makes its way to theaters. Ditto Disney with “Avatar: The Way of Water” as it books “Indiana Jones” and Universal with “Super Mario Bros. Movie” as “Oppenheimer” gears up to release. The problem, some insiders lament, is that exhibitors can have short memories. One executive with knowledge of these conversations says it’s a game of “what have you done for me lately?”
There’s a reason that Imax has more control, and it’s not necessarily its ubiquity in the exhibition space. The company uses a proprietary technology to create a film print that’s specifically designed to fit the aspect ratio of its screens. Alternatively, the rest of the country’s PLF operators can project the same version of a movie that they would play on 2D screens, which the studio’s provide. They don’t need to commission specific prints for their high-definition or XD auditoriums. It gives them more scheduling flexibility compared to Imax, which also can’t pivot as quickly in the event that a movie isn’t selling tickets. Since Imax isn’t planning to offer “Barbie,” it won’t have a version of the movie to play even if the company later decided it wanted to slot a few showtimes.
Complicating the matter is that Imax has a vested interest in certain movies like the Marvel installment “Eternals,” Jordan Peele’s “Us” and “Oppenheimer” that use its patented technology. That leaves the company eager to prioritize those films when it comes to deciding who gets its limited screens. Relationships that Imax has fostered with certain directors, like Nolan and Denis Villeneuve (“Dune”), sometimes appearl to trump the demand for popular franchises and long-running series that would otherwise be hugely important to theater operators, insiders say.
“In a situation where there’s an unavoidable conflict,” Gelfond says, “we’ll look at a number of factors: how the franchise has performed before, visuals, and our relationship to the filmmaker.”
Nolan, for his part, is known to breathlessly evangelize about the singular of experience of Imax, going as far as branding it “the best film format that was ever invented.” As he promoted 2012’s “The Dark Knight” he told the masses that “it’s the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion.”
That kind of publicity makes it worth going all in on Nolan, even at the expense of Cruise.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3Mvb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWJhdHRsZS1pbWF4LXNjcmVlbnMtMTIzNTYzMzUzNy_SAWVodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9uZXdzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1iYXR0bGUtaW1heC1zY3JlZW5zLTEyMzU2MzM1MzcvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One and Part Two: Release Date, Trailers, Cast & More","We break down the characters, the voice cast, the plot, the release date, and more.","Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to watch Tom Cruise drive a motorcycle off a cliff. The seventh movie in the Mission: Impossible franchise will hit theaters this July, and it looks as though it will continue Cruise’s tradition of putting increasingly jaw-dropping, death defying stunts into each one of these action flicks. But, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One will just be the first half of a two-part story, as the title suggests. Ahead of the premiere of the first half of Ethan Hunt’s next mission, we’ve done our own stunt work and gathered up everything you need to know about the Dead Reckoning Part One and Part Two.
When Do Parts One and Two Come Out?

Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One, the seventh film in the Crusie-led film adaptation of the ’60s and ’70s espionage TV series, hits theaters soon, on July 12, 2023. Fans won’t have to wait (that) long for the conclusion, as Part Two is set to premiere slightly under a year later, on June 28, 2024. However, filming on Part Two is currently paused due to the Writers Strike, so it’s quite possible that the release date will be delayed again.
Both movies will be exclusive theatrical releases — and if they’re anything like Top Gun: Maverick, another Cruise movie from Paramount Pictures, the same studio behind Mission: Impossible, they won’t be streaming for a while. Maverick hit Paramount+ more than 200 days after its theatrical premiere.
Were it not for the COVID-19 pandemic, Dead Reckoning would have already been released, as Part One was originally slated for a July 2021 premiere. Delays due to the pandemic and subsequent COVID filming protocols (this is where Cruise’s viral, uh, virus rant originated) pushed the release back to 2022, then eventually to 2023.
Though it’s rare that any franchise ever truly ends, Dead Reckoning Part Two is expected to be the end of the franchise — at least as it currently exists.
Who’s Directing It?

Christopher McQuarrie, the director who took Mission: Impossible to new heights starting with Rogue Nation, the fifth film in the franchise, returns for both Part One and Part Two of Dead Reckoning. McQuarrie also co-wrote both installments with Erik Jendresen.

Tom Cruise first played IMF agent extraordinaire Ethan Hunt in 1996 when the original Mission: Impossible hit theaters. He’ll have just turned 61 when Dead Reckoning Part One premieres, and Part Two will supposedly be his final appearance as the character, some 28 years later.
He’ll be joined by several returning cast members, including Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames as his fellow IMF agents Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, respectively. Rebecca Ferguson returns as ex-MI6 agent Ilsa Faust, and Henry Czerny returns as former IMF director Eugene Kittridge, a character who hasn’t been seen since the original ‘96 franchise-starter. Vanessa Kirby returns as Alanna Mitsopolis, the black market arms dealer-turned-uneasy ally to Ethan Hunt, as does Frederick Schmidt, playing her brother Zola Mitsopolis.

There are lots of new additions to the franchise as well. Hayley Atwell, best known for playing Peggy Carter in the MCU, joins as Grace, a character McQuarrie described as a “destructive force of nature” with “somewhat ambiguous loyalties” on the franchise-focused Light the Fuse podcast. Ozark’s Esai Morales plays the film’s primary villain, Gabriel (Morales took over for Renfield star Nicholas Hoult, who dropped out due to scheduling issues), while Guardians of the Galaxy’s Pom Klementieff plays an assassin who works for Gabriel.

Shea Whigham, recently seen in HBO’s Perry Mason, plays Jasper Briggs, an enforcer in a mysterious group known as “The Community” who is attempting to track Ethan Hunt down along with his partner, played by Greg Tarzan Davis. Charles Parnell (Top Gun: Maverick), Rob Delaney (Deadpool 2), Indira Varma (Obi-Wan Kenobi), and Mark Gatiss (Sherlock) also star, as does The Princess Bride’s Cary Elwes in an as-yet undisclosed role.
Recent Oscar-winner Angela Bassett, who played CIA director Erika Sloane, was originally supposed to reprise her role but couldn’t due to COVID travel restrictions.
The cast for Part Two hasn’t fully been revealed, though it’s probably safe to assume that most of the major actors from Part One will appear once more, assuming they survive the first movie. We do know, however, that Ted Lasso star Hannah Waddingham will join the ensemble, as will Parks & Rec’s Nick Offerman, who plays Sydney, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
What Is Dead Reckoning About?
(Photo by Christian Black/©Paramount Pictures)
Candidly speaking, the plots of the Mission: Impossible movies aren’t really their main appeal. They tend to be slick, serviceable MacGuffin chases that are an entertaining framework for banter and Tom Cruise’s insane stunts. But we do have some idea of what to expect from Dead Reckoning Part One. Here’s the official synopsis from Paramount:
“In Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, Ethan Hunt and his IMF team embark on their most dangerous mission yet: To track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity before it falls into the wrong hands. With control of the future and the fate of the world at stake, and dark forces from Ethan’s past closing in, a deadly race around the globe begins. Confronted by a mysterious, all-powerful enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than his mission — not even the lives of those he cares about most.”
Tracking down a weapon that threatens humanity before the bad guys get it? Dark forces from Ethan’s past? A deadly race around the globe, and a mysterious enemy? This is, in other words, pretty standard spy movie stuff, but few franchises are capable of pulling it off with as much style as Mission: Impossible. No specifics for the plot for Part Two have been revealed, so as not to spoil Part One, but it’s probably safe to say it won’t deviate too far from the tried and true formula, even as it serves to wrap up loose ends from Part One.
How Long Will It Be?

Part One is on the longer side. Without credits, it boasts a runtime of 2 hours and 36 minutes. The length of Part Two, of course, is TBD.
How Many Trailers Are There?
While there have been no trailers for Part Two yet, naturally, there have been a few for Part One. The first, which was light on dialogue, came out in May of 2022, more than a year before the film’s release. The full trailer came out a year later.
While they’re not quite trailers, Paramount also released a trio of behind-the-scenes featurettes, one of which centers on Cruise’s most dangerous and ambitious stunt yet — driving a motorcycle off a cliff and parachuting to safety. It’s wild, and it certainly inspires a deeper appreciation for the work that went into the stunt, but if you don’t want to spoil the majesty of it all, it’s probably best to check it out after you’ve seen the film.
Is Tom Cruise Doing His Own Stunts?

2023-06-30 21:22:49+00:00,Hayley Atwell’s ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Screen Test Was ‘Two Hours of Stunt Choreography’ So the Team Could ‘See My Natural Abilities’,"Haley Atwell spent two hours in stunt training for her ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" screen test.","Everything is supercharged when it comes to the long-running “Mission: Impossible” franchise, and that extends to the movie’s audition process. In a recent interview with The Telegraph, Hayley Atwell revealed that her screen test for the mysterious role of Grace in the two-part “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning” required a two-hour screen test that was essentially a stunt training course. Some actors screen test with dialogue, but not “Mission: Impossible” actors.
“Who the character has become is a byproduct of the process,” the film’s writer-director Christopher McQuarrie said. “So when we went into the screen test, we’ve not written a character that we’re trying to find someone to fit with. Rather, we’re looking for an actress who we want to work with and we’ll fit the character to her.”’
Atwell’s screen test was with stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood and was made up of “two hours of stunt choreography just to see where my natural abilities lay,” she said.
“We did an unarmed combat sequence and mixed martial arts to see if I was someone who could grapple and trap or someone who was more into high kicks,” Atwell added. “[It’s to] ascertain my natural style.”
Once McQuarrie and Cruise decided Atwell was the perfect actor to bring Grace to life, they went about constructing the character to fit Atwell’s stunt capabilities. She went through an additional five months of stunt training after accepting the role.
“From the physical training we discovered that I was a quick learner through sleight-of-hand tricks and using a prop – so my character is an opportunist who can take an inanimate object and make a weapon out of it, rather than someone who is slick and skilled and formally trained,” Atlwell said about the process. “From that, this inconsistent character emerged: someone who is spontaneous, quite unpredictable, but not calculating.”
Atwell added of her character, “Tom and McQuarrie were interested in finding a different kind of tone for this film than we’d seen before – and a character who had a relationship with Tom that felt more cat and mouse, two people who through circumstances and pressure find themselves in each other’s company but they’re exasperated by each other. So therein will lie the chemistry between them, but also some of the comedic elements in the film.”

6/26/2023 21:20,Still Cruising: Tom premieres new ‘Mission Impossible’ adventure in Abu Dhabi,Tom Cruise has graced the red carpet in Abu Dhabi for the Middle Eastern premiere of “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.”,"ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The red carpet unfurled Monday in Abu Dhabi for Hollywood action megastar Tom Cruise, who was on hand for the Middle Eastern premiere of “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.”
Cruise was met by an enthusiastic crowd of fans and movie buffs eager to catch a glimpse of the star at the Emirates Palace Hotel in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.
Dressed in a tailored tuxedo and flashing his signature smile, Cruise appeared moved by the exuberant reception, stopping to speak with many attendees. The evening’s buzz was punctuated by the “Mission: Impossible” theme, its familiar chords adding a layer of cinematic nostalgia to the night.
“I’m a cinephile, I love movies and the history of cinema and how this art form develops,” Cruise told The Associated Press on the red carpet. “I didn’t know whether the audience was going to embrace (the first Mission: Impossible movie), it was the first film I ever produced and I did it because I wanted to challenge myself in many ways as an actor, as a producer, as a storyteller.”
“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is the seventh installment of the blockbuster $3.5 billion grossing franchise famed for jam-packed action and ever-daring stunts performed by the 60-year-old Cruise himself.
“We’ve had a lot of fun coming up with these moments,” said Cruise.
The Mission: Impossible series follows the globe-trotting adventures of Ethan Hunt, a secret agent of the Impossible Missions Force, or IMF, as he undertakes high-risk covert operations. Picture heart-racing action, sophisticated gadgets, and Cruise’s Hunt executing death-defying stunts at every turn.
Matching the topic of the moment, Hunt and his IMF team are tasked with tracking down a potent new artificial intelligence weapon in “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.” Scenes include base-jumping off a cliff on a motorcycle, hurling a steam train off an exploded bridge, and drifting a yellow Fiat 500 through Rome’s winding streets.
In a nod to the locale, the film incorporates several action sequences in Abu Dhabi. The desert landscapes of Liwa, known as the Empty Quarter, set the stage for intense horseback chases and firearm confrontations. Cruise runs across the dune-shaped roof of Abu Dhabi International Airport’s new Midfield Terminal in another scene.
“When you see us shooting a sequence in Abu Dhabi, it’s about that culture, it’s about that country, and that’s why we keep coming back here,” said Christopher McQuarrie, who is returning for the third time as director of the high-octane spy series.
McQuarrie joined Cruise on the red carpet along with other Mission: Impossible co-stars, both new and returning. Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff made their franchise debut, while Simon Pegg reprised his role as Benji Dunn, a character known for infusing comedic relief into the franchise’s most tense scenes.
“When you have a film which is high-tension you need that to occasionally be injected in order to make it a little bit more enjoyable,” said Pegg.
Following pandemic delays, the production companies behind the franchise, Paramount Pictures and Skydance, pushed the film’s release from September of 2022 to July of 2023. A leaked video from the set featured Cruise launching an expletive-laden rant at colleagues after he reportedly spotted two crew members failing to respect social distancing rules. The star expressed his concern about the potential consequences, which included shutting down production and jeopardizing the then-struggling movie industry and the jobs it supports.
“We just had to write the rulebook on how to make a film during a pandemic,” said Pegg. “Make sure everything was super safe, that was Tom’s biggest challenge in a way was to make us all feel safe and be safe, somehow we muddle through.”
Cruise was praised by many for his role in revitalizing Hollywood following the industry’s pandemic-induced stagnation. This recognition came on the heels of his blockbuster film, “Top Gun: Maverick,” which not only marked Cruise’s first $100 million debut but also signified the return of blockbuster movies to theaters as the most significant movie debut since the onset of the pandemic.
Abu Dhabi marks the third premiere location for “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” with the red carpet previously rolled out at the Spanish Steps in Rome and Leicester Square in London. The movie is set to open in U.S. theaters on July 12.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy10b20tY3J1aXNlLWIyNmFlYWJmMDk1ODJkZTljYmI4MzYxZmNhNGMzNGI00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-15 15:22:48+00:00,Box Office: ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One’ Now Cruising to Projected $78 Million Five-Day Debut,"Tom Cruise's ""Mission: Impossible 7"" is coming in below its $90 million projections, while ticket sales for ""Sound of Freedom"" are up 17%.","Paramount’s “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” is defusing a bit at the domestic box office, readjusting for an estimated $78 million gross over its five-day opening. That’d be a substantial chunk behind projections headed into the weekend, which had the Tom Cruise action sequel hoping for $90 million.
Some in the industry were expecting a “Top Gun: Maverick” halo effect for “Dead Reckoning” after last year’s legacy sequel positively ignited movie theaters, rocketing through the summer to become the fifth-highest grossing domestic release of all-time. That doesn’t seem to be the case though, as “Mission” isn’t exactly transcending the numbers typical for its franchise.
The last entry, 2018’s “Fallout,” launched with a then-franchise record $61 million over three days. “Dead Reckoning” opened on Wednesday, plus previews on Tuesday evening — a bump-up in the calendar that the industry suspects was implemented to take advantage of premium ticket prices for Imax. Universal and director Christopher Nolan take over those auditoriums next weekend with their sweeping historical drama “Oppenheimer.”
Tom Cruise may have fostered a reputation as the global vanguard for movie theaters over the past few years — “I love my popcorn,” he declared in a new video this week — but it’s worth a reminder that his films aren’t the biggest openers on the block. Instead, they tend to draw older audiences, who are less inclined to roll out for a new release in the first few days. “Top Gun: Maverick” is the star’s superlative multiplier, taking its $126 million three-day debut to a $718 million finish, but “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” more than tripled its opening weekend, as did the 2015 entry “Rogue Nation.”
As “Dead Reckoning” falls behind opening estimates, the franchise will need to find those kinds of legs again. This seventh franchise entry is the most expensive yet — with a production budget that ballooned to $290 million, not only due to its high-octane set pieces but also a series of COVID-related production delays and safety measures. (“We are the gold standard!” Cruise shouted at crew members he caught breaking protocols in 2020.) That’s more than $100 million higher than the price tag for “Fallout.”
Strong word-of-mouth should be helpful. The “Mission” series is now a favorite among critics for its daredevil stunts, intricate set pieces and wry humor. Variety chief film critic Peter Debruge filed a rave for “Dead Reckoning,” writing that it “delivers a formidable concept and several hall-of-fame set-pieces while somehow managing to tie the storylines back into these movies’ core mythology.” He’s far from an outlier, as the film stands with a 92% approval rating from top critics on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences are also exhilarated, as indicated by the “A” Cinema Score grade determined by surveying ticket buyers.
“Mission: Impossible” will also look to register strongly overseas, where the franchise has become a strong draw. Both “Fallout” and “Rogue Nation” earned more than 70% of their ticket sales in foreign markets. So far, “Dead Reckoning” has earned $82.1 million across 70 international territories through its first three days of release.
“Dead Reckoning” sees Tom Cruise back as secret agent Ethan Hunt, recruiting his crew of super-spies to take on a very scary and very topical enemy: an all-powerful artificial intelligence called the Entity. Christopher McQuarrie returns to direct after helming the last two entries. Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby and Henry Czerny make series returns, while newcomers Hayley Atwell, Esai Morales, Pom Klementieff, Cary Elwes and Rob Delaney join the fray.
Even with Cruise driving motorcycles off cliffs and chasing criminals around Europe, there is perhaps a more remarkable box office narrative continuing to unfold this weekend. Angel Studios’ “Sound of Freedom” continues to show strength as a bona fide word-of-mouth monster. Major studios are projecting a $23 million haul through the weekend — which would mark a sizable 17% uptick from its gross last weekend.
Wide releases hardly ever see week-to-week rises in ticket sales, but “Sound of Freedom” isn’t a typical wide release. After being shelved by Disney during the shuffle of the 21st Century Fox acquisition, the Jim Caviezel thriller was eventually taken on by Angel Studios. The Utah-based banner has employed a “Pay It Forward” system, encouraging viewers to donate money to the company so that it can purchase and distribute tickets to other prospective audience members looking to see the film at no cost. But a release doesn’t go up in ticket sales just based on an untraditional system — with its glowing “A+” grade on Cinema Score and lots of chatter on social media, “Sound of Freedom” is a phenomenon, particularly among conservative audiences.
The film, which has been scrutinized by anti-trafficking experts, tells the story of real-life ex-fed Tim Ballard, who left the government to take on human trafficking through his own means. Ballard founded the non-profit Operation Underground Railroad, though he has reportedly parted ways with the organization more recently.
Sony’s “Insidious: The Red Door” looks to take third place, projecting a $12.6 million haul through Sunday. That would mark a sizable 62% tumble from its opening last weekend, when the horror sequel debuted on top of domestic charts. The Screen Gems, Stage 6 Films and Blumhouse co-production carries a modest $17 million production budget — a figure that its $54 million domestic gross has already far surpassed.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is facing a 59%-or-so drop in its third weekend. The Harrison Ford finale added $3.3 million on Friday, pushing its domestic total to $136 million. The Disney release will soon surpass “Fast X” ($145 million) to become one of the top 10 domestic releases of the year; it’d be more remarkable if it weren’t for the film’s whopping $300 million production budget.
Disney also looks to round out the top five with the Pixar romance “Elemental.” The animated feature added $2.6 million on Friday, stretching its domestic haul to $119 million. “Elemental” bombed upon release, landing Pixar’s lowest opening in history ($29 million), but it has held remarkably well in the weeks since, continuing to draw family crowds. While it won’t recoup its $200 million production budget in North America, things seemed far bleaker just a few weeks ago.
Opening in limited release, Disney is putting out the ensemble comedy “Theater Camp” out under its Searchlight Pictures banner. The indie release, starring Molly Gordon and Ben Platt, looks to capitalize on strong notices out of the Sundance Film Festival. The film is opening in six theaters in Los Angeles and New York, earning $109,000 on Friday.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLTctcHJvamVjdGVkLW9wZW5pbmctd2Vla2VuZC10b20tY3J1aXNlLTEyMzU2NzA4NDAv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vYm94LW9mZmljZS9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtNy1wcm9qZWN0ZWQtb3BlbmluZy13ZWVrZW5kLXRvbS1jcnVpc2UtMTIzNTY3MDg0MC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Here's when you can expect to see Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One on streaming.,"Where to Stream: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning - Part One
Powered by Reelgood
Tom Cruise is primed to dominate the summer box office for the second year in a row, with Mission Impossible 7—aka Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One—coming to theaters this weekend.
Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who has helmed all of the Mission: Impossible films since 2015’s Rogue Nation, the seventh movie in this franchise once again finds Agent Ethan Hunt on a mission. (An impossible one. Duh.) This time Ethan and his team are facing off an adversary known as “the Entity,” which sounds sufficiently scary. But if anyone can handle it, it’s Tom Cruise. This is the the man who drives his motorcycle off the edge of a cliff and doesn’t bat an eye.
Despite Cruise’s insistence that he’ll see us at the movies, some folks may be wondering if they can wait to watch Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning on streaming. Don’t worry, Decider has all the info you need to help you make an informed decision. Read on to find out when Mission Impossible 7 will be on Paramount Plus.
Will Mission Impossible 7 be on Paramount Plus?
Yes. Mission Impossible 7 will eventually be streaming on Paramount+, after the movie has left theaters and released on DVD and digital platforms, because it is a Paramount Pictures release, and all of the new Paramount movies have been going to Paramount.+
When will Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning be on Paramount Plus?
The short answer? We don’t know. A Mission Impossible 7 Paramount+ release date has not yet been announced, given that the film is only just now opening in theaters. However, we can make an educated guess as to when Mission Impossible 7 will be on Paramount+, based on previous Paramount releases.
Last year’s Top Gun Maverick, another big Paramount release starring Tom Cruise, was released in theaters on May 23 and began streaming on Paramount+ on December 22—about six months after it opened in theaters. If Mission Impossible 7 follows the same release pattern, you can expect Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One to be streaming on Paramount+ in February 2024.
Six months is a long time to wait, so if you want to see Tom Cruise hang off of things right now, you can go see Mission Impossible 7 in theaters.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZGVjaWRlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8xMy9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtNy1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1wYXJhbW91bnQtcGx1cy1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWNpZGVyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3LzEzL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS03LWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLXBhcmFtb3VudC1wbHVzLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,"Rebecca Ferguson says new ""Mission: Impossible"" film ""goes beyond"" in terms of action, emotion","""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" hits theaters this Wednesday, July 12.","Rebecca Ferguson says new ""Mission: Impossible"" film ""goes beyond"" in terms of emotion, action
The new ""Mission: Impossible"" movie brings audiences even more action and emotion than previous films in the franchise, said Rebecca Ferguson, who plays former British MI6 agent Ilsa Faust in the film.
Ferguson said Monday on ""CBS Mornings"" that while she expects ""Mission"" films to be incredible, intense and action-packed, the latest installment in the series — ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" — ""goes beyond"" action-wise and emotionally.
The film is set to hit theaters this Wednesday, July 12. It is a production of Paramount Pictures, a division of CBS News' parent company. Its highly-anticipated release follows a four-year gap since the release of the previous installment, ""Mission: Impossible – Fallout.""
Ferguson said that working with Tom Cruise — who produces and stars in the film as Ethan Hunt — has had an impact on her professionally, even outside the franchise.
""Tom brings the best every single day and he expects the best, and not in a hard whipping kind of way,"" Ferguson said. ""Just in a, 'you have been given a platter of training, of knowledge, so give it when it's given,' and I know that I expect the same on a show that I produce. I want the best.""
In the ""Mission"" films, her character and Cruise's character maintain a ""will they or won't they"" tension that captivates audiences and leaves room for interpretation. Ferguson said she finds what keeps the characters apart ""attractive and interesting.""
""Tom and I ... never talk about them as an item. But I guess when we watch the film, they're so similar. They fight the same cause and yet, you have yourself constantly saying, 'But why? Why are we doing this? We could run away,'"" she said, ""There's so much connection between them. But is it sibling? Family? love? What is it? It's humanity.""
For Ferguson, the film's release this week is daunting, but also exciting, she said.
""Also, it's that treat of giving the audience something that I know that I loved before I was in it,"" she said. ""I waited for 'Mission: Impossible.' I loved them.""
""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One"" hits U.S. theaters on Wednesday, July 12. Deadline calls it ""Hollywood action filmmaking at its peak"" and The Hollywood Reporter praises director Christopher McQuarrie's ability to keep ""his audience glued to every moment.""

,Mission: Impossible's Pom Klementieff talks Tom Cruise fight scene,'Guardians' star Pom Klementieff wanted Tom Cruise to kick her in the stomach for a 'Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One' fight scene. 'But he wouldn't do it.',"Tom Cruise got strapped to the outside of a plane for 2015's Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and rode a motorbike off a cliff for the latest sequel, Dead Reckoning Part One. But there is at least one thing the Top Gun star won't do in pursuit of on-screen verisimilitude while making the action franchise — kick Pom Klementieff in the stomach.
In the latest Mission: Impossible film, the Guardians of the Galaxy actress plays a highly dangerous character named Paris who is partnered with the movie's main antagonist, Gabriel, played by Esai Morales. During a sequence set in Venice, Paris has a fight with Cruise's super-spy Ethan Hunt and it was while shooting the encounter that Klementieff asked her co-star to give her a kick in the guts for real.
""I kept telling him to just kick me here,"" the actress recalls to EW, indicating her midsection. ""I was squeezing abs. [I said], 'You can just go for it.' He was like 'No, no, no, no, no.' I was like, 'But it's going to help me!' But he wouldn't do it.""
Pom Klementieff in 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One'. Christian Black/Paramount Pictures and Skydance
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One director Christopher McQuarrie cast Klementieff after seeing her playing Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 and describes her character as ""very, very, very much a chaotic element in the story. It doesn't matter how deep in the background she is, you're going to be watching her at all times and wondering what she's going to do."" The actress herself says that Paris is someone who ""destroys everything in her path. She's a rebel, she's a killer, she's extremely skilled and quite lonely too.""
Much of the destruction caused by the character takes place in Rome during a sequence in which a Humvee-driving Paris pursues Cruise's Ethan Hunt and Hayley Atwell's character, who are in a small yellow Fiat. ""I had so much fun shooting this scene,"" says the French actress. ""It was so special to be on location in Rome. We were shooting during COVID, so we were very lucky to be here. I was trying to not laugh too much because I was having so much fun in the car following the Fiat.""
Klementieff reveals that her character's name is a nod to the Great Paris, the magician-spy played by Star Trek actor Leonard Nimoy on the original Mission: Impossible TV show. ""When Christopher McQuarrie cast me for the role, he didn't know which name the character would have,"" she says. ""It was cool to name me Paris, me being from France, and then they decided that I would speak French because I speak French in real life.""

It is unlikely that Nimoy ever wore anything as eye-catching on the TV show as the looks sported by Klementieff in the movie.
""She's very different style-wise from every other actress in the Mission: Impossible franchise,"" Klementieff says. ""She has a side that's a bit more punk and she doesn't really give a f---. So that was cool.""
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One will release in theaters July 12.

Simon Pegg said Cruise is far more generous and fun than that rumor suggests, and that he even “took us go-karting and zip-lining” during off hours on “Dead Reckoning Part One.”
“I’ve been able to hack my way through all the bizarre mythology that surrounds him,” added Pegg, who has starred in every “Mission: Impossible” movie opposite Cruise since 2006’s “Mission: Impossible III.” “On one side he’s Tom Cruise — this enigmatic film star everyone wants to know about. And on the other he’s just a guy. I like being normal with him.”
Pegg previously said on BBC’s “Desert Island Discs” radio show that he does not ask Cruise about anything related to his “personal beliefs” when they are together because “that would be me abusing my privileged access that I get to him.” That means Scientology questions are off the table. So what does Pegg talk to Cruise about on set? Cruise’s fame.
“We joke about it,” Pegg said. “I mean, I always make fun of him for it, you know, about the things that he can access. We were filming in South Africa recently on this mountain and then he decided he wanted to swim with sharks. He flew us in a helicopter to this seaside part and we dived with sharks. At the end of the day we said, ‘That was a real Tom Cruise kind of day.’ He kind of appreciates the ridiculousness of it sometimes.”
Pegg added, “My relationship with him is just very simple and amiable. It’s always been a very easy relationship. I think you realize, when you meet the person rather than the thicket of mythology that’s built up around them, it’s a different experience. I mean, he loves [the fame] and he really relishes it, it’s all he knows. It energizes him and spurs him on. I don’t think I would appreciate that particularly. I’d find it very stressful and overwhelming and it would make me want to retreat. I’m happy where I am.”

Currently, the Mission series has grossed over $3.5 billion worldwide.
It’s hard to overstate the impact that Cruise’s Mission: Impossible franchise has had on action cinema over the decades, and how it has itself grown exponentially over the same period. “Mission had done a train sequence before, all the way back in the first film and a lot of that had been done on a stage. We wanted to do one that was practical. We wanted to build upon what was learned on that sequence and apply all of that knowledge to something practical and real,” McQuarrie says, speaking about one of the film’s many jaw-dropping action sequences, in which he and Cruise drive a real steam train off a blown-up bridge (more on that later). Over six installments and 27 years of the Mission: Impossible franchise, the character of Ethan Hunt has earned his place as one of Cruise’s most indelible creations. And, in Dead Reckoning Parts One and Two, the elite agent will be tested more than ever.
The filmmakers are not only delighted with what their approach has yielded thus far, but also thrilled with what they have yet to reveal. “In the next one, you will feel the world constantly expanding and you’ll go to places the franchise has never been. You’ll see parts of the world that you’ve never seen this way. And, frankly, some of them won’t exist for much longer,” McQuarrie says. “We have really, truly, taken this story to the edge of the world.”

If neither Cruise nor McQuarrie is yet prepared to reveal what ground-breaking stunt Cruise is preparing to pull off for audiences in the next movie, McQuarrie will at least confirm this: “The bike jump [in Dead Reckoning Part One] was far and away the most dangerous thing we had ever attempted. The only thing that scared me more than that stunt was what we had planned for Part Two.”

For now, though, what both men want is for audiences around the world to get ready to immerse themselves in a jaw-dropping story that they say makes this Mission: Impossible the most exhilarating, ambitious, and emotional installment so far. “I always knew there were things we could do better,” Cruise says of his near-three decade Mission journey. “There are always mountains to climb. But I really do believe that this movie is Mission in its highest gear. No one can be tougher on me than me. I have always set the bar high for myself and always expect a lot from myself. I never want to rest on any laurels in seeing how I can serve the audience.”
Cruise smiles, excited by what that audience is about to see, and by what he knows is coming next. “If I could be on a movie set every single day of my life, I would,” he says. “I am always pushing myself. I can’t help it, it’s in my nature.”

Film fans are eager to see Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two as the upcoming film will see the return of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt and will serve as a direct sequel to the highly-acclaimed Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. Here’s when Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two could be coming out on Paramount Plus.
When is the predicted Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two Paramount Plus streaming release date?
At the time of writing, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two has a theatrical release date of June 28, 2024. As such since the film is not yet out in theaters, there is no official streaming release date. However, fans can expect the film to drop on Paramount Plus sometime in September 2024.
The expected September 2024 Paramount Plus streaming release date for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two is due to Paramount Pictures’ pattern of releasing its theatrical films on its streaming platform 30 to 45 days after its theatrical run. However, if the theatrical release is delayed because of the ongoing writers’ and actors’ strikes then Mission: Impossible fans should also expect a delay in the streaming release.
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two will serve as a direct sequel to Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One and see Ethan Hunt presumably continue dealing with the AI being known as the Entity.
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two stars Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, Henry Czerny, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Vanessa Kirby, and Esai Morales, among many other cast members.
Is Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two coming out on Paramount Plus?
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two will be available to watch via streaming on Paramount Plus.
The reason that Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two will drop on Paramount Plus is because the film’s distribution rights are owned by Paramount Pictures.
Current Paramount Plus subscribers will be able to watch Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two when it drops on the streaming platform. A Paramount Plus Essential subscription costs $5.99 a month while a Paramount Plus subscription with SHOWTIME costs $11.99 a month.
The official synopsis for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two reads:
“The eighth installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise.”

2023-08-01 16:47:53.779561+00:00,Tom Cruise didn't want Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning to end on a cliffhanger,"Tom Cruise didn't want the end of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One to be a cliffhanger, according to direc…","Relieved that this summer’s Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One didn’t end with a dramatic cliffhanger that left you feeling unsatisfied and somewhat frustrated at the lack of closure after more than two hours in the theater? Turns out, you have Tom Cruise to thank for that.
Talking to Empire, director Christoper McQuarrie said, “Tom was fixated day and night on the ending of the movie. He had great anxiety about the end of the film – that the end of a ‘Part One’ was going to be a cliffhanger, and that cliffhangers by their very nature tend to be deeply, deeply unsatisfying. You feel like the camera just stopped and you're not there. You're not given that release. ‘I have to wait a year? I have to wait two years, for whatever that release is?’”
McQuarrie continued, “He said, ‘We gotta give them that sense of completion, and yet the story has to feel like it needs a place to go.’”
Unintentionally, that statement feels like a slam against Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse which had a cliffhanger ending which was seen by some as the primary problem of the movie — and arguably one of the only problems with it, in many people’s eyes.
It’s interesting to see how different filmmakers approach the subject of how to create a movie that just… fails to end; it’s something audiences have seen a lot of this year alone, with Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and Fast X all offering half of a story despite runtimes over two hours. (Fast X, like Across the Spider-Verse, notably ends in a dramatic cliffhanger that sets up not one, but two, follow-ups.)
Movie audiences are certainly no strangers to the idea that movies will be continued and stories will flow into sequels and spin-offs — the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe demonstrates that, if nothing else — but if more and more movies are going to start pulling one story into two or more movies, the question of how to do that and still give audiences a fulfilling experience in each individual serving is going to start being more and more of a topic of discussion. Will Cruise’s view hold more weight if this trend continues… Stay tuned.
Wait, is that a cliffhanger?

In ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning,"" Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) returns out of the shadows to take on another world-saving task — but this time, he's fighting a digital threat along with a physical one.
A rogue A.I. that can seemingly predict anybody's future is to blame here, but writer and director Christopher McQuarrie has also thrown in plenty of physical problems for Hunt to take on.
While Esai Morales' Gabriel is the big bad that the IMF has to stop, his henchwoman Paris, played by Pom Klementieff, is ""completely insane.""
The ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" star told Insider that creating Paris was a collaboration between herself, Cruise, and McQuarrie after she joined the film.

Klementieff recalled: ""So, I wanted to bring something completely insane that was really scary for Ethan. So it was just ongoing conversations with Christopher McQuarrie and Tom on how to create the character.""

She also noted that she gave input on Paris' costumes because she wanted to do her own stunts in ""Dead Reckoning Part One.""
""We were thinking about how the character moves, how the clothes move, and then I wanted to do some kicks too because I've been training for years,"" Klementieff said. ""And high kicks, what to wear with that? So a skirt to not be limited in the movements. It took time to create the character and make something like this little monster.""
That collaborative spirit was spread across the film. Klementieff's fellow Marvel alumni, Hayley Atwell, later told Insider that she didn't even have a character when she signed on for the sequel. She explained that McQuarrie and Cruise were just looking for the ""right person"" to join the cast.

""McQ and Tom, during the screen test, said we don't have a character that we're looking for someone to fit into. We find the person that we want to work with,"" Atwell said. ""And then the three of us in real time create that character as we go along and then also seeing what the camera ends up wanting.""

The ""Doctor Strange"" star went on to say that there was plenty of improvisation on set, but her charismatic thief wasn't given a name for quite a while.
""So we're always kind of throwing out ideas, and then certain bits would be improvised,"" she said. ""I remember when McQ finally christened me and went, 'She's called Grace.'""
""I was like, 'Oh!' and he said, 'It was partly because it was ironic because of who she is,'"" Atwell continued. ""But he was like, 'It's because you've graciously taken anything we've thrown at you, and you've delivered or are willing to kind of be part of this process.'""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXIuY29tL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1wb20ta2xlbWVudGllZmYtaGF5bGV5LWF0d2VsbC1oZWxwZWQtY3JlYXRlLXJvbGVzLTIwMjMtNtIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXIuY29tL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1wb20ta2xlbWVudGllZmYtaGF5bGV5LWF0d2VsbC1oZWxwZWQtY3JlYXRlLXJvbGVzLTIwMjMtNj9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
7/25/2023 19:00,"Tom Cruise, our messy messiah of movies","Op-ed about Tom Cruise as savior of movies, enemy to AI","Over the span of his 40-year career, Tom Cruise has been many things: Hollywood heartthrob, celebrated Short King (he's 5-foot-7), Scientology spokesperson, reticent actor and now . . . the savior of cinema. Earlier this year, Steven Spielberg made the decree at the annual Oscars luncheon, telling the actor he ""saved the entire theatrical industry,"" as ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" Cruise's highest grossing movie ever ($1.49 billion globally), achieved the rare and coveted task of bringing moviegoers back to the theaters. The claim has regained traction now that the star has joined negotiations with SAG-AFTRA in order to protect actors from being replaced by artificial intelligence — nevermind the fact that he has declined to join the picket line for the unions' ongoing strike.
He's famously known for performing his own stunts no matter how terrifying, just one of the many reasons people refer to him as the last remaining movie star.
It's no mere coincidence then that the villain in Cruise's latest movie, ""Mission Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,"" is, of all things, AI. In the seventh installment, notoriously rogue spy Ethan Hunt is tasked with finding the key that controls the sentient AI called ""The Entity"" that can manipulate digital reality. Good guy that he is, Ethan doesn't stop at obtaining the key, he sets out to destroy The Entity for the sake of mankind.
Like his character, Cruise is fighting to preserve reality by tackling AI, merging his persona with his performance and reinforcing himself as the movie messiah. Since the pandemic, the public has been awoken to his staunch defense of The Movies. In a leaked clip captured while filming ""Dead Reckoning"" during the pandemic, he was heard yelling at crew members who were not following COVID-19 precautions. While he was audibly angry and intense, the clip was widely interpreted as Cruise being dedicated to the craft that is moviemaking. To top it off, he's famously known for performing his own stunts no matter how terrifying, just one of the many reasons people refer to him as the last remaining movie star.
In an era where Hollywood is ruled by IP and franchises in place of actors, Cruise feels like the last of his kind. What allowed his stardom to endure and evolve in ways Brad Pitt's, Sandra Bullock's and so many others' did not?
Unlike other celebrities, the persona of Hollywood's last star has always loomed larger than life. It's not always a tidy reputation, but it is always intriguing and full-on — even his fall from publicity grace. The early aughts through to 2012 were dark times for the actor's public image. In 2004, he opened up about joining the Church of Scientology, an organization suspiciously structured like a pyramid scheme, purported to be a religion, founded by the science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard. The cult-like group comes with many controversies, including allegedly profiting from human trafficking and forced labor and practicing abusive behavior. The optics for Cruise at the time weren't great, but they were still surrounded by buzz and an intense need to know more about the actor.
The more investigations and self-reports from the actor about his ties to Scientology, the more complex and unhinged he appeared to be. There was the time he criticized Brooke Shields for taking antidepressants because psychiatry is not within the church's belief. Or, that time when a former Scientologist alleged that he had not seen his daughter Suri Cruise for 10 years because she is not a Scientologist. At one point, he also used the church to find new love interests, as Scientologists reportedly recruited actress Nazanin Boniadi, giving her a makeover to Cruise's preferences, to become the actor's girlfriend. He dated her for a while before letting the church break up with her for him. When she told a friend what happened, she was punished by the church with months of menial labor.

Even when he's not speaking about Scientology, everything about Cruise is sensational. His infamous 2005 couch-jumping Oprah Winfrey interview (which he's since enthusiastically reenacted) is case in point. Looking back, the interview feels like an ""I Think You Should Leave"" skit with Cruise, the Tim Robinson stand-in, taking emotions to the unsettling extreme until they cross social norms. He randomly and repeatedly jumps up onto the couch, grabs Oprah by both shoulders and shakes her, drops to his knees and then, when Katie Holmes is invited onto the stage, finds the actress, restrains both of her arms and almost drags her to the stage; all because he's just so passionate about his love for her. Perhaps what's even more perplexing than the actor's behavior is how the live audience uproariously cheers him on.
Such is the power of Tom Cruise.
After watching the interview, it's easy to see how Cruise was the character inspiration for the onscreen take on sociopathic killer Patrick Bateman in ""American Psycho,"" which Christian Bale came to realize after watching a 1999 appearance of Cruise on ""Late Show with David Letterman."" During his appearance, the actor recounted a story about co-piloting a private plane and turning off a passenger's oxygen supply. When Letterman asks him if that's attempted manslaughter, he laughs so hard he can't string a full sentence together to finish the story. Creepy as this interview is, it adds yet another conundrum to the puzzle that is Tom Cruise. Attempting to solve that puzzle keeps us coming back. His eerie antics keep us glued to the screen, like witnessing something horrific you just can't look away from.
It's almost as if Tom Cruise The Person and Tom Cruise The Character are one and the same.
Eventually, the star learned to shut up about Scientology, entering a newly reticent era and becoming known for turning down in-depth interviews. Who he is now and what he gets up to has become so mysterious that the New York Times recently went on their own impossible mission to find him in the wild. His increasingly private life and determination to keep making movies has essentially repaired his hurt reputation. As Rolling Stone points out, Cruise ""effectively replaced Scientology with a different public-facing religion: The Movies.""
Shielding his private life only added fuel to the fire that his mysterious, larger-than-life persona created. Now, when people hear any details they can about the star, they revere it and pick it over. He has a signature white chocolate coconut cake bundt cake and he sends it to celebrities every year? He taught Zac Efron to ride a motorcycle? He rescued a family from a burning sailboat? Wow, he's so fearless and heroic, like a real-life Ethan Hunt and all the other action heroes he's fully leaned into playing and that don't at all try to distract from his Scientology scandals . . .
It's almost as if Tom Cruise The Person and Tom Cruise The Character are one and the same. The conflation has bolstered the star's allure and ability to bring people to theaters, as his deep lore and real heroics draw people to see him, and specifically him, in films — and we eat it up. Journalist Justine Smith puts it best, ""People didn't come back to the cinema to watch a new 'Top Gun' movie, a sequel 30 years in the making — they came to the cinema to watch Tom Cruise.""
Whether or not you believe this one white man, who stood with SAG-AFTRA most when it benefits his own movies, can fix a systemic issue of exploitation and capitalism is irrelevant, because Cruise will act like he did. That's the whole point of the latest ""Mission Impossible."" And we watched it, we enjoyed it if its Rotten Tomatoes score (96% for critics and 94% for the audience) is any indication, and we will continue to watch when Cruise puts on another performance. While he is many things, no one can accuse him of not committing to the bit.
Cruise's allure can be best captured by his acceptance speech video for ""Top Gun"" at the MTV Movie & TV Awards. He didn't just accept his speech, he got into a helicopter and thanked the audience for going to the movies. Right before he jumps out of the helicopter to finish his speech mid-fall, he shouts, ""I love entertaining you!"" From Scientology to Movie Savior, Cruise does exactly that. He is a star because he never stops entertaining, and we love him all the more for it.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3LzI1L3RvbS1jcnVpc2UtbW92aWUtaGVyby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

,"Vanessa Kirby on bringing ""The White Widow"" to life in ""Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One""",The film hits theaters today.,"Vanessa Kirby on the higher stakes for the ""White Widow"" in new ""Mission: Impossible"" movie
When actor Vanessa Kirby reprised her role as Alanna Mitsopolis, widely recognized as the White Widow in ""Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,"" she focused her portrayal of the White Widow to be a powerful and dangerous international arms dealer, adding an electrifying dynamic to the film.
""I wanted to just try and capture the essence of what she had done,"" Kirby said.
Her character is known to have a quiet, yet menacing look and aura surrounding her which Kirby said was a challenge to learn.
""I would never have thought about myself to be somebody that sort of so in charge of this really dark, you know, hugely powerful organization, but to do it with lightness and play,"" she said.
She performs stunts throughout the movie with Tom Cruise, who plays protagonist Ethan Hunt, and also performs his own stunts in the ""Mission: Impossible"" series.
The film hits theaters today. It is a production of Paramount Pictures, a division of CBS News' parent company. Its highly-anticipated release follows a four-year gap since the release of the previous installment, ""Mission: Impossible – Fallout.""
To express gratitude to the audiences and embracing their enthusiasm for the franchise, Cruise and other members of the cast recently visited movie theaters across multiple cities. Kirby said this speaks to their bond, which got stronger as the cast and crew filmed together during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""We were a little family in our bubble for it now to be out there in the world is really thrilling. I think everybody is so fantastic and and I'm very proud to be a part of it,"" Kirby said.

,"""Mission: Impossible"" co-star Simon Pegg talks watching Tom Cruise's stunt: ""We were all a bit hysterical""","Cruise's character rode a motorcycle off a cliff, then jumped off the bike — in front of his stunned castmates.","For actor Simon Pegg, the first day on the set of ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" involved watching a friend and co-star attempting one of the biggest stunts in movie history.
The co-star was of course Tom Cruise, whose stuntwork in movies like ""Top Gun: Maverick"" and the ""Mission: Impossible"" series has audiences clamoring to see what he's capable of. In the newest ""Mission: Impossible"" movie, Cruise's character Ethan Hunt rides a motorcycle off a cliff, then jumps off the bike and performs a terrifying BASE jump to land safely.
Despite the high-stakes stunt, Pegg said the day was ""the opposite of chaos.""
""Tom is very, very diligent when it comes to preparing for these things. He's not crazy. Everyone says, oh, he must be crazy. He does, you know, but he trains hard. Everything is in place. It's a well-oiled machine,"" Pegg explained.
Despite knowing the actor was prepared, Pegg said it was ""scary"" to see the stunt happen. He even filmed the moment on his phone.
""We were up there just to see it. ... We were all a bit hysterical because, I mean, we trust him and we trust the system. We trust everything involved,"" Pegg explained. ""But still, it's nerve-wracking, and he would disappear, and then we'd wait and there'd be a big sort of pause. And then you'd hear good canopy, which meant his chute had opened at least. But he still had to get down to the boom. So it was exhilarating, to say the least.""

While that stunt may have made ""Mission: Impossible"" history, Pegg has been in the franchise since its third chapter as Benji Dunn. His character started as a lab technician, but grew to become a field agent and a close friend of Cruise's character. In all, Pegg has spent about 15 years in the role.
""It's a real treat as an actor to be able to evolve a character like that and play him over a series of different films and build on whatever's gone before. As an actor, that's a privilege to be able to do that,"" Pegg said.
While the character has only become more familiar to Pegg, filming the newest ""Mission: Impossible"" chapter meant working in a totally new environment: The cast started working on the movie during the coronavirus pandemic, and had to navigate quarantines and on-set protocols to make the film.
""Tom just was determined that it wasn't going to beat him. I think he saw COVID and the pandemic as a sort of existential threat to movies, to the theatrical experience. It was stopping us all from being together, watching films, and for Tom, that's so important, you know? That's his life. And I think he was like 'This isn't going to beat us. We're going to figure it out,'"" Pegg said. ""And that's what we did. He kind of wrote the rules on how to make a film in that situation as we went along and yes, it took longer. It took a little longer than usual, but we got through it. And I think that is reflected in the movie itself. We were on our own little mission impossible whilst we were making 'Mission: Impossible.'""
Now, another existential threat is facing the movie industry: On Thursday, SAG-AFTRA, the acting labor union, called a strike, meaning most actors cannot work on films and grinding Hollywood to a halt. This compounds a strike by Hollywood writers. As part of the strike, actors can no longer promote their work, but his interview was filmed before the actors' strike began.

""Things need to be fair,"" Pegg said. ""The infrastructure needs to be adapted to accommodate the new, the new ways we watch film and TV streaming, and the tech companies need to understand that for things to continue, everyone needs to be treated fairly. ... We need to just talk sensibly and get it all sorted out.""
Pegg, who is also a screenwriter, said that the strike is necessary, especially as movie studios push to use artificial intelligence in the filmmaking process.
""The only thing A.I. can do is create mediocrity, because all it can do is aggregate what's out there,"" Pegg said. ""So, yes, it can write a script, but it'll be rubbish. Do you know what I mean? A.I. has had no childhood trauma. A.I.'s never had a boyfriend or girlfriend, never had its heart broken, it's never been through anything that would give it the impetus to create art. ... To rely on it would be to just make everything mediocre, and we have to fight mediocrity in order to create great art.""

After 27 years and counting, Paramount’s Mission: Impossible action franchise has far surpassed CBS’s original 1966-73 television show in public fame.
The stunts rank among the most iconic in modern movie history: Tom Cruise’s protagonist Ethan Hunt dangling by wires in the first film, scaling the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in the fourth, hanging onto the side of an airplane several thousand feet in the air for the fifth, skydiving in a “HALO jump” [high-altitude low-open parachute] in the sixth.
Before Wednesday’s release of seventh installment Dead Reckoning – Part One, here’s a recap of the financials for the six prior films.
Mission: Impossible (1996)
Release Date: Wednesday, May 22, 1996
Domestic Opening Weekend: $45.4M
Domestic Total / Market Share: $180.9M (39%)

Global Total: $457.6M
Domestic Franchise Rank: #5
Global Franchise Rank: #5
Domestic 1996 Rank: #3
Global 1996 Rank: #3
Based on the hit television series, this opening installment directed by Brian DePalma set the template with many now-iconic components of the franchise: the pull-off facial disguises, the catchphrase “This tape will self-destruct in five seconds,” Ving Rhames as tech genius assistant Luther.
At the box office, the film came in third place for the year in both the domestic and global rankings, in both cases behind Independence Day and Twister.
Mission: Impossible II (2000)
Release Date: Wednesday, May 24, 2000
Domestic Opening Weekend: $57.8M
Domestic Total / Market Share: $215.4M (39%)
Overseas Total / Market Share: $334.1M (61%)
Global Total: $549.5M
Domestic Franchise Rank: #2
Global Franchise Rank: #4
Domestic 2000 Rank: #3
Global 2000 Rank: #1
Before the likes of Top Gun: Maverick and Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, this marked the first sequel of Cruise’s career. Clearly he made the right decision, as the follow-up ranked as the top film globally of the entire year, the only Mission installment to achieve the feat. Domestically it ranked third, behind How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Cast Away.
Costarring Anthony Hopkins as the mission commander, John Woo (Face/Off) directed the project. Cruise even insisted that the production use a real knife during a climactic fight scene, rather than a prop.
Mission: Impossible III (2006)
Release Date: Friday, May 5, 2006
Domestic Opening Weekend: $47.7M
Domestic Total / Market Share: $133.5M (33%)
Overseas Total / Market Share: $265.8M (67%)

J.J. Abrams made his feature film directorial debut, previously serving as executive producer for ABC’s television shows Alias and Lost, though he would go on to helm two Star Wars and two Star Trek movies. This third Mission installment also costarred Philip Seymour Hoffman as the franchise’s most memorable villain, Laurence Fishburne as the agency director and Simon Pegg as tech expert Benji Tunn, who would appear in every subsequent installment.
Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol (2011)
Release Date: Friday, December 16, 2011
Domestic Opening Weekend: $12.7M in limited release, $29.5M wide
Domestic Total / Market Share: $209.3M (30%)

Global Total: $694.7M
Domestic Franchise Rank: #3
Global Franchise Rank: #2
Domestic 2011 Rank: #7
Global 2011 Rank: #5
The series returned with a December release date, marking the only installment to shun a summer debut. It also marked the only installment not to debut wide, starting in a limited 465 theaters before expanding wide on its sophomore frame.
As a result, it’s the only franchise installment not to debut atop the weekend box office. In fact, it debuted in third, behind both Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows and Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked. Yet with strong legs, it finished above both Shadows and Chipwrecked in the end.
Brad Bird made his live-action directorial debut, after previously directing Pixar’s animated The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Jeremy Renner costarred as an intelligence agent.
Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation (2015)
Release Date: Friday, July 31, 2015
Domestic Opening Weekend: $55.5M
Domestic Total / Market Share: $195.0M (28%)
Overseas Total / Market Share: $493.8M (72%)
Global Total: $688.8M
Domestic Franchise Rank: #4
Global Franchise Rank: #3
Domestic 2015 Rank: #11
Global 2015 Rank: #8
Returning to a summer release date once again, this installment starts with Ethan Hunt and his team disbanded as a government espionage agency. Christopher McQuarrie directed, after previously directing Cruise in 2012’s Jack Reacher, and has stayed with the Mission franchise ever since. Alec Baldwin also costarred as the director of the CIA.
Mission: Impossible — Fallout (2018)
Release Date: Friday, July 27, 2018
Domestic Opening Weekend: $61.2M
Domestic Total / Market Share: $220.1M (28%)

Domestic Franchise Rank: #1
Global Franchise Rank: #1
Domestic 2018 Rank: #8
Global 2018 Rank: also #8
Often cited as the best installment to date, the financials certainly reflected that view, ranking as the top film to date both domestically and globally. Costarring Henry Cavill, Vanessa Kirby, and Angela Bassett, this installment finished the year in eighth place both domestically and globally.
Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)
With a trailer playing in cinemas for a full year and two and months, ever since May 2022’s Maverick, hype has been building around this seventh installment for a long time.
Boxoffice PRO‘s most recent forecast projects it will earn the franchise’s highest opening weekend to date. Whether it earns the franchise’s highest final total depends on word of mouth, but early reviews are positive, suggesting the odds are good.

2023-08-01 20:15:49+00:00,Watch Tom Cruise Roll a Fiat 500 in ‘Mission: Impossible’,The director Christopher McQuarrie discusses a chase scene involving the star and Hayley Atwell in ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One’,"“I am Christopher McQuarrie, the director and one of the writers and producers of ‘Mission — Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One.’” [MUSIC PLAYING] “What are we doing?” “Finding us a new car.” “The inspiration for this sequence actually occurred to me during the shooting of ‘Mission — Impossible Fallout’ when I was scouting locations for the chase scene in Paris. And I came across a little Fiat 500 that was parked along the Seine River. And I thought it would be great, the idea of watching Ethan Hunt and Tom Cruise driving in a car like that. When I pitched this idea to Tom, he immediately appreciated the notion of doing a car chase that involved more humor than any of the sequences we had done previously, and he really leaned into that. Something to watch during this sequence is the behavior between Tom Cruise and Haley Atwell. You’re looking at two actors performing in two-shots, meaning you don’t have any editorial control. It’s not like I can pick the best moments of each actor. I have to really be giving you their best at the exact same time. And what it really does is it creates an affinity for these two characters. The most important part about this sequence is not really the action. It’s the feeling of a relationship developing between two people who actually don’t want to be together. And this car chase is all about creating circumstances whereby they are forced together, and over the course of a sequence, you feel them turning into a team. Rome is a very tricky place to shoot. The Fiat is a very difficult car to drive. And obviously, it’s very difficult to drive that car with handcuffs, let alone on cobblestone streets which make all of the driving, everything that you see Tom doing, becomes completely unpredictable. And what you end up with is a sequence where the car almost has a mind of its own. It becomes a character in the sequence along with Haley’s hair, as you can see there. In this part of the sequence, we ended up on the Spanish Steps. We were allowed to shoot at the Spanish Steps with the understanding that we never could actually physically touch the Spanish Steps. But so long as we never touched the Spanish Steps, we could do whatever we want. So what we did is we built the Spanish Steps in three sections on a backlot so that we could drive cars down them. And everything that Tom and Haley are doing here is extremely difficult, extremely punishing. The car doesn’t have really great suspension. So the riding down the steps is very jarring. And we got into this bit here with the cars rolling over we did in three sections. One, Tom drove down the steps. Then we had a bunch of grips roll a car down the steps with no one in it. And then, finally, we built a padded interior for the two actors to actually roll down the steps with the cameras rolling.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMDEvbW92aWVzL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1wYXJ0LW9uZS1jbGlwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

""It was a masterclass in not only work ethic and his incredible manners, he's so gracious and so polite to everyone, and hardworking, but then also his understanding of every technical aspect of filmmaking,"" Atwell told ""CBS Mornings.""
Atwell plays Grace, a pickpocket and thief who accidentally finds herself in the middle of a high-stakes mission. She performs breathtaking stunts with Cruise, who plays protagonist Ethan Hunt and also performs his own stunts in the ""Mission: Impossible"" series.
She described Cruise as ""very attentive"" and said he ""can kind of read people,"" recalling a moment where they were filming a train scene and she was ""slumped in a corner"" looking tired.
""He's like, 'How you doing? ... I think you have adrenal fatigue,'"" Atwell said. ""And he presented me with this beautiful box of chocolate, like out of nowhere, and said ... 'You need some chocolate. That's going to wake you up.'""
She said it made a difference.
""Chocolate's gonna make a difference in my life in any context,"" she said, laughing.
The film hits theaters this Wednesday, July 12. It is a production of Paramount Pictures, a division of CBS News' parent company. Its highly-anticipated release follows a four-year gap since the release of the previous installment, ""Mission: Impossible – Fallout.""
To prepare for the role, Atwell trained for months to learn skills including martial arts and drifting, a driving maneuver that allows a car to glide through turns.
Atwell said she is proud of the film and that it was made with the audience in mind.
""We're so proud of it. But even the whole filmmaking process, every single frame and scene was designed, executed, edited with the audience in mind,"" Atwell said. ""And you know, when I said to Tom, you know, 'What is the running time of this going to be?' and he said, 'It's going to be as long as it is entertaining.' And it's true, it goes by so fast.""

,"Tom Cruise Refused to End ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’ on a Cliffhanger, Told the Director: ‘It’s Got to Be Satisfying’","SPOILER ALERT: This story discusses the ending of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” currently playing in theaters. “Dead Reckoning,” the seventh installment of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, is the latest Hollywood blockbuster to be split into two movies, but Tom Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie tried their hardest to give “Part One” a non-cliffhanger […]","SPOILER ALERT: This story discusses the ending of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” currently playing in theaters.
“Dead Reckoning,” the seventh installment of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, is the latest Hollywood blockbuster to be split into two movies, but Tom Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie tried their hardest to give “Part One” a non-cliffhanger conclusion. The filmmaker recently told Total Film magazine that thinking about how to conclude the first of two movies kept Cruise up at night during the filming of “Part One.”
More from Variety
“Where we ended the movie was always where we were going to end it,” McQuarrie said of the train action sequence. “How we ended the movie was a big, big mystery for us. It kept Tom awake at night throughout production. He would come in all the time and say, ‘This can’t be a cliffhanger, it’s got to be satisfying.’ The audience has to feel a sense of completion.”
McQuarrie continued, “Tom kept looking at that scene, and he had all this anxiety about whether or not it would be a satisfying conclusion or whether it would feel open-ended. We constantly revisited it, constantly refined it.”
Unlike “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” which threw moviegoers a curveball by ending on a massive cliffhanger (its second part, “Beyond the Spider-Verse,” arrives in March 2024), “Dead Reckoning Part One” ends with Cruise’s Ethan Hunt achieving his immediate goal (he secures the key to unlock the source code of The Entity, the film’s villainous AI program) and Hayley Atwell’s Grace accepting an offer to join the IMF. There are dangling plot threads for “Part Two” to pick up (chief among them being that the film’s human villain, Esai Morales’ Gabriel, is still alive), but at least one mission has reached its definitive end. This is a far more conclusive ending than “Spider-Verse,” which leaves viewers hanging as Miles Morales is stuck in an alternate universe with the Prowler-version of himself.
Story continues
“If you leave it with a cliffhanger, it feels a little bit like we’re expecting you to come back,” McQuarrie told Total Film. “We didn’t want that feeling. The feeling we were reaching for — and we hope you feel — is we dare you not to come back. We want to leave you thinking, ‘Oh, I can’t wait to see what happens next.'”
“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is now playing theaters nationwide from Paramount Pictures. “Part Two” is set to open on June 28, 2024.

2023-07-17 05:27:30+00:00,China Box Office: ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Opens Soft in Third Place,Box office data for the first half of 2023 has made Hollywood's new normal in China painfully clear: much smaller hits and far more flops.,"Tom Cruise failed to do the seemingly impossible in China over the weekend: revive Hollywood’s former box office muscle at the world’s second-biggest theatrical movie market.
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One badly lost its opening weekend in China, debuting in third place behind a pair of holdover Chinese hits.
The Paramount and Skydance sequel opened to just $25.9 million from Friday to Sunday, a steep tumble from Mission: Impossible Fallout‘s $76 million opening back in 2018. Chinese martial arts drama Never Say Never, meanwhile, earned $46.1 million, followed by local animation hit Chang An with $43.9 million.
Never Say Never, written and directed by local comedy favorite Wang Baoqiang (Lost in Thailand, Detective Chinatown), has brought in a healthy $211.5 million since its July 6 opening. Chang An, the latest release from pioneering Beijing-based animation studio Light Chaser, launched July 8 and has a current total of $96.1 million.
Ticketing app Maoyan forecasts Mission: Impossible 7 to finish its China run with just $60 million, down from M:I 6‘s $181 million total in 2018 and M:I 5‘s $136.7 million haul in 2015.
Local reviews for Cruise’s latest turn as Ethan Hunt have been notably strong. The film scored 9.4 on Maoyan, 9.5 on Alibaba’s Tao Piao Piao and 7.9 on Douban — very healthy numbers. But Chinese filmgoers just aren’t coming out for American movies the way they once did.
China’s theatrical box office results for the first half of 2023 became available earlier this month — and the numbers are pretty grim for Hollywood.
After abruptly lifting its strict COVID-19 lockdowns late last year, China has resumed importing U.S. movies at pre-pandemic levels in 2023, one of Beijing’s many moves intended to signal to the world that it is back open for business. In the first half of 2023, 24 U.S. titles were released in Chinese cinemas, just two fewer than during the same stretch in 2019, according to Artisan Gateway.
Overall, China’s theatrical market has staged a strong recovery recently. Total movie ticket revenue reached $3.8 billion (RMB 26.3 billion) in the first six months of the year, down just 16 percent from 2019 (and an improvement of 54 percent compared to last year, when Chinese cinemas were still hobbled by mass lockdowns).
Local Chinese movies, meanwhile — again evidenced this weekend by Never Say Never and Chang An‘s strong holds — are doing bigger business than ever. In the first half of 2023, thanks to a booming Chinese New Year release season, total sales for Chinese titles surged to $2.8 billion, up 27 percent from the equivalent period in the year before the pandemic.
The earnings shortfall that remains is almost entirely due to the plummeting earnings of U.S. movies in China, analysts have noted. Despite Hollywood tentpoles resuming their flow into China at a healthy rate, total ticket sales for U.S. movies clocked in at just $592 million for the first six months of the year, a steep slide from the $1.9 billion earned during the same stretch in 2019.
Hopes are relatively high for the earnings potential of Greta Gerwig and Warner Bros’ Barbie, which opens in China on Friday. But the U.S. film will face some extremely tough local competition. The first installment of Chinese director Wuershan’s Fengshen Trilogy, dubbed “China’s answer to Lord of the Rings,” opens Thursday, boasting a star-packed cast and the biggest production budget of any film in Chinese moviemaking history.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9jaGluYS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS03LW9wZW5zLXRoaXJkLXBsYWNlLTEyMzU1Mzc5ODQv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy9tb3ZpZS1uZXdzL2NoaW5hLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLTctb3BlbnMtdGhpcmQtcGxhY2UtMTIzNTUzNzk4NC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

,"FilmWatch Weekly: The best train sequence ever in ‘Mission: Impossible’, plus Chilean politics, French crime, and Irish ladies",,"Esai Morales and Tom Cruise in “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” from Paramount Pictures and Skydance
What is it with movies and trains? Two of the most anticipated franchise films of the summer, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 1, feature massive railroad-centered action sequences. IJATDOD’s comes in its opening, and features a convincingly de-aged Harrison Ford going up against O.G. Nazis on an army train in the waning days of World War II. MIDRP1’s comes as its grand finale, and is an instantly iconic masterpiece of destruction and derring-do that one-ups itself every thirty seconds in a series of kinetic crescendos.
Why are these types of sequences, in which characters race through, fistfight atop, and dangle perilously from a series of discrete but varied compartments as they hurtle along a preordained pathway at excessive speeds, still so much a part of the action director’s playbook? After all, most Americans (unfortunately) don’t have much experience in or around trains these days. Our most common interaction with them is when they are stationary, blocking other traffic in a way that is the opposite of pulse-pounding.
In some sense, it’s as if trains are part of cinema’s DNA. The first widely screened film was the Lumière Brothers’ 1896 The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station, which (perhaps apocryphally) caused spectators to leap from the seats in fear of the “approaching” locomotive. The first heart-pounding cinematic spectacle, you might say. That was followed up by the iron horse’s incorporation into narrative films, from 1903’s The Great Train Robbery to Buster Keaton’s The General.
Dramatic stories set on traveling trains combine circumscribed, even claustrophobic environments with a diversity of individual settings as varied as the number of cars in tow. They can bring together characters from diverse backgrounds, and are synonymous with intrigue in movies such as Night Train to Munich, Lars von Trier’s Zentropa, and, of course, the multiple versions of Murder on the Orient Express. These confluences can also lead to more positive relationships: Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Céline (Julie Deply) meet on Eurail in Before Sunset, and an unlikely pair of travelers make a surprising connection in the 2021 Finnish film Compartment No. 6.
The qualities that give rise to films such as the foregoing can also be found in stories set in ocean liners, or spaceships, or stagecoaches. But there’s something about rail travel that makes it especially amenable to elaborate stunt work. There’s an analog solidity to trains, behemoths of iron and steam and sheer momentum. No other mode of transport involves (a) high-speed movement (b) close to the ground that (c) must stay on its designated course or disaster will ensue.
That combination of rattling velocity and stolid implacability gives an action filmmaker a lot to work with, from Keaton contending with the cowcatcher of The General to Spidey and Doc-Ock going mano a mano a mano a mano (you get the idea) atop an elevated New York subway train in Spider-Man 2. Heck, Ethan Hunt himself already has a high-speed train battle to his credit, in the very first Mission: Impossible movie, with bonus points for helicopter involvement.
Until this year, however, the best rail-based action scene in film history was, of course, the one in which Oscar-winner Michelle Yeoh jumps a motorcycle onto a moving train to help Jackie Chan in 1996’s Supercop. And when I say Michelle Yeoh jumped a motorcycle onto a train, I mean Michelle Yeoh, who had never before the day of shooting driven a motorcycle, not some stunt driver, jumped that motorcycle onto that train. Eleven times, by most counts. (Plus there’s a helicopter involved, so take that, Brian De Palma.)
And now comes director Christopher McQuarrie to the stage, in Dead Reckoning, the new all-time champ for crosstie chaos. It’s an appropriate honor, since the film in its entirety is the most sheerly entertaining, adrenalizing spectacle in years. The plot is moronic when it’s not dispensed with entirely, and the dialogue is entirely dedicated to declaring the goals and methods the characters have in each discreet geographical sequence. (“Remember, Ethan: you need both halves of the key, Ethan! BOTH HALVES!” [paraphrased].) But, as they never tire of reminding us, Cruise and McQuarrie’s crusade is to get butts in seats, and there’s never been a better way to do that than by showing folks stuff they haven’t seen before, and showing it to them bigger and louder than they could experience anywhere else. Seriously, even if you think you have a banger home theater, see this in IMAX. (If I ever notice someone watching this film on a phone, I may need to be restrained.)
And in Cruise, the movies have their heir to Keaton and Chan, performers who knew that audiences can always tell when the performer is truly putting their safety at risk when executing stunts. There is something ineffable about knowing that it was the world’s biggest movie star his own self who drove a motorcycle of a precipice and then parachuted to earth (take that, Yeoh!). You can tell the difference between Cruise’s windblown face as he clings to the top of a Casey Jones special and the CGI version of similar antics in lesser films (including Dial of Destiny). And it seems impossible for any stuntman to mimic his running style—he looks like he was made by Boston Dynamics.
The climax involves a cascading series of catastrophes that lasts exactly as long as it should. (If this is all starting to feel a bit PG-13, so be it.) It’s top-notch audience manipulation, right down to the “Oh, right, this is just the first ****ing half!” realization. Tom Cruise is a perplexing guy, and he really should be questioned under oath about the whereabouts of Shelly Miscavige, but he’s certainly not the only movie star with a twisted past—he’s just the best one we have right now.

In a surprising turn of events, the highly acclaimed manga and anime series Spy x Family is using its web of connections to promote the blockbuster spy film Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One with Spy x Family Code White, the anime’s first theatrical release.
On July 10, the official Spy x Family website unveiled a teaser poster and a promotional video featuring the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) and the Forger family.
Here is everything we’ve gathered from the latest collaboration.
Spy x Family and Mission Impossible join forces to promote their thrilling spy films

The promotion included a side-by-side poster juxtaposing Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One’s original movie artwork with a cleverly edited version featuring characters from Spy x Family.
Here is the breakdown of the corresponding characters from both franchises.
SPY X FAMILY CHARACTER MISSION IMPOSSIBLE CHARACTER DEAD RECKONING PART ONE ACTOR Loid Forger Ethan Hunt Tom Cruise Yor Forger Grace Hayley Atwell Anya Forger Ilsa Faust Rebecca Ferguson Bond Forger Gabriel Esai Morales Yuri Briar Benji Dunn Simon Pegg Sylvia Sherwood The White Widow Vanessa Kirby Franky Franklin Luther Stickell Ving Rhames Fiona Frost Paris Pom Klementieff
A promotional video was also released alongside the poster, showing Loid introducing Anya to the Mission Impossible franchise.
The video starts with the narrator giving background information about Operation Strix, a mission from the Westilian Intelligence Agency that coincidentally pulled together Loid Forger, Yor Forger, Anya Forger, and their dog, Bond Forger.
Anya then sits down and watches the Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One trailer with Bond, Loid, and Yor. Loid starts thinking about its plot, which Anya can hear because of her telepathic ability.
Anya is confused by Mission Impossible’s backstory but gets intrigued with Ethan Hunt, Tom Cruises’ character in the series. She then compares Ethan to Bondman, the main character in Spy Wars, her favorite cartoon TV series.
Loid notices that Ethan can escape dangerous situations because of his latest spy tech. The Spy x Family super agent believes Ethan’s gadgets would be useful for him, too, and wonders if his associate, Franky Franklin, could get him the same gear.
Yor suddenly says out loud that Ethan seems capable, just like Loid. Anya, who is so absorbed with the trailer and Loid’s thoughts, nearly slips up and reveals that Loid is a spy.
Anya stops before Loid can notice and changes the conversation by shouting, “Anya would like spy merch, please!”
Loid then explains how having a lot of handy gadgets and a trusted team is vital for spy missions and introduces Ethan’s team in the movie.
The last part of the crossover video features a short Spy x Family Code White teaser trailer. Spy x Family’s first theatrical release is set to hit theaters across Japan on December 22, and it will feature an original plot that isn’t adapted from the manga.
Instead, Spy x Family creator Tatsuya Endo had worked with Wit Studio and CloverWorks to create new characters for the movie.
Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One will hit Japanese cinemas on July 21.

Esai Morales Explains Why His Villain Is “Ferocious” In ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’
Esai Morales and Pom Klementieff in Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One from Paramount Pictures and Skydance.
Actor Esai Morales, who plays the villainous Gabriel, in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, recently shared why he believes his character is so “ferocious.”
Speaking with Fandango about the film, Morales first explained how heroes need good villains to prove their heroism.
He said, “I think your heroes, the more formidable a foe your hero has the bigger the mountain. And you can’t have a hill. You need something ferocious.”

Morales then went on to explain how he brings that to the camera, “For me it’s about tapping into the pain in my life, tapping into the times where I’ve had to draw deep and it’s serious stuff.”
“I think that McQuarrie and Tom know how to capture that, and edit it, and put it together in a way that leaves a lasting impact,” he continued. “The movie is haunting. The character I play is haunting.”
From there Morales elaborated, “I play it tied to his past, Ethan Hunt’s past. And as I’ve said a couple of time, I think, nobody can threaten your future more than somebody who knows your past.”
When asked about the character’s backstory and how it was developed, Morales revealed, “Well, the thing is that I talk to the director more, and then Tom comes in and he fine tunes. He has an eye. Come on, he’s been doing this at such a high level for so long. He knows what works with the audience. He knows.”
“And it’s funny,” he continued. “I loved watching the fun aspects. So for me this is a dream come true.”

Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One sees “Ethan Hunt and his IMF team embark on their most dangerous mission yet: To track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity before it falls into the wrong hands.”
“With control of the future and the fate of the world at stake, and dark forces from Ethan’s past closing in, a deadly race around the globe begins. Confronted by a mysterious, all-powerful enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than his mission – not even the lives of those he cares about most,” the film’s official description concludes.
The film features a star studded cast including Tom Cruise, Esai Morales, Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Pom Klementieff, Mariela Garriga, Henry Czerny, Shea Whigham, Greg Tarzan Davis, Charles Parnell, Frederick Schmidt, Cary Elwes, Mark Gatiss, Indira Varma, and Rob Delaney.
The movie is written by Christopher McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen. McQuarrie also directs the film.
The movie is currently in theaters now.

The British actress, who’s engaged to music producer Ned Wolfgang Kelly, described the gossip during the filming of the seventh installment of the action franchise as “upsetting.”
Tom Cruise and Hayley Atwell attend the Australian Premiere of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” presented by Paramount Pictures and Skydance at ICC Sydney on July 03, 2023, in Sydney, Australia.
“I would be like, ‘Ooh, there’s some weird rumors, and it feels base, it feels a little dirty, it feels grubby, it’s not what I’m about,'” she told The Independent. “Why are things being assumed or projected onto me about my relationship with my work colleague and boss?”
Atwell, 41, particularly took umbrage to the scuttlebutt because she viewed Cruise — who is 61 — and director Chris McQuarrie (a.k.a. McQ) as “uncle figures.” The speculation, she added, has an impact on people in her “personal life, who are subject to being on the receiving end of that. It becomes invasive.”
Tom Cruise greets Hayley Atwell during a photo call in support of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” at Overseas Passenger Terminal on July 02, 2023 in Sydney, Australia.
Atwell confessed she sought counsel from the iconic superstar, who has been a magnet for rumors throughout most of his career. The “Risky Business” actor offered some sage advice, she said.
“When I’ve talked to him about it, he’d be like, ‘You know exactly who you are. You know what you’re about. And that is the only thing that matters. It doesn’t matter what people think of you, if you are in integrity with yourself, if you know what your value system is,'” Atwell said.

The Golden Globe Award nominee previously starred as Peggy Carter in six Marvel movies, most notably 2022’s “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.”

,Every MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE Villain Ranked From Worst to Best,"Ethan Hunt has faced a lot of enemies, but which one is the best? Here's every single villain from the Mission: Impossible franchise ranked.","You don’t save the world from annihilation seven times without coming to blows with a lot of evil people. But not every enemy Ethan Hunt has faced off with in the Mission: Impossible franchise has been his equal. Some proved more than worthy foes, but others were cinematic duds. Who was the worst and who was the best of the baddies? To find out we ranked all of the villains from the original Mission: Impossible through Dead Reckoning Part One. We also explain which of the villains actually qualify for our list.
Paramount Pictures
Before we get to every Mission: Impossible villain these are the characters who didn’t qualify for our list and why.
Neutral Evil (The Mitsopolis Crime Family)
Max Mitsopolis (Mission: Impossible)
Paramount Pictures
The franchise’s first arms dealer was a criminal out for herself rather than an enemy fighting Ethan directly.
“The White Widow” Alanna Mitsopolis and Zola Mitsopolis (Mission: Impossible – Fallout and Dead Reckoning Part One)
Paramount Pictures
Max’s kids followed their incarcerated mother into the family business. As a result they end up with the same non-villain designation for the same reasons. (Though Zola comes close to qualifying as a villain in his second appearance.)
Antagonist, But Not a Bad Person
Sometimes good/not-bad people have an issue with Ethan Hunt. These are those people.
Eugene Kittridge (Mission: Impossible ONLY)
Eugene Kittridge was just doing his job in 1996. There really was a mole!
Alan Hunley (Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation)
Paramount Pictures
Before he joined the IMF team, Alec Baldwin’s Alan Hunley was a huge pain in Ethan’s ass, but he wasn’t acting out of malice.
Erika Sloane (Mission: Impossible – Fallout)
Paramount Pictures
CIA Director Erika Sloane’s refusal to believe in the IMF helped August Walker get away, but a lack of trust does not make one evil.
Jasper Briggs (Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One)
Paramount Pictures
Not everyone who hunts down Ethan Hunt is a bad person. And in some cases they’re actually good guys, like Shea Whigham’s Jasper Briggs.
Dishonorable Henchmen-tion
These are major henchmen so terrible they don’t deserve to be ranked.

Wallis (Mission: Impossible II)

Paramount Pictures

Wallis, part II‘s second most important henchmen is so unremarkable I might have made him up.

Brownway (Mission: Impossible III)

Paramount Pictures

It pains me to besmirch the great Eddie Marsan in anyway, but Brownway is so insignificant Ethan Hunt didn’t bother to kill him or even arrest him.

Henchmen-sches

These are good henchmen who simply aren’t in their movie enough to earn a formal spot on our villain list.

Kagan the Flautist Assassin (Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation)

Paramount Pictures

You really have to do something special to stand out as a one sequence henchmen in these films. The very tall flautist assassin Kagan more than does that. He’s sadistic, imposing, and really enjoying his work.

Richter the Police Assassin (Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation)

Paramount Pictures

Richter the police assassin can’t compare with his musical counterpart, but he’s part of the Syndicate, gets a name, and tries to kill Benji. What a jerk.

Now for the ranking of the actual villains of the Mission: Impossible franchise.

21. Sean Ambrose (Mission: Impossible II)

Paramount Pictures

Sean Ambrose isn’t just the worst villain in the Mission: Impossible franchise. He’s one of the lamest, most boring, least intimidating villains in movie history. How much of that is a poor script and a poorly made movie? I don’t know and I don’t care because I never want to think about this character ever again.

20. Hugh Stamp (Mission: Impossible II)

Paramount Pictures

Poor Hugh is actually a totally cromulent number two, but his number rightfully deserves his number 21 designation. Plus, Mission: Impossible II is easily the number seven film in the franchise. That’s a lot of math, but it all adds up to a low number for Hugh Stamp. He also has a really stupid name.

19. Denlinger (Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One)

Paramount Pictures

Cary Elwes’ Denlinger is a truly evil dude played by a fantastic actor, but he only has two scenes. We only know he’s bad for one of them before he instantly died. He just can’t go any higher with such a small villain resume.

18. Dr. Nils DeBruuk (Mission: Impossible – Fallout)

Paramount Pictures

He only has one scene but it’s a doozy. The religion-hating Dr. DeBruuk built three portable nuclear bombs and then gleefully celebrated their (faked) detonation in major holy cities. What a monster. If he weren’t so goofy and gullible he wouldn’t be this low.

17. Marius Wistrom (Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol)

Paramount Pictures

Ghost Protocol’s top henchmen is a loyal disciple to a raging lunatic who wants to set off a nuclear bomb. That’s good villainy. He also looks like a jerk, which always helps. Unfortunately he’s technically in the film less than you think. His best sequence turns out to be his boss in a Wistrom mask.

16. Janik Vinter “The Bone Doctor” (Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation)

Paramount Pictures

Janik’s nickname alone makes him a pretty good bad guy, but working for the Syndicate and killing lots of innocent people is also pretty heinous. He’s also a genuinely scary dude.

15. Franz Krieger (Mission: Impossible)

Paramount Pictures

The brutal murder of an IMF agent? The double-cross of Ethan? Using a helicopter to try and decapitate someone hanging on a train? All for a little money? Honestly? I can almost forgive all of that, but nearly screwing up the iconic wire heist? Have you no sense of decency, sir!

14. John C. McCloy (Mission: Impossible II)

Paramount Pictures

John C.McCloy, a pharmaceutical CEO (played by the great Brendan Gleeson), who wants to unleash a fatal virus on the world so he can then get rich selling the only cure is pretty heinous for reasons we really don’t want to think about too much for obvious reasons.

13. Eugene Kittridge (Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One ONLY)

Paramount Pictures

Why is Eugene Kittridge a villain in Dead Reckoning Part One but not in the original film? Because in the seventh film he’s trying to turn the United States into an eternal, unmatched, unbeatable superpower. More importantly he knows that’s wrong. Combined with his decades-long antagonistic relationship with Ethan and Kittridge ends up being a memorable franchise baddie even if he’s not a traditional bad guy.

12. John Musgrave (Mission: Impossible III)

Paramount Pictures

The third film’s secret villain not only betrayed his friend Ethan, he let Owen Davian kidnap Julia. And for what? So the US could be .001% more powerful? John Musgrave might have seemed like a milquetoast middle management loser, but that’s a big reason why he’s so despicable. The nepotism hire had no moral compass. What he did have was a dad who played golf with the President.

11. Claire Phelps (Mission: Impossible I)

Paramount Pictures

Claire Phelps conspired with her husband to kill their friends and betray their government for not that much money. She then pretended to be on Ethan’s side so he could steal her a list that would lead to many more deaths. Claire’s sweet seeming nature is why she’s among the franchise’s most conniving and loathsome villains. Ethan believed in her!

10. Sabine Moreau ( Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol)

Paramount Pictures

Léa Seydoux’s Sabine Moreau remains one of the franchise’s most stylish, cold-blooded killers. Any chance she survived her fall off the Burj Khalifa? We’d love for her to come back.

9. Chief Atlee (Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation)

Paramount Pictures

The man who founded the Syndicate and then risked the lives of good agents in an attempt to cover his tracks when he lost control of the group is as heinous as any government official to appear in the series.

8. Kurt Hendricks ( Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol)

Paramount Pictures

A genius IQ of 190 but “crazy” is a pretty good foundation for a worthy IMF opponent, and Kurt Hendricks more than qualifies as such. He blew up the Kremlin and was so committed to nuclear holocaust he sacrificed himself to try and make it happen. Plus his Wistrom mask ploy and escape in the sandstorm chase are among the best villain moments in Mission: Impossible.

7. Paris (Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One)

Paramount Pictures

Pom Klementieff’s sneering Harley Quinn-like killer is easily the franchise’s best enforcer. Paris laughing tank drive through Rome alone would get her a top 10 spot.

6. Jim Phelps (Mission: Impossible)

Paramount Pictures

Jim Phelps murdered his team and betrayed the United States because he was mad the Cold War ended and the President didn’t need him as much. What a baby. A monstrous, vile baby. He’s so terrible he’s almost as bad as Jon Voight.

5. The Entity (Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One)

Paramount Pictures

A foe who is everywhere at once, knows all of your secrets and what you’re going to do next before you do, and has the ability to destroy all mankind at any moment? The Entity might be a classic Hollywood rogue AI trope, but it’s one of the best versions of it we’ve ever seen.

4. Gabriel (Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One)

Paramount Pictures

No one has ever scared Ethan Hunt more than the man who essentially created him, Gabriel, the “messiah” who views death as a gift. That’s genuinely chilling. The combination of his dapper appearance and Esai Morales delivers a villain who has the chance to vault to the top of this list in Dead Reckoning Part Two.

3. August Walker (Mission: Impossible – Fallout)

Paramount Pictures

Henry Cavill’s large amoral meatball “John Lark” was the perfect foil for the more cerebral, righteous Ethan. August Walker also looked like he could literally rip someone in half, making him unique among the franchise’s villains. He was a sociopath with a grand plan to upend the world who also happened to be a dumb grizzly bear.

2. Owen Davian (Mission: Impossible III)

Paramount Pictures

You can’t overstate how important Phillip Seymour Hoffman’s Owen Davian was to the franchise after two straight subpar installments. He helped elevate the possibilities of what these movies could (and ultimately did) do. He’s that good. So while Davian is in the movie far less than you realize initially, you remember every second of his rage-filled performance. As far as single film villains go he’s the best.

1. Solomon Lane (Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and Fallout)

Paramount Pictures

The number one spot rightfully goes to a villain so evil Mission: Impossible brought him back for a second film. Sean Harris’ Solomon Lane is the anti-Ethan Hunt who leads an anti-IMF. And for as chilling and clinical as he is in his original appearance, he’s even scarier in his second when his unbridled anger at Ethan boils over. Considering his introduction scene that’s a special feat.

Plus, he’s still alive! If the Entity and Gabriel need some help dealing with Mission: Impossible‘s number one hero, they could come calling for his number one villain. That would make for one truly terrifying team.

2023-07-08 18:08:37+05:30,'Is There Anything He Can't Do?' Tom Cruise Speaks Fluent Hindi At MI 7 Promotions; Watch,"In a recent interview while promoting his upcoming film Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1, Tom Cruise displayed another hidden talent of his as he spoke in fluent Hindi to the Canadian interviewer of Indian origin. The clip has gone viral and fans are wondering if there’s anything he can’t do.","Over the years, Tom Cruise has become a global phenomenon with his terrific performances, great films and death-defying stunts.

Last year, he saved cinema with Top Gun: Maverick and now he is returning to the big screen with the 7th instalment of the much loved Mission: Impossible franchise titled Dead ReckoningPart 1.

Several clips of his stunt scenes from the film have already gone viral on social media leaving the audience gobsmacked and extremely excited for the upcoming film.

Now, while doing the promotional interviews for it, a clip has been making the rounds of social media where Tom is seen speaking fluent Hindi leaving the interviewer (Canadian of Indian origin) in the video as well as the people (mostly Indians) on social media amazed.

@ Paramount Pictures

It so happens that the interviewer from ETalk wondered if there is anything Tom can’t do and went on to talk about how he speaks French in the film and that left her wondering if he is going to speak in Hindi with her.

Tom immediately responds, “If you want me to speak in Hindi with you I will. Let's try it.” She then says, “Namaste, aap kaise hain? (How are you?)” and Tom repeats with fluency.

He then asks her if she speaks fluent Hindi and is even more impressed upon learning that she can also speak Punjabi and Farsi.

Watch the clip below:

2023-08-09 14:30:14+00:00,"How C2 Motion Picture Group Is Quietly Putting $100M+ Into Paramount Tentpoles & Jodie Comer’s New Thriller, While Trying To Avoid “Cautionary Tales”",The financier-producer has quietly put more than $100M into Paramount tentpoles and a handful of indie movies.,"EXCLUSIVE: C2 Motion Picture Group has quietly put more than $100M into four Paramount movies in the past 12 months: Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts, Dungeons & Dragons: Honour Among Thieves and Babylon.

The LA-based financier-producer is now in talks with the studio to potentially invest in double that number of movies.

In the past 18 months, C2 has also fully financed indie movies including Michael Keaton dramedy Goodrich, Samara Weaving horror Azrael, and thriller Longlegs with Nicolas Cage, while it has co-financed Jodie Comer starrer The End We Start From.

The company was set up by Jason Cloth and Dave Caplan. Cloth is the founder of Creative Wealth Media, which with former partner Bron notably had a co-fi slate deal with Warner Bros and backed movies including Joker. Caplan recently produced and directed hip-hop documentary The DOC, and previously produced on a string of TV series including ABC Family’s Monica The Medium.

In a wide-ranging chat, we spoke to the duo about collaborating with Paramount, highs and lows at the box office, the health of the indie market, Bron as a “cautionary” tale, and the impact of the strikes.

FORMATION & STRATEGY

DEADLINE: How did C2 come about?

DAVE CAPLAN: Jason and I became friends socially. We worked on a project that has not been announced yet, and I think we found after spending a lot of time together that we have the same creative sensibilities, which I think lean very commercial. We talked about the direction for a new production company/mini-studio/film financier that leaned very commercial, that was very filmmaker-forward and filmmaker-sensitive, but also wanted projects that we would want to go watch in theaters. We were having those conversations 18 month to two years ago.

DEADLINE: How is the company capitalized?

JASON CLOTH: C2 is the next iteration of Creative Wealth. So, we have the same institutions, the same philosophy of going after high-net-worth family offices. It’s designed to raise capital on a more sophisticated institutional level.

DEADLINE: Like Creative Wealth, a key resource is the Canadian pension funds as well?

CLOTH: Correct.

DEADLINE: Which fields are the family offices in?

CLOTH: Different fields. Family offices tend to be more open to film financing because they’re generally more open to alternative investments, which is how we pitch film investing. They’re usually very entrepreneurial.

We’re always open to new partners, but we just can’t take on an unlimited number of indie movies and there is a maximum amount that we will have available from Paramount. We’d rather have fewer better partners than money from any source.

DEADLINE: Creative Wealth was a key financier of Bron, which was previously very active but has recently filed for bankruptcy. What’s the status of your collaboration with them?

CLOTH: Bron doesn’t factor into C2 at all. C2 doesn’t finance shows produced, sourced or originated by Bron. Creative Wealth hasn’t financed anything from Bron in the last year and a half. Bron has gone on to do other things. Dave and I are more aligned in what we want to do going forward than Aaron [Bron CEO Aaron Gilbert] and I were. So, that’s where we are.

DEADLINE: Are you still a director at Bron?

CLOTH: No.

DEADLINE: For anyone looking from the outside who may be in two minds, what separates C2’s ambitions from those of Bron? There are some similarities. Is it about being more streamlined?

CLOTH: It’s definitely more streamlined. Dave and I are very cognisant of costs. We’re very cognisant of budgets, very picky as to the types of projects we do. I love Bron and Aaron, but I would very much use them as a cautionary template as to what I would do and what I wouldn’t do, and what works in the market and what doesn’t work. I would be foolish not to take a look at what got them to where they are.

DEADLINE: Financier Hudson Private sued Bron and Creative Wealth for failure to repay an investment. What is the status of that legal case?

CLOTH: That was a little complicated. It wasn’t quite what was reported. Let me just say that monies that they were not entitled to, they did not get, and films that they actually invested in, they are getting their money from. So, that’s where that is. It didn’t quite go for them the way they thought it was going to go.

DEADLINE: And it’s ongoing?

CLOTH: It’s only ongoing because of Bron’s situation. But that’s about as much as I can say.

DEADLINE: It sounds like C2 will look to avoid having as many strings to its bow as Bron tried to add?

CLOTH: Dave and I would do a lot of market analysis before we decided to get into something outside of our core. That said, we have been discussing TV…

CAPLAN: We’re definitely interested in TV. We’re exploring a few different projects and we’re definitely interested in unscripted. From a marketplace perspective, because we have funding, that gives us more of a competitive advantage in the indie film market, versus selling a TV show to a streamer, or network, where from my experience streamers tend to like to get packages, and then co-develop alongside the producers or studio.

Having funding and making a pilot, or making a series independently, and then taking it to a streamer can be very risky, more so than funding an independent film. So, yes, we are interested in TV but we haven’t found the right project to greenlight yet. But there are conversations going on. Come January, we’ll be leaning into TV in a bigger way.

Mila Kunis and Michael Keaton Courtesy/Getty

In terms of our film output, we’re being focused. There may be the odd exception if a filmmaker we love becomes available, but we’re concentrating on three commercial genres: thrillers, elevated action, and elevated horror. If the right commercial dramedy or rom-com coms along, we’ll still do it, like Goodrich with Michael Keaton and Mila Kunis. The team and script were so good that we couldn’t say no. Our producing partner on that, Daniela Taplin Lundberg, is a brilliant producer.

CLOTH: We’re not very interested in co-financing and having a passive role…

DEADLINE: What credits do you normally take on projects?

CLOTH: I’m usually executive producer while Davis is producer, along with a company credit.

DEADLINE: What budget do you have at your disposal each year?

Dave: It’s more related to the project, and what we deem the value of that project to be. We would do a 70 million-dollar Guy Richie movie, depending on the auspices, and we would consider that in the same way that we would look at an eight million-dollar horror film.

DEADLINE: You haven’t financed a big Guy Richie movie yet, right?

Dave: We have not. Jason and I are executive producers on Guy’s new movie with Henry Cavill and Eiza Gonzalez, which is in post-production. We’d love to do more with him.

DEADLINE: But, you have very deep pockets…

CLOTH: What it means is that our investors have confidence that what we greenlight for a year meets our greenlight criteria, and they would be fine putting up capital to finance those productions. Dave and I read a lot. Dave reads a tremendous amount. But there’s a limit.

We’re looking at ten, maybe ten-plus indie movies a year, in addition to our studio slate business. We would go out and raise a separate capital pool for our TV business.

CAPLAN: Most of our projects are under $25M. The sweet spot for us is probably $8-15M.

PARAMOUNT DEAL

DEADLINE: So, coming to your deal with Paramount…

CLOTH: I’d probably call it a multi-picture strategic partnership. We couldn’t be happier with the partnership and the deal terms that we’ve got from them, and the collaborative nature that their executives have adopted. I’ve not seen anything like it in the years that I’ve been doing slate financing with major studios.

They will divulge the details when ready but we have a rather large, growing business with Paramount that we want to expand to whatever level they will allow us. Talks are ongoing.

Joker

DEADLINE: Before we get into that deal, I want to go back a couple of steps to your previous slate deal with Warner Bros. To what extent was the critical and financial success of Joker a transformational one for Creative Wealth as an investor? I know you’ve said in the past that the funds you manage accounted for a quarter of that film’s budget. Did that film help open doors at Paramount?

CLOTH: I don’t think it was transformational. It’s certainly something that everybody still wants to talk about. Being part of of quite a few studio films was more transformational than anything else. Before Dave and I took on the Paramount partnership, I was pretty much done with the slate financing side of things. We weren’t really treated much like partners before Paramount.

I began to realize that certain terms weren’t being given to you because that would’ve given you a slight advantage. It wasn’t a very fair game to play. I was lucky enough to have a lunch with my lawyer and one of the heads of co-finance at Paramount, at which I expressed my dissatisfaction with that side of the business, and then we started discussions.

Skydance was leaving Paramount at the time, so it really was fortuitous that we were speaking when we did. That was last year’s Cannes Film Festival.

It’s a little like playing Blackjack. Even if you play exactly like the house, the house still has a small advantage. That’s always what’s going to happen in studio slate financing, but the idea is to get as close to even with them as possible, and I think, given the way Paramount has treated us, we’re as close to that type of deal as anybody. We probably have the best terms of any major studio slate financier.

CAPLAN: The executives at Paramount are also very, very good. Brian Robbins, Marc Weinstock, Mike Ireland, Daria Cercek and Peter McPartlin are very smart, and they have very good taste.

CLOTH: There aren’t many studios you can do a deal like this with. MGM no longer exists in that way. We’ve spoken to Warner Brothers, but there are just certain terms, deal points, that they are not open to giving us…

DEADLINE: You’re not going to disclose precise deal points but what are the parameters of these deals?

CLOTH: It’s about how close to being on par with the studio can we get in terms of return on investment. That’s what all the different terms do. It’s about minimizing the layers between you and the studio to make it more fair.

DEADLINE: What is your investment in these movies?

CLOTH: The overall deal is nine figures across the four films we’ve done, and then it would be substantially more than that for the films that we’re negotiating now. We’ve identified seven or eight movies we’re negotiating terms on now.

Tom Cruise in ‘Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning – Part One’ Paramount

DEADLINE: That’s a lot. Was Mission your biggest outlay? [We understand that C2 filled a gap in financing left by Chinese financier Alibaba]

CLOTH: One of the things I learned with Joker is just because I know information doesn’t mean it’s always a good thing to give it out. Paramount didn’t need to co-fi those movie with us but it was about beginning a collaboration. If you really want to be in the slate finance business long-term, you need to have a piece of everything…

DEADLINE: And some you need to take a hit on…

CLOTH: Yes.

DEADLINE: So, Babylon…

CLOTH: When I say that I would want to be part of everything that Paramount does, I’m not joking. If they said, you could have a piece of everything, you know, that would be the direction I would move towards.

DEADLINE: So it didn’t sting for your investors that the first project was Babylon, which didn’t make strong returns?

CLOTH: Well, that’s just representative of the film business. Looking back on it, and I’m just going to speak for myself, I loved the movie. I love the filmmaker. But the movie got on the wrong side of critics and it began to take on a life of its own. Sometimes that happens.

I don’t agree with the critical review of the film as it stands now, but I’m very proud to be part of a Damien Chazelle movie and I’m proud that that was our first film with Paramount. They treated us with respect and grace. They were collaborative, even though we knew it was going to be a rough go, and it was a testament as to why we decided to do other films with them.

DEADLINE: What is your assessment of the box office return so far for Mission?

CLOTH: We’re hopeful that the movie legs out and performs solidly through the rest of summer and hits the numbers that Fallout reached. The average Mission movie does 4.7 times its opening weekend. They tend not to be front-loaded. It’s more of a slow burn. I predict there will be some solid holds all the way into September.

DEADLINE: If it gets to nearly five times its opening weekend you’ll all be very happy, I’m sure. That looks challenging…

CLOTH: It’s an expensive movie. It was built to do that. There was almost no other direction for it to take — it had to be one of the biggest-grossing movies of the year.

DEADLINE: Very expensive, yes. If the $290M budget is accurate that would rank it in the top 15 most expensive movies all time…Have you been surprised by the box office performance of Barbie and would it have been less risky for Mission to open on a date further from that and Oppenheimer?

CLOTH: We believed Barbie would be a huge hit, but were still taken back by the enormity of the cultural phenomenon surrounding it. Looking at the summer 2023 box office, we all knew it was going to be a highly competitive frame and have always trusted and maintained confidence in Paramount’s releasing strategies.

DEADLINE: Just looking from the outside, it could be said that none of Babylon, Dungeons & Dragons or Transformers have taken off at the box office. Mission, it remains to be seen, but it probably hasn’t done as brilliantly as hoped out of the gate. Do your core investors get spooked by those box office numbers? And if not, does that give credence to some people’s views that have been aired during the strike that ultimately studios never lose?

CLOTH: The studios certainly can lose. But box office isn’t the only barometer for success these days. Box office might be a bit lower but that might be a trend, not something that’s unique to these movies. Transactional business is way, way up, but that’s not reported on as much. Box office is one of around eight windows of revenue that these films generate, so the mix is just different nowadays.

DEADLINE: So, you and your investors were happy with the returns on Babylon, Dungeons & Dragons, and Transformers?

CLOTH: Babylon was not commercially successful. But there’s more to these deals. We gain a level of copyright ownership. Owning a piece of one film might not have a lot of value, but owning a piece of 30, 40 or 50 films at a major studio has a lot of value.

Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves. Paramount

DEADLINE: Sure. A lot of the numbers you’re referring to aren’t readily available or disclosed by studios or financiers. That’s probably why we still think primarily about box office…

CAPLAN: Yes, those numbers aren’t generally divulged. The rentals list on the iTunes app gives you a small indication of what’s going on…

CLOTH: We [Bron/Creative Wealth] were co-financier on The Addams Family during Covid. We sold millions and millions of copies on iTunes at $19.99. Dungeons & Dragons has spent a long time in the top five rentals on iTunes and you can get it on Paramount Plus. The market has changed a bit. People are now more comfortable renting at home.

DEADLINE: Why wasn’t C2 mentioned in the marketing and press around Mission and one or two of the other movies?

CLOTH: Our involvement came quite a bit later than everyone else’s [but still before release], and perception is everything. We’re just thankful to have been a part of these incredible movies. Our clients know whether or not they’re part of these films. We don’t have credits in the film, and the extent of the publicity was that Paramount was ok with us talking to you now about our involvement in them, and we’re fine with that. On the other films coming out in future, our involvement will be front and center. We are involved much earlier on those. Some of these have releases well into 2024 and 2025.

STRIKES & LANDSCAPE

DEADLINE: Among projects that haven’t shot yet for you is Stephen King adaptation The Monkey. I suppose like many, you’re in a holding pattern with regards to an interim agreement?

CAPLAN: Yes. There’s a level of complexity in getting them but our indie movies are true indies.

DEADLINE: Around the time of Cannes you did a deal with Paramount for Jodie Comer movie The End We Start From. That movie will be going to Toronto but presumably without Comer and her co-stars…

CAPLAN: Yes, it’s complicated over who will be able to promote the movie. We think our director Mahalio Belo will be there but we’re not sure yet about cast. We put our blood, sweat and tears into it so we’re hopeful it can get the recognition it deserves.

CLOTH: The festivals are certainly going to be very different if a number of the actors can’t make it. It’s far from ideal. There’s an electric buzz you get from proper festival launches. You don’t get that if the talent isn’t attending.

DEADLINE: How long do you think these strikes last?

CLOTH: I don’t know. Barry Diller previously predicted that if it goes into late September there’s Armageddon coming for the industry. I don’t know if that’s the case, but certainly somebody like that would be in a better position to comment, and it’s fairly ominous if that’s his take.

CAPLAN: I don’t have any special knowledge, but I think that the negotiations will pick up in earnest probably late September, early October. I think it’ll probably go until late October, early November. Taking into account the major points of disagreement, studio release schedules, speaking to people on the inside, and from reading interviews.

CLOTH: I think the easiest way to look at it is, at what point is there enough pain on both sides that they’re motivated to start talking and compromising.

CAPLAN: At what point does the lack of content impact churn at streamers, or will streamers be more inclined to license more library content to reduce the churn, and when will that reach an inflection point? If they start to see major churn, I think that’s when negotiations may pick up, but if that doesn’t happen, I think it could cause it to go longer.

We’re in business with both sides of this, the studios and the indies. We’re supportive of everyone getting a fair deal.

DEADLINE: A broad one to end. What’s your take on the health of the film and TV markets right now? Before Barbie, it felt like a number of these big movies weren’t hitting home at the box office, which I know we’ve discussed is only one metric. We have streamer retrenchment, global economic challenges, the TV market isn’t what it was a few years ago…

CAPLAN: That’s very broad and will be different for each sector. For an independent producer in unscripted television, it’s probably very challenging, as it is for a non-writing executive producer of scripted TV. For an independent film financier of very commercial, well-priced content, in our experience thus far, it’s healthy.

CLOTH: But the truth is that that segment represents only a few percent at the top, and then there’s 95 percent of indie producers and financiers that really do not have a very good finger on the pulse of the market.

Even Oscar-nominated dramas often don’t resonate widely today. The first question we ask is, will people want to watch this? You’d be surprised how many people don’t ask that question.

DEADLINE: Wasn’t the Cannes market indicative of challenges in the indie finance space that you guys specialize in? We announced more projects, pre-sale packages, than I’ve ever announced before. Good ones with strong cast and fundamentals. But it was very quiet when it came to announcing sizeable deals.

CLOTH: Well, except that we had two movies and both did well. We did very well on The Monkey, for example.

CAPLAN: The market has been in contraction since what some call ‘the Netflix correction’. It feels like fewer series are being announced, and probably fewer films are being seen in the cinemas.

I think peak television has already happened, but as we’ve seen, when a movie pops it becomes an event and part of the cultural conversation and you can still see big breakouts. Mario Brothers, Barbie…and look at Smile. I think people are still showing up for horror in a big way. Action movies, too, with that 17-day theatrical window, that can be a good space. And then with transactionals, I think what they did with movies like Plane and Violent Night was smart.

CLOTH: There’s still a fair bit of delusion from some producers about what the prospects are for their film. Often that relates to theatrical.

CAPLAN: Marketing is so key right now. Look at Sound Of Freedom…

CLOTH: One of the things I always say to Dave is to savor the good. In the film business, success is so difficult to achieve. It’s such an easy concept to explain to people, but it’s so infinitely difficult to achieve.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLXRvbS1jcnVpc2UtdHJhbnNmb3JtZXJzLXBhcmFtb3VudC1maW5hbmNpZXJzLWMyLWJyb24tMTIzNTQ1MDMwMi_SAXRodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4L21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS10b20tY3J1aXNlLXRyYW5zZm9ybWVycy1wYXJhbW91bnQtZmluYW5jaWVycy1jMi1icm9uLTEyMzU0NTAzMDIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the team behind the high school comedy “Superbad,” had sold Brian Robbins, the CEO of Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon, on the idea of adding some adolescent anarchy into their animated reboot of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.” But there was a problem with the initial designs for the film’s four reptile heroes: Instead of looking like muscular teens, these Turtles were scrawny and malnourished, barely strong enough to wield nunchucks or hurl a throwing star. “They looked like they were on Ozempic,” Robbins jokes.

And that separates him from other movie moguls, who arrive at the C-suite from MBA programs and years spent in the corporate trenches.

“He’s actually made movies, which puts him in a different category from most studio executives,” says Rogen. “He has a fundamental understanding of the process. He knows how to wrangle a movie into existence. So you can have a different kind of conversation with him.”

“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” the result of the four-year journey to reinvigorate the tired kid’s franchise, opens in theaters on Aug. 2, and Robbins is so bullish on what Rogen and Goldberg have delivered that he’s developing a sequel. In a sign of how much the entertainment business is changing, Paramount and Nickelodeon will also produce two seasons of a streaming series with the voice cast from the movies that will serve as a “bridge” between the films.

If “Mutant Mayhem” draws crowds, it will end Paramount’s summer on a high note. But as Robbins settles into a white leather chair on the deserted set of “CBS Mornings” in July, all the momentum he’s established at the studio he’s led for two years is about to collide with a pair of labor strikes that will bring Hollywood to a standstill. There are still 48 hours to go before contract negotiations collapse between the studios and the actors union, but Robbins knows where this is heading. “They’re going to strike,” he says with an air of resignation.

And on July 14 they do, sending 150,000 actors to the picket lines alongside the 11,500 screenwriters who have been holding out since May for a contract that, among other things, gives them more generous royalties from the streaming services that license their work. The effects of this industrywide shutdown are seismic — movies and shows have stopped shooting, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without paychecks. And the delicate social fabric of the entertainment ecosystem has frayed, with each side faulting the other for letting it come to this. As a member of the directors guild, as well as a former member of the actors union, Robbins has a unique perspective on what’s going on.

“I’ve been on all sides of it,” he says. “I’m a guy who went to my mailbox and got residuals. I know how important that is to actors and writers. There has to be a way forward, and hopefully we’ll find it soon. Strikes have happened before, but this one is taking place at a difficult time.”

Outside of “Barbie,” things aren’t going so hot for the Hollywood studios who write the diminishing residual checks. The cable business is vaporizing, movies have been eclipsed by TikTok and YouTube, and streaming, which was supposed to usher in a golden era of entertainment, turned out to be too expensive to maintain. As for the box office, it’s down nearly 20% from pre-COVID levels — a sign that the filmgoing audience could be more comfortable watching movies at home. Even two of Paramount’s biggest franchises, both in their seventh installments, are showing signs of aging. “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” based on the popular toys, and “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” Tom Cruise’s latest outing as agent Ethan Hunt, opened below expectations this summer. They will likely not turn a profit, given their massive budgets, in their theatrical runs.

“You can’t deny that cash flow at media companies is less than it was or that their share prices are way down,” Robbins says. “There’s been major disruption in this business. We’ll get through it, but we’re going through a painful transition.” He doesn’t seem to be sweating the situation, though it helps that the heavily air-conditioned “CBS Mornings” set makes that impossible. “Why do they always keep these places so cold?” Robbins says with a theatrical shiver that betrays years spent as one of the teen stars of “Head of the Class.” Those sitcom days are long past Robbins, who is presiding over Paramount as the studio has mounted an impressive revival, one supported by hits like “Top Gun: Maverick,” “The Lost City” and “Smile.” And on the horizon are sequels to “Paw Patrol” and “Gladiator,” as well as “If” from “A Quiet Place” director and actor John Krasinski.

Robbins has also established strong relationships with the creative community. “As big as the stakes are, he always stays cool,” says Christopher McQuarrie, the director of “Dead Reckoning Part One.” “He’s also the only head of studio who’s ever called me just to ask how I was doing.”

It’s a shift in fortunes for a studio that had spent much of the previous decade in limbo while its parent company was engulfed in corporate melodrama featuring a merger, leadership struggles and a feud involving its owners, the Redstone family. (The revolving door of names for the conglomerate that owns the studio morphed from Viacom to Viacom-CBS to, ultimately, Paramount Global, illustrating these chaotic shifts.) Robbins politely alludes to what came before when I tell him that visiting the Paramount lot at that time was eerie — a funereal quiet hung over the place.

“Yeah, they had a great run in the early aughts, and then there was a seismic shift, and there was a lot of drama corporately at Viacom, and it just created a downward spiral,” he says.

Paramount no longer feels like it’s been left behind by the business. While Robbins may be altering the perception of the studio, the knock on him is that the most successful films that Paramount has released during his tenure originated under the regime of his predecessor, Jim Gianopulos. Robbins counters that it can take decades to develop a project, to say nothing of the work that goes into making and marketing it. “You ask who greenlit a movie?” he says. “It’s semantics. There’s a lot of people that deserve credit for ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ or ‘Mission: Impossible.’ But over the last two years, it’s been up to my team to see these movies through production and bring them into the world.”

Studio executives tend to be hard-charging, blustery sorts. And while Robbins is a workaholic with a healthy ego, he’s got a laid-back energy that separates him from the pack. He punctuates sentences with “man,” sounding more like a surfer than a suit, and has an easygoing confidence that’s disarming.

“I’ve never seen Brian nervous,” says Kenan Thompson, who worked with Robbins on his first feature, 1997’s “Good Burger.” “He always has his legs crossed, giving off this air of ‘I’ve got this all under control.’”

“This is blowing my mind,” Robbins confesses to me. “This is totally surreal.”

And as I survey the scene in front of us on a muggy June night in Brooklyn, it’s hard to disagree. After all, I’m staring directly at Pete Davidson, who’s peacocking in a blue velour tracksuit that’s been spray-painted with the face of a Transformer, traversing a line of fans screeching at him for selfies. In the distance, there’s a 15-foot statue of an Autobot, a new addition to this stretch of Flatbush Avenue. It’s all part of the extravaganza that Paramount has orchestrated to promote “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.” But that’s not what Robbins is referring to. It turns out he grew up in Marine Park, Brooklyn, a short subway ride from here. “We went back and forth on this street all the time,” he says. “I never would have thought I’d be at something like this.”

Robbins’ family relocated to Los Angeles when he was 14 so his father, an actor, could land better jobs. Growing up, he’d run lines with his dad before auditions. Eventually, Robbins decided to try out for things himself. He secured guest spots on “Knight Rider” and “Growing Pains” and was a finalist for “Risky Business” and “War Games” before landing his breakthrough role as a rebellious prodigy on “Head of the Class.”

“It was amazing,” Robbins says. “I was 18 years old, and I was on one of the biggest shows on television.”

He calls the sitcom his “film school.” On set, he befriended the crew, grilling them about their jobs. “Everyone was so open,” he remembers. “They let me hang out in the writers’ room or took me to the editing room and taught me how they selected shots.”

He decided that his future lay behind, not in front of, the camera. “Acting was not my path,” Robbins says. “I didn’t want to be in my 50s auditioning for guest spots on ‘CSI.’”

After “Head of the Class” ended in 1991, Robbins began directing and producing. He made the influential 1995 music documentary “The Show,” but his real talent was his ability to sense what younger viewers wanted to watch. And in the early ’90s, those kids were looking for their own version of “Saturday Night Live,” so Robbins and his producing partner Mike Tollin created “All That,” a sketch-comedy show starring teenagers that aired on Nickelodeon. That’s where he got the idea to take two of the show’s breakout stars, Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell, and shoot a low-budget movie called “Good Burger” about two high school fast-food workers. Paramount executives loved the idea, and when they asked who was directing the picture, Robbins pitched himself, despite having never made a feature film.

“The second I got back to my office, I turned to my assistant and said, ‘The good news is we’re making a movie. The bad news is I have to act like I know what I’m doing,’” Robbins says.

“Good Burger” was a hit, grossing $23.7 million on its $8.5 million budget, and Robbins was in demand. He used that clout to direct a range of films, including the football drama “Varsity Blues” and a remake of “The Shaggy Dog.” Because he’d spent years acting, Robbins had a knack for identifying promising young talent and coaxing performances from them.

“Brian was the first director who spoke to me as an actor,” says Michael B. Jordan, who had one of his early roles in “Hardball,” a sports drama that Robbins directed. “He helped me tap into what a fictional character would be feeling.”

Robbins also formed bonds with actors that outlasted the movies they made together. “Brian was like a second dad,” Thompson says. “He taught me the ropes. He always told me that when you go into meetings, you can’t be your normal relaxed self: ‘Sell a version of yourself that’s more exciting.’”

Directing proved draining, requiring Robbins to be away from his family for long stretches of time. In 2009, as he was trying to figure out his next move, he noticed that his sons were growing more engrossed by YouTube than movies or TV. One of their favorite shows focused on Fred, a hyperactive teenager played by Lucas Cruikshank, which inspired Robbins to take that character and make a movie about him. To get it off the ground, he invested $1 million of his own money, eventually signing a deal to have it premiere on Nickelodeon, where it was a ratings hit.

“It proved I could be entrepreneurial,” Robbins says. It also left him wanting to move more aggressively into the emerging medium. So he came up with the idea for AwesomenessTV, a startup targeting tween YouTube users. “He saw where the audience was going before most people did,” says UTA chief Jeremy Zimmer, Robbins’ former agent.

Awesomeness eventually sold to DreamWorks Animation, and when DreamWorks Animation was itself sold to Comcast in 2017, Robbins left the company. That’s when he was approached by Paramount to run Paramount Players, a label making mid-budget comedies and dramas. It was a short 16-month stint before he was promoted to oversee Nickelodeon, which was struggling to recapture its 1990s dominance. But an even bigger job awaited.

Paramount Global chairwoman Shari Redstone, who had urged Robbins to take the job at Nickelodeon, says she became convinced that he was the right choice to reinvigorate Paramount. She wanted the studio to have a different vision. “Brian did not have the typical résumé,” she says. “He has his own way of looking at the business. I want us to be moving and changing and looking at the future, and I feel like Brian is making sure we don’t get left behind.”

Since taking over Paramount in 2021, Robbins has pushed the film team to work more closely with other divisions of Paramount Global. “If you look at our success, we made some great movies, but we marketed the living hell out of them,” he says. “And that’s because I did what no one else at Paramount had done. There was a moat around the studio, and I pulled up the drawbridge and said we’re going to work across the company.”

So that’s why CBS viewers were treated to an appearance by “Top Gun: Maverick” star Tom Cruise on an AFC Championship Game broadcast or audiences on MTV were offered a marathon of “Scream” movies in the lead-up to the latest sequel’s release. When we meet in July at “CBS Mornings,” Robbins isn’t there to be interviewed by Gayle King. He’s observing how the program is handling “Mission: Impossible” week, which has seen cast members stop by to enthuse about making the latest installment. All that cross-promotion is supposed to help “Mission: Impossible” achieve a cultural ubiquity that’s hard to pull off in a fractured media landscape.

The release of “Dead Reckoning Part One” marks the end of a turbulent production and a crisis that Robbins inherited on his first day on the job. The studio was at an impasse with Cruise and McQuarrie about the sequel’s runaway budget, which ultimately ballooned to nearly $300 million due to COVID shutdowns, and the filmmakers’ desire to add an expensive sequence involving a Russian submarine. That scene was originally slated to appear in the next installment, but Cruise and McQuarrie believed it was necessary to include earlier in the two-part story. However, the cost had to be assumed wholly by Paramount, because Skydance Media, which co-financed the movie, had a contract requiring the studio to assume overages beyond $240 million. Robbins avoids specifics, but admits things got thorny. “Let’s just say that the studio and the production and Tom were in a disagreement over direction, and there was a stalemate going on,” Robbins says. “We had to hit the pause button. They were stuck on how they were going to move forward with ‘Dead Reckoning Part Two’ while finishing ‘Part One.’”

So, I ask, was the disagreement over money? “It was a production issue, and it was about the scope of what was being asked for,” he says. “And the question we needed to ask was do we need this and why? And then how big is it going to be, and how long is that going to take?”

Appeasing Cruise wasn’t the only thing Robbins had to worry about in those early days. He was savaged in the press, partly because he was promoted as Gianopulos, a well-respected executive who had led Paramount since 2017, was pushed out.

Because Robbins had been an early advocate of YouTube, creating AwesomenessTV to make content for the platform, many assumed that he had sold Shari Redstone on a vision of dismantling the studio’s theatrical slate and sending everything to its streaming service. But the opposite is true — “Smile,” for instance, was supposed to debut on Paramount+, but after viewing a rough cut of the film, Robbins opted to release it theatrically. In fact, he’s primarily interested in making movies for cinemas, believing that the publicity that accompanies that kind of launch makes films more popular when they hit home entertainment.

“It was understandable,” Robbins says of the criticism. “Jim is a gentleman and a statesman of the movie business. The guy is adored — I adore him. He’s nothing but a class act. We live in a world where it’s easier for the press to get more readers by writing something negative than writing something positive.”

Robbins downplays that time, but friends acknowledge that the blistering coverage stung him. (TheAnkler, a newsletter that covers Hollywood, branded Robbins “Norbit Man,” a reference to the critically excoriated Eddie Murphy comedy that he directed).

“You know what I said to him,” Jeffrey Katzenberg, Robbins’ friend and mentor, remembers. “Go back and Google what happened when Barry Diller was named CEO of Paramount. Go back and look at what the reaction was when Michael Eisner was named president of Paramount. Read about when Bob Daly was first named head of Warner Bros. For all of these greats, when they got their jobs, the reaction was harsh, skeptical and cynical. It worked out pretty great for them, and it will work out great for you. Just go do the job.”

It’s a glittering summer morning, and over breakfast Robbins and three of his most trusted Paramount colleagues are giving me a guided tour of all the reasons the movie business is so hazardous. The group includes Marc Weinstock, president of global marketing and distribution, as well as Michael Ireland and Daria Cercek, the co-heads of the motion picture group. The topic is why it’s so punishingly hard to make a movie these days. “You have to will movies to happen,” Robbins says. “The biggest problem with this business is people sit back and feel like a great movie is just going to come to them.”

That passivity has made studios reliant on sequels and superhero movies, often with diminishing returns. The past few weeks have seen new installments in long-running franchises such as “Indiana Jones” and “Fast and Furious” open to disappointing results, while comic book movies like “The Flash” failed to spark much interest. “There has to be a fresh approach to making franchises,” says Cercek. Ireland, looking up from a plate of Belgian waffles, agrees. “There needs to be a reason to make a sequel,” he says. “It can’t just be we’ve made six other versions of this same story, and here’s a seventh.”

Robbins calls it having “a big idea.” And in the case of the latest “Transformers” film, that eureka moment was to have G.I. Joe enter the robots’ cinematic universe, bringing together two of Paramount’s biggest franchises. But that required Robbins to convince Hasbro, the toy company behind both sets of characters, and producers Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay, to let the studio bring the worlds together. And Bay’s approval was tricky, because he was worried that merging the series would cheapen the other “Transformers” movies. “I called him 50 times,” Robbins says. “I would not let him off the hook. And when he finally stopped dodging my calls, we got him to sign off.”

Even with G.I. Joe’s firepower, the recent “Transformers” movie grossed a mediocre $427 million. “We feel it’s not great, but good” is Robbins’ spin. But the film’s struggles, he says, show the perils of a fading global box office. Russia, once the sixth-biggest market for films, has been closed off following its invasion of Ukraine. More consequential, China, which rivals the United States in ticket sales, has become an unreliable source of revenue for Hollywood films. That’s largely due to rising geopolitical tensions with the U.S. In the case of “Rise of the Beasts,” the film grossed $90 million from China, half of what Paramount anticipated.

“China is a different marketplace,” says Weinstock. “You can’t count on it for a big number anymore, so everyone needs to reevaluate their budgets.”

Most summer movies carry staggering price tags. During COVID, many of these productions saw costs escalate by tens of millions of dollars. And though pandemic shutdowns have eased, inflation makes it hard to economize. How, I wonder, will Robbins and his team make cheaper movies?

“It’s no one’s fault,” says Robbins. “COVID and inflation took the $100 million movies and made them cost $200 million. But movie tickets didn’t go from $12 to $24. We have to ask: How do we build movies? What’s necessary? We need to make smart choices. You can’t have everything, but you need that foundation to be strong.”

Years ago, studios could build their movies around movie stars, but Hollywood has done a crappy job of replenishing its cosmos of leading men and women. Instead, they’ve leaned into comic book adaptations, where costumed heroes are the draw, not the actors behind the mask. That makes it difficult to produce other kinds of movies, such as dramas and rom-coms, that rely on personalities, not superpowers, to attract crowds.

Paramount’s leaders want to invest in a new generation of talent. They’re developing “The Saint,” a remake of the Roger Moore spy series that will star “Bridgerton’s” Regé-Jean Page. And for the “Gladiator” sequel, the studio is teaming veteran actor Denzel Washington with the 27-year-old Paul Mescal, recently Oscar nominated for his work in the indie “Aftersun.” To see if Mescal could fill out a toga, Cercek and Ireland watched his performance in the West End revival of “A Streetcar Named Desire.” “He played Stanley, and there are several moments where he takes off his shirt and it was electric,” Cercek says. “The ladies in the audience were very vocal, and we were like, ‘I think we’ve found our guy.’”

Even a star’s ability to make audiences swoon isn’t always enough to guarantee that a movie will make money. “Babylon,” an epic about the silent movie era, collapsed at the box office when Paramount released it last December, despite starring Brad Pitt, while “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” will lose money even though Chris Pine led the ensemble. Robbins isn’t abandoning the idea of more “Dungeons & Dragons,” though if there’s a sequel, he says, “We’ve got to figure out a way to make it for less.” As for “Babylon,” that one hurt because Robbins believes in Damien Chazelle, the Oscar-winning “La La Land” director who made the movie. “It broke my soul to have ‘Babylon’ not do well,” Robbins admits when we meet for the first time in April. “There’s people who loved the movie and there’s people who hated the movie, but you can’t deny it’s an ambitious fucking movie.”

Costs may be rising while the box office is contracting, but Robbins sees areas of opportunity. He’s overhauled Paramount’s animation division, raiding Nickelodeon’s vault and jettisoning projects that he didn’t think were commercial. “Under the Boardwalk,” a movie about hermit crabs on the Jersey Shore that predated Robbins, will debut on Paramount+, not in theaters. “We’re not going to release an expensive original animated movie and just pray people will come,” he says.

Instead, the studio’s upcoming animated releases will center on familiar properties such as “SpongeBob SquarePants” and “Avatar: The Last Airbender,” which Robbins thinks will appeal to millennials who grew up with the shows.

“It’s not about Disney and Pixar anymore,” he says, noting that recent Disney films like “Elemental” and “Lightyear” have stumbled at the box office. “People are looking for animated movies that are irreverent and have a comedic point of view.”

Robbins and his team believe that they can successfully navigate an uncertain future for movies. But even the smartest executives or the most brilliant filmmakers and brightest stars may not be skilled enough to overcome the cultural and economic forces that are reshaping entertainment. Movies are enormous investments of time and resources, and with younger consumers growing more passionate about video games or social media, can the film business remain viable? Hollywood is already in a defensive crouch, with media conglomerates that once bragged about the billions they were shelling out for “content” now signaling they want to cut costs or sell assets. Analysts believe all this tumult could spark a fresh wave of mergers. So what would that mean for a company like Paramount Global and the studio Robbins runs?

“There’s a whole lot of uncertainty,” says Peter Newman, head of NYU Tisch School of the Arts’ MFA/MBA program. “Will more of these media companies combine? Or does someone like an Apple decide they want to take over a traditional studio?”

Back at “CBS Mornings,” Robbins looks like a man in dire need of an espresso as he rubs his eyes. He’s been out until 2 a.m., attending a lavish New York premiere for “Mission: Impossible” and then partying with the cast after the event. It must, I think, have required him to be always “on,” emanating the “exciting version” of himself that Robbins once advised Thompson to be while pitching studio executives.

Of course, Robbins is now on the other side of the desk, and that changes things. And part of his job requires saying no— rejecting a story idea or, say, informing Tom Cruise that he can’t shoot a sequence with a submarine (in the latter case, the answer was yes, because the latest “Mission: Impossible” kicks off with one).

“Delivering tough news is part of the job,” Robbins admits. “It’s about having a hard conversation. And hopefully, at the end of that talk, you still have mutual respect, or you find a way to come to a compromise. It’s not a fun part of the job.”

“Last night,” Robbins says, his mouth inching into a grin. “Last night was way more fun.”

These interviews were conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike began.

Tom Cruise checks in to promote latest Mission Impossible movie

Hollywood star Tom Cruise is visiting Korea for the 11th time and said Thursday that he went to grab Korean barbeque as soon as he arrived the night before.Since his first visit to Korea in 1994 for “Interview with the Vampire,” Cruise has paid a visit almost every time his film premiered, such as in 2001 for “Vanilla Sky,"" 2008 for “Valkyrie,"" 2013 for “Jack Reacher” and last year for “Top Gun: Maverick."" Cruise said he is so comfortable and well-received in the country that this time, he ""got to meet and talk to people on the streets of Seoul."" He also added that he is ""happy to be able to show Korea to his colleagues here today.""Cruise is not just here to enjoy Korean food with his friends, but to promote his latest film “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One."" On Thursday, he attended the press conference for the film at Lotte Cinema's World Tower branch in Songpa District, southern Seoul and talked about how traveling around the world and making movies is his dream come true.“I was very passionate about storytelling from when I was very young,” Cruise said. “I wanted to make movies and travel the world from when I was four, and started auditioning at age 18.”Reflecting on his three-decade-long career, Cruise said that a passion for acting was what made him the globally famous actor today. “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” tells the story of Ethan Hunt, played by Cruise, who must track down a new weapon that threatens to wipe out all of humanity.“I lived in hotels and worked part-time jobs to get through auditions,” Cruise said. “One of those jobs was sweeping snow off of someone’s lawn. I didn’t study acting professionally and had my share of struggles. A strong passion for acting was what made me the actor I am today.”Cruise famously does all of his stunts in his action films, and “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” was no exception. In this new installment, there is one particular scene where Cruise falls off of a cliff in Norway that is exceptional.“When I do those stunts, I focus on the story first,” Cruise said. “I talk to the director and see what needs to be done to elevate the story that we are trying to tell. I drive my own planes, helicopters and jets, and do my own parachuting too. For this movie, I trained again for parachuting and biking.”Watching Cruise do his own stunts is terrifying yet at the same time gratifying to watch, said Simon Pegg, who has played the supporting character Benji Dunn in the Mission: Impossible series.“Preparations for the stunts are done extensively, so it’s not something you’d call reckless – nevertheless it’s terrifying to watch Tom do all those things,” Pegg said during the press conference. “We film with the best experts from around the world and train with the best for the most amazing shots. Of course, unexpected things happen during filming and everyone is on edge, but I have got some great shots of Tom performing stunts on my phone that I will post on social media once the film is out.”“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” opens in local theaters on July 12.BY LIM JEONG-WON [lim.jeongwon@joongang.co.kr]",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8va29yZWFqb29uZ2FuZ2RhaWx5LmpvaW5zLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2LzI5L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbW92aWVzL0tvcmVhLVRvbS1DcnVpc2UtTWlzc2lvbi1JbXBvc3NpYmxlLzIwMjMwNjI5MTcyNjQwODM4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

""Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part 1"" -- ★ ★ ★

In his seventh impossible mission on the silver screen, Tom Cruise saves Hollywood (again), saves the world (again, maybe) and continues to save his career (again and again).

Still basking in the jet fumes of his massive hit sequel ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" Cruise returns as constantly running IMF Agent Ethan Hunt in ""Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part 1,"" a globe-trotting thriller loaded with the spectacular and innovative action set pieces that eluded ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.""

Both ""Dial"" and ""Dead"" cover familiar genre turf with obligatory motorcycle chases, car races, ridiculous gunfights and tough guys going mano-a-mano atop of yet another cliched speeding train. But here, the expected disaster sequence pulls off one of the movies' greatest nail-biters of all-time, an intricate, elaborately detailed succession of death-defying stunts executed with such precision and tension that viewers might pass out from forgetting to breathe.

That 61-year-old Cruise continues to perform as many of his own stunts as possible (or allowable) anchors the flimsy verisimilitude of these outlandish events. (Well, maybe not the ludicrous idea that IMF agents can convincingly pass themselves off as other people simply by wearing computer-generated masks that magically give them the exact same bodies, vocal qualities and gestures of their targets.)

In the story, two high-tech combination keys disappear from a Russian submarine that has been attacked and turned into a mass crypt on the ocean floor.

The search is on to find the keys so humankind can be saved from a timely, high-tech boogeyman: a rogue form of artificial intelligence called ""the Entity."" This Entity can access information contained in the world's computer banks. It can manipulate financial markets, military defense systems, private mail, the news media!

In case audiences can't understand the stakes, a high-ranking official exclaims, ""Whoever controls the Entity, controls the truth!""

With reams of self-consciously contrived, bluntly expository dialogue like this, director Christopher McQuarrie and co-writer Erik Jendresen clearly are not focused on winning the Best Screenplay Oscar.

Instead, their perfunctory words in a convoluted plot connect a series of highly energized, crowd-pleasing cinematic constructs not dependent on internal logic or plausibility. ""Fallout,"" the 2018 ""Mission: Impossible"" entry (also directed by McQuarrie) features a much stronger balance of drama and thrills. But no one will complain here.

The ever-cool Esai Morales plays Gabriel, a smooth terrorist and supposed old acquaintance bent on finding those keys before Hunt and his techie assistants (Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn and Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell) do.

Series newcomer Hayley Atwell plays Grace, a British thief so good that Ethan tries to recruit her for his IMF boss Kittridge (Henry Czerny, returning from the first ""Mission"" movie).

Hunt needs all the help he can muster to deal with a shrewd, merciless killer named Paris (Pom Klementieff) -- the same name used by Leonard Nimoy in the CBS TV series ""Mission: Impossible"" from the 1960s.

Lalo Schifrin's iconic TV theme periodically surfaces in Scottish composer Lorne Balfe's percussive score, dressing up a movie so visually incendiary that you leave the theater wondering ""How can Cruise and McQuarrie possibly top this?""

2023-06-26 18:43:55+00:00,Mission: Impossible 7 Director Explains Why Dead Reckoning Is 2 Movies,"Christopher McQuarrie, writer/director of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, explains why the film is split into two movies.","Christopher McQuarrie, writer/director of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, has explained why the movie will be divided into two parts.

The upcoming action spy film Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One will star Tom Cruise as his iconic character IMF Agent Ethan Hunt. It will feature many of the characters we know and love for their most dangerous mission yet. This movie will only be the first part of a two-part film where the IMF team faces off against Gabriel (Esai Morales).

“I knew I wanted to expand the cast, and I knew I wanted to give each one of those characters more to do, so I knew the movie was going to be bigger and longer than Fallout,” McQuarrie told Collider.

“And at which point I said, ‘Why are we fighting this? Why are we going to try to jam this into two hours? Let’s just break it in half and make it two movies.’ That really was the rationale behind it being a two-part movie. It just it wasn’t just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie,” he continued.

When is the next Mission: Impossible movie coming out?

Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One premieres in theatres on July 12, 2023, by Paramount Pictures.

The cast includes many familiar faces such as Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, and Henry Czerny reprises his role from the original Mission: Impossible. New cast members include Hayley Atwell, Esai Morales, Shea Whigham, Pom Klementieff, and Cary Elwes.

“Ethan Hunt and the IMF team must track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity if it falls into the wrong hands,” reads the official synopsis. “With control of the future and the fate of the world at stake, a deadly race around the globe begins. Confronted by a mysterious, all-powerful enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than the mission — not even the lives of those he cares about most.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbWluZ3Nvb24ubmV0L21vdmllcy9uZXdzLzEyOTk4NzgtbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLTctZGlyZWN0b3ItZXhwbGFpbnMtd2h5LWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLWlzLTItbW92aWVz0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29taW5nc29vbi5uZXQvbW92aWVzL25ld3MvMTI5OTg3OC1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtNy1kaXJlY3Rvci1leHBsYWlucy13aHktZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctaXMtMi1tb3ZpZXM_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-06-21 14:00:00+00:00,How Did Edgar Wright Help Change 'Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One' For The Better?,Have you ever attended a friends and family screening?,"When you're making a movie at any level, there comes a time when you have a cut and need some new eyes. This happens with the little indie you shoot and with the giant blockbuster sequel that's about to take over the summer.

Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise have been an incredible team when it comes to Mission: Impossiblemovies. They've created hits that continue to escalate an exciting franchise and push the boundaries of what we've seen at the movies.

Still, these two are not isolated geniuses. In fact, their collaboration with cast and crew is part of what makes these movies so special. When it came time to screen a cut of the movie, they showcased it to some friends, including writer/director Edgar Wright.

McQuarrie did an interview in the new issue of Total Film magazine where he relayed the story. He said, ""Edgar came to one of the later screenings [of the film], and asked one simple question about a specific sound–kind of an audio cue–and I thought I’d addressed that note. It was so obvious to me. But it wasn’t obvious to Edgar. And when I asked the audience, it wasn’t obvious to them either. Nobody thought to bring it up until Edgar did. And that changed the entire movie. It changed the entire movie for the better. You just need honesty and clarity and awareness. No one person, Tom [Cruise] included, can really sit there, and look at the movie 24 hours a day, objectively. Tom and I will just look one another in the eye, and say, 'Do we want to change this? Or is this what we prefer?'""

I think this speaks to the confidence McQuarrie has as a filmmaker. He's not afraid to take notes and to tirelessly work to make things better. I think the lesson that we all should get from this is to open ourselves up to that kind of commentary.

In addition, it speaks to the power of a direct note. Wright didn't just say, ""I don't get it."" Instead, he offered a specific instance of what he thought needed to change that helped propel the work.

Let me know what you think in the comments.

The Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One stars were photographed leaving a screening of the action movie separately at the Dolby Screening Room London Soho on Wednesday evening.

Both Cruise, 60, and Atwell, 41, looked stylish for the event, with the latter rocking a monochrome ensemble consisting of a white button-up shirt tucked into a pair of cream-colored trousers. She finished the look in a pair of orange peep-toe heeled sandals and carried a large red bag.

Cruise, meanwhile, looked both casual and sleek in all black, wearing a polo shirt, slacks and matching shoes. The actor topped off the look not entirely unlike the way his Top Gun: Maverick character might — in a pair of aviator sunglasses — as he smiled and waved to photographers.

While Cruise and Atwell have been seen out and about together multiple times over the years — including at the 2021 Wimbledon women's singles finals, alongside costar Pom Klementieff — a source told PEOPLE in December 2020 that they were not dating.

""Not true at all!"" the insider said.

Cruise hasn't dated anyone publicly since his 2012 divorce from Katie Holmes. The two welcomed daughter Suri, now 17, during their six-year marriage.

The actor was also married to Nicole Kidman from 1990 to 2001. They share daughter Isabella, 30, and son Connor, 28.

Cruise reprises his role as Ethan Hunt in the upcoming seventh Mission: Impossible movie, the franchise's first entry since 2018.

In the film, Hunt and his team are tasked with tracking down ""a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity before it falls into the wrong hands,"" according to an official synopsis for the film. Additionally, the plot promises ""a deadly race around the globe"" throughout the movie.

""Confronted by a mysterious, all-powerful enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than his mission — not even the lives of those he cares about most,"" the synopsis adds.

Cruise, Atwell and Klementieff, 37, are joined by a large ensemble cast for the latest Mission: Impossible film, including Ving Rhames, Esai Morales, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Mariela Garriga, Henry Czerny, Shea Whigham, Greg Tarzan Davis, Charles Parnell, Frederick Schmidt, Cary Elwes, Mark Gatiss, Indira Varma and Rob Delaney.

The movie is written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, a longtime collaborator of Cruise's, who directed the previous two Mission: Impossible films and wrote Top Gun: Maverick. McQuarrie, 54, is also making the upcoming sequel Dead Reckoning Part Two, which is expected in 2024.

,'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One' - Hayley Atwell,"Moviefone speaks to Hayley Atwell about 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One' and Tom Cruise. He is dedicated, a professional, and a gentleman.","‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,’ which was co-written and directed by Academy Award-winner Christopher McQuarrie ('The Usual Suspects,' ‘Mission: Impossible – Fallout’), opens in theaters on July 12th and is the latest installment of the ‘Mission: Impossible’ franchise.

What is the plot of ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’?

In ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,’ Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team embark on their most dangerous mission yet: To track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity before it falls into the wrong hands. With control of the future and the fate of the world at stake, and dark forces from Ethan's past closing in, a deadly race around the globe begins. Confronted by a mysterious, all-powerful enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than his mission – not even the lives of those he cares about most.

Who is in the cast of ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’?

Tom Cruise ('Top Gun') as Ethan Hunt, Hayley Atwell (Captain America: The First Avenger') as Grace, Esai Morales ('Master Gardener') as Gabriel, Ving Rhames ('Pulp Fiction') as Luther Stickell, Simon Pegg ('Hot Fuzz') as Benji Dunn, Rebecca Ferguson ('Dune') as Ilsa Faust, Vanessa Kirby ('Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw') as Alanna Mitsopolis, Pom Klementieff (‘Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3’) as Paris, Henry Czerny ('Scream VI') as Eugene Kittridge, Shea Whigham ('Joker') as Jasper Briggs, and Greg Tarzan Davis ('Top Gun: Maverick') as Degas.

Moviefone recently had the pleasure of speaking with Hayley Atwell about her work on ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,’ her mysterious character, her relationship to Ethan Hunt, and working with Tom Cruise.

You can read the full interview below or click on the video player above to watch our interviews with Pegg, Hayley Atwell, Vanessa Kirby, Pom Klementieff, Shea Whigham, Greg Tarzan, and director Christopher McQuarrie.

Moviefone: To begin with, can you talk about your mysterious characters, Grace, and your approach to playing her?

Hayley Atwell: Great question. Because it was a collaborative one over a long period of time. There was a lot of time in filming where she didn't even have a name. So, we tried lots of different things and different kinds of qualities to see what kind of thing felt most exciting on camera and, Tom and McQuarrie, I'd met several times before. McQuarrie had come to see me in a play in London's West End about 10 years ago and said, ""I want to work with you. I just don't know what the character is yet."" So when I came in for the screen test for this, they both said, ""We're looking for the actor we want to work with and then we will build the character with them in real time as filming commences."" So I loved that. I found that very liberating because I trusted that I was in safe hands with them. They were not going to allow me to do something that ended up on a screen that I wouldn't be proud of. So it allowed me the freedom to try lots of different things. So, the five months of preparation of stunt training for it was also about studying films from ‘Paper Moon’ to ‘The Sting’ to ‘Broadcast News’ to ‘What's Up Doc?,’ to try and find a levity that I could take and build with Tom as a new kind of chemistry than you've seen before in this kind of franchise.

MF: What is Tom Cruise like as a scene partner, especially in the action sequences?

HA: He is dedicated, he is a consummate professional, and a gentleman. He's very concerned with people's health and safety as well as his own. So, he's meticulous in his preparation for any stunt that he does, which also means that his resources or an education for myself coming into this is so huge that I too felt like I could learn so much about what's going to keep me safe, what's going to keep me dynamic and mobile, and able to do a stunt several times from different directions, different takes with different performance notes, and how to sustain that over months and months. You feel very much in safe hands because he's like a boxing coach that's on your side. When you do something or land something, he is your greatest fan because he wants to see everyone around him thrive, which means his encouragement is contagious. I think everyone says that about him, that have worked with him in this way close up with him in terms of stunts that there's no one quite like him.

MF: Finally, can you talk about Grace’s alliance with Ethan Hunt?

HA: That was so fun to discover. It's going, how are they cat and mouse or sort of sibling, how can they play with each other but in a way that didn't seem to be too calculating? That they both needed each other in some way or both looking for the same thing, and how could they get their own needs met, but by using each other? To work with him in scenes, he's incredibly present. Anything that you offer up, he will have seen it, taken it on board and reacted to it. He's very alive to the other actor. Even when he's off-screen and he's standing behind the monitor or the camera and it's your closeup, he is right there with you giving exactly the same amount of energy and focus as he would be if he was in front of the camera too. So, you have a scene partner, you have someone that's in your corner and someone that's opposite you, that's holding the space for you to the best work you can possibly do in that moment.

2023-07-14 21:30:18+00:00,No One Can Needle Tom Cruise Like Henry Czerny Can,"A star of the first “Mission: Impossible” film makes a welcome return 25 years later, bringing a delight in exposition that few actors can match.","“Mission: Impossible” is a franchise known for its big-budget, death-defying stunts, but sometimes there’s nothing more suspenseful than a good old-fashioned, face-to-face staredown.

That’s what the actor Henry Czerny brought to the first film in the series, released in 1996. As the officious Kittridge, director of the Impossible Mission Force, Czerny sneered at star Tom Cruise with such delicious condescension that their tetchy tête-à-tête in a Prague restaurant — shot at deliriously canted angles by the director Brian De Palma — became one of the film’s highlights.

Six films later, in the new “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” Kittridge has returned to sneer and spar some more with Cruise’s superagent, Ethan Hunt. Christopher McQuarrie, who directed the last three movies in the franchise, said he had long intended to have Czerny return to the fold.

“Henry’s Kittridge is not a villain,” McQuarrie wrote in an email. “He’s not even an antagonist. He’s a worthy adversary, walking the line between a guy we love to hate and want to like. He’s a bastard, but he’s a bastard we want on our side.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTQvbW92aWVzL2hlbnJ5LWN6ZXJueS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUta2l0dHJpZGdlLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

,Pom Klementieff Is the Most Likable Villain Ever in 'Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part 1',"Pom Klementieff speaks to 'InStyle' about Paris, her character in the newest installment of 'Mission: Impossible,' currently in theaters.","This interview took place before SAG-AFTRA strike activity.

While villains typically tend to be unanimously reviled characters — from Scar and Pennywise to Hannibal Lecter — the best actors find a way to make even the worst bad guys likable. In the seventh installment of Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible series (Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, currently in theaters), Pom Klementieff plays the fiery Paris, whose sole directive is to sabotage everybody else’s efforts (by all means necessary — and we mean all means) to retrieve a key that unlocks an all-powerful artificial intelligence nicknamed ""The Entity.""

And yet, the audience can’t help but fall in love with the rambunctious French firecracker, whose grunge-inspired outfits, platinum bob haircut, and intricate fight sequences make her the film’s resident cool girl.

“She's on a path of destruction and you're still rooting for her, like, ‘I love this girl,’” Klementieff tells InStyle about her character, a Harley Quinn type who drops roundhouse kicks in plaid miniskirts and runs a military-grade tank through the tourist-filled streets of Venice, Italy, with a maniacal smile on her face. Her character is a woman of few words, relying on action and fashion to speak for her, which Klementieff calls “freeing, because it was just all about behavior and all about just movement.”

She also says she drew inspiration from iconic silent characters of the past, played by some of the greats like Clint Eastwood, Japanese comedian Takeshi Kitano, and French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo.

“But the beauty of it is that when she speaks, everyone listens,” she adds.

Klementieff is no stranger to the genre, with a stacked résumé that includes high-action projects like Thunder Force (starring Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer) and Guardians of the Galaxy. Although Paris is a far cry from her beloved Marvel character Mantis, likability is something Klementieff excels at bringing to her characters both good and bad. She also appeared as Haeng-Bok in Spike Lee's 2013 mystery Old Boy alongside Josh Brolin, Elizabeth Olsen, Samuel L. Jackson, and Michael Imperioli.

Paramount Pictures

The latest installment of the wildly popular franchise — which also marks the series’s second-to-last volume (Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part 2 is slated to hit theaters next summer) — delivers all the makings of the espionage franchise that loyal fans have come to know and love: action-packed scenes, over-the-top fight sequences, and the thrill of taking on things that are, well, impossible.

“It was such an honor to join this franchise,” Klementieff gushes. “I've been a fan since I was a child, so I saw all the other movies so many times. It was just incredible to get to work on this movie and to work with Tom and McQ [director Christopher McQuarrie].”

But this film is also sure to draw in a whole new generation with its reinvented approach to the spy movie, which weaves together modern technological advancements (we’re talking an AI entity that has the world’s superpowers clamoring for control), moments of comedic relief, a whirlwind romance, and a set of new characters, like Paris and Grace (played by fellow Marvel alumnae Hayley Atwell). Even moviegoers who aren’t die-hard Mission: Impossible fans can prepare to be captivated for the film’s entire 2 hour and 43 minute run, which seems long, but is stacked with exciting content from start to finish. In other words, it’s quite literally a movie that feels like a real movie (thank you, Harry Styles, for these profound words) and deserves to be experienced in theaters.

“There's some lightness to it and there's drama. Sometimes it's rom-com, sometimes it's film noir. It's so many things at the same time,” Klementieff says, explaining the film’s diverse landscape. “I think this movie is so rich, it feels like several movies at the same time in several genres at the same time. There's also some very charming and funny moments, right? With Ethan [Cruise] and Grace. as well, you see a comedy that you haven't seen in the previous movies.”

Paramount Pictures

Unlike the majority of action movies, M:I 7 taps into current style trends for costuming (something for the fashion girlies) — especially when it comes to Paris and her punk-rock aesthetic. Klementieff worked with the movie’s costume designer, Jill Taylor, to develop something “fresh and different” for the rebellious character while also keeping her “grounded” during her intense action sequences.

“We're going to bring something different for this character, some vibe that was a little bit more punk, which is cool to do, because I think it was really different from the other female characters from the franchise,” she says. “What was very important to me is that she was not wearing heels because she knows she's going to fight, so wearing heels just doesn't make sense.”

During one scene, Paris, along with everyone else searching for the coveted key, attends a party at a nightclub in Venice. Paris’s makeup look, which included a drawn-on white mask with a black teardrop, was influenced by the 17th century pantomime staple Pierrot from the commedia dell'arte.

“It's kind of cute but creepy at the same time,” she said describing Paris’s less-than-incognito ensemble. “[There’s] something melancholic about the teardrop that really connected with the character, that made sense.”

Paramount Pictures

Klementieff admits that her style IRL isn’t that entirely different from her latest on-screen persona. ”My style is eclectic and it depends on the mood, but for everyday, of course it's going to be more relaxed and more chill. But, for events I like to have fun and just take risks.”

The actress arrived at the movie’s Seoul, South Korea, premiere in a head-turning strapless leather gown made from motorcycle gear (found by her stylist Jonathan Huguet), which she paired with platform boots and a slicked-back hairdo that included nail embellishments, executed by her hairstylist Marcia Lee.

“It's fun to do things that are unexpected, go from one vibe to another, and not take it too seriously,” she says. “Life is short and you want to have a good time too, so I do that with fashion, as well.”

Much of the narrative following “Dead Reckoning’s” opening weekend of $54.7 million is that it wasn’t performing up to spec, though one has to remember that it made another $23.8 million before the weekend for a five-day opening of $78.5 million. Although the weekend part was lower than the $61.2 million the previous “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” opened with in 2018, it was more than every previous “Mission: Impossible” movie.

The problem that “Dead Reckoning” knew it was going to face was the combination of Greta Gerwig‘s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer,” which were always going to grab all the screens (particular IMAX) just a week after it opened. Almost no one saw the real-life drama “Sound of Freedom” coming out of nowhere and making so much money either.

“Dead Reckoning” received similar rave reviews as “Fallout” and a great “A” CinemaScore, but the summer can be a particularly busy time with many movies demanding screens. A force like “Barbenheimer” is something so rare that not even Cruise could have expected the impact it might have on the latest “Mission: Impossible” installment.

Here’s an overview of the whole franchise, which has now been going on for 27 years:

2023 – “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One”

Opening: $54.7 million; Domestic Gross: $154.1 million

2018 – “Mission: Impossible – Fallout”

Opening: $61.2 million; Domestic Gross: $220.2 million

2015 – “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation”

Opening: $55.5 million; Domestic Gross: $195 million

2011 – “Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol”

Opening: $12.8 million (IMAX only); Domestic Gross: $209.4 million

2006 – “Mission: Impossible III”

Opening: $47.7 million; Domestic Gross: $133.5 million

2000 – “Mission: Impossible 2”

Opening: $57.8 million; Domestic Gross: $215.4 million

1996 – “Mission: Impossible”

Opening: $45.4 million; Domestic Gross: $181 million

In general, the franchise has had quite a few highs and lows and “Dead Reckoning Part One” is still faring better than 2006’s “Mission: Impossible III,” a notable misfire for the franchise that may have suffered from Cruise’s private life exploits that was overshadowing his work as an actor during that period. 2011’s “Ghost Protocol,” directed by Brad Bird (“The Incredibles”), took a different approach by being released in over 450 IMAX theaters before expanding wider, and it also was released in December that year, so it was able to get a nice bump from the holidays. (It was also arguably one of the best movies in the franchise until “Fallout.”)

The problem is that the latest installment isn’t getting any of the theaters it has lost since opening back as “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” hold strong and even gain theaters, so it might not even catch up to the original movie’s $181 million, which doesn’t account for over 25 years of ticket price inflation.

So what can Paramount do to make sure next year’s “Dead Reckoning Part Two” doesn’t follow a similar path as “The Matrix Revolutions” in 2003 or 2015’s “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2,” which ended their respective franchises on a low note. “The Matrix” did try to revive the franchise with 2021’s “The Matrix Resurrections,” which was anything but, and this November, the prequel “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbird & Snakes” will try to see if that franchise can be revived without any of the original cast.

The ongoing writers’ and actors’ strikes makes it difficult to know if director Christopher McQuarrie and his team might be able to get “Dead Reckoning Part Two” finished sooner, maybe to strike while the iron is still hot or take advantage of the bump in business that movies get over the holidays, a la “Ghost Protocol.”

2023-06-14 00:20:12+00:00,Mission: Impossible 8 Shooting Is Not Disrupted by WGA Strike,"Paramount insiders say the Hollywood writers' strike will not affect shooting on the ""Mission Impossible"" sequel starring Tom Cruise.","Contrary to media reports, “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part Two” is not being delayed by the ongoing writers’ strike and shooting is set to resume later this summer after Tom Cruise and the film’s cast complete their promotional work for “Part One,” according to insiders with knowledge of the production.

Last week, Empire Magazine published an interview with “Dead Reckoning” director Christopher McQuarrie, where he acknowledged the delays and hurdles that his team’s work on the two “M:I” films have had to face.

“Behind each tsunami is another tsunami,” McQuarrie said. “It’s unrelenting. We live in a state of 24-hour tsunami awareness. That’s just what we do.”

While McQuarrie was not quoted as referring to specific delays such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the article says that “obstacles for this double production have already included a pandemic and now encompass an ongoing writer’s strike.”

This led other film media outlets like Slash Film to report that the writers’ strike has extended the current pause on shooting, which studio insiders say is inaccurate as McQuarrie and Cruise are taking a scheduled break from production to do interviews for “Dead Reckoning: Part One” and to attend that film’s premiere in Rome next weekend.

The WGA strike, which is currently in its seventh week, has led to shutdowns on countless film and TV productions while on-location permits for shooting in the Los Angeles area have dwindled to zero over the past month. But some high-profile productions have pushed on, including Marvel Studios’ “Deadpool 3,” which is still shooting in Canada ahead of a rescheduled release date in May 2024.

It is still possible, however, that the productions that are still shooting during the WGA strike may also be forced to pause if the actors union SAG-AFTRA fails to reach a deal on a new labor contract during its ongoing talks with the studio labor representatives at the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. SAG-AFTRA’s members have overwhelmingly authorized their leaders to order a strike if it cannot reach an agreement after the current labor contract expires on June 30.

In addition to forcing a pause on all productions, an actors’ strike would also affect the publicity campaigns for several late summer films and for the upcoming Emmy nominations, which will be announced on July 12.

“Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” will not be one of the films affected, as Paramount insiders say the film’s press junkets and premiere had been scheduled before the June 30 SAG-AFTRA deadline for several months for unrelated reasons. But other July and August films, such as Warner Bros.’ “Barbie” and “Blue Beetle,” as well as Universal’s Christopher Nolan film “Oppenheimer,” may have their publicity plans disrupted.

,Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' Costars Reveal His 'Generous' Gifts: From Shark Trips to Skydiving (Exclusive),"Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' costars Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff reveal the wildest gifts the actor-producer has given them, including everything from shark-diving expeditions to skydiving lessons","Tom Cruise famously sends his friends in Hollywood a coconut cake every year for the holidays — but for his Mission: Impossible costars, the actor-producer is even more generous.

Cruise, 61, is back in theaters with the seventh installment in the hit action series, Dead Reckoning Part One, with many returning cast members (Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Vanessa Kirby and Rebecca Ferguson) as well as new ones (including Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff).



As one of the franchise's newcomers, Atwell, 41, tells PEOPLE she was especially touched by her costar's ""very thoughtful gifts.""

""I'm on my fourth Christmas cake,"" the English actress says. ""I've had a few birthdays as well because we've been working together nearly, what, over three and a half years now.""

For one of her special days, she recalls receiving ""a beautiful amphora"" from Cruise, which she describes as ""this beautiful old clay pot, which is a natural filtering system.""

""I'm like, 'It's a water jug. Nice,' "" she continues. ""And then you taste it and you compare it to normal filtered water or tap water, and it's really light and kind of creamy. It's just a different level of clarity. It's beautiful.""

Klementieff, who goes head-to-head with Cruise in Dead Reckoning as one of the film's villains, is also a fan of the coconut cake.

""I freeze it and then I eat it frozen, so I just eat it every day,"" she shares. ""That's what I did last year for Christmas. I started it when I got it and I ate it every morning, so I had a sugar rush. It was not good for my health, but it was delicious.""

Another gift from Cruise was even more addictive.

""Another beautiful gift that was so thoughtful is that I wanted to skydive with him and also the stunt team, but they said that I needed to get my license,"" recalls the French actress, 37. ""So when I wrapped the movie, he gifted me, as my wrap gift, the lessons of learning how to skydive.""

""He found a teacher for me and I learned how to skydive and I got my license and we even did jumps together. And now I'm addicted, so that's my new thing now!""

Despite having worked with Cruise since the third Mission: Impossible film in 2006, Pegg, 53, continues to be surprised with what his costar does for his cast.

""He's always very keen to show his appreciation,"" says Pegg. ""I think he's so used to being the focus of attention, it's naturally his instinct to kind of reflect everything back. And he's always incredibly sort of generous in terms of his gratitude to us and how he thanks us and how he lets us know that we're valued.""

One way Cruise showed his appreciation for his crew, as Pegg recalls, was taking the team shark-diving on a break from filming.

""We were filming somewhere near some coastal waters where there were sharks and we had the afternoon off and we all jumped,"" says Pegg.

""It's such a Tom Cruise thing. We've been filming in a helicopter and he flew us in the helicopter to this place where you could go into a cage and feed sharks. It was one of those days that we got to the end of the day and we were like, 'That was a real Tom Cruise kind of day.' ""

Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is in theaters now.

7/6/2023 13:29,An already full-tilt movie franchise turns it up a notch in ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning’,"There are, as a rule, only so many places you can go as an action movie after leaving Tom Cruise clinging to the side of an Airbus A400M and flinging him out a cargo plane at 25,000 feet.","NEW YORK (AP) — There are, as a rule, only so many places you can go as an action movie after leaving Tom Cruise clinging to the side of an Airbus A400M and flinging him out a cargo plane at 25,000 feet.
But in the kinetic, headlong world of “Mission: Impossible,” the pressure to keep upping the ante — like the films’ always-running star — never stops.
“Every time we finish a movie, the first thing Tom says to me is: We can do better,” says Christopher McQuarrie.
McQuarrie, the writer-director of 2015’s “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation” and the 2018 franchise high point, “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” was working with Cruise on “Top Gun: Maverick ” (which McQuarrie co-wrote and co-produced) when they started talking about their ambitions for the next iteration of “Mission: Impossible.”
Their plan was to make not one but two sequels: Back-to-back blockbusters that would feature even bigger stunts — Cruise envisioned a motorcycle jump-slash-skydive — and a massive train sequence that McQuarrie pined to realize. The heady experience on “Maverick,” a pop-culture juggernaut that grossed nearly $1.5 billion worldwide, only further ratcheted up their aspirations.
“‘Top Gun: Maverick’ really taught us a lot in terms of character dynamics and the emotional payoff of the movie overall,” McQuarrie said in a recent interview. “To be making movies on this scale, you really need to think about, more than anything, the feeling that the audience is left with going away.”
A year after the box-office dominance of “Maverick”, McQuarrie and Cruise are back with another high-flying spectacle of daring-do. Similar to “Maverick,” “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is a state-of-the-art action extravaganza of old-school technique, made with star power, practical effects and stunt work designed to prompt exclamations of “He did what?”
It was also their most nearly impossible mission yet – and not just because of, according to Paramount Pictures, the 500 skydives and 13,000 motocross jumps that Cruise did in preparation for his climactic stunt. “Dead Reckoning” was just days away from beginning production in Venice when COVID-19 cases began skyrocketing in Italy, an early epicenter.
“Mission: Impossible” was one of the first major productions to be shut down by the pandemic. Months later, Cruise and “Dead Reckoning” – a globe-trotting $290 million movie so logistically complicated that it prompted controversy for initial plans to blow up a century-old bridge in Poland – led an industry-wide effort to get movie business back on line during the pandemic. An already high-stress production became even more tense. In December 2020, an audio recording leaked of Cruise yelling at two crew members for not obeying COVID-19 protocols.
“We are the gold standard,” Cruise said in the recording. “They’re back there in Hollywood making movies right now because of us. Because they believe in us and what we’re doing.”
There were numerous delays and pivots along the way. But McQuarrie says he never thought “Dead Reckoning” wouldn’t get finished.
“We just kept moving forward because if you stopped, if you were trying to find the end of the tunnel, you would just reach a place of such despair,” says McQuarrie.
McQuarrie and Cruise first collaborated on the 2008 Hitler assassination drama “Valkyrie.” McQuarrie, the famed screenwriter of “The Usual Suspects,” was then in proverbial movie jail for his poorly received directorial debut, “The Way of the Gun.”
“When I met Tom in 2006, I had not directed a film in seven years,” McQuarrie says. “I wouldn’t direct a film again for another five years. I had really put any ambitions I had to direct out of my mind. I certainly never imagined being considered an action director, let alone directing four action films.”
“In ‘Dead Reckoning,’ you’re seeing the ghosts of all the movies that I was never allowed to make,” he adds.
Unlikely as it may be, McQuarrie (who’s also directing the already-shooting part two of “Dead Reckoning”) has emerged as the architect of one of the most visceral action franchises.
In “Dead Reckoning,” Ethan Hunt faces off with a rogue artificial intelligence, a prescient and well-suited antagonist for a movie universe built less on CGI than practical effects. McQuarrie told Cruise he wanted to wanted to take “Mission: Impossible” beyond the threat of a terrorist getting hold of a deadly weapon.
“Another lesson we took from ‘Top Gun’ was: What is the audience bringing to the movie? ‘Top Gun’ came out of Cold War anxieties. I said to Tom in 2019: What anxiety is it now?” says McQuarrie. “What we didn’t anticipate was the level to which it would accelerate.”
In “Mission: Impossible,” what you see is rarely what you get. Hunt and his team of spies are masters of deception. At the same time, McQuarrie and his crew, including cinematographer Fraser Taggart, go to considerable lengths to ensure what the audience is watching feels authentic and immersive.
“The challenge normally is hiding the fact that it’s not the actor doing it,” says McQuarrie. “And here the reverse is the case. You’re actually going to great lengths to show that Tom’s actually doing it.”
Taggart, who had shot the helicopter sequence in “Fallout,” says he’s never worked with an actor so resistant to stunt doubles as Cruise — even in the most innocuous of shots.
“Tom won’t do it. He just refuses, even to the extent of you’ll do an insert of hand,” says Taggart. “It can’t be anyone else doing it, as you would on other projects. Tom will insist that’s him.”
Just as “Top Gun: Maverick” strove to get as many cameras in the cockpits of fighter jets, the set-pieces of “Mission: Impossible” are choreographed to get cameras as close to Cruise and the cast — here that includes Hayley Atwell, Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby — as possible.
For Taggart, that meant getting his head around often dizzying challenges like shooting a scene involving a train moving 60 miles an hour through a mountainous Scandinavian landscape with uncontrollable weather conditions. He didn’t want just fixed cameras.
“So now we’ve got to get a whole camera crew involved and some lighting and we’ll probably end up with 10 people strapped to the top of a train carriage, including an old-fashioned physical camera up there,” says Taggart. “You think: Can we actually get 10 people on top of the train doing 60 miles an hour? That’s the challenge because you’d really like all of your crew and actors to survive the shoot.”
In another sequence with characters inside a falling train cabin, they suspended a camera operator, Chunky Richmond, on stunt wires so he was hanging alongside the actors. For a nighttime chase through the byzantine passageways of Venice — for Taggart one of the most complex tasks of “Dead Reckoning” because of the inherent darkness of the city — they knocked on doors everywhere along the route to get cameras on terraces and pointed out windows.
For an elaborate car chase in Rome, Taggart used robotic arms on vehicles that were mounted but could also move.
“We always try technology but we usually break it all,” he says.
McQuarrie has said he likes to write “Mission: Impossible” movies as they’re shooting; “Fallout” began without just an outline. Production on “Part Two” has been paused during the promotion on “Part One,” and it’s unclear if the ongoing writers strike would threaten production on the sequel. But for McQuarrie and company, the only way to make a “Mission: Impossible” movie is full tilt.
“Everything we’re doing is by the seat of our pants,” says McQuarrie. “We want you to come to the movie and experience it the same way the characters are, which is: I don’t know what’s going to happen next.”

,Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One movie review (2023),"A ridiculously good time, the kind of movie that people should see large and loud.","At the airport, Ethan also crosses paths with a pickpocket named Grace (Hayley Atwell), who gets stuck in the middle of all of this world-changing insanity, along with a few agents trying to hunt down the rogue Ethan and are played by a wonderfully exasperated Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis. A silent assassin, memorably sketched by Pom Klementieff, is also essential to a few action scenes. And Vanessa Kirby returns as the arms dealer White Widow, and, well, if the ensemble has a weakness, it's Kirby's kind of lost performance. She has never quite been able to convey ""power player"" in these films as she should.
But that doesn't matter because people aren't here for the White Widow's backstory. They want to see Tom Cruise run. The image most people associate with “Mission: Impossible” is probably Mr. Cruise stretching those legs and swinging those arms. He does that more than once here, but it seems like the momentum of that image was the artistic force behind this entire film. “Dead Reckoning Part One” prioritizes movement—trains, cars, Ethan’s legs. It’s an action film that's about speed and urgency, something that has been so lost in the era of CGI’s diminished stakes. Runaway trains will always have more inherent visceral power than waves of animated bad guys, and McQuarrie knows how to use it sparingly to make an action film that both feels modern and old-fashioned at the same time. These films don’t over-rely on CGI, ensuring we know that it’s really Mr. Cruise jumping off that motorcycle. When punches connect, bodies fly, and cars crash into each other—we feel it instead of just passively observing it. The action here is so wonderfully choreographed that only “John Wick: Chapter 4” compares for the best in the genre this year.
There’s also something fascinating thematically here about a movie star battling A.I. and questioning the purpose of his job. Blockbusters have been cautionary tech tales for generations but think about the meta aspect of a spy movie in which the world could collapse if the espionage game is overtaken by a sentient computer that stars an actor who has been at the center of controversy regarding his own deepfakes. There’s also a definite edge to the plotting here that plays into the actor’s age in that Ethan is forced to answer questions about what matters to him regarding his very unusual work/life balance, a reflection of what a performer like Cruise must face as he reaches the end of an action movie rope that’s been much longer than anyone could have even optimistically expected. Cruise may or may not intend that reading—although I suspect he does—but it adds another layer to the action.
Of course, the most important thing is this: “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is just incredibly fun. It feels half its length and contains enough memorable action sequences for some entire franchises. Will Cruise save the blockbuster experience again? Maybe. And he might do it again next summer too.

2023-07-06 08:00:14+00:00,Mission: Impossible director on why Dead Reckoning is split into two parts,Christopher McQuarrie tells GamesRadar+ and Total Film about the franchise-first decision to go for a two-parter,"Mission: Impossible director Christopher McQuarrie has explained why Dead Reckoning is split into two parts – and it goes back to the series’ fifth instalment in 2015.
""That takes us all the way back to Rogue Nation where we discovered an emotional component to the story that we really weren’t expecting. Stuff that we thought was going to be pure exposition actually turned out to be the emotional core of the story,"" McQuarrie tells GamesRadar+ and Total Film in London.
""When we went to make Fallout, I wanted to build upon that. That led to a longer movie, because you couldn’t scrimp on the action at the expense of emotion.""
From there, the Mission: Impossible films grew larger and larger – with Ethan Hunt’s personal tale being weaved into bigger and better action set-pieces. For that to happen, concessions had to be made.
""So, we were fighting to get that movie down to two hours and 20 minutes,"" McQuarrie recalls. ""I knew I wanted to expand further in terms of the cast and in terms of the emotion of the story. I knew automatically that meant we were going to have a longer movie.""
Which brings us to Dead Reckoning. While McQuarrie admits he was expecting a neater divide (""I was hoping to make a four-hour epic and just cut it in half and everybody could have a two-hour movie, but here we are,"" he tells us), the decision to cut the movie into two parts for the first time ever in the franchise gave the narrative space to operate – without having to compromise.
As McQuarrie explains: ""Instead of fighting the running time, I said let’s just cut the movie in half and give ourselves the breathing room to tell that story – not anticipating, then, that Part One would expand to the size that it did, the epic scale that it did.""

Warning! This post spoils many plot details of Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.
There are thrills aplenty scattered across the sprawling run time of Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, the latest spy-movie blockbuster from Tom Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie. But the plus-size sequel saves the best for last. Its final act is a crescendo of interlocking dilemmas, syncing the ominous tick of multiple clocks, assembling most of the key players on one racing train.
Grace (Hayley Atwell), the self-serving thief Cruise’s Ethan Hunt has identified as a possible new recruit for the Impossible Mission Force, spends most of this closing stretch in disguise: Fitted with one of the franchise’s signature hyperrealistic masks, she sits down for a tense transaction that’s really a moment of moral choice for the character. Will she help Hunt or just help herself? As this dramatic predicament plays out, Cruise’s superspy faces the daunting challenge of getting aboard the train, which is mysteriously picking up speed — an obstacle he eventually overcomes in typical Cruisian fashion, with an insanely dangerous stunt involving a mountain, a motorcycle, and a parachute. These two separate tracks eventually converge for an action-packed finale, building to a derailment that becomes a breath-stealing vertical climb through a compartment dangling over a ravine.
The train, after all, is such a perfect metaphor for Mission: Impossible.
It’s what Mission: Impossible does best: entwining related problems and then escalating them to a fever pitch of queasy suspense. Yet for some viewers, the excitement of this final, multipart set piece will be tinged with something more, an unmistakable déjà vu. The attempted sale of a hotly sought MacGuffin. A slowly loading progress bar. A fight sequence on top of a train racing treacherously into dark tunnels. If all this doesn’t trigger memory banks, the appearance of an old company adversary, Kittridge (Henry Czerny), on the passenger manifest should do the trick. Seven entries in, Mission: Impossible has glanced backwards to the 1996 movie that started it all, which also happened to end with a blast of locomotive action.
This finale, an echo of the series’ first, is the most explicit example of how Dead Reckoning communes with Brian De Palma’s franchise-launching original. The agent is, once again, on the run from his own agency, the manhunt led by the very first thorn in his side, Kittridge, who apparently learned nothing in the 25-plus years since Hunt soaked him in aquarium water. Grace’s expertise at pickpocketing mirrors the sleight of hand Ethan performed in Mission: Impossible. And flashbacks, featuring the phantom of a young Cruise, serve as a reminder of how much time has passed since the actor first stepped into his signature role.
You could call this a version of the trendy legacy-sequel nostalgia trips offered on the regular these days — including, of course, by Cruise himself last summer, in Top Gun: Maverick. But McQuarrie, the star’s returning behind-the-camera handler, isn’t just interested in the easy dopamine hit of a cameo or callback. He’s also in dialogue with the values of that first movie — its Clinton-era upgrade of classic espionage tropes — and maybe wondering aloud how they connect to the franchise’s improbably robust present. The stunts may have gotten bigger over the years, along with the budgets (inflated, one presumes, by the insurance Paramount has to secure every time Cruise gets a new idea about how to risk life and limb for our amusement). But the foundation of this series is still subterfuge and skullduggery, a vision of sneaky spycraft that’s outlived the Cold War that spawned it.
The franchise really comes full circle, though, aboard that runaway train, twisting itself into a figure-eight of old-new exhilaration. It’s almost surprising it’s taken the series this long to set another elaborate action sequence on the rails. The train, after all, is such a perfect metaphor for Mission: Impossible. It hurtles forward in one direction, like the movies themselves do, and like their unstoppable main character Ethan, the “physical manifestation of destiny.” It has separate compartments — an expression of the way McQuarrie and his predecessors structure these first-rate entertainments around discrete set pieces, or how each movie works on its own, even as it connects to what comes before and after. And trains have a certain old-fashioned romance and cool, which is what Mission: Impossible usually strives for.
Just as Dead Reckoning pays tribute to an influential ancestor, so did De Palma’s original forge ties to the cinematic past. Shifting the action to a train evoked a whole library of older thrillers: The Manchurian Candidate, and From Russia With Love, and of course North by Northwest, Hitchcock’s ultimate toy, an adventure whose mechanics can be seen in just about every rollicking roller-coaster ride Hollywood has made since. When Cruise, in one of the first M:I’s (and by extension, the franchise’s) defining images, is blown forward across the train by a fireball, his face framed close with the wreckage behind him, it’s as if De Palma is racing the past and future together: We were seeing, in that iconic moment, a rich lineage of spy thrillers collide with the explosive demolition derby of the ’90s blockbuster machine.
Dead Reckoning extends that homage further. At this point, the first M:I is an ancient touchstone, too — just another station on this franchise’s winding path through genre-movie history. But there’s a special poignancy to seeing the series wave to its younger self in passing, and an extra chill of recognition to the familiar, now ageless sight of Tom Cruise hanging over the chasm of doom. Superimposed on his climactic climb through a wrecked train is his first tussle with gravity — the moment when he dangled over a computer in an Apple-white room, defeat calling from below. Cruise is still hanging all these years later. It’s a pleasure to stare into the abyss with him.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctdGFrZXMtbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWJhY2stdG8tdGhlLXN0YXJ0Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,10 Spoiler Facts We Learned About Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One From Christopher McQuarrie,Christopher McQuarrie sat down with Empire for an epic spoiler conversation on his latest mission with Tom Cruise. Here are some gems we learned along the way.,"Contains spoilers for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One
It’s finally here. No, not just Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One – though its arrival once again confirms that Tom Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie are an absolute force to be reckoned with when delivering breath-taking cinematic spectacle. No, the completion of (part one of) another Mission also means another dizzying deep-dive into the dramatic making of a Hollywood blockbuster like no other on the Empire Spoiler Special Podcast. Following in the footsteps of Fallout and Rogue Nation, McQuarrie – or, McQ – sat down with Empire’s Chris Hewitt for a lengthy, no-holds-barred, spoiler-filled conversation about his experiences of making Dead Reckoning Part One – from its lengthy production through COVID, to its narrative twists and turns, astonishing action sequences, and excised material.
The first part of that epic (and ongoing) spoiler conversation has now dropped on the Spoiler Special Podcast feed – a three-and-a-half-hour exploration of Ethan Hunt’s latest thunderous IMF mission. And believe us, this is only the beginning. There are hundreds of gems to be found in this instalment alone – be sure to listen to the full episode for a deeply incisive, honest, in-depth conversation. And here you’ll find just a smattering of the diamonds McQuarrie dropped along the way – delve into 10 fascinating facts from that first part here.
1) The actors ‘risked their lives’ for a sequence that was cut from the film
One of the most astonishing things about McQuarrie’s Mission movies is that, for all the incredible stuff you see on screen, you know that there was equally impressive stuff that hit the cutting room floor. Take, for instance, an entire sequence from the thunderous steam-train finale that was edited out. “It was supposed to be something we did with a resettable rig where everything could be very predictable, and nothing we did worked, and ultimately the actors had to risk their lives and do it practically,” McQ explains.
But when test notes came back with feedback on the pace and length of the movie, it had to go. “The train was a little bit like the car chase in Jack Reacher, where we couldn’t understand why we kept getting this note about length,” he says. “Finally, there was one shot in the Jack Reacher chase I pulled out, and it taught me everything about shooting action.” He had a sense a similar thing was affecting Dead Reckoning Part One’s finale. “With the train, I kept thinking, ‘Is this the shot?’ And we kept pulling and we kept getting the note, and eventually we identified what it was.” It was a shame to lose it, though. “The work that went into what was holding back the sequence was extraordinary – it was days, and it was a struggle, and it was very, very risky,” he says. “We took it out, and the scene just sang.”
2) The flashback Marie could have been a de-aged Julia Roberts
A key sequence in Dead Reckoning Part One has Ethan looking back to his own past, before the first Mission: Impossible film – in which Esai Morales’ villain Gabriel kills Ethan’s partner Marie. The role (originally due to be a bigger part of Part One, and set to be expanded in Part Two) went to Mariela Garriga. But, given the time-period there were thoughts of casting a de-aged actor appropriate to the late-‘80s, early-‘90s time period. “We started thinking, ‘What would it look like if Tony Scott had shot this, and who would it have been? Who was the ingénue, who was the breakout star in 1989?’,” recalls McQ. “And right around then was Mystic Pizza, and I was like, ‘Oh my god, Julia Roberts – a then pre-Pretty Woman Julia Roberts.” Ultimately, it didn’t come to pass – not only because of the expense (and distraction) of de-ageing everybody for the scene, but because McQ would have “to somehow convince Julia Roberts to come in and be this small role at the beginning of this story”.
3) Young Ethan Hunt’s file photo is Mission: Impossible-era Cruise with Days Of Thunder hair
Speaking of Ethan’s past, this time we see the picture in his IMF folder, hinting at some kind of troubled history that he’s been working to erase. And the image of the young Hunt was a simple combination of two historic Tom Cruise eras. “It just so happens Tom has one sensational photo of him looking directly at the camera and that happens to be in his dossier in Mission: Impossible,” says McQuarrie. It needed some tweaks, though, to fit the 1989 time period. “I had found a picture of Tom from Days Of Thunder, with that hair. And we took his Days Of Thunder hair and stuck it on his Mission: Impossible dossier photo, put some vertical lines behind it and created it in about 15 minutes. We made young Ethan Hunt without any kind of de-aging or special effects or anything else.” Mission complete.
4) McQ fixed the movie after a ‘brutal’ post-screening email
As ever, test screenings and bits of feedback from filmmaker friends were a vital part of bringing Dead Reckoning Part One together – with the likes of Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, and Alfonso Cuaron offering notes. And one bit of feedback, from a friend of editor Eddie Hamilton, was especially helpful for not holding back. “He wrote the most brutal email I've ever read – not hostile, but just both barrels right to the chin, things that were not working for him in the movie, things that were really bugging him, and that he was not a big franchise action movie guy to begin with. He was not a huge fan of Mission: Impossible,” explains McQ. “And I woke up that morning and read this email and just wanted to vomit. It was so brutal.” As it turned out, it was exactly what the filmmaker needed to hear – and led to the removal of scenes, some involving Marie, that were holding the film back. “It just forced me to look at things through another person's eyes, which is really what the value of testing is,” he says. As for Eddie’s friend? He got his credit. “He's in the special thanks.”
5) Tom Cruise decided where the title sequence should drop
There’s a specific thrill when a film drops its title sequence surprisingly late into the runtime – almost at the point you’d assumed it wouldn’t even have any opening credits. Dead Reckoning Part One holds out 28 minutes before running that iconic theme music, as decreed by Cruise – who knew exactly when the sequence would work best.
It felt odd coming straight from the submarine opener, and played a bit subdued when positioned after the desert shootout too. “You went into the credits with a very down note,” says McQ. “[Tom] just said, ‘The credits are in the wrong place’. He looked at the whole first act and said, ‘The first act is great, it’s the best it’s ever been, you’ve fixed all those issues. But the credits are in the wrong place – they’ve got to go after the scene with Kittridge.’” As skeptical as McQuarrie was, when he tried it the filmmaker agreed with Cruise that it was “just the right place” for them to be. “So they go 28 minutes into the movie – who cares! It’s the right vibe. You go into the credits with a win. He was right.”
6) McQ and Cruise lived together while shooting during COVID
How’s this for a sitcom set-up: one of the biggest movie stars in the world and his long-time director, holed up together while shooting a behemoth action blockbuster. While you can imagine the laugh-track and slap-bass now, that’s exactly the position Cruise and McQuarrie found themselves in here, thanks to the intervention of COVID. “We’d wake up in the morning, we'd meet in the living room for breakfast, we'd talk about the movie, we would drive to work in the car together, we’d work all day, we’d drive back to the apartment together at the end of the night. And that was our life.” It’s the material the 22-minute network formula was made for.
7) Tom Cruise was adamant not to end Part One on a cliffhanger
Dead Reckoning is one of several summer movies in 2023 that’s actually just ‘Part One’ of a bigger story – see also Across The Spider-Verse, and Fast X. And while there’s plenty more story to come in Part Two of Mission, it was Cruise who was particularly adamant that this film have its own ending. “Tom was fixated day and night on the ending of the movie,” says McQuarrie. “He had great anxiety about the end of the film – that the end of a ‘Part One’ was going to be a cliffhanger, and that cliffhangers by their very nature tend to be deeply, deeply unsatisfying. You feel like the camera just stopped and you're not there. You're not given that release. ‘I have to wait a year? I have to wait two years, for whatever that release is?’” Cue the reveal that Ethan has the key (Mission: Accomplished!), and that Part Two will be all about heading to the very thing it unlocks. “He said, ‘We gotta give them that sense of completion, and yet the story has to feel like it needs a place to go.’”
8) The title Dead Reckoning didn’t arrive until after Part Two had started shooting
One of the benefits, though, of having a Part Two? It gave them time to, er, come up with the title of the film. It wasn’t until work began on the next film that Dead Reckoning emerged as the title for Ethan’s latest mission. “Somewhere along the line, the title of this movie – which did not exist until we were in Africa shooting Part Two – became both fitting for the story, and the making of the story itself,” muses McQuarrie. “We were quite literally navigating via dead reckoning for most of the production, it's the most aptly named [movie].”
9) Tom Cruise is basically like Gromit in The Wrong Trousers
You wouldn’t necessarily expect to compare Tom Cruise – the most American of all-American action stars – to Aardman’s Lancashire legends Wallace and Gromit. And yet, the process of making a Mission movie – where the action literally comes first, and the rest of the film is built around it, with Ethan’s arc coming into place right at the very end – brings to mind an iconic scene from The Wrong Trousers. “[Tom] is a train in front of which you must lay track,” McQ explains. “There's that little GIF of Wallace And Gromit, and Gromit is putting the track in front of the train. That's very much what making Mission: Impossible is.” Did he watch a version of The Wrong Trousers where the train crashes down a ravine?
10) Cruise and McQ are still working on ‘The Gnarly Movie’
Back in 2020, in an interview looking back on Jack Reacher, McQuarrie told Empire that he and Cruise had been looking to make a hard-R movie together with “a very un-Tom character” in it. And while the two-part Mission has taken precedent, they’re still planning to make that together, under the codename ‘The Gnarly Movie’. “There's a movie that Cruise and I are talking about doing next or in some probable next, that Erik [Jendresen, writer] and I developed together – what has been referred to on the internet as ‘The Gnarly Movie’,” McQ teases. “It's that movie that they're all asking for, and that we want to do.” First, they just have to get through the gnarliest movie of all: Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtcGlyZW9ubGluZS5jb20vbW92aWVzL2ZlYXR1cmVzL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1wYXJ0LW9uZS0xMC1zcG9pbGVyLWZhY3RzLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW1jcXVhcnJpZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,'Mission: Impossible 7' Director Says He Considered Casting Julia Roberts for Flashback Sequence with Tom Cruise,Christopher McQuarrie said on Empire's 'Spoiler Special Film' podcast that he briefly considered whether he could recruit Julia Roberts to act alongside Tom Cruise for a flashback sequence in the latest 'Mission: Impossible' movie that would have required both stars to be digitally de-aged,"Christopher McQuarrie says he briefly considered casting a major actress for what would have been a small role in the latest Mission: Impossible movie.
As Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One filmmaker McQuarrie, 54, appeared on Empire magazine's Spoiler Special Film podcast recently, the director recalled that as the production considered de-aging Tom Cruise for a flashback sequence in the new movie, he briefly wondered whether he could book Julia Roberts to act alongside the actor.
""I said, 'OK, if I were doing this sequence, it would be Tom in, say, 1989,' "" McQuarrie recalled on the podcast, noting that he believed the late Tony Scott (True Romance) would have been a good pick to direct a late '80s Mission: Impossible movie.
""We looked at Days of Thunder and we looked at the style of it, and we started thinking what would it look like if Tony Scott had shot this, and who would it have been?"" the director continued, according to a /Film transcription of the podcast appearance. ""I looked back at who was the ingenue, who was the breakout star in 1989? And right around then was Mystic Pizza. And I was like, 'Oh my God. Julia Roberts, a then-pre-Pretty Woman Julia Roberts, as this young woman.' ""
McQuarrie continued to note that he decided he only would want to de-age Cruise for the flashback if he could ""somehow convince Julia Roberts to come in and be this small role at the beginning of this story.""

As McQuarrie considered his options, though, he decided seeking out digital de-aging — and the fees the production would incur from casting an A-list star like Roberts — were not worth what he envisioned for the scene.
""As you're conceptually going through it, you're like, 'Now all anybody's going to be doing is thinking about the de-aging of Julia Roberts, and Esai [Morales], and Tom, and Henry Czerny,' "" the director said. ""And then I got the bill for de-aging those people before their salaries were even factored into it.""

""And if you put two of them in a shot together, or three of them in a shot together, it would have been as expensive as the train by the time we were done,"" he added.
Rather than spend time and money on de-aging all the actors involved, the latest Mission: Impossible movie kept the flashback sequence simple and avoided showing the faces of 61-year-old Cruise or 60-year-old Morales, who plays a villain named Gabriel. Mariela Garriga plays Marie in those flashbacks; she's expected to return in the role for the film's forthcoming sequel Dead Reckoning Part Two.

While the new film did not include any digital de-aging of its principal star, Cruise did perform what McQuarrie once called ""by far the most dangerous stunt we've ever done"" with his now-famous motorbike jump off a cliff for the movie.
Aside from Cruise, Morales and Garriga, the latest entry in Cruise's decades-long action series also stars Hayley Atwell, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Pom Klementieff, Ving Rhames, Henry Czerny, Shea Whigham, Greg Tarzan Davis, Charles Parnell, Frederick Schmidt, Cary Elwes, Mark Gatiss, Indira Varma and Rob Delaney.

,Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie break down the 'most dangerous' stunt they've done for latest 'M:I' film,"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" star Tom Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie talk about the ""most dangerous"" stunt they've ever done for this latest installment.","Tom Cruise is breaking down his latest death-defying Mission: Impossible stunt.
Over the course of seven films, the series has become known for its dangerous and elaborate stunts almost always performed by Cruise himself. And his latest mission, Dead Reckoning Part One, is no exception, with stunts like speed flying — a more dangerous form of skydiving — and car chases through the cobblestone streets of Italy on the docket. Plus, the biggest stunt of them all that includes a motorcycle jump off a cliff into a base jump.
On Wednesday's Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One “Creating the Impossible” special, Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie went deep on the film’s signature sequence, which begins with Cruise driving a motorcycle down a giant ramp and right off the edge over a cliff, where he lets go of the bike as it falls to a crash and he eventually opens a parachute.
“I’ve wanted to do it since I was a little kid,” Cruise said of the jump. “It all comes down to one thing: the audience.”
The stunt was filmed in Norway where a group of engineers and technicians constructed a ramp on the top of a mountain that took “a number of months” to build, according to McQuarrie, with all of the supplies being brought in by helicopter. The director pointed out that if Cruise was to be blown off course while trying to drive down the ramp it would result in a terrible accident. Once he’s off the bike and doing the base jump, Cruise is surrounded by what’s described as a “rock bowl” where he has to deploy his parachute and try to move himself away from the mountain.
“We’ve been working on this for years,” Cruise said. “You train and drill over and over and over and over again. With a jump like this, the challenge is finding the cameras, it’s the amount of preparation, and then it’s the weather.”
Luckily the weather definitely cooperated on shoot day. After parachuting out of a helicopter near the end of the ramp to get his body warmed up and to gauge the elements, Cruise went on to perform the actual stunt six straight times in one day, with each attempt just as breathtaking as the one before it.
All of the previous six films in the franchise have a signature stunt or two that helps set them apart from the others. And for Dead Reckoning Part One, the hope is that this is that stunt. That is, until they start filming Dead Reckoning Part Two.
“This is far and away the most dangerous thing we’ve ever attempted,” McQuarrie said. “The only thing that scares me more is what we have planned for Mission 8.”

Dead Reckoning Part One will clock in at two hours and 36 minutes without credits, pushing it past 2018's Mission: Impossible Fallout, which had a runtime of two hours and 27 minutes. Speaking to IGN's Stella Chung at the film's junket in Rome, McQuarrie explained that it had ""nothing to do with a trend of any kind,"" referring to the amount of two-part movies hitting theaters these days.
""We knew the movie was so big, and rather than trying to contain it all in a two-hour movie, we just very early on said, 'let's break this up into two parts,' "" he explains. ""A lot of characters, a lot of action. It was a very big story that needed two parts.""
McQuarrie told Collider, meanwhile, that he always knew the next chapter would be bigger than Fallout.
""Fallout really grew because of all the character and emotion we were putting into the story,"" he said. ""I knew I wanted to expand the cast, and I knew I wanted to give each one of those characters more to do, so I knew the movie was going to be bigger and longer than Fallout.
""At which point I said, 'Why are we fighting this? Why are we going to try to jam this into two hours? Let's just break it in half and make it two movies,'"" he added, reflecting on the decision. ""That really was the rationale behind it being a two-part movie. It wasn't just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie.""
McQuarrie said Paramount Pictures were receptive to the idea of splitting the story across two films, but production of the two titles didn't come without its challenges. There was a lot of planning, coordinating, and managing that needed time on the logistics side of the shoot.
""It was complicated by the fact that certain things in Part Two required stopping Part One to shoot them, whether it was because of weather or actor availability,"" he said. ""And so, with all the other challenges that were confronting this movie while we were making it, there was the challenge of stopping in the middle, not even knowing what the full movie was, and trying to predict what it was in the second film.""
The two films were supposed to be filmed back-to-back, but the production faced multiple setbacks amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Principal photography on Part Two eventually kicked off in March 2022, though McQuarrie admits they still haven't figured out the ending.
""I don't know what the ending of Part Two is, so I couldn't tell you,"" he confessed to Collider. ""I'm not being evasive. I could tell you that I know what the end of Part Two is, but I can't guarantee that that will be the ending when we get there. Tom and I never obsess about executing the plan. We always have a direction, we always have a place we're going.
""In retrospect, it sounds as though what we do is just flying by the seat of our pants and making it up as we go along,"" he continued. ""That's not an accurate description. You are definitely flying in a direction, you're definitely prepared. You couldn't be that cavalier without somebody getting seriously physically hurt. These things are planned within an inch of their life. Along the way, we see a shiny object and go for it.""
There's a lot of hype building for Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, as the two-part movie will reportedly serve as a send-off for Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt. Part One will hit theaters on July 12, 2023, with Part Two expected to follow less than a year later, on June 28, 2024.

,Fast And Loose: Inside Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’s Wild Production Journey,Empire gets the lowdown on the making of the new Mission.,"On Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, Tom Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie found themselves battling all sorts of elements, responding by making things up as they went. This, they tell Empire, was their most insane production yet. Strap in…
Read an extract of our exclusive Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One feature from our July 2023 issue below, or see the full piece here.
Christopher McQuarrie had a problem. He was well into production on Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One when the news came through. Berlin was no longer going to let him use an under-construction airport he had earmarked. “We were going to shoot this airport sequence and a foot chase there,” he says. “And then Berlin said, ‘No, we’re too close to the opening of the airport.’” Suddenly, the foot chase was off. The airport sequence was out. Another punch to roll with, on a production packed with them.
“Then Abu Dhabi said, ‘Well, we have an airport,’” recalls McQuarrie. “And we said, ‘Great — instead of a foot chase, let’s do something in the desert.’” Which is how McQuarrie, his star/ producer/creative partner Tom Cruise, and the cast and crew of Dead Reckoning wound up in Abu Dhabi, making what McQuarrie calls “the hardest, hardest sequence I have ever had to work out. Now, it’s a sequence of which we are immensely, immensely proud. But it’s like everything else on Mission — if I’d known going in, I would never have done it.”
Welcome to the McQuarrie/Cruise method of making movies, honed over the course of their decade-and-change working relationship, through the likes of Valkyrie (co-written by McQuarrie), Jack Reacher (which he wrote and directed) and Top Gun: Maverick (which he co-wrote and produced), plus a whole host of Mission: Impossibles. It is loose, it is improvisational (except for the big stunts, which are planned with military precision), it is not for studios that are faint of heart or shallow of pocket. It is, says Tom Cruise, “never boring”, the star unleashing that laugh. “Never boring. It’s constantly evolving. You have to be pretty unrelenting, and honest with yourself about stories and structure and what’s working and what’s not. I don’t want to stop until it’s right.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbXBpcmVvbmxpbmUuY29tL21vdmllcy9mZWF0dXJlcy9mYXN0LWFuZC1sb29zZS1pbnNpZGUtbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLXBhcnQtb25lcy13aWxkLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tam91cm5leS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Tom Cruise has always been known to do his own stunts, especially when it comes to the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise.
Each movie follows Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and a team of agents who are tasked with stopping nefarious forces, and this usually involves a death-defying act by Cruise.
And ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" sees the star undertake his biggest stunt yet in a literal leap of faith, as he rides a motorcycle off the edge of a cliff before opening his parachute and gliding down to reach a train.
Speaking to Insider on the red carpet at the film's UK premiere on Thursday, director Christopher McQuarrie said that the ambitious stunt was something of a surprise to the film's studio, Paramount, as well as fans.

""I don't think they really knew what they were getting involved in until we sent it to them, which is kind of the case,"" the director added.
""We talk about things in the abstract, but until they really see it… I don't think any of us fully grasped what we were getting ourselves into until we did it.""
It's a jaw-dropping moment, and Paramount previously released a making-of featurette detailing what went into the stunt, with Cruise practicing the scene numerous times before production started in Norway.
But the stunt sets the bar quite high for 2024's ""Dead Reckoning Part Two."" However, Cruise told Insider that he's more than up for the challenge.

""I'm always pushing. I just remember, every time they say, 'Can you top it? Can you not top it?' we're always pushing,"" the actor told Insider. ""Every film I do, whatever genre it's in, I want to make it as entertaining as possible for that audience. I know I can do things better.""
Cruise's costar Pom Klementieff also spoke to Insider about the challenge of filming a brutal fight scene in a confined alleyway in Venice.

""It was incredible. It was very hard to shoot because it was very challenging and very narrow. So we had to think of where to place the camera, where to place the lighting, because we were also shooting at night time, you know?"" said the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" star.
Klementieff added: ""But at the same time, there was not a better person to do it with than Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie, so I felt really lucky to be able to do that.""

,Tom Cruise Is Doing an 'Oppenheimer' and 'Barbie' Double Feature Too: 'Doesn't Get More Explosive',"Tom Cruise shared his excitement over seeing 'Oppenheimer' and 'Barbie,' which both hit theaters days after 'Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One'","Tom Cruise is showing some love for his fellow filmmakers and actors!
The Hollywood icon — gearing up for the theatrical release of his own film Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One next month — took a break from his action-packed schedule to tweet about some of the summer movies he is looking forward to watching himself.
Among the films he praised were Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the long-awaited sequel starring Harrison Ford as the legendary adventurer (out Friday), the atomic-bomb biographical thriller Oppenheimer starring Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer and Barbie with Margot Robbie as the famous toy. The latter two films will be released on the same day: July 21.
“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,” Cruise wrote alongside photos of himself and his Dead Reckoning — Part One director Christopher McQuarrie in front of each of the films' respective posters.
""Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indy and one of the most iconic characters in history,"" added the actor, 60, ""I love a double feature, and it doesn't get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Oppenheimer and Barbie.”

Cruise was recently on the red carpet in Rome for the world premiere of Dead Reckoning Part One, as previously reported by PEOPLE, praising how people of different cultures ""all join together to enjoy cinema"" as he gave a speech from the city's famous Spanish Steps, according to Variety.
""It’s something that I grew up with, that made me and inspired me to dream and want to travel the world,"" Cruise said. “My goal since I was little was to make movies and travel. And not just be a tourist, but work in that world and understand their culture.""
""Through my movies, I’ve been able to have that because everyone here has allowed me to entertain them. It’s a privilege that I have never taken for granted,"" he continued in his speech, highlighting the importance of seeing movies in theaters. ""It’s my passion to entertain you, and I will always fight for big theaters and that kind of experience for everyone.”
Cruise joined his longtime collaborator McQuarrie, 54, along with some of the stars of the film, such as Esai Morales, Simon Pegg, Frederick Schmidt, Shea Whigham, Mariela Garriga, Rebecca Ferguson, Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff and Vanessa Kirby.

The star complimented his collaboration with McQuarrie — who directed the last two Mission: Impossible movies and also wrote 2022's Top Gun: Maverick — during his speech, saying the director has ""had a hand in every single film I’ve made over the past 16 years.""
""He is my creative brother and an exceptional human being,” Cruise said.
McQuarrie and Cruise have been working together since at least 2008, when McQuarrie wrote the script for Valkyrie. He later directed Cruise for the first time in 2012’s Jack Reacher, which led to him becoming the Mission: Impossible franchise’s director starting with 2015’s Rogue Nation.
In the series’ newest entry since 2018, Dead Reckoning Part One follows Cruise's Ethan Hunt and his IMF team racing their most perilous mission: to stop a horrifying weapon that endangers mankind before it’s too late.

2023-07-01 06:19:18+00:00,‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Director Says Filming Tom Cruise Speed-Flying Left Crew in “Absolute Terror”,Tom Cruise and the 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One' crew are detailing what went into filming the Speed-flying scene for the movie.,"Tom Cruise and the Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One crew are detailing what went into filming the epic speed-flying scene for the upcoming film.
The actor, known for going above and beyond with his stunts, learned how to do what director Christopher McQuarrie called “one of the most dangerous sports in the world” for the latest installment in the action franchise.
In a recent video giving a behind-the-scenes look at the movie, the filmmaker explained that since “there are no limits” with Cruise, “we become a little bit more adventurous every time.” And this time, the actor decided to do a “sport very few people on this planet do.”
McQuarrie went on to explain that “while it may look similar, speed-flying is not skydiving. Skydiving is fairly predictable. Speed-flying is incredibly unpredictable.”
The air sport, similar to paragliding, combines elements of parachute swooping to allow people to fly at high speeds down mountainsides while maintaining close to the slope.
In the footage, Cruise said of the stunt, “We’re gonna do spirals, and we’re landing at an incredibly high speed, over 80 kilometers an hour.”
McQuarrie added that although it “looks quite beautiful” when “flying very close to rocks,” the crew was in “absolute terror” behind the cameras. Especially since they had to overcome several technical challenges, including coming up with the stunt and finding the most dynastic way to shoot it.
The director called the whole experience a “one-of-a-kind adventure.”
Taking on death-defying stunts is nothing new to Cruise. Throughout his decades-long career, the actor has continued to look for ways to push the limits for projects, from scaling a skyscraper to dangling on the outside of a plane. In his upcoming film, he also drove a motorcycle off a cliff and parachuted to safety on the first day of filming.

2023-07-14 21:00:00+00:00,‘Mission: Impossible’ Star Simon Pegg Says Tom Cruise and Director Christopher McQuarrie Are Like ‘Lennon and McCartney’,‘Mission: Impossible’ star Simon Pegg describes the collaboration between Tom Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie as like ‘Lennon and McCartney.’,"Since “Mission: Impossible III” in 2006, Simon Pegg has been part of the core ensemble of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, playing hacker and sometime field agent Benji Dunn opposite its stalwart star Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. Pegg was never going to be the actor risking life and limb on screen — “it’s Benji’s job to be the one that actually says, ‘what the fuck are we doing here?’,” he observes. But over five installments of the indefatigable series, his character has shifted from questioning what Ethan is doing in the moment to believing absolutely in why he’s doing it, thanks in no small part to the writing and directing of Christopher McQuarrie.
McQuarrie came onto “Ghost Protocol” as “a sort of master plumber to re-wriggle the pipes,” as Pegg characterizes it, and since became the series’ ongoing co-architect with Cruise. Their partnership reaches its peak, even if by all indications it’s far from over, with “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” half of an operatic culmination of narrative seeds planted since Cruise first played Hunt back in 1996. In a conversation with Variety, Pegg discusses what makes McQuarrie’s creativity so special, and his collaboration with Cruise et al so unique; he also talks about new details he discovered about Benji, explored the challenges of being self-referential in a franchise like this without undermining emotional stakes, and hinted at what is yet to come as he and the rest of the filmmaking team move on to “Dead Reckoning — Part Two.”
You said that you have shot at least some of these films without a script. What’s actually there for you to work from, and what’s the minimum you need to play a scene without knowing what it might connect to?
We never don’t have a script on the day of the shoot. The scene will have been written and we would’ve had time to learn it. It’s more that McQ allows the locations we go to, the characters, the actors he’s working with to help him tell the story. He’ll let the story be revealed to him by, say, looking at the streets of Rome or the canals of Venice. It’s a fly by the seat of your pants way of working because you’ve got a rough idea of what you’re doing, but the minutia doesn’t come sometimes until the last minute. But that’s part of being an actor, and I enjoy that — we have a mission impossible going alongside our “Mission: Impossible.” But it’s never not in McQ’s head. He’s not making it up as he goes along, by any means. It’s all in there, you just have to tease it out gradually.
Thinking about the screenwriting that you’ve done, Chris’ shares in common this very Swiss-watch precision to it.
When Edgar Wright and I write together, we have the Swiss watch laid out on a table and we do it like that. McQ throws it in the air and assembles it as it falls, and it’s extremely educating for me as a filmmaker because it’s the antithesis of what Edgar and I do. That’s partly because a lot of Edgar’s transitions are very precise so we need to know how each scene starts and finishes so that it can dovetail into the next one. But it certainly made me aware that sometimes you can allow the situation to help inform the narrative or the dialogue. That’s because McQ is a master problem solver. If you give him a broken script, he just rubs his hands with glee. If you give him a blank page, he’ll scratch his head. It’s just how he is — he’s an absolute master.
It seems like it shouldn’t be quite so unique for Christopher to be able to deliver these smart, muscular, inventive action movies, but it is. What is it that makes McQ’s creativity so singular?
I think in Tom, he’s just found such a perfect creative partner, someone who can facilitate that way of working, can allow him to practice this extreme method of filmmaking. I remember when we were making “Ghost Protocol” and the script on that just wasn’t very focused, and Tom brought in McQ, a sort of master plumber to re-wriggle the pipes. And it was on that that their creative romance really took off. They’re both eternal students of film and just methods of filmmaking, methods of storytelling, certain camera rigs. I remember when we shot “Rogue Nation,” we were still using film. The cameras were quite cumbersome. Now, you can put a camera on a motorbike and just send it off a cliff and go down and pick it out of the undergrowth. And they’re forever absorbing these new methods of telling the story. So I just think they found each other — in a way that Lennon and McCartney found each other, if I could really hyperbolize.
“Dead Reckoning” feels like it’s ramping up to bring full circle these ideas and themes that the series has been exploring since the very first film. Have there been callbacks or references that you particularly enjoyed being a part of?
The interesting thing about the initial phase of this story was that it was an eclectic showcase of separate directors, and then it morphed into something with greater continuity in terms of Chris and Tom’s collaboration. But Chris has always had a great understanding of the importance of the legacy, and so we have Henry Czerny back for this one, which is so cool to see Kittridge back, and Henry’s such a brilliant actor. And also, the acknowledgement of where Ethan came from, this idea that the IMF agents are kind of offered a choice, which is usually prison, death or joining the IMF. And we came up with Benji’s whole backstory, that he was a hacker in the UK who broke into a sensitive database in the US and got extradited to be tried criminally and then was offered the choice. And so they’re striving to move forward, but also the embracing of the history of it, I think really kind of singles this story out, I think, in franchise cinema.
Does Chris give you a sense of the road he’s mapping, or do you even need that at this point when you learn the details of, say, Benji’s origin story with the IMF?
McQ’s method of filmmaking is like in Wallace and Gromit’s “The Wrong Trousers” when Gromit is on the top of the train and he’s laying the track in front of the train as it’s moving. I think McQ loves to have the story reveal itself to him, and those beautiful little parallels and callbacks aren’t necessarily preordained — they just kind of present themselves. McQ’s really keen to evolve the story in a very organic way and never to cram anything in. If it feels right, we’ll do it. If it feels like it’s just fan service or it’s just some kind of tenuous link, which doesn’t quite ring true, then it won’t find its way in.
On the other hand, the movie pokes very gentle fun at the idea that the IMF team has gone rogue more than it simply just followed a mission. Have there been other tropes you felt it probably was time to actually admit to as opposed to just sweeping past that choice?
I’m so glad they made the IMF joke in this because the International Monetary Fund has become more of a presence in the news, and it felt like it had to be addressed. But something like the mask gag, which is probably the most absurd thing in all “Mission: Impossible,” the idea that you could literally just immediately look like someone else, I love the fact that we utterly commit to that device in such a way that it rings true. I think if we ever went, wait a minute, how could you look so much like [that person]? It would spoil it. We are not a self-reflexive series. There’s a little bit of that occasionally when it’s required, but I think sometimes being arch reflects a lack of confidence in your own story. If you don’t have the confidence in the absurdity of your story, no one else is going to. And certainly with the mask gag, you’ve just got to commit.
One of the things that you do in this film is ride in a self-driving car. Why would Benji do that if it could be manipulated by The Entity?
That’s why he puts his seatbelt on. We had that thought, and we even spoke about the idea of The Entity hacking the car whilst Benji was in it. But I think he has to just do a Hail Mary and hope The Entity isn’t listening. I mean, fortunately, they’re using kind of analog comms, so with a bit of luck The Entity won’t be able to infiltrate the car. But I think it’s that moment of Benji thinking, you know what? I’m just going to pop on my belt, and that was our a way of saying, yes, we know.
How important are those plot redundancies? Is there a certain threshold where telling a story that’s exciting is more important than every single screw fitting into every little round hole?
Tom and McQ are incredibly meticulous with that kind of stuff. Obviously at times, just the sheer size of the story, the amount of characters, there are probably little holes that people can find, but we’ve always got a reason like that to explain stuff. But it is important to not just rely on people’s goodwill. I think you do have to try and cover every base as best you can, otherwise it’s just lazy. I get annoyed when I watch movies and things happen that just wouldn’t happen for whatever reason. And not necessarily great big fantasy films where you’re dealing with fantastic ideas, I don’t like it when characters do things they wouldn’t do just to facilitate a certain plot point. And I think McQ is really good at making sure that doesn’t happen with this.
After returning to Benji so many times, what are you still learning about the character?
What I love about McQ’s writing is that he’s always very true to the characters. Some people often say, “don’t you want to go and do that crazy stunt?” And it’s like, well, maybe, but would Benji do that kind of thing? He’s not Ethan. It’s Benji’s job to be the one that actually says, “What the fuck are we doing here?” Whereas Ethan’s got to be so focused, he can’t afford to take that pause. But I love the scene in this movie when Benji’s defusing the bomb and it’s starting to kind of grill him about his personal life. It’s both a heartwarming and sinister moment because it’s The Entity kind of drilling into Benji, but at the same time, you understand just how much Benji cares about who’s around him. That character stuff is the secret weapon, I think, of these films. People often make a lot of the stunts, obviously, because Tom’s doing incredibly daring stuff, but what Tom and McQ talk about the most is character, and that’s what they obsess about the most, that’s what they spend the most time working on, is making sure that the people involved in these moments of daring are people that you give a shit about. Because if you don’t, then those stunts will just be hollow.
Part One feels very complete even though obviously Part Two is coming. How much have you filmed of Part Two and what has the flow been from one film to the next?
We’re not shooting in a pandemic, which means it’s not going to take quite as long as the last one did, which is a relief. I can tell you that we’ve already shot stuff which makes part one seem tame. To sit with an audience and watch Part One and know what’s coming, I feel this supreme sense of dramatic irony. It’s going to be extraordinary and surprising and also have the same degree of heart and character and attention to detail that Tom and McQ always bring.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLXNpbW9uLXBlZ2ctdG9tLWNydWlzZS1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1tY3F1YXJyaWUtMTIzNTY3MDc4Ni_SAXFodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9uZXdzL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1zaW1vbi1wZWdnLXRvbS1jcnVpc2UtY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbWNxdWFycmllLTEyMzU2NzA3ODYvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-16 16:45:00.222000+00:00,Christopher McQuarrie Talks Dead Reckoning's Timely Villain,"A movie about ""Tom Cruise versus the algorithm"" couldn't have come at a better time.","Audiences go to see a Mission: Impossible movie because they want to see Tom Cruise bend the universe backwards to survive stunts that would likely kill anyone else. Because of that, it can sometimes be easy to leave behind the actual plot of these films and their respective villains, give or take some exceptions. But the recently released Dead Reckoning Part One has quite the memorable villain, because it’s the very thing the entertainment industry is actively fighting at this moment.
Dead Reckoning’s plot centers around an AI algorithm dubbed The Entity that various global superpowers, but especially the US government, want for their own ends. If there were any time for a movie to give a wakeup call about AI, it’d be as actors and writers are striking to ensure their work isn’t fed into an algorithm that would end their livelihoods. But director/co-writer Christopher McQuarrie told Collider that he and Tom Cruise were originally hesitant on making technology the villain during initial story meetings back in 2018. “Two or three years ago, this idea would have been too intellectual for most people,” he recalled saying to Cruise.

As he explains it, he later drew on fears of the Cold War during his childhood to really flesh out the Entity and make it what it is in the final film. “’What are people bringing to the movie now?’ They’re not bringing the Cold War,” he noted, “they’re not bringing the war on terror, they’re bringing something new, and what is it?’” He, Cruise, and fellow co-writer Erik Jendresen eventually agreed to go all in on AI because he felt “this anxiety about technology and what and how technology was beginning to influence our lives.”

Dead Reckoning makes the Entity’s danger to both the world and Ethan Hunt’s team felt throughout the film. Both on its own and with human disciples like Gabriel (Esai Morales), the AI does a lot of damage that won’t be too surprising if you’ve seen at least one rogue AI movie. Even so, he mentioned his hope that the duology will elicit feelings of catharsis similar to the original Top Gun did for Cold War-era audiences back in 1986. “That movie was telling you that everything was ultimately gonna be okay. You were showing them a way out.” But before that, he teased that the Entity’s actions in Dead Reckoning Part Two will “freak you out” even more.

6/26/2023 21:20,Still Cruising: Tom premieres new ‘Mission Impossible’ adventure in Abu Dhabi,Tom Cruise has graced the red carpet in Abu Dhabi for the Middle Eastern premiere of “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.”,"ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The red carpet unfurled Monday in Abu Dhabi for Hollywood action megastar Tom Cruise, who was on hand for the Middle Eastern premiere of “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.”
Cruise was met by an enthusiastic crowd of fans and movie buffs eager to catch a glimpse of the star at the Emirates Palace Hotel in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.
Dressed in a tailored tuxedo and flashing his signature smile, Cruise appeared moved by the exuberant reception, stopping to speak with many attendees. The evening’s buzz was punctuated by the “Mission: Impossible” theme, its familiar chords adding a layer of cinematic nostalgia to the night.
“I’m a cinephile, I love movies and the history of cinema and how this art form develops,” Cruise told The Associated Press on the red carpet. “I didn’t know whether the audience was going to embrace (the first Mission: Impossible movie), it was the first film I ever produced and I did it because I wanted to challenge myself in many ways as an actor, as a producer, as a storyteller.”
“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is the seventh installment of the blockbuster $3.5 billion grossing franchise famed for jam-packed action and ever-daring stunts performed by the 60-year-old Cruise himself.
“We’ve had a lot of fun coming up with these moments,” said Cruise.
The Mission: Impossible series follows the globe-trotting adventures of Ethan Hunt, a secret agent of the Impossible Missions Force, or IMF, as he undertakes high-risk covert operations. Picture heart-racing action, sophisticated gadgets, and Cruise’s Hunt executing death-defying stunts at every turn.
Matching the topic of the moment, Hunt and his IMF team are tasked with tracking down a potent new artificial intelligence weapon in “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.” Scenes include base-jumping off a cliff on a motorcycle, hurling a steam train off an exploded bridge, and drifting a yellow Fiat 500 through Rome’s winding streets.
In a nod to the locale, the film incorporates several action sequences in Abu Dhabi. The desert landscapes of Liwa, known as the Empty Quarter, set the stage for intense horseback chases and firearm confrontations. Cruise runs across the dune-shaped roof of Abu Dhabi International Airport’s new Midfield Terminal in another scene.
“When you see us shooting a sequence in Abu Dhabi, it’s about that culture, it’s about that country, and that’s why we keep coming back here,” said Christopher McQuarrie, who is returning for the third time as director of the high-octane spy series.
McQuarrie joined Cruise on the red carpet along with other Mission: Impossible co-stars, both new and returning. Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff made their franchise debut, while Simon Pegg reprised his role as Benji Dunn, a character known for infusing comedic relief into the franchise’s most tense scenes.
“When you have a film which is high-tension you need that to occasionally be injected in order to make it a little bit more enjoyable,” said Pegg.
Following pandemic delays, the production companies behind the franchise, Paramount Pictures and Skydance, pushed the film’s release from September of 2022 to July of 2023. A leaked video from the set featured Cruise launching an expletive-laden rant at colleagues after he reportedly spotted two crew members failing to respect social distancing rules. The star expressed his concern about the potential consequences, which included shutting down production and jeopardizing the then-struggling movie industry and the jobs it supports.
“We just had to write the rulebook on how to make a film during a pandemic,” said Pegg. “Make sure everything was super safe, that was Tom’s biggest challenge in a way was to make us all feel safe and be safe, somehow we muddle through.”
Cruise was praised by many for his role in revitalizing Hollywood following the industry’s pandemic-induced stagnation. This recognition came on the heels of his blockbuster film, “Top Gun: Maverick,” which not only marked Cruise’s first $100 million debut but also signified the return of blockbuster movies to theaters as the most significant movie debut since the onset of the pandemic.
Abu Dhabi marks the third premiere location for “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” with the red carpet previously rolled out at the Spanish Steps in Rome and Leicester Square in London. The movie is set to open in U.S. theaters on July 12.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy10b20tY3J1aXNlLWIyNmFlYWJmMDk1ODJkZTljYmI4MzYxZmNhNGMzNGI00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-05 17:00:00+00:00,Paul Schrader Dismisses New ‘Mission: Impossible’ as ‘Tiresome Claptrap’: ‘A.I. Could Have Written This Script’,"Paul Schrader had no patience for the ""claptrap"" writing of ""Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning — Part I""","The man who wrote “Transcendental Style in Film: Ozu, Bresson, Dreyer” was apparently unimpressed with “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.”
Paul Schrader took to his always-colorful Facebook page to write a terse review of Christopher McQuarrie’s latest Tom Cruise blockbuster. The “Master Gardener” director was not a fan of the blockbuster’s script, which he saw as indiscernible from AI writing. (Not to mention the movie’s main villain is a godlike AI.)
“‘Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning.’ Such tiresome claptrap,” Schrader wrote. “There’s no reason that AI, given the correct prompts, could not have written this script.”
While Schrader invoking AI is hardly a compliment, he has been more supportive of computers writing scripts than most of his peers. The Oscar nominee has frequently spoken about what he sees as the potential for AI to replace screenwriters on supposedly lowbrow Hollywood entertainment.
“It’s apparent that AI will become a force in film entertainment” Schrader recently wrote. “Do you need a new episode of ‘CSI: Vegas?’ ChapchatGPT [sic] will deliver that in a matter of seconds. And it will be good, it will cull all the episodes of CSI for the last 20 years and come up with something both generic and contemporary.”
Schrader has not been shy about sharing his thoughts on this summer’s biggest theatrical blockbusters. He raved about Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” calling it the best film of the 21st century and encouraging his followers to make the long drives to see the film in IMAX.
“‘Oppenheimer.’ The best, most important film of this century,” Schrader wrote. “If you see one film in cinemas this year it should be ‘Oppenheimer.’ I’m not a Nolan groupie but this one blows the doors off the hinges.”
On the opposite end of the spectrum, Schrader found time to see the allegedly MAGA-coded blockbuster “Sound of Freedom” after every screening of “Barbie” was sold out on opening weekend. He had harsher words for that film, even if he conceded that he could understand its appeal to largely Trump-supporting audiences (many of whom see it as touching on subject matter related to Q-Anon conspiracy theories).
“Interesting film, more interesting phenomenon,” he wrote of the film. “It’s simplistic, schematic and effective in the Hollywood tradition of ‘message’ movies–but is not ‘Christian’ per se. It’s also a white savior movie, the Hispanics beings saved or punished by the interloping blue-eyed hero. I saw it with a predominately Hispanic audience who applauded afterwards, not seeing the irony in this.”
Ultimately, Schrader did rave about “Barbie” on his Facebook after finally seeing it, calling the film a “wonder” and declaring Barbieland “Gretaland” after director Greta Gerwig.
No question, “Dead Reckoning” has suffered at the box office due to Barbenheimer. The tentpole has grossed $452 million worldwide so far, but that’s nothing compared to “Barbie’s” $823 million and counting total. “Oppenheimer” has so far grossed a cool $425 million, but it’s also currently occupying all IMAX screens in North America, crushing opportunity for “Dead Reckoning” even despite Tom Cruise’s alleged entreaties to exhibitors to make way for his movie.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9nZW5lcmFsLW5ld3MvcGF1bC1zY2hyYWRlci1oYXRlZC1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctMTIzNDg5MjE1NC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-01 20:15:49+00:00,Watch Tom Cruise Roll a Fiat 500 in ‘Mission: Impossible’,The director Christopher McQuarrie discusses a chase scene involving the star and Hayley Atwell in ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One’,"“I am Christopher McQuarrie, the director and one of the writers and producers of ‘Mission — Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One.’” [MUSIC PLAYING] “What are we doing?” “Finding us a new car.” “The inspiration for this sequence actually occurred to me during the shooting of ‘Mission — Impossible Fallout’ when I was scouting locations for the chase scene in Paris. And I came across a little Fiat 500 that was parked along the Seine River. And I thought it would be great, the idea of watching Ethan Hunt and Tom Cruise driving in a car like that. When I pitched this idea to Tom, he immediately appreciated the notion of doing a car chase that involved more humor than any of the sequences we had done previously, and he really leaned into that. Something to watch during this sequence is the behavior between Tom Cruise and Haley Atwell. You’re looking at two actors performing in two-shots, meaning you don’t have any editorial control. It’s not like I can pick the best moments of each actor. I have to really be giving you their best at the exact same time. And what it really does is it creates an affinity for these two characters. The most important part about this sequence is not really the action. It’s the feeling of a relationship developing between two people who actually don’t want to be together. And this car chase is all about creating circumstances whereby they are forced together, and over the course of a sequence, you feel them turning into a team. Rome is a very tricky place to shoot. The Fiat is a very difficult car to drive. And obviously, it’s very difficult to drive that car with handcuffs, let alone on cobblestone streets which make all of the driving, everything that you see Tom doing, becomes completely unpredictable. And what you end up with is a sequence where the car almost has a mind of its own. It becomes a character in the sequence along with Haley’s hair, as you can see there. In this part of the sequence, we ended up on the Spanish Steps. We were allowed to shoot at the Spanish Steps with the understanding that we never could actually physically touch the Spanish Steps. But so long as we never touched the Spanish Steps, we could do whatever we want. So what we did is we built the Spanish Steps in three sections on a backlot so that we could drive cars down them. And everything that Tom and Haley are doing here is extremely difficult, extremely punishing. The car doesn’t have really great suspension. So the riding down the steps is very jarring. And we got into this bit here with the cars rolling over we did in three sections. One, Tom drove down the steps. Then we had a bunch of grips roll a car down the steps with no one in it. And then, finally, we built a padded interior for the two actors to actually roll down the steps with the cameras rolling.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMDEvbW92aWVzL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1wYXJ0LW9uZS1jbGlwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

Simon Pegg said Cruise is far more generous and fun than that rumor suggests, and that he even “took us go-karting and zip-lining” during off hours on “Dead Reckoning Part One.”
“I’ve been able to hack my way through all the bizarre mythology that surrounds him,” added Pegg, who has starred in every “Mission: Impossible” movie opposite Cruise since 2006’s “Mission: Impossible III.” “On one side he’s Tom Cruise — this enigmatic film star everyone wants to know about. And on the other he’s just a guy. I like being normal with him.”
Pegg previously said on BBC’s “Desert Island Discs” radio show that he does not ask Cruise about anything related to his “personal beliefs” when they are together because “that would be me abusing my privileged access that I get to him.” That means Scientology questions are off the table. So what does Pegg talk to Cruise about on set? Cruise’s fame.
“We joke about it,” Pegg said. “I mean, I always make fun of him for it, you know, about the things that he can access. We were filming in South Africa recently on this mountain and then he decided he wanted to swim with sharks. He flew us in a helicopter to this seaside part and we dived with sharks. At the end of the day we said, ‘That was a real Tom Cruise kind of day.’ He kind of appreciates the ridiculousness of it sometimes.”
Pegg added, “My relationship with him is just very simple and amiable. It’s always been a very easy relationship. I think you realize, when you meet the person rather than the thicket of mythology that’s built up around them, it’s a different experience. I mean, he loves [the fame] and he really relishes it, it’s all he knows. It energizes him and spurs him on. I don’t think I would appreciate that particularly. I’d find it very stressful and overwhelming and it would make me want to retreat. I’m happy where I am.”

2023-06-25 18:10:00.700000+00:00,Christopher McQuarrie on the Two-Part Challenges of Dead Reckoning,"Making a Mission: Impossible movie is already a big effort, so you can imagine how difficult that is for one that's been split into two parts.","Splitting films into multiple parts is still a fairly recent phenomenon, and 2023 has multiple “Chapter One” movies playing in theaters. In addition to Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, the first movie in Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon saga is coming in December, Fast X was its own “Part One” back in May, and next month will see the release of Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One.
Speaking to IGN and Collider during the film’s premiere, writer/director Christopher McQuarrie talked about some of the challenges that come with making a multi-part movie. Prior to Covid, Dead Reckoning was originally meant to be shot back-to-back, but according to him, one of the bigger issues was stopping production on one film in order to focus on the other part. “There was the challenge of stopping in the middle,” he said, “not even knowing what the full movie was, and trying to predict what it was in the second film.” Because of factors like an actor’s availability and the weather, for example, “certain things” in Part Two required Part One production to be stopped.

Production on Part Two began in March 2022, and is set to start back up again one the production circuit for Part One has fully ended. By McQuarrie’s own admission, he still hasn’t entirely locked down the ending, saying he and longtime collaborator Tom Cruise tend to figure things out as they go along. “Tom and I never obsess about executing the plan,” he said. “I could tell you that I know what the end of Part Two is, but I can’t guarantee that that will be the ending when we get there. [...] We always have a direction, we always have a place we’re going.”

Splitting Dead Reckoning into two parts wasn’t originally McQuarrie’s plan, but naturally, it apparently became “so big”—bigger than 2018's Mission: Impossible—Fallout, even—that all the moving parts and players couldn’t fit into a single movie. He chalked that up mainly to the characters: the movie has a larger cast than earlier installments, and he wanted each of them to have a sizable part to play in the story. It wasn’t in response to a trend, he said, but because it has “a lot of characters, a lot of action. [...] It wasn’t just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie.”

We’ll see how that claim holds up when Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning arrives in theaters on July 12, with Part Two currently slated to come out on June 28, 2024. Look for our review of the first film closer to release.

2023-07-14 16:30:00+00:00,"Hayley Atwell Had No Interest in Playing Just a ‘Femme Fatale, Ice Queen’ for ‘Mission: Impossible’","Interview: To craft the franchise's next star, Atwell tells IndieWire she boned up on drifting, watched old '70s heist movies, and looked for nuance.","[Editor’s note: The following interview was conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike began on July 14, 2023.]
Hayley Atwell is no stranger to action (the British star is, after all, a bonafide Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero, thanks to her turns across the franchise’s film and TV series as Peggy Carter aka Agent Carter aka Captain Carter), but the star is also a classically trained actress who has excelled in various stage productions, with two Laurence Olivier Awards noms under her belt. Combining those talents and interests in one role? That sounds up her alley.
Enter: Christopher McQuarrie’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” which sees Atwell making her debut in the eye-popping, stunt-heavy spy world for the franchise’s seventh feature. Alongside star Tom Cruise, Atwell’s pickpocket Grace runs, kicks, runs, punches, runs some more, and drives (sorry, drifts) all over Europe in pursuit of a key that can save the world from nothing less than permanent destruction. Like fellow newbie Pom Klementieff, Grace is a totally new creation in this fast-paced world, and a character that relied heavily on Atwell’s own instincts to be crafted. Stunts and character work: the Atwell way.
Ahead, Atwell tells IndieWire about what she wanted for Grace (not just a femme fatale, not only a victim), her unexpected knack for drifting, and what we might expect to see from her in the second film in the “Dead Reckoning” world.
The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
IndieWire: Considering that you guys have been on tour for, at this point, it feels like months, I wondered: is there anything that you want to talk about this movie that no one has asked you yet?
Hayley Atwell: No. [laughs] I mean, we’ve just covered everything. There’s been so much to share and to say about the process of it. And it’s been fun, because I get to relive and reminisce about the last four years. It was such an ambitious undertaking for the filmmakers, and obviously the obstacles that the whole industry was facing in 2020. On this press tour, it’s been a chance to reflect back a little bit. I’m not a great one for self-reflection.
But I think also, when you’re on a press tour like this, and suddenly reviews come out, and you start to see audiences responding to it, it gives you an extra boost of going, “Yeah, we created this as a pure cinematic experience to be seen on the big screen,” and people are responding to it in the way that we’d hoped.
And people do seem to be responding, that has to give you a boost.
It’s funny, because when people go, “Oh, you must be exhausted,” it’s a bit like when people, after a play, come up to me backstage and go, “How do you learn your lines?” It’s like, “Well, it’s my job.” And I do love it, and I feel just very, I don’t mean to sound glib. I feel really grateful for the experience and the opportunity to work with these guys. When you do an interview, you want to make sure that you’re communicating authentically what the experience is, and not wanting to sound just all, “Everything’s great and rainbows.”
“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” Paramount
You also surely feel a lot of pride in your character, who you also helped created from the ground up.
[There have been ]so many amazing challenges that I got to address, from the stunts to finding nuance of the character within a franchise this size, and coming in as an outsider, and wondering how Grace would fit into the franchise in a way that offers something new as a female character, and yet added to the already incredible established cast that is so loved worldwide. So to have done that, that’s what’s been energizing.
And to be sat here going, “I am so lucky to do what I do.” Because I set out 17 years ago to dedicate my life to a creative life, and it’s happening. So, I think that helps you sleep at night well.
There are so many compelling female characters in this franchise already, but it’s particularly notable that there’s still space to have you and Pom’s characters, who are both new and totally different, enter a series that’s already six films deep.
It’s a testament to Chris and Tom, because they are always looking to go, “OK, what did we learn from the last one? And what can we take to the next one that we’ve learned from? And what is the next progressive step for this storyline? And how do we serve each actor coming in with their own talents?”
When McQ came to see me in a play 10 years ago, and he took me out for dinner afterwards and said, “That thing that you do on stage…,” and there was a particular moment that he still refers to to this day, and he acts it back to me so well. He’s a really good actor! He knew that he wanted to put it into a story somewhere, he just didn’t know what or when.
So with the creating of this character, I came into the screen test, and they said, “We don’t have a character in mind. We find the actor we want to work with, and then we create the character with them.” To hear that from filmmakers, particularly of their caliber and particularly of a franchise of this size, that [means] you’re giving agency back to the artist immediately. Even in the screen test, as an actor, I’m coming in going, “Oh, OK. In that case, let me try a ton of creative choices and we’ll see what lands.” There’s no good or bad. There are just choices.
I knew Grace would be sort of a lone wolf at the beginning, and her story would be how she is someone who can’t, for whatever reason in her past, trust other human beings, and how isolating that is as an existence, and then how she learns through an art to trust. I just didn’t know, obviously, the details of it, or where that would fit within the plot, or if I could elevate her from being more than one thing, so she wasn’t just the femme fatale, the ice queen, the victim. That she could be full of contradictory qualities, and that you could have moments of levity, vulnerability, self-assurance, self-doubt, fear, and panic, as well as courage of having a go anyway.
“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” Christian Black
That also then came about through watching my stunt rehearsals and my stunt training. Tom and McQ would come in, and check in, and see how my style was coming on, what I seemed to naturally enjoy doing, and then they would fit that to the film. So I discovered quite early, I had a bit of a knack for drifting, and [stunt coordinator] Wade Eastwood was my brilliant teacher in that. So they were like, “Right, you can drift, which means that will be a car chase sequence.”
And then working with Tom, we were watching a lot of movies. A lot of ’70s heist movies, like “What’s Up, Doc?” and “The Sting” and even “Paper Moon.” We’re looking at chemistry between two protagonists, particularly if they’re sort of exasperated by each other, but circumstances have forced them together, and that creates a setup for comedic timing, and how you could fit that into the middle of an action car-chase sequence?
If Grace is seen as being calculating, or manipulative, or attempting to pull the carpet under his feet on purpose because she gleefully enjoys that, then the audience are not going to really want to lean into who she is. It’s a recoil, because it seems to be too cruel, so we found ways of going, “Well, how about that she doesn’t know who to trust, and she’s hyper-vigilant?” So she’s always looking for an escape, because that safety, that self-reliance, is the only thing that she’s really been able to trust. So, Ethan’s job is to convince her that he’s the right one to trust.
Even though we don’t know much about Grace and her background, there is a natural empathy to her, simply because she’s alone and thrust into this insane world. How would anyone react in those circumstances?
When she’s caught in Rome, she then discovers that was Ethan who stitched her up. And you sit there and you realize, “Oh, if she doesn’t get her money, she’s out on a limb there.” She doesn’t have anything or anyone else to rely on, apart from the job she’s having to deliver on, and although it’s a very morally-questionable job, it’s also one that she has forged out of survival. She was an orphan. She hasn’t come from any sort of background of privilege or security, and she’s sort of a scrappy, kind of making it up as she goes along.
So for Ethan to do that, and then also to see Ethan’s capability of knocking out some of the Rome guards, and then that look that she gives him as they’re off into the courthouse, and she’s walking down the corridor with him, and she’s looking at him going, “This guy’s pretty scary.” For him to have all this power and to do those things to her, Oh, my God. So of course, when she gets her opportunity to scream out “pervert!” to him in Italian to be able to get away, for her that’s the safest option.

I’ve enjoyed playing complicated characters, because I think human beings are. We don’t always make the right decisions. A lot of the time we’re making decisions based on instinct for self-preservation, and that exists in all the theater roles I’ve done certainly. Why should the woman be the moral compass and the moral center of the movie?
There was a lovely dear friend of mine called Deborah Frances-White, who runs The Guilty Feminist podcast, and she was talking about the fun-killer test. The fun-killer test is this perception that the woman has to be the wise, moral heart of a story. Say it was the wife in the movie telling the soldier, “Your family needs you, don’t go to war,” if we actually followed her, and what she wants, and what she’s saying, there would be no film. She’d kill the fun of the film. I think that’s a really interesting story arc in terms of crafting a character. It’s like, “If we actually followed her, would the story get more interesting or would we actually kill the action?”
And Grace also refutes something I’ve long been obsessed with tearing down, this notion that female action stars can only be “badass” or a “strong female character” with no nuance or failures.
It’s like when a person is described as one thing. I mean, they aren’t. It’s to do with the person talking about them, and what they have seen of that person, and filtered to that person’s personal experiences and perspective on the world. Any sort of one-off description of a character suggests to me something’s been underwritten.
When you are building Grace knowing that she will be in two films at least, how much are those choices based in, “OK, we want to have this in Part One, and how much are we going to learn in Part Two?” There’s still so much that we need to learn about Grace and her background that I assume we’ll see more of in the next film.
I think what [Cruise and McQuarrie] are great at doing is they’re always looking objectively, from an audience perspective, going, “What is this telling us? What is the frame here communicating? What is this take communicating?” Highlighting the individual talents of the actors that they bring on. So I feel like I always have faith in them, and I have faith in the next installment too that they’ll serve the characters in a way that the audience want. They satisfy their audience. They’re there to delight them and entertain them. So they’re not going to leave them hanging in that regard, I don’t think.
I know that Tom gave Pom skydiving lessons as a wrap gift. What did he give you?
Oh my gosh, so many things. I mean, they’re very personal. He would pilot me and a lot of us to work in a helicopter, and take us out for dinner, and take my family out on the helicopter rides too. And of course the coconut cake.
The coconut cake!
I went skydiving as well. I didn’t love it as much as Pom. I loved it in the sense of, if we were going to use it [in the film], I’ll do something and I’ll learn it if I know it’s going to be used. Because I love acting. Doing the physical stuff for the sake of it, I go, “What’s it for?” I’m always driven by the thing it’s going to be led into. I would’ve continued skydiving if I felt that that would actually been used in the film.
But I think the thing that he’s given me more than anything else, because it’s not about the physical stuff. It’s more about, he’s given me his time. He is always available for a conversation about the techniques of movie-making, of what each department does, the business side of things. Mentoring, and that sense of you’ve just got someone on your side that’s rooting for you. That is unquantifiable. To have his time, and he’s always open to that. The doors are always open to those conversations. There’s no one like him in Hollywood, and I don’t think there ever will be. To have that is an enormous privilege of which I would not take advantage, but I hold with great respect.

My last question is everyone’s favorite question these days: which other major summer movie do you want to see first, “Barbie” or “Oppenheimer”?
Oh, double bill! I’m so excited by them. I mean, from the interviews that I’ve read and the trailers that I’ve seen, they’re such different films, and exceptional filmmakers, and I love the diversity of them. I don’t believe films should be pitted against each other. This is not a competition. Tom and McQ certainly don’t feel like they’re in competition. They want “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie” to succeed, as do I. I want all great movies to be seen on the big screen by as many people as possible, because it’s a celebration of our art form. It’s a celebration of our industry, and it’s what keeps it healthy.

2023-07-13 00:00:00+00:00,Kittridge Is Back: Henry Czerny Talks ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ and How He Almost Returned to the Franchise Earlier,'Mission: Impossible 7' actor Henry Czerny talks his return as Kittridge to the franchise.,"Henry Czerny received a mission from filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie and chose to accept it.
That mission? Return as former IMF chief Eugene Kittridge in “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” 27 years after he first appeared in the original “Mission: Impossible” in 1996.
At the “Dead Reckoning” premiere in New York, Czerny said when he first got the call about returning to the “Mission: Impossible” world, he didn’t believe it.
“I think it’s a joke at first because my reps called me and said they want to bring Kittridge back and I’m in the middle of doing my errands in Los Angeles and fighting traffic or shredding old tax documents,” he told Variety. “I think, ‘Okay, what’s going on really?’ They say, ‘Chris McQuarrie wants to talk to you about bringing Kittridge back,’ and I take it seriously. Two days later, I’m on a call with Chris McQuarrie.”
Czerny revealed that that McQuarrie, who began writing and directing the series with 2015’s “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation,” originally wanted Kittridge back “a couple of installments ago.” In “Rogue Nation,” Alec Baldwin came onboard as Alan Hunley, the director of the CIA, who became Secretary of the Impossible Missions Force in 2018’s “Fallout.” Czerny wouldn’t reveal any of the previous plans for Kittridge’s original return, but said, “I’m thrilled that Alec came and did Hunley, that’s for sure. That was great, I love that.”
In “Dead Reckoning,” Kittridge is back, but this time as the new CIA director. He’s taking over from Angela Bassett’s Erika Sloane, who appears in a photograph in the opening scene with all the heads of national security. (Bassett was unavailable to return due to the COVID-19 production delays, and McQuarrie teased that she, like Czerny, might return: “Angela is too fabulous, you could never ever let Angela get away, so there’s always a plan in the future.”)
Just like the original “Mission: Impossible,” Kittridge is still causing problems for Tom Cruise‘s IMF agent Ethan Hunt. In that film, Kittridge believed Hunt, as the lone survivor of a setup that killed his entire IMF team, was the mole that the agency had been trying to track down and attempted to bring him in. Disavowed by the agency and with Kittridge on his heels, Hunt spends the duration of the film trying to complete the mission and clear his name.
In “Dead Reckoning,” Kittridge wants to control the “Entity,” an all-powerful AI algorithm that could bring the world to its knees, and orders Hunt to secure two halves of a key that will unlock it. But Hunt realizes the Entity is too much for one government organization to handle, so he disobeys commands and crosses the globe to retrieve the keys to secure it himself.
The chase for the keys brings Hunt, Kittridge and the rest of the “Dead Reckoning” cast aboard a train in a thrillingly destructive third act. Fans of the original “Mission: Impossible” will remember the finale of the first movie also took place on a train (and one ill-fated helicopter).
“There are a whole bunch of Easter eggs for people if they’re interested,” Czerny said. “The last time you see him in the first one, he’s on a train, and this one you see him on a train as well with another Vanessa, Redgrave and Vanessa Kirby.”
In the first “Mission: Impossible,” Vanessa Redgrave played Max Mitsopolis, a black-market arms dealer who gave information to Hunt and was later apprehended by Kittridge. In “Fallout” and “Dead Reckoning,” Vanessa Kirby plays Alanna, Max’s daughter, who continues the family business.
In the 27 years between his “Mission: Impossible,” appearances, Czerny says the outrageous stunts have only gotten better and better.
“They’ve honed it down to what you have here, which is incredibly delicious,” he said. “Nothing is extraneous, and they know the craft so well. They know the franchise so very well. What you experience is a very tight, action-packed, heartfelt movie about friendship and what to do when you’re stuck between a rock and a hard place.”
Despite appearing in the start to the epic film franchise, Czerny revealed “Dead Reckoning Part One” is his new favorite entry. “Previous to this one, ‘Fallout’ was my favorite,” he said. “And, due respect to everyone in ‘Fallout,’ this eclipses it. It’s great.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvaGVucnktY3plcm55LW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1ldWdlbmUta2l0dHJpZGdlLTEyMzU2Njg0NzEv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9oZW5yeS1jemVybnktbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWV1Z2VuZS1raXR0cmlkZ2UtMTIzNTY2ODQ3MS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-31 11:00:50+00:00,How Editor Eddie Hamilton Cut “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” to the Quick,"Editor Eddie Hamilton knows the ""Mission: Impossible"" formula better than almost anyone not named Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie.","How Editor Eddie Hamilton Cut “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” to the Quick
As it is, Tom Cruise’s new Mission: Impossible movie (now playing) runs a hefty two hours and forty-three minutes, but what people see in theaters actually represents a very slimmed-down version of the original cut that director Christopher McQuarrie screened for his friends. “It ran four hours,” says Cruise’s go-to editor Eddie Hamilton. “We watched it in a screening room with 40 people, and it was two and a half hours to Venice. Then we had snacks and came back for the last hour and a half.”
Hamilton, who earned an Oscar nomination for Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick and cut previous Mission: Impossible entries Rogue One and Fallout, faced an embarrassment of riches in the Dead Reckoning Part One rough cut. High-energy performances, eye-popping stunts, and locations like Abu Dubai, Rome, Venice, and Norway filled the screen. For the seasoned editor, the challenge came in streamlining all that footage into the summer popcorn movie that has so far grossed $370 million and critical acclaim.
Speaking from his home in London, Hamilton explains the tricks of the trade he used to reckon with Dead Reckoning‘s car chases, motorcycle stunts, and multiple character arcs.
Dead Reckoning throws many plates up in the air — new villains, old villains, the “cruciform key” Macguffin, Ethan Hunt’s gang, plus the addition of Hayley Atwell’s new pickpocket femme fatale character Grace. How do you balance all that plot information with emotional beats?
That’s the push-pull we deal with every single day. Especially on a long movie like this, you have to make sure that there’s no air. We discussed it all the time with Chris McQuarrie being like: “I’m feeling air, I’m feeling air.” I’ve been working on the movie for three years, I’ve watched it 700 times and seen it iterate day after day, compressing, compressing, compressing.
You like to keep things moving.
But you can get to the point where you compress it too much. Right at the end of the movie, Ethan Hunt’s talking to the henchwoman Paris, where she’s lying there going, “Why did you spare my life?” We did an ultra-tight version of that scene where I cut all the air out. I came back the next day and watched it again with Chris. We went, “Woah. There’s no emotion at all. I don’t feel anything. It’s just information,” And information is the death of emotion.
The movie’s first big set piece at the airport introduces Hayley Atwell’s character Grace, plus multiple bad guys, surveillance cameras, cutbacks to Luther and his laptop, and you’ve got Benji racing around trying to find a ticking bomb, and Ethan Hunt’s in the middle of it all. That’s a lot of moving parts!
The airport scene was filmed partially at a real airport in Abu Dhabi. It was phenomenally difficult, but Chris doesn’t worry too much about figuring everything out on the page or even on set. The actors give us a lot of flavors, he collects the ingredients, and then we bake the cake in the editing room. That sequence took weeks of work. We had to intercut between Luther and Ethan and Grace and Paris and the buyer while also making sure the graphics on Benji’s laptop are designed so that your eye is guided around the screen. The first time never works. We throw it all out, and it still doesn’t work. It’s an evolutionary process. Honestly, I was working on that scene for two years.
Complex sequences seem to have become part of Mission: Impossible’s DNA.
If you think back to the opera scene in Rogue Nation, there’s all this cross-cutting to keep each character “alive,” so it’s similar in that way to the airport sequence. Chris likes to challenge himself with complicated sequences because he knows that when we sit together in the edit, we will refine it until we eventually get there.
Can you give an example of what it means to “refine” the raw footage?
It often involves going back and getting little close-ups of people, little bits of information. Or in the case of Hayley Atwell, she was finding her character every day. Is Grace scared? Confident? Flirty with Tom? Wily? There were times when she was a bit too confident, a bit smug, and we dialed that down. We modulated Hayley’s performance all the way through.
Were you present on set to make edits during production?
Yes, some of the time. I’d have a feed on my iPad, and on day two of the production, I’m working on day one footage, knowing it’s going to be rough and everything’s going to change. But you’ve got to start somewhere. I went through dailies and watched everything. We had 780 hours of footage on this movie.
The car chases in Rome looked phenomenal. How did you piece that footage together?
I’m thrilled with the way it turned out, but the Rome sequence took weeks of careful work to make sure [the action] landed correctly. You have to understand that Tom Cruise and Hayley Atwell are in a two-shot the entire time. You’re not cutting to create chemistry — you’re allowing their behavior to play out in a two-shot. One of our touchstone movies was What’s Up Doc.
The screwball comedy with Barbara Streisand?
Yeah. Chris loved that film and really embraced that approach in the Fiat and, before that, the BMW chase where Ethan’s handcuffed to Grace, and he’s driving one-handed. We filmed so much cool stuff but ended up compressing it because we kept getting feedback from the audience that it was just too long. Tom would always tell us, “You’ve always got to leave the audience wanting more,” so that became our mantra. We said, “Okay, we’re going to dive back into the chase sequence and take out more until it’s the right length.” Chris and Tom listen to the audience very carefully. They want to make mass entertainment for people in every country on the planet.
Can you talk a bit more about editing the action in Rome so it would track for an audience?
The trick is any time you cut to Tom and Hayley reacting in the car, you can then jump to any location without losing the audience, apart from locals. We cut to Ethan, and he turns right; we’re in a different part of the city, and who cares? Sometimes we’d take one chase and combine it with another one, and you don’t even notice that we’re in two different parts of the city. So we do cheat. But we’re constantly trying to keep this dynamic energy going with pressure from the other characters and the gags while we’re balancing all of that with Tom’s precision driving, where he carefully knocks over scooters or drives into some tiny alley. We cut out quite a bit of cool stuff, so we’re going to do a deleted shots reel for the DVD where you can see all these bits in a montage.
For the grand finale, you’ve got Tom Cruise and his motorcycle flying through the air to land on a speeding train – – pretty spectacular. Were you on set when they shot that?
Yeah. In September 2020, I was in Norway when they filmed the jump, but it’s always about the emotional state, isn’t it? Because it doesn’t matter if someone does a stunt if you don’t have an emotional connection to the characters and the stakes, and why people are doing what they’re doing. How much of the story do we see before we see Ethan on the motorbike? How often do we cut to Grace and the White Widow on the train? To get all those pieces balanced correctly, you have to work really hard to make everything smooth and emotional, so you’re not bumped off the ride.
You clearly place a premium on paring the story down to its essence.
You have to be utterly ruthless. Even in the last week of the edit, I’d say to Chris, “We’ve got to cut this; we’ve got to cut that.” This was stuff that Chris was very fond of, but he was like, “If it can go, it must go.” It’s the art of getting the maximum amount of story into the minimum amount of screen time. That’s what you’re aiming for. That’s the holy grail.

2023-07-11 18:17:08+00:00,Tom Cruise ‘Working Diligently’ on His Next Movie Shot in Space: ‘We’ll See Where We Go’,Tom Cruise teases his next movie set in space and 'Dead Reckoning Part Two.',"Tom Cruise is still preparing to boldly go where no actor has gone before.
He and his “Edge of Tomorrow” director Doug Liman are set to film a movie in space and make Cruise the first civilian to perform a spacewalk. Universal is backing the film, which has a budget of around $200 million.
When asked about his space-set movie at the “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” premiere in New York on Monday, Cruise said he didn’t have a production start date set, but, “We’ve been working on it diligently and we’ll see where we go.”
Of course, Cruise still needs to finish making “Dead Reckoning Part Two,” the potential finale of his “Mission: Impossible” series, before he can plot his next movie. Writer and director Christopher McQuarrie, who’s overseeing both “Dead Reckoning” movies, said he and Cruise are getting right back to work on “Part Two” as soon as the “Part One” press tour ends.
“We finish this tour, and on our way back to the U.K. we stop to scout along the way. We hit the ground running as soon as we get back,” McQuarrie told Variety. “I get two days of vacation between here and Tokyo and I’m back on.”
The latest “Mission: Impossible” film, which opens in theaters Wednesday, pits Cruise’s IMF agent Ethan Hunt against a mysterious villain from his past, and reunites him with allies Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson).
But the greatest draw of any “Mission: Impossible” movie is, of course, the stunts, and “Dead Reckoning Part One” doesn’t disappoint. In the film, Cruise drives a motorcycle off a massive cliff and parachutes safely down to the ground. When asked about that morning on set, Cruise said it was just a “usual day.”
“I keep things pretty calm, nothing unusual. The usual day for me,” he told Variety. “We wake up, and I remember that morning McQuarrie and I came to set, and normally we’re talking about story and the characters, just keep it real casual — as casual as possible. We know what’s happening. I remember getting there in the morning and the ramp was ice. You can see in the EPK as I’m jumping out of the helicopter to test the wind down there, they’re cleaning the ramp of ice. You just go through it nice and easy, no changes.”
Pegg, who has starred opposite Cruise in five “Mission: Impossible” films so far, said the one-of-a-kind action star carried “cinema itself” on his shoulders while making “Dead Reckoning Part One” during the pandemic.
“I’m very driven, I am ambitious, I care deeply about my job, but I don’t have cinema itself on my shoulders,” Pegg told Variety. “I feel like Tom, particularly during the making of this movie, felt like that. I felt like he was facing an existential crisis in the form of the pandemic, and he just wouldn’t be cared by it. I don’t know if I have it in me to do what he does, I literally don’t. There’s a reason why he’s the only one who does this stuff. There isn’t an actor working who does what he does.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvdG9tLWNydWlzZS1zcGFjZS1tb3ZpZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy0xMjM1NjY2ODA3L9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvdG9tLWNydWlzZS1zcGFjZS1tb3ZpZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy0xMjM1NjY2ODA3L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

IGN's Stella Chung had the chance to speak to McQuarrie at Dead Reckoning's press junket in Rome about Cruise's stunts and she asked which one has scared him the most.
""It's coming,"" McQuarrie said. ""You haven't seen it yet. I mean, everything we do... In terms of this movie, definitely the motorcycle jump. But we have continued and we've pushed ourselves even further in Part Two, and you'll see. It's terrifying.""
For those unfamiliar and not worried about stunt spoilers, the motorcycle jump, which you can watch the making of below, sees Cruise actually riding a motorcycle off an extremely tall cliff in Norway before jumping off it and deploying a parachute. Oh, and Cruise did say back in 2021 that this was the most dangerous thing he's ever done.

While McQuarrie wasn't ready to reveal any more about this ""terrifying"" stunt, he did talk with us a bit further at the film's red carpet premiere about stunts in general, if they scare him anymore, and how one gets the green light.
""Oh, they all do,"" McQuarrie said of these stunts. ""They're all terrible ideas. We have a motto on this movie now: 'This is a terrible idea - when do we start?' It never starts with awesome. It starts with, 'That's very ill-advised.' That's how you know you're on to something.""

Speaking of ill-advised, Cruise himself understands the risks these stunts bring with them and even said he wanted to perform the motorcycle jump stunt on day one just in case it killed him.

2023-07-08 15:00:51+00:00,McQuarrie Rejects Moral Ambiguity in Mission: Impossible Movies,"Christopher McQuarrie rejects moral ambiguity in the Mission: Impossible movies, including Dead Reckoning, where a good guy always wins.","This discussion of the Christopher McQuarrie run of Mission: Impossible movies contains very light spoilers for the newest Mission: Impossible film, Dead Reckoning Part One.
Mission: Impossible – Fallout is a remarkable film for a number of reasons. It is a superb action blockbuster on its own terms. It is a fascinating study of both Tom Cruise as a movie star and the sometimes complicated relationship that the actor has with his audience. It is also a thematic meditation on what the Mission: Impossible films are, as well as the space that they occupy in the modern cultural landscape.
The early Mission: Impossible movies were products of a different time, one that Francis Fukuyama called “the end of history.” There was a moral ambivalence that reflected the post-Cold War milieu. In Brian De Palma’s Mission: Impossible, the hero of the original show, Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), betrays the ideals of a country that had moved past him. By his own admission, co-screenwriter Robert Towne peppered Mission: Impossible 2 with “some chicken-shit misogynism” for flavor.
This is all standard spy movie stuff. These sorts of thrillers are built around morally complex and ambiguous figures. In the new millennium, blockbuster cinema began to lean harder into that moral uncertainty and relativism, depicting heroes who were often conflicted about their decisions and whose actions had unintended consequences. The standard-bearer for this approach might be Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy, one of the century’s great blockbuster achievements.
However, it was also apparent looking at the other iconic spy franchise. Running in parallel with those early ambiguous Mission: Impossible movies, the James Bond films starring Pierce Brosnan had edged into high camp with entries like The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day. The franchise went through a gritty reboot with Casino Royale, casting Daniel Craig as a version of the character who was more introspective and conflicted than his predecessors had been.
As the James Bond movies became heavier, the Mission: Impossible movies became lighter. Brad Bird’s Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol has an energy that occasionally veers into broad slapstick farce as the team works with malfunctioning equipment in high-stakes situations, with producer J.J. Abrams even singling out Bird’s comedic sensibility in pre-release interviews. However, the Mission: Impossible movies wouldn’t truly begin exploring this shift until Christopher McQuarrie took over.
McQuarrie is one of Cruise’s long-term collaborators. Although McQuarrie is now an established director in his own right, he established himself as a screenwriter on The Usual Suspects and first crossed paths with Cruise as the screenwriter of Valkyrie. Cruise has frequently brought McQuarrie on board as a writer on projects being overseen by other directors. He even did an uncredited polish on Ghost Protocol and had a hand in shaping Top Gun: Maverick.
As such, it makes sense that even McQuarrie’s crowd-pleasing blockbusters have a certain “writerly” quality. McQuarrie’s three Mission: Impossible films — Rogue Nation, Fallout, and Dead Reckoning Part One — are all in some ways about exploring what a Mission: Impossible film actually is. Modern pop culture is dominated by franchises and intellectual properties, so what makes Mission: Impossible unique? How do these films stand out from the crowd?
McQuarrie’s films understand that the spy thriller is a genre built around a murky internal morality. These are stories about “realpolitik,” about systems governed by ruthless pragmatism and horrific compromise. These are stories about the sacrifices required by “the greater good,” the inevitability of “the necessary evil.” These are games played in the shadows, in which human lives are measured as statistics and where decency is a luxury that players can seldom afford.
It is notable that McQuarrie’s biggest addition to the Mission: Impossible mythology is the character of Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), whose very name evokes a metaphorical deal with the devil. In Rogue Nation, Faust finds herself caught in a moral compromise between MI6 head Atlee (Simon McBurney) and international terrorist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Atlee is blackmailing Faust into compliance, using her to infiltrate Lane’s organization and cover up his own complicity.
Faust breaks with Atlee when she undermines her cover within the terrorist organization to prevent Lane from executing Ethan Hunt (Cruise). For Faust, it is a simple moral choice. “He was going to torture and kill an American agent,” Faust protests. “I wasn’t going to let him die. He’s our ally.” Atlee counters, “There are no allies in statecraft, Ilsa, only common interests.” Atlee then warns Faust that Lane is going to order her to kill Hunt and that she will do it because she has “no choice.”
Hunt operates within a similarly morally ambivalent system. Early in Dead Reckoning Part One, he meets with CIA Director Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny). Kittridge argues that the world is a morally complicated place and that Hunt’s worldview is outdated. “Your days of fighting for the so-called greater good are over,” he warns Hunt. The CIA is seeking to control “the concepts of right and wrong for everyone for centuries to come. You’re fighting to save an ideal that doesn’t exist.”
While this theme runs through both Rogue Nation and Dead Reckoning Part One, McQuarrie brings it squarely into focus in Fallout. At its core, Fallout is a rejection of the moral ambiguity that defines so many contemporary blockbusters. It is a movie in which Hunt is repeatedly confronted with the choice to sacrifice an innocent life for the greater good, only to reject the choice and find a more creative solution to the problem facing him.
At the start of the movie, Hunt chooses to save the life of his old friend Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), allowing nuclear material to fall into the hands of terrorists. Later on, while organizing a daring raid on a prison convoy transferring Lane, Hunt is haunted by visions of a situation where he might have to take an innocent life to preserve his cover. During the eventual abduction, Hunt chooses to blow his cover rather than allow an innocent police officer (Alix Bénézech) to die.
This character trait is established early in Fallout. “Some flaw deep in your core being simply won’t allow you to choose between one life and millions,” explains Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), the head of the Impossible Mission Force. “You see that as a sign of weakness. To me, that’s your greatest strength.” In the closing monologue, CIA Director Erika Sloane (Angela Bassett) admits that the world needs “people like (Hunt) who care about the one life as much as they care about the millions.”
Fallout is not simply a rejection of the classic “trolley problem.” The film repeatedly pushes Hunt towards the sorts of ethical compromises that defined American foreign policy during the War on Terror, only for him to reject them. At one point, Sloane proposes to abduct a suspected terrorist, boasting that they have “a G5 standing by to rendition him to Gitmo, where a waterboard is waiting.” Naturally, Hunt doesn’t operate that way.
Early in the film, the team captures Nils Debruuk (Kristoffer Joner), a scientist complicit in a terrorist plot. As news footage reveals the horrors of the attacks, Hunt loses control. “Give me five minutes with this guy,” Hunt pleads. “That’s not who we are,” Stickell replies. Hunt counters, “Then maybe we need to reconsider that.” McQuarrie frames this as high drama. The soundtrack builds with solemn choirs and mournful violins. The camera pushes in on Hunt’s face, a man lost in introspection.
Of course, it’s all a ruse. The reports are fake. The scenario has been staged. Hunt manipulates Debruuk without resorting to “enhanced interrogation.” The hospital room is just a set, opening up behind Hunt once he has tricked Debruuk into telling him what he wants to know. Hunt isn’t actually feeling conflicted; he is just playing a character for the scientist’s benefit. McQuarrie reminds audiences that these sorts of cinematic dilemmas are just elaborate constructions.
Fallout isn’t just engaging in abstract philosophical debates or grappling with the political climate. It is also a conversation about the narrative conventions of contemporary blockbusters, which were increasingly morally ambiguous. Fallout’s primary villain is John Lark (Henry Cavill), a brutal CIA operative who is the “hammer” to Hunt’s “scalpel.” Cavill is a modern blockbuster star, at this point most famous for his portrayal of a morally complicated Superman in Zack Snyder’s superhero films.
Fallout often feels directly engaged with Nolan’s Dark Knight films. The sequence in which Hunt and Lark break Lane out of custody directly evokes the Joker’s (Heath Ledger) raid on the convoy holding Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) in The Dark Knight. Lorne Balfe’s soundtrack seems to directly evoke Hans Zimmer’s score for those films, with “The Exchange” specifically recalling “Gotham’s Reckoning” and “Fate Whispers to the Warrior” suggesting “Necessary Evil.” This is no surprise, as Balfe emerged from Zimmer’s Remote Control Productions. Still, the influence is particularly pronounced here.
As a result of all of this, Fallout positions Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt in contrast to other big blockbuster franchise protagonists: Daniel Craig’s James Bond, Henry Cavill’s Superman, Christian Bale’s Batman. Even more than Chris Evans’ Captain America in that same summer’s Avengers: Infinity War, Hunt is positioned as a man who refuses to “trade lives.” He’s a protagonist that the audience can root for without any conflicted emotions or ethical uncertainty. Hunt will always do the right thing.
This is McQuarrie’s thesis statement about the Mission: Impossible franchise. It is a rejection of moral complexity and ambiguity. There is no elaborate ethical trap that the heroes cannot outwit through inventiveness or spectacle. Any time the films threaten to get too bogged down in a philosophical quandary, the solution is an insane stunt or a crazy reveal. It’s a very simplistic and appealing approach to blockbuster storytelling, and Mission: Impossible does it better than any other franchise.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzY2FwaXN0bWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2NocmlzdG9waGVyLW1jcXVhcnJpZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtbW92aWVzLXJlamVjdC1tb3JhbC1hbWJpZ3VpdHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

,Mission: Impossible's Christopher McQuarrie On Angela Bassett's Scrapped Dead Reckoning Part One Role And Whether She'll Return To The Franchise,Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning would have featured Angela Bassett's Erika Sloane in a standout scene early in the film.,"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1's excellent cast is filled with stars who appeared in previous installments of the action-forward series – including Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, and Henry Czerny – but one familiar face missing from the ensemble is Angela Bassett. There were plans to bring the Oscar-nominated actor back as Erika Sloane, the character she played in Mission: Impossible - Fallout, but the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately prevented that from happening.
So what was her part going to be? That's a question that has been asked of writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, and answered. Speaking with Variety, the filmmaker spoke about the return of Erika Sloane that didn't come together, and he explained that she was going to be featured in the early scene in Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1 where members of the intelligence community gather to discuss the dangerous artificial intelligence known as The Entity. Said McQuarrie,
It's interesting, she was going to be the head of the CIA. She would’ve been in that room with all the other heads of the intelligence community that you meet.
Angela Bassett's Erika Sloane surely would have fit right into that meeting alongside Henry Czerny's Eugene Kittridge and Cary Elwes' Denlinger, and it would have been fun to have her presence enhance the depth of canon in the scene given her history in the franchise. If one wants to look at her absence from the most positive point of view, however, it can be pointed out that she gets spared being knocked unconscious by the smoke bomb that is activated by an infiltrator (that's as spoiler-y as I'll get for those of you who have not yet seen the film).
Fortunately, just because Angela Bassett's Erika Sloane isn't in Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1 doesn't mean that her time with the franchise is at an end. Obviously there's at least one more title on the way (Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 2, which is presently scheduled for release in June 2024), and there is no plan to have that film be the finale. Addressing the potential to see Sloane again in a future Mission: Impossible sequel, Christopher McQuarrie said,
And we’re not done with Angela Bassett… Angela is too fabulous, you could never ever let Angela get away. So there’s always a plan in the future.
For now, fans can go see Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1 and at least appreciate the Angela Bassett Easter egg that comes in the form of a portrait that can be spotted hanging on the wall during Denlinger's meeting. The movie is now playing in theaters everywhere, and you should certainly make an effort to see it on the biggest screen possible to get the most out of it.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZXMtY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbWNxdWFycmllLWFuZ2VsYS0yMTA5MzEwNzcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,"Tom Cruise Refused to End ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’ on a Cliffhanger, Told the Director: ‘It’s Got to Be Satisfying’","SPOILER ALERT: This story discusses the ending of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” currently playing in theaters. “Dead Reckoning,” the seventh installment of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, is the latest Hollywood blockbuster to be split into two movies, but Tom Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie tried their hardest to give “Part One” a non-cliffhanger […]","SPOILER ALERT: This story discusses the ending of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” currently playing in theaters.
“Dead Reckoning,” the seventh installment of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, is the latest Hollywood blockbuster to be split into two movies, but Tom Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie tried their hardest to give “Part One” a non-cliffhanger conclusion. The filmmaker recently told Total Film magazine that thinking about how to conclude the first of two movies kept Cruise up at night during the filming of “Part One.”
More from Variety
“Where we ended the movie was always where we were going to end it,” McQuarrie said of the train action sequence. “How we ended the movie was a big, big mystery for us. It kept Tom awake at night throughout production. He would come in all the time and say, ‘This can’t be a cliffhanger, it’s got to be satisfying.’ The audience has to feel a sense of completion.”
McQuarrie continued, “Tom kept looking at that scene, and he had all this anxiety about whether or not it would be a satisfying conclusion or whether it would feel open-ended. We constantly revisited it, constantly refined it.”
Unlike “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” which threw moviegoers a curveball by ending on a massive cliffhanger (its second part, “Beyond the Spider-Verse,” arrives in March 2024), “Dead Reckoning Part One” ends with Cruise’s Ethan Hunt achieving his immediate goal (he secures the key to unlock the source code of The Entity, the film’s villainous AI program) and Hayley Atwell’s Grace accepting an offer to join the IMF. There are dangling plot threads for “Part Two” to pick up (chief among them being that the film’s human villain, Esai Morales’ Gabriel, is still alive), but at least one mission has reached its definitive end. This is a far more conclusive ending than “Spider-Verse,” which leaves viewers hanging as Miles Morales is stuck in an alternate universe with the Prowler-version of himself.
Story continues
“If you leave it with a cliffhanger, it feels a little bit like we’re expecting you to come back,” McQuarrie told Total Film. “We didn’t want that feeling. The feeling we were reaching for — and we hope you feel — is we dare you not to come back. We want to leave you thinking, ‘Oh, I can’t wait to see what happens next.'”
“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is now playing theaters nationwide from Paramount Pictures. “Part Two” is set to open on June 28, 2024.

2023-07-02 19:30:00+00:00,‘We argue all the time’: Tom Cruise’s director on managing the world’s biggest star,A tense conversation with Tom Cruise before he rides a motorcycle off a cliff? All in a day’s work for Mission Impossible director Christopher McQuarrie.,"The film hits cinemas on July 8, but pre-production started in 2019 before experiencing significant delays due to the pandemic. Shot with a budget of $290 million, it is set to be one of the year’s biggest box office releases, a film designed to drag audiences back into cinemas. Completing his own stunt work has become a part of the Cruise mythology. According to McQuarrie, that has been the aim of his leading man all along. “These are the kinds of movies we need right now, we’re looking at an industry hanging on by its fingernails, and Tom is doing everything he can to bring people back to the theatre,” he says. That’s no understatement. From driving motorbikes off cliffs to base jumping onto a moving train, Dead Reckoning is a testament to Cruise’s willingness to try anything once. “We actually did the cliff thing six times,” laughs McQuarrie.
Completing his own stunt work has become a part of the Cruise mythology; he famously broke his right ankle during a roof-jumping stunt on Mission: Impossible 6. For a director, it sounds like a working nightmare, a hugely famous lead determined to do everything himself. “It’s stressful, but I wouldn’t have it any other way, and neither would Tom; it’s all very considered,” says McQuarrie. “The other day, someone made a comment about him being fearless, and he said, ‘It’s not that I am not scared; it’s that I don’t mind being scared,’ and that’s the difference. People assume Tom Cruise is a daredevil, but he’s just dedicated to confronting the fear.’” At 61, Cruise may soon need to confront a different fear; getting older. He remains the world’s most bankable and daring action star, with contemporaries like Stallone and Schwarzenegger no longer vying for box office dollars.
But with Dead Reckoning set to be a two-part epic, might Cruise call it a day after this? “Even if I knew the answer to that question, I couldn’t be sure because I’ve learned that with Mission: Impossible and with Tom, you just don’t know what will happen when we wrap,” says McQuarrie. Should the impossible become possible and age catches up with Cruise, the franchise could have ready-made replacements in British actress Atwell and French Avengers star Klementieff. Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell, Tom Cruise and Pom Klementieff. Atwell plays Grace, a sleight-of-hand expert who ends up working alongside Ethan Hunt, while Klementieff is Paris, a French assassin tasked with hunting the pair. Both hold their own in Dead Reckoning, undergoing five months of intense training before filming commenced.
“I certainly learned a lot, but this series is so synonymous with Tom; if there were a spin-off, it wouldn’t be the classic Mission: Impossible world,” says Atwell. Loading “There would have to be some understanding that it is new territory, but it could work; I don’t know if I am prepared to jump off a cliff. Klementieff agrees, adding: “The way the females are developed makes them powerful and have their agency; they never depend on the man, they aren’t girlfriends, and much of that comes down to what Tom wants.” “I don’t know what the future holds, but I will always be ready to play Paris.”
How Dead Reckoning Part One will perform remains to be seen, but the bar has been set high. The previous MI film, Fallout, had a total worldwide gross of US$791 million against a production budget of $178 million, becoming the franchise’s highest-grossing film so far. Dead Reckoning opens two weeks before both Barbie and Oppenheimer, two of the other most hyped films of the year. But if he’s feeling the pressure, McQuarrie does an excellent job of hiding it. Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie on the set of the new Mission: Impossible film. “Ultimately, Barbie and Oppenheimer are also movies made by people who want to make movies for the audience, not an audience, and that is the smart thing; that’s what we’re all trying to do; more power to them.” Hard to argue with that.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbWguY29tLmF1L2N1bHR1cmUvbW92aWVzL3dlLWFyZ3VlLWFsbC10aGUtdGltZS10b20tY3J1aXNlLXMtZGlyZWN0b3Itb24tbWFuYWdpbmctdGhlLXdvcmxkLXMtYmlnZ2VzdC1zdGFyLTIwMjMwNzAyLXA1ZGw1di5odG1s0gGLAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNtaC5jb20uYXUvY3VsdHVyZS9tb3ZpZXMvd2UtYXJndWUtYWxsLXRoZS10aW1lLXRvbS1jcnVpc2Utcy1kaXJlY3Rvci1vbi1tYW5hZ2luZy10aGUtd29ybGQtcy1iaWdnZXN0LXN0YXItMjAyMzA3MDItcDVkbDV2Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

McQuarrie recalled dropping the word ""uncharted"" in a post about Rogue Nation and getting misinterpreted.

Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is now playing in theaters, and its opening weekend brought in a franchise-best $235 million at the worldwide box office. The two-part movie reportedly serves as a send-off for Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt, with the first half of the story setting the stage for the sequel, due out in 2024.
The reception to Mission: Impossible's Dead Reckoning chapter has been positive so far. IGN's review of Part One praised McQuarrie for creating ""an explosive yet self-reflexive action saga that leaves you wanting more"", with his third outing of the series proving that ""he still has an ingenious bag of tricks to pull from"".

2023-07-17 20:33:14+00:00,Vanessa Kirby and Hayley Atwell Explain How ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning’ Pulled Off That Thrilling Mask Sequence,'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning' stars Vanessa Kirby and Hayley Atwell and editor Eddie Hamilton explain the franchise's thrilling mask reveal.,"SPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” now playing in theaters.
The “Mission: Impossible” movies have no shortage of death-defying stunts, but the Tom Cruise-starring action franchise is known for another iconic magic trick: its mask reveals.
“Dead Reckoning Part One” features two mask reveals — in the first, Cruise’s Ethan Hunt uses a mask to infiltrate a meeting between CIA director Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny) and officials from various intelligence agencies about a rogue artificial intelligence system, known as the Entity. The other is a face swap between Hayley Atwell’s Grace, a pickpocket who becomes embroiled in IMF’s hunt for the Entity, and Vanessa Kirby’s black-market arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis, aka the White Widow.
“It was so much fun. It was the first time two women have got to do that,” Kirby told Variety on the red carpet at the film’s New York premiere.
“It was such an amazing gift — because I love Hayley — to channel her and get to play her for a bit, and to get to play somebody that was totally out of control,” she continued. “My character is usually so restrained and composed and in control; it was really, really fun to play someone a bit scrappier and a bit messier. I’m naturally more messy in real life, so I felt more at home in that sense.”
In a separate interview, Atwell echoed Kirby’s excitement, sharing that the two became particularly close while training together for the film amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “We both have a background in theater, and we’re both British, and we had mutual friends,” Atwell said.
There’s something so satisfying about watching Ethan or another character (i.e. Simon Pegg’s IMF field agent Benji or the villainous Dougray Scott posing as Ethan) rip off their prosthetic disguise to reveal themselves to a shocked party. But pulling off those scenes requires as much technical skill from the filmmakers as it showcases the actor’s versatility. (The late Philip Seymour Hoffman’s take on Cruise’s super spy persona Ethan Hunt when they pull a switcheroo during “Mission: Impossible III” is an absolute master class.)
“We’re always trying to come up with new and original ways of doing it because it’s a signature ‘Mission: Impossible’ move,” said Oscar-winning film editor Eddie Hamilton, who boarded the franchise with 2015’s “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation” and continued on with 2018’s “Fallout” and the two-part “Dead Reckoning.”
Hamilton teased that there was a third mask reveal which landed on the cutting room floor “because it no longer had relevance” in the larger story. The scene was near the beginning of the movie and got nixed because it undercut the significance of Ethan’s big moment.
“It was the right decision, ultimately,” Hamilton said of scrapping the scene. “There are quite a lot of people who’ve never seen a ‘Mission: Impossible’ movie who might be coming to see this because of the goodwill of ‘Top Gun: Maverick,’ so that [first scene] is a great moment to have a mask reveal, because you’re like ‘What the hell is going on?’”

The mask moment between Grace and Alanna comes as part of “Dead Reckoning’s” complex final scheme, where Ethan and Grace must infiltrate a meeting between the White Widow and her mysterious buyer on board the Orient Express as a last ditch-effort to obtain the key to access the Entity’s source code.
The plan — Grace will go to the meeting disguised as Alanna, while Ethan assumes the identity of her brother, Zola. To do that, they must board the train without being recognized, tranquilize Alanna and Zola, meet the buyer, acquire the completed key and get off the train undetected. It’s a ruse that’d require everything to go perfectly to succeed, but when the mask machine breaks, the team must improvise, with Grace going in alone and Ethan boarding while the train is in motion.
Accomplishing the scene required some moviemaking tricks. The reason why Alanna’s face looks so perfect when being created by the mask machine is because it’s actually Kirby’s face, with her body hidden out of frame.
“Her body’s down there,” Hamilton said, motioning below the frame of his Zoom camera. “She’s keeping her eyes sharp, and the VFX team put the edge of the briefcase in across her neck and painted her out of the shot.”
Then there’s a hidden wipe between Atwell putting on the White Widow mask and Kirby standing in the mirror as “The Gray Widow” (the nickname filmmakers gave to the in-disguise character).
“What’s so elegant about it is there’s two stitches,” Hamilton said. “But you don’t realize what you’re seeing until [Grace] walks up to the mirror, and you’re like ‘Wait, what? How did that happen? That was completely seamless.'”
The trickery of the scene, Hamilton explained, is to make moviegoers feel like they’re starting their journey into the third act of the movie, but it’s a ruse. “We’re having fun with the audience’s expectations of how these films play out, which is great,” he adds.
Beyond the mechanics of the sequence, the White Widow mask moment allowed Kirby to flex her acting chops. When discussing the scene, Atwell heaped praise on Kirby’s mimicry of her mannerisms and pointed to a small tell in her co-star’s performance that distinguished the transition from Alanna to Grace.
“There’s an echo gesture that she does: when I fall backwards on the tracks in the little Fiat 500, I sort of blow hair out of my face, [Vanessa] then does it as she comes out of the cabin as Grace playing the White Widow,” Atwell explained. “She sees her brother there and she does it as well, and there’s a different kind of manic energy in her eyes. That’s all Vanessa studying me a little bit and having a great time. It is remarkable.”
In addition to being a fun visual gag, the sequence also serves as part of Grace’s redemption arc. (Originally, there was a version of this scene where Grace tranquilized Ethan, Luther [Ving Rhames] and Benji and boarded the train on her own to “try to get money from the buyer and maybe bargain her way out of the situation she’s in,” Hamilton said. “But the test audience didn’t really like that idea, so we came up with this idea.”)
Grace’s decision not to take the money was “her moment of reckoning,” Atwell said, crediting Kirby with pulling off that pivotal turn, which sets up the character’s future in part two. “I love that moment,” Atwell said of the way her fellow actor played the scene. “That’s Vanessa being brilliant and being able to show off her range.”
And the mask itself was also a helpful prop for Atwell to demonstrate Grace’s new state of mind. In fact, the way Grace strips off the Gray Widow mask at the end of the sequence was intended to feel a bit like “an exorcism.”
“It’s like I’m throwing [it] away. Like I just don’t like the version of myself I was when I had the mask on, and I’m getting it out of my system,” Atwell explained. “I’m taking off the old identity of who Grace was from the first half of the movie, when she realizes, ‘If I had taken the money, it would have been more than the key I was giving away.’”
These interviews were conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike began.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2ZlYXR1cmVzL21pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS03LXZhbmVzc2Eta2lyYnktaGF5bGV5LWF0d2VsbC1tYXNrLXNjZW5lLXRyYWluLTEyMzU2NzE1ODkv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vZmVhdHVyZXMvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLTctdmFuZXNzYS1raXJieS1oYXlsZXktYXR3ZWxsLW1hc2stc2NlbmUtdHJhaW4tMTIzNTY3MTU4OS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

The British actress, who co-stars with Cruise in the upcoming action thriller “Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One,” opened up about past speculation that she dated Cruise in an interview with The Independent published Saturday.
Atwell, who is engaged to music producer Ned Wolfgang Kelly, said she views Cruise and “Dead Reckoning” director Christopher McQuarrie as ""sort of two uncles.""
""I would be like, ‘Ooh, there’s some weird rumors, and it feels base. It feels a little dirty,"" Atwell told the British outlet. ""It feels grubby. It’s not what I’m about. Why are things being assumed or projected onto me about my relationship with my work colleague and boss?""
Atwell added that she found the rumors ""upsetting"" because of the scrutiny it brought to her private life.
""It’s involving people in my actual life, my personal life, who have to be on the receiving end of that,"" Atwell said. ""It becomes invasive.""
'Impeccably made':'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One' lauded for action-packed drama
Marking the seventh installment in the iconic ""M:I"" franchise, ""Dead Reckoning Part One"" follows Cruise’s secret agent Ethan Hunt as he faces off against ""The Entity,"" an evolving form of artificial intelligence that threatens global security. Atwell plays enigmatic thief Grace in the film. The pair becomes an effective duo, navigating a wild car chase through Rome in a tiny Fiat and a hellacious train trip on the Orient Express.
""Dead Reckoning"" has earned rave reviews from critics for its stunning action sequences and compelling performances. Erik Davis of Fandango called the film an ""impeccably made action film that does not stop entertaining.""
""Each action sequence is long, crazy and intense,"" Davis wrote on Twitter. ""The story is big and sprawling, but I like how it both felt complete and left you dying for what comes next.""
Perri Nemiroff of Collider said the film is ""another winner for the franchise,"" including the addition of Atwell’s character. ""She can do it all. Action, comedy, a capable hero in many respects while trying to get her sea legs in others,"" Nemiroff tweeted.
USA TODAY film critic Brian Truitt gave the film three out of four stars, writing that while ""Dead Reckoning"" is chock-full of gloriously bonkers stunt sequences, its technological villain introduces some narrative obstacles.
""If you choose to accept this 'Mission' – and what action-movie fan or Cruise nerd wouldn’t, really – it’s the first half of a man vs. machine epic that doesn’t skimp in the thrills department,"" Truitt wrote. ""Just don’t think too hard about it, though you’ll probably still give serious side-eye to your laptop.""

2023-07-24 03:15:07+00:00,‘Mission: Impossible’ Box Office: Can ‘Dead Reckoning’ Rebound From Barbenheimer?,'Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning' tumbled a series-worst 64 percent as 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' turned into weapons of box office mass destruction.,"Tom Cruise, the star who is credited with saving the box office after Top Gun: Maverick flew to $1.5 billion in global ticket sales, is now facing another kind of reckoning — surviving the Barbenheimer effect.
His Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One tumbled a franchise-worst 64 percent to $19.5 million in its second weekend when going up against Barbie and Oppenheimer, whose dual arrivals transformed into a cultural phenomenon and propelled the domestic box office to historic heights. Revenue for the July 21-23 weekend was the fourth-biggest of all time; in addition, it was the first time ever that one movie opened to $100 million or more and another to $50 million or more. Barbie scored $155 million, followed by $80.5 million for Oppenheimer. No one in Hollywood anticipated such a staggering turnout.
The seventh installment in Paramount and Skydance’s storied Mission: Impossible series, which finished Sunday with a domestic total of $118.8 million, had hoped to earn as much as $25 million in its second outing.
The question now is whether Dead Reckoning Part One can level out and enjoy a long run as other series installments have done, and just as Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick did. Executives across Hollywood, and not just at Paramount, aren’t ruling Dead Reckoning out just yet, especially since it has a better critics’ score on Rotten Tomatoes than Barbie and Oppenheimer, as well as strong audience exit scores.
“I don’t think the story has yet been written,” says one executive at a rival studio.
Mission: Impossible pics have never sported mega-openings, yet expectations were high for Dead Reckoning after Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick opened to $160.5 million over Memorial Day weekend in 2022, including $126.7 million for the three days. Dead Reckoning had been tracking to open to $90 million in its first five days beginning July 12; instead, it took in a franchise-best $78.5 million, not adjusted for inflation.
Titles in the Mission franchise have always drawn a larger percentage of their global gross from the foreign box office. Dead Reckoning Part One is no exception. It earned another $55 million from 72 markets in its second weekend for a foreign tally of $252.1 million and $370.9 million globally through Sunday. It is doing especially well in Asia, where Barbie and Oppenheimer aren’t strong players. And in a number of markets, it is pacing 15 percent or more ahead of 2018’s Mission: Impossible — Fallout. In Japan, it debuted to $7.9 million, 23 percent ahead of Fallout, which earned a franchise-best $571.5 million overseas for a global total of $791.7 million, including $220.2 million in North America.
Mission: Impossible 7 had to contend with losing Imax screens for three weeks to Oppenheimer, in addition to losing premium large-format screens to both Oppenheimer and Barbie. The upcharge for Imax and PLFs is significant and can have a big impact on the bottom line. In early July, Imax screens were dedicated to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
Cruise’s latest movie, directed by Christopher McQuarrie, cost nearly $300 million to produce and saw its release date delayed numerous times because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was initially set to open in summer of 2021, then summer or fall of 2022. Its release date ultimately landed on mid-July of this year, a date dictated by the shooting schedule of Dead Reckoning Part Two and Cruise’s availability to promote Part One (the actor is known for his global marketing efforts).
Adds another observer: “Barbenheimer siphoned off MI7′s potential this weekend, with Oppenheimer drawing older males away from Dead Reckoning. Not only that, Sound of Freedom is an unexpected force to be reckoned with and is presenting competition from an unlikely source.”
Estimates for the U.S. box office show Angel Studios’ faith-based political thriller Sound of Freedom beating Dead Reckoning for the weekend with $20.1 million for a cume of $123.4 million (Sound of Freedom opened July 4), according to Comscore. Paramount and other studios show Dead Reckoning beating Sound of Freedom; Monday actuals will determine the order.
Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part Two is set to open in theaters June 28, 2024. McQuarrie and Cruise have shot much of the movie, but production is now halted because of the SAG-AFTRA strike in another moment of reckoning for the storied action franchise.
Things looked different in late June, when Cruise — Hollywood’s highest-profile advocate for the theatrical experience — urged audiences to see Dial of Destiny. And, yes, two other movies in a surprisingly effective plea. Wrote the actor on Instagram : “I love a double feature, and it doesn’t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiZW5oZWltZXItMTIzNTU0MzYwMi_SAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3MvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYmFyYmVuaGVpbWVyLTEyMzU1NDM2MDIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-11 13:48:47+00:00,"Simon Pegg On What He Learned From ‘Mission: Impossible,’ Including Driving a Speed Boat","Movie interview, Simon Pegg: The actor on playing agent Benji Dunn in five 'Mission: Impossible' movies opposite Tom Cruise.","Before joining the IMF team in 2006’s Mission: Impossible III, Simon Pegg was best known as the quirky star of Shaun of the Dead. At the time, the British actor couldn’t have imagined that he’d go on to play the globe-trotting, death-defying agent Benji Dunn in five movies opposite Tom Cruise. But in Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, Benji remains an integral character, aiding Cruise’s Ethan Hunt in the frantic search for their new foe, an AI dubbed “The Entity.” Pegg and Cruise are joined by a group of newcomers and M:I regulars, including Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, Esai Morales, Vanessa Kirby, Pom Klementieff and Henry Czerny, in what is being called the series’ best film so far.
For Pegg, the Christopher McQuarrie-helmed action flick was an opportunity to both learn new skills and hone in on the emotional truth of his character, who nearly died at the end of 2018’s Mission: Impossible – Fallout. It was also a chance to watch Cruise do even more insane stunts, like drive a motorcycle off a cliff in pursuit of a train. Here Pegg discusses his history with Mission: Impossible, working with Cruise and why he hopes fans will go see this one in theaters.
When you were initially approached about the role of Benji, how was he presented to you?
I remember J.J. Abrams called me up at my office. I was writing Hot Fuzz with Edgar Wright and the call came in that J.J. Abrams was on the phone. I was vaguely aware of him as the guy that did Alias. In his inimitable way, rather than an offer coming through my reps, he just called me and said, “Hey, do you want to come be in Mission: Impossible III? I’ve got this really fun part for you.” I’d never been in a Hollywood movie and I was flattered and terrified. He just said, “He’s Ethan’s tech guy. He works in the lab and you’ve got this really great scene and I’d love you to come and do it.” And that was pretty much the brief that I got. Then after M:I III came out, I got a call about a year later suggesting Benji be a field agent.
Was Benji becoming a field agent in Ghost Protocol nerve-wracking for you?
I was at a certain point in my life when I was ready for it. It was a new beginning for me. Tom had said to me, “You know, you gotta get in shape for this. You’ve got to be an agent, so we’ll get trained and stuff.” I was so up for it. I remember going into Prague to shoot the scenes that were supposed to be in Red Square in Russia and joining a gym and getting really, really into my fitness and fight training. It was genuinely exciting. I welcomed it with open arms.
What’s made you keep coming back to these movies and to Benji over the years?
It’s such a privilege as an actor to be given the opportunity to build on a character. When it’s with a film series, you get to do it over a longer period of time. If you’re playing a character in a TV show, that evolution is constant, whereas with this you get to readdress him or her every time you come to do another film and evolve them forensically. That’s a real gift. It’s always a no-brainer to say yes.
Do you get a script when a new movie comes up or just a call?
MQ—Christopher McQuarrie—will say, “Hey, let’s go for dinner.” And we sit and we talk and he explains everything that he has planned and the basic story. It’s always the most exciting, fun dinner to have. I love McQ. We are such nerds together, like movie nerds. All we talk about is movies. And when we’re talking about our movie it’s even more exciting. So nowadays, because of the way we work, McQ has the structure and the story and the big events worked out and then he’ll let the locations we go to tell him the story that we’re going to tell as the film progresses. So it’s less about having a completed script and more about an idea of what’s going to happen.
Even if there’s not a script, do you discuss how Benji has evolved and where he is emotionally in the film?
McQ and I talked at length about where Benji would be for this one and in terms of what had happened to him previously where he was almost killed and came very, very close to being vaporized in a nuclear fire. We wanted all of that to weigh on Benji a bit. He knows that the only family he really has is his friends or the people around him. He’s made the choice to become this IMF agent and it’s like the priesthood or something, where you reject your normal life to join this thing. At this stage in the film, he’s fully matured and is much more of an accomplished agent. He’s less of the wet-behind-the-ears new guy that he was in Ghost Protocol.
In Dead Reckoning, what was interesting to you about the idea of the villain being an AI?
When McQ told me that back in 2019, I felt like, “Oh, that’s a cool idea. It’s very Mission Impossible.” There’s always been a strong technology thread in Mission Impossible, and it felt very on brand. But then in the three years that have elapsed, it’s become such a talking point. It’s not a new idea—we can go back to HAL and The Matrix and all those films that have toyed with AI before. But we haven’t seen it depicted at a time when it’s getting close to that. The IMF are all about subterfuge and inventing truths to entrap people and wearing masks. The Entity feels like it’s the super IMF. They’re coming up against themselves, but times one thousand.
In Mission: Impossible, the characters get scared and injured and even die. What feels exciting about being in an action movie where you’re not playing someone who is a superhero?
The stakes are immediately higher. The moment you start to enter fantasy realms, death and vulnerability start to have no meaning. There’s a place for that, and there’s a whole genre of those kinds of characters, but what you get with a more human story is more relatability. You get the fact that if Ethan doesn’t make that jump, then he’s going to die. He’s not just going to hit the ground, roll over, and stand in a cool position. That brings it all a little bit closer to home for us as the audience.
How many of your own stunts do you do?
As much as I can. Luckily for Benji, mostly what I do is sit behind the computer and tell Tom where to go, which I’m not complaining about in any way. But I drove that boat around the Venice Canals—I had to learn to do that. The basic theory is that when you hand it over to a stunt professional, they just do the stunt. They can’t act. They just have to do the physical action. And so you can’t really get a performance in the midst of a stunt. What Tom’s really keyed into is the idea that if the actor does the stunt, then the performance never stops. So I never want there to be a moment when it switches to someone else and I can’t do my own physical action or comedy or whatever. Tom really leads from the front with that.
Had you ever driven a boat before?
I learned to drive a twin engine speedboat for Fallout. So I had some experience. But the thing about driving a boat around Venice is the canals are just so narrow and the boats are so expensive. You can’t afford to grind against a concrete jetty. You also have to drive into the future a little bit. Like every move you make happens two seconds later. So it’s a really, really complicated thing to do. But it was so much fun. I’d never been to Venice. So to get there and immediately go out on the Grand Canal with [stunt coordinator] Wade [Eastwood] and start driving around a little course—that’s a dream come true.
When it’s time for Tom to do one of these big stunts, like drive a motorcycle off a cliff, are you on the set for it?
Yeah. Actually, if you look on my Instagram, I put up a video that I took on the day on my phone, which is basically us watching Tom do it and our reactions, which are hysterical. In the moment, you don’t know what’s gonna happen. I’ve been there for so many of Tom’s big stunts and there’s always a degree of uncertainty. However hard he trains, no matter how brilliant our stunt team are, you can’t account for a crosswind or a bit of grit coming off the ramp and going into the eye or something. So it’s a pretty terrifying experience. But my God, it’s exhilarating.
I don’t know if I could handle watching it.
What I’ve learned over the years is it’s easier to be there than it is to not. If you’re back at base and you’re just wondering what’s happening, it’s much worse.
Tom talks a lot about the importance of seeing movies in the theater. Is that a sentiment you share?
One hundred percent. I’m such a believer in the cinematic experiences as a democratizing force. People talk about the cinema as, “See it on the big screen.” The only reason the big screen is there is so that so many people can watch it at the same time. And it’s vitally important for us as a society to share stuff like that because we’re living in such a divisive time when we’re all pulling away from each other. We’re all becoming more insular because we’re constantly on our devices. We’re getting into fights online about the silliest things. And yet, the cinema is a place where you can sit with 300 people, none of whom you might have anything in common with, and you get this moment of shared emotion, which is the glue that holds us together. It’s a tribe and I think our tribes are disbanding the more we fracture in society. I feel like cinema, theater and any sort of shared experience, music—they’re vitally important for us and for our survival. I know that sounds slightly hyperbolic, but I believe it.
What was the last movie you saw in a theater?
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. There’s a lot of talk at the moment—and it’s online rubbish—about there being some kind of rivalry between all the big tentpole films of the summer, but it’s just not true. I’m just rooting for everybody because it’s important that everybody does well. I’m gonna go see Barbie, I’m gonna go see Oppenheimer, I’m gonna go see Asteroid City. I’m gonna go and see everything I can. Because it’s important for the survival of our industry that we all get out to the cinema. It’s not a competition; it’s art.
Have you started filming the second part of Dead Reckoning yet?
Yes. We were shooting them simultaneously. So we were still shooting parts of Part One when we’d already started shooting Part Two. And it’s got to be ready for next year, so we hit the ground running as soon as we come off the press tour. I’m gonna have the peculiar experience of promoting a film and then going back to shooting that same film.
Will this actually be the last Mission: Impossible film?
I think it’s the end of a certain phase of Mission: Impossible, but I doubt very much it is the end of Mission: Impossible. It’s too vivacious. And I’m not sure we’ve left ourselves anywhere to go. I was talking to McQ this morning about our 99 percent Rotten Tomatoes score. What do we do? We’ve only got one percent to play with. If we don’t pull in 100 percent for Part Two, everyone’s gonna be like, “Oh, well, it didn’t do as well.” We’ve set the bar too high!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvc2ltb24tcGVnZy1vbi13aGF0LWhlLWxlYXJuZWQtZnJvbS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtaW5jbHVkaW5nLWRyaXZpbmctYS1zcGVlZC1ib2F0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-07 13:22:00-07:00,Mission Impossible Director Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise Argue About You,"Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise argued all the time during the making of Mission Impossible – Dead Reckoning — about how to keep you, the viewer,","Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise argued all the time during the making of Mission Impossible – Dead Reckoning — about how to keep you, the viewer, entertained for every second of the film.
“I get asked all the time, ‘Do you and Tom ever argue?’ Yes, we argue every single day on your behalf. It’s not about my vision or Tom’s vision. It’s about your experience,” McQuarrie told MovieMaker.
McQuarrie has directed two previous films in the series, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and Mission: Impossible – Fallout, and his stunning track record with Cruise goes back to 2008’s Valkyrie, which McQuarrie co-wrote. He first directed Cruise in 2012’s Jack Reacher.
Joining the fast-moving Mission: Impossible franchise nearly a decade ago meant trying to keep up a goal of making every movie outdo the last. Loud, gorgeous, and heartfelt, their films are like the grandest of operas with the finest musicians performing. Sometimes they get close to the stratosphere — as in the HALO jump for Fallout.
But for an especially thrilling scene in Dead Reckoning, they imposed a limitation (and some mild spoilers follow): putting Cruise behind the wheel of a tiny Fiat for a race through Rome.
“You lose all sense of time because you’re going so fast. It’s so dangerous,” McQuarrie told MovieMaker. “Filming car chases is very chaotic. We were in Rome for a little over two weeks, with only three or four hours to film at some locations.”
Here’s our Q&A with McQuarrie about how research begets more research, how a little Zed camera can create a depth of perception, and the perils of chasing a stone downhill.
Sonya Alexander: How do you prepare the visual language for a film like Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One?
Christopher McQuarrie: We were very determined to make a very different film from the previous Mission Impossibles. We want to keep the notion alive that these films evolve visually, from the first film all the way through to the present. A lot of that was looking back on it. Looking at what had worked. Looking at what we could improve upon.
I worked with cinematographer Frasar Taggart, our gaffer Martin Smith who does all of our lighting, and Jonathan “Chunky” Richmond, my first assistant camera operator… We were a little bit of a brain trust in constantly finding ways to keep the camera moving and keep the scenes alive. And always creating a little sense of instability in the story because of the chaos in the narrative.
Christopher McQuarrie on Shooting the Fiat Chase
Sonya Alexander: Do you have any particular cameras you like to use for action sequences, like the Fiat chase?
Christopher McQuarrie: It’s less about the cameras and more about the lenses. In this particular sequence, for the chase in Rome, we used what was called a Zed cam. It is a very small, very flexible, very versatile camera. And larger cameras simply wouldn’t have worked because the Fiat itself is simply so small.

We tried putting a full-sized camera on it and it was bigger than the car itself. I don’t know if you remember The Flintstones, when they put the food tray on the car… that’s literally what it looked like when you put cameras on it. You couldn’t see through the windshield.
And that’s how we make these movies. The action dictates the kind of camera that we’re working with. We explore every medium. What it comes right down to is what camera can get the job done and in many cases what camera can survive.
Sonya Alexander: What was the biggest challenge of doing the submarine scene?
Christopher McQuarrie: The biggest challenge of the submarine scene was that a lot of what you are seeing is inside a space with no windows. There’s no way to see outside. There’s no way to create a three-dimensional geography. You don’t really know where the submarine is in three- dimension space. All of our action sequences are about geography.
It was about creating the instruments inside the submarine to get a sense of how the submariners felt the world around them and understood 3D space. And all of that blocking is meant to put you in a submarine the way the crew would be there and creating that sense of spatial awareness.
The other thing is it’s just a very cramped environment, built on a gimbal. The set could roll twenty degrees in all directions. It was very challenging. It was a very tight space. A lot of those actors weren’t terribly experienced. In fact, one of the actors, it was his first time on camera. They were extraordinary. Over the course of shooting that scene, they really became the crew.

A ‘Little Spoiler’ About Mission Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part 2
Sonya Alexander: When you do the research for these films, do you come across info that inspires future storylines?
Christopher McQuarrie: Yes, absolutely. The submarine was a really good example of one. The research we were doing for that particular sequence inspired what’s going to happen with the rest of the story, particularly as it relates to submarines. There’s a little spoiler for you.
Sonya Alexander: What is the greatest strength of this film compared to the others?
Christopher McQuarrie: I think that every film that Tom and I do takes all of the knowledge that we’ve acquired from the previous films, and we apply it to that film. So, you’re watching a film that’s benefitting from all the previous Mission Impossibles, Edge of Tomorrow, Top Gun: Maverick.
Everything we’ve learned, we’ve applied it here and we never stop. We never believe that we know everything. We’re constantly confronting each other, confronting the narrative, and we’re always trying to learn. We never get too comfortable to think that we’ve got it all figured out. When you think you know what you’re doing, that’s when you get surprised.

Christopher McQuarrie on Arguing With Tom Cruise
Sonya Alexander: You’ve collaborated with Tom a lot. What do you enjoy most about your collaborations?
Christopher McQuarrie: There’s no ego. There is no particular set of rules other than you’ve got to entertain the audience. We need to engage the audience every single instant of the movie. In a strange way, the audience is there with us in every story meeting, in every test screening, in the editing room, on the set.
You’re making the movie with us because we’re constantly thinking about what your experience is going to be. And it makes it a very democratic process. It’s not really about who’s right and who’s wrong. It’s all about what’s right for the audience. That allows us to eliminate conflict.
If he has an idea that I don’t understand or I have an idea that he doesn’t understand, we just proceed and take it on its natural course and it either works or it doesn’t. But ultimately, it’s about whether or not you’re having a good time in the movie. I get asked all the time, “Do you and Tom ever argue?” Yes, we argue every single day on your behalf. It’s not about my vision or Tom’s vision. It’s about your experience.
Sonya Alexander: Since you’re the writer and director, what pressures do you feel to actualize the visuals and story from the page?
Christopher McQuarrie: The way I like to describe it — writing is pushing a boulder up a mountain, directing is running down the mountain with the boulder after you. Everybody is waiting for you when you’re the screenwriter. They’re all waiting for those pages. It’s the blueprint for how the movie is made.
It’s a very lonely and solitary place to be. And when you’re directing, the clock starts. The firehose is on, and you have to drink from it. You’re responsible not only for the enormous budget of the film, but you’re also responsible for the safety of all of the people around you. It’s a lot to balance on the head of a pin.
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One arrives in theaters, including IMAX, on Wednesday.

“I've been a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible franchise, of Christopher McQuarrie, of Tom Cruise. So when I was handcuffed with Tom in a scene (while shooting for Dead Reckoning), I said, “Wow, I'm in a Tom Cruise movie!” And he responded with, “No no, I'm in a Hailey Atwell movie!” That's just how Tom is. He's so generous, always bolsters people to do better,” Hailey said in an video by Mulderville USA.
On Tom and Christopher's style of working
“Tom and McQ's working relationship has been forged over 16 years of friendship and a deep understanding and appreciation of film. The technical sides of it, but also about storytelling. I've come into their orbit at a time when there's so much finesse in how they communicate on set. They're sort of mind reading. Tom would say, ‘Hey McQ’ and he'd say, ‘Yeah, I agree.' And you'd be like, ‘What?’ (laughs) So they both challenge each other. They're both individually very strong-willed leaders, and yet they complement each other because it's a foundation of utter respect for what the other can do professionally. They have a symbiotic relationship, they come hand in hand.”

Hayley is best known for playing Peggy Carter, Steve Rogers' love interest, in the Captain America franchise and Russo Brothers' Avengers franchise of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. She also played Captain Carter in Marvel shows Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Agent Carter. Her last appearance as Peggy Carter or Captain Carter was in Sam Raimi's MCU film Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness last year.
She'll lend her voice to the iconic character of Lara Croft in the upcoming animated adaptation of Tomb Raider.

,Mission: Impossible's Pom Klementieff talks Tom Cruise fight scene,'Guardians' star Pom Klementieff wanted Tom Cruise to kick her in the stomach for a 'Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One' fight scene. 'But he wouldn't do it.',"Tom Cruise got strapped to the outside of a plane for 2015's Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and rode a motorbike off a cliff for the latest sequel, Dead Reckoning Part One. But there is at least one thing the Top Gun star won't do in pursuit of on-screen verisimilitude while making the action franchise — kick Pom Klementieff in the stomach.
In the latest Mission: Impossible film, the Guardians of the Galaxy actress plays a highly dangerous character named Paris who is partnered with the movie's main antagonist, Gabriel, played by Esai Morales. During a sequence set in Venice, Paris has a fight with Cruise's super-spy Ethan Hunt and it was while shooting the encounter that Klementieff asked her co-star to give her a kick in the guts for real.
""I kept telling him to just kick me here,"" the actress recalls to EW, indicating her midsection. ""I was squeezing abs. [I said], 'You can just go for it.' He was like 'No, no, no, no, no.' I was like, 'But it's going to help me!' But he wouldn't do it.""
Pom Klementieff in 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One'. Christian Black/Paramount Pictures and Skydance
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One director Christopher McQuarrie cast Klementieff after seeing her playing Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 and describes her character as ""very, very, very much a chaotic element in the story. It doesn't matter how deep in the background she is, you're going to be watching her at all times and wondering what she's going to do."" The actress herself says that Paris is someone who ""destroys everything in her path. She's a rebel, she's a killer, she's extremely skilled and quite lonely too.""
Much of the destruction caused by the character takes place in Rome during a sequence in which a Humvee-driving Paris pursues Cruise's Ethan Hunt and Hayley Atwell's character, who are in a small yellow Fiat. ""I had so much fun shooting this scene,"" says the French actress. ""It was so special to be on location in Rome. We were shooting during COVID, so we were very lucky to be here. I was trying to not laugh too much because I was having so much fun in the car following the Fiat.""
Klementieff reveals that her character's name is a nod to the Great Paris, the magician-spy played by Star Trek actor Leonard Nimoy on the original Mission: Impossible TV show. ""When Christopher McQuarrie cast me for the role, he didn't know which name the character would have,"" she says. ""It was cool to name me Paris, me being from France, and then they decided that I would speak French because I speak French in real life.""

It is unlikely that Nimoy ever wore anything as eye-catching on the TV show as the looks sported by Klementieff in the movie.
""She's very different style-wise from every other actress in the Mission: Impossible franchise,"" Klementieff says. ""She has a side that's a bit more punk and she doesn't really give a f---. So that was cool.""
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One will release in theaters July 12.

2023-07-10 08:00:26+00:00,Mission: Impossible actor says Dead Reckoning is the biggest action movie of all time,Cary Elwes calls Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One the biggest action movie ever,"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning actor Cary Elwes has high praise for the latest instalment in the long-running action franchise.
""It’s not just probably the biggest action movie of all time, I think it’s also one of the most emotional action movies we’ve ever seen,"" Elwes, who plays Denlinger in Dead Reckoning, tells GamesRadar+ and Total Film.
""That was what blew me away. I was fully just expecting amazing stunts and cool locations, but the emotional journey the audience is going on is, for me, what sends it into a whole other stratosphere.""
Simon Pegg, who plays Benji in the series, agrees that Mission: Impossible’s scope and scale keeps getting bigger and bigger.
""It did feel different,"" Pegg says. ""Not just because we were making it when we made it, but you know Tom [Cruise] and [director Christopher McQuarrie] are never going to rest on what they’ve done before. They’re going to push it forward. Every film, when it ends, we get asked 'What’s next?' and we think, 'Well, what could we possibly do?'""
Despite the ""enormity"" of the movie, Elwes – who has appeared in everything from The Princess Bride to Stranger Things – was struck by how nonplussed director Christopher McQuarrie was by the globetrotting production.
""There was never a bead of sweat on his head, not once,"" Elwes reveals. ""We had to deal with all kinds of things then – COVID, all kinds of logistical things – that a huge production of this nature entails. The guy never broke a sweat. He was totally, totally chill the whole time. So he set the tone on-set and so everyone felt [like] this is great, this is just a fun day at work.""

7/15/2023 0:00,New 'Mission: Impossible' wows Chinese audiences,,"Hollywood megastar Tom Cruise has done it again with his new film ""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,"" which is filled with daring stunts, breathtaking action scenes, and his endless charisma. The film ignited wows from the audience at the China premiere in Beijing on Tuesday.

""We are constantly trying to build on every movie to bring you an absolutely unrivaled experience. Director Christopher McQuarrie and I have approached 'Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning' with that same commitment to practical filmmaking,"" Cruise said via a pre-recorded video before emphasizing how much he missed all his Chinese friends and fans.
Cruise visited China in 2018 to promote ""Mission: Impossible – Fallout."" However, the COVID-19 pandemic and its lingering aftermath have nearly halted overseas promotional tours to China by foreign cast and crew. Despite these challenges, Chinese movie fans have eagerly followed the progress of the new installment of the popular action franchise. The critically acclaimed film is now set for release in Chinese theaters in various formats, including IMAX, on July 14.
Over the course of its six installments and 27 years, the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise has gained popularity in China and holds significant relevance. The second installment was directed by Chinese director John Woo, while the third film, helmed by J.J. Abrams, was shot in Shanghai and the ancient water town of Xitang in Zhejiang province. China has imported nearly all of the ""Mission: Impossible"" installments, grossing a total of 2.9 billion yuan in the country. ""Fallout"" so far stands as the highest-grossing film in the franchise in China, earning 1.25 billion yuan.
""Dead Reckoning Part One,"" starring Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Esai Morales, and Vanessa Kirby, is one of the most expensive films ever made and the most expensive in the franchise with an estimated budget of $291 million. It is also the longest in terms of runtime, spanning 156 minutes.

This opening chapter in that two-movie arc sees Ethan Hunt and his IMF team on their most dangerous mission yet: trying to save the world from a mysterious, all-powerful artificial intelligence villain with the power to control the way humanity perceives reality. ""The stakes in this story are as global as global stakes get,"" said McQuarrie, also noting the key to crafting an engaging story is by tapping into the audience's emotions, which ""makes that action worth doing.""
The most stunning stunts in the film include Cruise fighting on a moving train, engaging in a car chase on the streets of Rome, and, in particular, riding off a cliff on a motorbike. These stunts were performed during real takes, by Cruise himself, emphasizing practical filmmaking rather than relying on computer-generated visual effects.
For the motorbike scene, Cruise rode a motorbike off a purpose-built ramp on the side of a mountain in Norway, a vertiginous rock face situated approximately 1,200 meters above sea level – all on the first day of principal shooting on Sept. 6, 2020. He then descended 4,000 feet into the ravine below before opening his parachute at a mere 500 feet from the ground. While the director and a small crew breathed a collective sigh of relief after the first successful run, Cruise picked himself up and repeated the stunt seven more times, ensuring the footage was perfect.

The stunt was undeniably the most dangerous of Cruise's career, which is quite a statement considering his previous jaw-dropping endeavors in the ""Mission: Impossible"" films. Those include swinging around the exterior of the world's tallest building, Dubai's Burj Khalifa, in ""Ghost Protocol,"" hanging onto the side of an Airbus A400M mid-flight in ""Rogue Nation,"" and launching himself out of a Boeing C-17 Globemaster III from 25,000 feet, executing a high altitude low opening (HALO) jump on film for the first time ever in ""Fallout."" This time, after a year of rehearsals in the U.K. during pre-production, Cruise had completed over 500 skydives and 13,000 motocross jumps in preparation.
""Every time I went off the ramp, it was dangerous. It was risking my life. And we wanted to keep that to a minimum,"" Cruise had previously said. ""We have a saying on 'Mission: Impossible' movies: 'Don't be safe. Be competent.'""

""Dead Reckoning Part One"" also marks a significant milestone for the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise. ""This is the first time we've ever split a 'Mission: Impossible' story over two movies. It's something we've never attempted before because of the complexity of these stories. The scale of these two movies is epic in every sense,"" said Cruise. The second installment of ""Dead Reckoning"" is scheduled for June 2024.

,Hayley Atwell and Simon Pegg Rave About 'Mission: Impossible' Costar Tom Cruise: 'He's Just a Guy',"Hayley Atwell, Simon Pegg and director Chris McQuarrie open up about their relationships with Tom Cruise — and how he's ""just a guy"" who loves making movies","Tom Cruise may be a worldwide movie star, but he’s also “just a guy,"" according to his Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One collaborators.
Despite his enduring fame, Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell and director Chris McQuarrie insist that the actor, 61, is just a man who loves making movies.
Pegg, 53, who plays Benji Dunn in the iconic spy series, told The Times that Cruise is involved “in every part of a film” — from filling its lead role to helping out on-set caterers. “I just don’t think anybody else can be as arsed as he can,” he told the outlet.
The star, who met the Jerry Maguire actor nearly two decades ago, cited the actor’s tendency to do his own stunts while describing his intense dedication to the movies he creates.
“With special effects, you know something is artificial — it removes a degree of tension — so Tom pushes things to the limit, to the point of risking his life,” Pegg said of Cruise.

Atwell, 41, seconded Pegg’s claims of Cruise’s dedication to making movies that audiences will love.
""It’s very rare,"" she told The Times of the Risky Business star’s attention to detail on set, recalling when he gave a runner-slash-aspiring-cinematographer a laminated cinematography guide.
The actress, who plays Grace in the action film, added that — similar to his treatment of everyone on a film set — Cruise values viewers and their experience with a movie above all else.
“He doesn’t want to make movies now to punish an audience,” Atwell told the publication. “He doesn’t want films with the message that if you do not understand this, you’re not smart.”

The Marvel star continued, “I can tell when I watch some movies that the director has made it for themselves. I don’t feel involved or I think, ‘Am I stupid?’ Tom’s not a snob.”
An example of this, Atwell said, was during a script read for a Mission: Impossible film — not Dead Reckoning Part One — when Cruise told the crew that he “didn’t get” a line, which translated to “the audience will not get it” — and thus it was cut.

McQuarrie, 54, the director of several Mission: Impossible movies and a longtime friend of Cruise, echoed Pegg and Atwell’s statements about Cruise’s desire to make movies that are fun for audiences.
“There is an outsized importance placed on Oscars [and] films that not many people are going to see,” he told The Times, noting that it is a phenomenon that he says is a “wedge has been driven into the [film] industry.”
“Are you an artist or an entertainer?” McQuarrie posed, before adding that Cruise — who introduced himself to McQuarrie as a maker of “mass entertainment” in 2006 — does not see these titles as “mutually exclusive.”

Pegg also raved to the publication about Tom’s intense love of movies — the intersection of art and entertainment — and what it means for the future of film.
“People can argue that cinema is frivolous, but it’s not,” he told The Times. “Cinema brings people together at a time we’re pulling apart, and that just added to Tom’s determination to put people in a room together.”
He continued, “The power of cinema is, for him, precious and it’s vital we sustain it.”
The Shaun of the Dead actor also opened up about his personal relationship with Cruise, telling the outlet that he was able to “hack my way through all the bizarre mythology” surrounding the Top Gun star.
“On one side he’s Tom Cruise — this enigmatic film star everyone wants to know about — and on the other he’s just a guy,” Pegg said. “I like being normal with him.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9oYXlsZXktYXR3ZWxsLXNpbW9uLXBlZ2ctcmF2ZS1hYm91dC1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtY29zdGFyLXRvbS1jcnVpc2UtNzU1ODM0NdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

2023-07-15 16:15:00+00:00,"Pom Klementieff’s ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Villain Was Inspired by Bruce Lee, Clint Eastwood, ‘Kill Bill’ … and a Shoebill Stork",The star of 'Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' reveals how she 'manifested' her role as villain Paris.,"Named after a word that sounds similar in Korean to both “spring” and “tiger,” Pom Klementieff has appropriately showcased ebullience and viciousness throughout her career — and especially in the past few months. In May, she reprised her role as Mantis in “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” empathetically shepherding her fellow outcasts through an adventure to save Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) from unapologetic MCU villain the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). She also appears in “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” as Paris, a ruthless assassin who will stop at nothing to kill Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and anyone else who gets in her way.

Ahead of “Dead Reckoning Part One,” Klementieff spoke to Variety about her character in the film, whose backstory she worked closely with Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie to develop. In addition to talking about how she “manifested” the opportunity to be a part of the franchise, she revealed the panorama of influences — from Jean-Paul Belmondo to animal videos on YouTube — she enlisted to ensure that audiences never forget Paris.

“She’s a pretty mysterious character that doesn’t speak much, but the beauty of it is that when she speaks, everyone listens,” says Klementieff.

Paris possesses an almost sociopathic glee as she works for Gabriel [Esai Morales]. What was her backstory?

My character, I think, is on a path of destruction and she’s a very skilled fighter, and she enjoys to fight and to kill people. But there is also an underlying feeling of betrayal and of loneliness from being an orphan, so there’s a deep wound underneath. There’s a lot of things that I came up with myself, because what Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise do is cast the actors, and then they build the character around the actor’s abilities.

Tom Cruise is famous for performing his own stunts. Which of your own stunts did you request to do?

We trained very hard with [stunt coordinator] Wade Eastwood. But I had been training for years with a martial artist who taught me how to punch, how to kick, so I had been doing kickboxing, boxing, taekwondo. It was my dream to be part of “Mission: Impossible.” When I was training years ago, sometimes in my schedule, instead of writing “martial arts” or “stunt training,” I would write “Mission: Impossible,” because I wanted to manifest it.

What films did you watch for inspiration ahead of being in an action scene?

Quentin Tarantino is one of my favorite directors, so of course I always watch “Kill Bill.” I watched movies with Bruce Lee, with Jackie Chan and some French movies as well, because it was not just about the fight and the physicality — it was also the way the character walks. I was inspired by movies with Jean-Paul Belmondo to find a cockiness to the character. And movies with Clint Eastwood, Takeshi Kitano, all these beautiful characters that barely speak but convey so many emotions as well.

There’s a physicality to so many of your roles. How intentional has that been?

I think it just happened. I’m not a Method actor. It comes naturally. For this movie, I would watch videos of animals, and I was inspired by a bird — the shoebill stork — for the physicality of the character, [the way it] turns slowly and stares, and I thought that it looked like me a little bit.

How much do you want action to be a cornerstone of your career going forward?

I’m dying to do more action, but it has to be the right project and the right director. That’s the beauty of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise — it’s not just an action movie. It’s beautiful storytelling with incredible filmmakers. Recently I shot something that I’m really proud of, a short movie with BMW called “The Calm.” Sam Hargrave, who did “Extraction,” directed it, and I was shooting this fight scene inside a car. I love doing very intricate things. And when there’s limitations, it’s even more exciting.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLXBvbS1rbGVtZW50aWVmZi10b20tY3J1aXNlLTEyMzU2Njg3NTUv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctcG9tLWtsZW1lbnRpZWZmLXRvbS1jcnVpc2UtMTIzNTY2ODc1NS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,Tom Cruise And Christopher McQuarrie Talk What Mission: Impossible’s Sequels Have In Common With Top Gun: Maverick,"When it comes to the sequels of Mission: Impossible and Top Gun: Maverick, Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie pointed out a fascinating similarity.","Reading the headline, the similarities between the Mission: Impossible movies and Top Gun: Maverick I thought of first were the death-defying action and of course the leading man of both franchises, Tom Cruise . However, these franchises have something else in common as the actor and Christopher McQuarrie spoke about the importance of creating singular stories within a franchise.

What I mean by singular stories is, the movies are able to be comprehended without seeing the films that came before them. As the director and actor released Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One , they spoke about what the seventh M:I movie has in common with Top Gun's legacy sequel. While speaking with Film4 Christopher McQuarrie, who directed M:I 7 and co-wrote and produced Maverick, explained this major similarity between the two series, saying:

We don’t want you to have to leave the narrative and to remember another narrative to understand what’s going on with this one. We don’t assume you’ve seen another Mission: Impossible. The same way with Top Gun: Maverick; we didn’t assume you had seen the original Top Gun. It had to be a movie that stood alone. And it had to be a movie that ended conclusively, even though it was a Part 1.

As a casual fan of the M:I franchise specifically, I think these two have accomplished this goal every time. I have never seen the Mission: Impossible movies in order , and I watched all seven over the course of many years. So, the overarching plot is not something I can really recall. However, as McQuarrie said, it’s not necessary.

As shown in the moderately reviewed Dead Reckoning , the IMF is recontextualized, and we’re reintroduced to Henry Czerny’s Kittridge, who was only in the first Mission: Impossible before appearing in the seventh film. However, his importance is explained in the Dead Reckoning. Even if you haven’t seen the 1996 movie in years (like me), you’ll still understand his role in the story. McQuarrie continued to speak about this example, explaining:

We took that to the extreme in that we reintroduced the concept of the IMF. But all of that was serving story, which was by bringing back Henry Czerny. Bringing back a character from deep in Ethan’s history, it felt important that we recontextualize what the IMF is and answer some of those questions that really have always been taken for granted. The notion of: ‘Should you choose to accept?’ The notion of where Ethan Hunt comes from and how he became this person.

Not only did McQuarrie and Cruise effectively bring back a character in a way that didn't require viewers to see the six movies prior, this isn’t the first time they’ve done it. Not only does the Mission: Impossible franchise focus on making individual stories for each installment, the same thing was done with Top Gun: Maverick.

Tom Cruise had to be convinced to make Maverick , and it was the story between his pilot and Goose’s son Rooster that sold him. While the film is deeply linked to its predecessor through this relationship, it added scenes that explain the connections. It’s not necessary to have seen Top Gun before seeing the sequel. While it would help, it’s by no means required. The same can be said about M:I.

Along with this similarity, Cruise also noted how he wants these franchises to have longevity because he wants to keep making Mission: Impossible movies and pushing what’s possible. The actor said:

Here we are all these years later. My hope was to be able to have it continue, but also to be able to challenge myself as a storyteller, as a filmmaker and really live, you know, to become part of my childhood dream, which was to make movies and travel the world.

Clearly, what Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie are doing works, because Maverick was a massive success, and M:I 7’s sequel Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part Two will appear on the 2024 movie schedule . This method of making movies understandable for all audiences is fantastic. It also makes it so you don’t necessarily have to do homework before making your way to the movies to catch the latest action flick from this dynamic duo.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3RvbS1jcnVpc2UtY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbWNxdWFycmllLXRhbGstMTYzNDE0NDg5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-15 14:00:00+00:00,How Tom Cruise Got Us to Forget About His Scientology Ties,Star of ‘Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One’ has avoided any and all Scientology questions and instead painted himself as Movie Savior.,"There are movie stars and then there is Tom Cruise. Forty years a star, enough classics to make listing even a few here pointless, and, now, someone who can stake a legitimate claim to saving Hollywood (or at least jolting some life into that lazy, bloated monstrosity). Last year’s Top Gun: Maverick, with its millions at the box office, helped rescue the movies and movie theaters from the brink of Covid-19 and streaming. This year’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, the seventh and ostensibly penultimate installment of the secret agent series, should reach similar heights. Tom Cruise is as big as he’s ever been — a feat as staggering as any Ethan Hunt stunt.

Because then there’s all the other stuff. The Scientology of it all. The Church’s interminable history of alleged abuses and misconduct and Cruise’s status as its most prominent figure, a high-ranking member with deep ties to leader David Miscavige. Cruise has been a Scientologist for nearly as long as he’s been a star, his introduction to the Church reportedly brokered around 1986 (the same year Top Gun came out) by his first wife Mimi Rogers. A lot has allegedly happened in that time, from the harrowing accusations against the Church itself (abuse, trafficking, forced labor, to name a few, all of which the Church has denied), to the various claims about Cruise’s relationship with it (the alleged arrangement of romantic partners, for one, which the Church has also denied).

And yet, none of it’s ever really caught up with Cruise, let alone dragged him down. Even Alex Gibney, who directed the damning Scientology doc Going Clear (based on Lawrence Wright’s book of the same name), admitted to Rolling Stone recently that he was “surprised” Cruise had avoided any kind of reckoning.

“There are stories about him that, if one could get people to go on the record, would be shocking,” Gibney said. “But they have to be willing to do it. And so far, they haven’t been.” (Cruise did not respond to a request for comment.) Editor’s picks

It’s easy to let one’s imagination run wild with known unknowns (just ask Donald Rumsfeld — or don’t, actually); but the thing is, there’s already a lot we do know about Tom Cruise and Scientology. It’s not some nasty secret stashed away. It barely qualifies as dirty laundry at this point. We’ve had years of tell-alls, exposés, memoirs, documentaries, lawsuits, even one unforgettable episode of South Park. At the most recent Oscars and Golden Globes, where Top Gun: Maverick was fêted with multiple nominations (and even won an Academy Award for Best Sound), hosts Jimmy Kimmel and Jerrod Carmichael both joked about it. They weren’t even subtle or winking, like the kind of jokes 30 Rock made about Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein years before the full extent of their alleged transgressions were revealed. Carmichael flat-out said the three Golden Globes Cruise returned in protest of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association should be exchanged for Shelly Miscavige — David’s wife, who hasn’t been seen in public since 2007.

With Tom Cruise, it’s yet to reach the point where we, as a culture, are devastated, disheveled, distraught, screaming, “He can’t keep getting away with it!” He remains deeply beloved, and not even in an unsettling, upsetting way, like some of our other prominent problematic actors. And it has everything to do with the way Cruise has thrown himself completely into his work over the past 10 years or so — the way he’s effectively replaced Scientology with a different public-facing religion: The Movies.

There was a brief window where it was possible the Tom Cruise/Scientology partnership would end in some kind of mutual assured destruction. The man was on an absolute tear in the mid-2000s, railing against psychology and pharmaceuticals, scolding Brooke Shields for taking antidepressants, then doubling down during a contentious interview with Matt Lauer. It was a time when Cruise was willing to sit down with a major publication like Rolling Stone for a wide-ranging, on-the-record interview, and give quotes like: “If you really want to know, get What Is Scientology?, the book, and look at it, because that’s what Scientology is. It’s a very large body of knowledge with tools that are available. It’s ah… it really is the shit, man.” Related

Shockingly, this didn’t exactly endear Cruise or the Church to the culture at large. A 2008 incident is telling: Hackers obtained and leaked an internal Church video that featured Cruise, full Steve Jobs mode in a black turtleneck, extolling the virtues of Scientology; there was also footage of Cruise accepting the Church’s “Freedom Medal of Valor” and saluting Miscavige. In response, the Church not only tried to wipe the video from the web, but cast doubt on its authenticity, claiming it was “pirated and edited.” By the end of that year, Cruise was apologizing to Lauer for acting “arrogant” and declining to answer interviewer questions about Scientology.

The first half of the 2010s saw more bad press with the release of Wright’s book and Gibney’s doc, as well as the high-profile defection of Leah Remini. Cruise even endured some self-inflicted wounds after filing a defamation suit against the tabloid Life & Style, which had run a story claiming Cruise had abandoned his daughter, Suri, with ex-wife Katie Holmes. In a 2013 deposition, he was forced to admit that Scientology had played a role in his divorce from Holmes, and that Holmes told him she wanted to protect their daughter from the Church. (The lawsuit ultimately settled out of court.)

But by that point, Cruise had weathered the worst of the storm he’d largely wrought upon himself. His M.O. was simple: keep quiet and make movies — and the movies he made were good. Thanks to a creative partnership with writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, he revived the Mission: Impossible franchise and also dropped a few fan favorites, like Jack Reacher and Edge of Tomorrow. (The two also worked together on The Mummy, though, so clearly no one’s perfect.)

Action flicks have always been a core component of the Cruise oeuvre; but after a versatile first 20 years as an actor, his focus narrowed on them in the 2000s, and since then, that focus seems to have only hardened into a raison d’être. There’s little doubt Cruise loves these kinds of movies and the work that goes into not only doing the stunts, but building the characters and stories to make those set pieces worthwhile. But “Tom Cruise, Action Hero” is also an appealing prospect and PR win: If you’re an organization beset by controversy and accusation, why wouldn’t you want your poster boy constantly saving the world?

But action flicks have suited Cruise similarly well in this era of muted public association with Scientology. Amidst the ceaseless rise of green screen tech and CGI tricks, and the Marvel-ization of blockbuster cinema, Cruise remains one of the crazy, blessed few still willing to throw himself out of a plane in service of the noble causes of storytelling and entertainment. That willingness to fully embody Ethan Hunt or Pete “Maverick” Mitchell is a great way to make people not necessarily forget, but stop worrying so much about L. Ron Hubbard, or Xenu, or Shelly Miscavige. Or from wondering, when was the last time Tom Cruise saw his daughter?

It certainly helped, too, that whenever Cruise went out to promote one of his new movies, he was never asked about any of that. Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation came out just a few months after Gibney’s Going Clear in 2015, and there’s nothing in the press cycle to suggest the doc was ever broached with Cruise on record. (One reporter got a very generic comment from Cruise the following year at the London premiere of Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, the actor calling Scientology a “beautiful religion” and “something that has helped me incredibly in my life.”) Instead, in these heavily moderated interviews and red carpet chats, he mostly talked about The Movies — his current movie, his next movie, his old movies, other people’s movies, and, maybe his favorite topic of all, the process of making movies.

Cruise would’ve probably kept chugging along like this, but Covid-19 added a new dimension. When audio leaked in late 2020 of Cruise upbraiding Mission: Impossible crew members for not following pandemic protocols, the overall reaction was less shock, more awe. His dedication to making this movie was absolute, imbued with a clear-eyed understanding of the existential threat Covid-19 posed to the film industry. He backed up those words with the fight to keep Top Gun: Maverick off streaming and ensure it safely landed in theaters. He was handsomely rewarded with box office receipts, rave reviews, and respect from his peers. “You saved Hollywood’s ass,” Steven Spielberg told him at an Oscars luncheon earlier this year, “you might have saved theatrical distribution. Seriously.”

Even at the height of his public association with Scientology, The Movies were like a kind of religion for Cruise. In 2002, when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences needed someone to validate the existence and value of film and the film industry after 9/11, it called on Cruise, and he delivered. You can see shades of it as far back as 1984, two years before his introduction to Scientology, in the way he discusses movies as a vehicle for betterment and serenity: “I’m interested in my personal growth, what’s going to make me happy. Not how much money am I gonna make, not what film is gonna really make me more visible.”

But without the pandemic, Cruise’s embrace of The Movies as his public-facing religion may not have reached such a full expression. What he says about The Movies hasn’t really changed that much, but now it’s shot through with the aura of the savior. With that irrepressible conviction and charisma, he has that preacher’s ability to turn repeated platitudes into mantras or prayers. (Seriously, his reliance on the bit about how, ever since he was four he wanted nothing more than to make movies and travel the world, has arguably surpassed Lady Gaga/100-people-in-a-room levels of ridiculousness — and yet it’s still kinda charming). And what other way is there to look at Cruise’s stunt work than the fearless devotions of a man willing to martyr himself for the thing he loves?

This is not to argue that The Movies has supplanted the Church of Scientology in Cruise’s private life, too. Despite the public distance, there’s no evidence that Cruise has recently drifted from, left, or ever intends to leave the Church. And therein lies the obvious complication: Tom Cruise, Action Hero was already a reliable way to take people’s minds off Tom Cruise, Scientologist; Tom Cruise, Action Hero and Savior of The Movies, is even better. The benefit to Cruise is clear — the continuation of his career and copious amounts of goodwill. You can even speculate as to the benefit for the Church itself: After all the bad press, investigations, and lawsuits, with membership reportedly declining, Cruise’s success may still be a beacon for those in it, a totem to clutch and claim only they understand its true value and power.

As for the rest of us, we seem to have reached a cordial stalemate with Cruise. We’ve delayed his reckoning — maybe forever, maybe only for now — allowed him to float above the level of a Mark Wahlberg, or worse, a Mel Gibson. And that’s because, as much as Tom Cruise, Action Hero and Savior of the Movies is good PR, it’s also who he is, who he’s always been. Despite everything else he believes, he still believes in The Movies.

There’s a famous tidbit about how Thomas Cruise Mapother IV spent a year in seminary school as a teenager before he started acting. Tom Cruise has always insisted Thomas Mapother was never actually close to becoming a priest, but the episode still encapsulates the zealous streak in his character, an irrepressible yearning for knowledge and understanding, his belief in, or need for, a higher calling or power. And before he found an outlet for all that in Scientology, he found it in acting and making movies. It’s still there. The proof is everywhere, even when he’s just looking a camera dead in the eye, smiling, and saying, “I love my popcorn. Movies, popcorn.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yb2xsaW5nc3RvbmUuY29tL3R2LW1vdmllcy90di1tb3ZpZS1mZWF0dXJlcy90b20tY3J1aXNlLXNjaWVudG9sb2d5LW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZy1tb3ZpZS1zYXZpb3ItMTIzNDc4OTAxNS_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucm9sbGluZ3N0b25lLmNvbS90di1tb3ZpZXMvdHYtbW92aWUtZmVhdHVyZXMvdG9tLWNydWlzZS1zY2llbnRvbG9neS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctbW92aWUtc2F2aW9yLTEyMzQ3ODkwMTUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-20 16:18:06+00:00,12 of Tom Cruise’s Most Jaw-Dropping Stunts,"From scaling a skyscraper to hanging on to the outside of an airplane as it takes off, THR has compiled a list of some of Tom Cruise's wildest stunts.","Tom Cruise has never steered away from challenging himself in his roles for projects. Especially since 1986’s Top Gun, he has continued to push the limits of his body and acting, taking on his own stunts in most of his top films, including Mission: Impossible, The Last Samurai and Jack Reacher.

Most recently, Cruise took on several death-defying stunts in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, including speed-flying down a mountainside as well as driving a motorcycle off a cliff and parachuting to safety.

The actor has previously said during an appearance on The Graham Norton Show that he has been “doing different stunts” since he was a child and that once he got into acting, he wanted to keep doing it to help with the “storytelling.”

“I feel that [when] acting you’re bringing everything, you know, physically and emotionally, to a character in a story,” he explained at the time. “And I’m able to do it [stunts], and I’ve trained for 30 years doing things like this that it allows us to put cameras in places where you normally are not able to.”

More recently, during a conversation at Cannes in 2022, Cruise reiterated that he enjoys performing his own stunts despite the danger, only this time he referenced one of the best athletes of Hollywood’s golden era.

“No one asked Gene Kelly, ‘Why do you dance?’” the actor said. “Why do you do your own dancing?’”

,Christopher McQuarrie Says He Doesn't Want To Let The MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE Franchise Down with DEAD RECKONING — GeekTyrant,,"Director Christopher McQuarrie has found himself in a position to play with awesome big-budget movies as a writer, director, and producer, and he’s been enjoying success from that. He also has a great partner with Tom Cruise and the two talents just make freakin’ awesome films together!

The two had a massive hit with Top Gun: Maverick and now they are back to make more Mission: Impossible movies with Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One and Part Two. A movie like Top Gun: Maverick is a hard act to follow, but they actually managed to pull off something special with the upcoming Mission: Impossible movie!

Regardless of that, McQuarrie is terrified of Dead Reckoning and he doesn’t want to let the franchise down after Maverick and Mission: Impossible - Fallout. He explained in a recent interview with Total Film:

“I don’t take my position for granted. I don’t take the audience’s participation for granted. When we were making Top Gun: Maverick, I didn’t take for granted that people loved that movie or that it was a 35-year-old cultural institution. I looked at it with a very suspicious and cynical eye towards Hollywood’s tendency to make it a cash grab. “So, everything I do is to constantly check myself and remind myself that it does not matter what you did before, this is the one you’re doing now. I’m terrified of the result of Dead Reckoning, which lives in the shadow of Fallout, which lives in the shadow of Rogue [Nation], and Ghost [Protocol], and all the other movies that came before it. I don’t want to let the franchise down. I’m more frightened now than I was on my first Mission.”

Well, having already seen the movie, I will tell you that it delivers the epic greatness that fans have come to expect from the franchise. In fact, it’s the best film in the franchise and in my opinion a perfectly made franchise action thriller.

McQuarrie and Cruise pulled it off! I don’t think they have anything to worry about as they are setting the standard for making awesome blockbuster movies. Marvel Studios and DC Studios should take note if they want their franchisees to survive.

I would be more worried about the next films in the franchise because they just raised the bar to a whole new crazy level with Dead Reckoning Part One!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL2dlZWt0eXJhbnQuY29tL25ld3MvY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbWNxdWFycmllLXNheXMtaGUtZG9lc250LXdhbnQtdG8tbGV0LXRoZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZnJhbmNoaXNlLWRvd24td2l0aC1kZWFkLXJlY2tvbmluZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,"Film Critic Harlan Jacobson reviews ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One""",WBGO Film Critic Harlan Jacobson reviews Oppenheimer and Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One,"DD: Not just one Mission Impossible, but two, the latest Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One with Tom Cruise returning as agent Ethan Hunt in the 7th installment in the series, and Oppenheimer, with Cillian Murphy in Christopher Nolan’s large-screen epic about the race to beat Germany to the atomic bomb in WWII. Our film critic, Harlan Jacobson, ties them together and jumps.

HJ: The film universe is atwitter – you should pardon the expression--with Barbieheimer, the race between two mass market films, Barbie and Oppenheimer, that are both opening this weekend to chase big numbers at the box office like the old days, pre-everything. At least as interesting is the performance test between Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning and Oppenheimer. Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer are in their way similar and what the industry needs—fresh auteurist visions where one is light satire with a feminist intent, and the other a dark mea culpa on the use and abuse of male power. But Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning represents the continued uninspired retooling of past franchises – Bond, Bat, Super and Spiderman, Marvels that are no longer marvels -- that are the default position of risk-averse corporate filmmaking. This is the cancer that was eating away at theatrical attendance 30 years before the pandemic landed theaters in the ICU.

Harlan Jacobson Tom Cruise stars as ""Ethan Hunt"" in Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One

Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie’s Dead Reckoning with Tom Cruise hopping from planes to trains and at least one clown car, and Oppenheimer with the lesser-known Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man who birthed the atom bomb and regretted it even before the fallout rained down, however, are both about missions impossible—to save the planet for good or ill. Oppenheimer, however, is the bet made by visionary filmmaking associated with the great American indie explosion of the early 70s in Marty Scorsese and especially Francis Ford Coppola that the way forward is by investigating the American character, in fiction or in history, to take the pulse of the culture in which we now live.

Dead Reckoning did well in its first week out. And given that everyone in the industry, specially during these strike months, is watching the vital signs of both theatres and distributors, that’s a cheering sign if you care about the biz. But the health of the art — meaningful, fresh character narrative that has Tolstoy’s aspirations to paint the broader moment and David Lean’s imperative to make it big – lies with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, lensed by his cameraman on Tenet, Dunkirk and Interstellar, Hoyte Van Hoytema. It's spirit may lie with American indie filmmaking, but Oppenheimer was made using the elite and expensive cutting edge tech tools of film, crafted by people at the top of their art, with limitless resources backed by a studio, Universal, releasing it in standard film, digital IMAX, and in its best iteration that matches how it was shot on a 70-millimeter IMAX film camera – shown at a premium price of $26.99 at Loews 68th Street in NYC, one of 19 theaters in the US and 30 worldwide equipped to show it.

Nolan’s 12th film – you may remember his Memento back in 2000 about what we need to remember -- has two principal concerns on its mind: 1) the moral no-man’s land entered by Oppy, the scientist given a sports team nickname when he led the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos to build the atomic bombs dropped on Japan to end the war, and 2) the ensuing security driven fascism of the Communist witch hunt in Congress less than a decade later that destroyed Oppenheimer’s reputation and his career. At three hours and distilled from the 2006 Pulitzer Prize winning 700 -page book, American Prometheus, The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by former Nation columnist Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film’s arc follows Oppenheimer from his days as a university student who was a lab klutz but a good theoretical physics thinker, through his selection to bring the bomb to bear on the war effort, and the multiple layers of tragedy that ensue.

There are the overlapping politics of university life, military protocols, the war, the post war madness, and the personal dynamics, from marriage to professional egos, that must be threaded and orchestrated on a metronome keyed at first to the German head start on developing a bomb, led by Werner Heisenberg, he of the already famous Heisenberg principle that if you can see it, you’ve altered its nature. Then the metronome of The Red Scare takes over, and we watch Murphy’s 60-foot face trying to reconcile his heartsickness with the inexorable political buzzsaw of petit tyrants coming at him that Sean Connery’s James Bond or Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt routinely escape.

The film is peopled by front rank actors at the top of their power – Murphy as Oppy, Emily Blunt as his wife Kitty, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr. in a standout turn as Oppy’s Brutus, Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh (as Niels Bohr), David Krumholtz, Bennie Safdie (Edward Teller), Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Florence Pugh and Gary Oldman as a chameleon Harry Truman. Nolan returns to the screen 80s British leading man Tom Conti as Albert Einstein and Josh Peck, lost since Nickelodeon’s 2004 series, Drake & Josh, as the nervous wreck here who pushes the button at Los Alamos.

Nolan’s film positions Oppenheimer to understand the necessity of the project, even as the swirl historically pondered how, especially where and whether to use it. Oppenheimer in Nolan is divided against himself. Even on a screen as large as a football field, there’s a lot of one-on-one ruminations before and after the countdown to the Trinity test blast, which Nolan creates in a fireball, and the ultimate bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki delivered more demurely here over a radio report and newsreel aftermath. Oppenheimer is ultimately ruined as a Communist security risk by Senate investigations shown here that drop out to IMAX in black and white. But how we see him hinges on one line, when he responds to a colleague’s private suggestion that the bomb is so terrible they really ought to keep the Soviets in the loop. The film stops for a beat. “That would be treason,” Oppenheimer says here, and he’s having none of that. Ergo, chalk up Oppy as another wronged patriot and a man so traumatized by doubt he’s incapable of defending himself in the face of the fascist McCarthy period.

Everything in America always does come down to how Walt Kelly summarized it in Pogo long ago: “We have met the enemy, and they is us.” This Oppenheimer is brave, ambitious, magnificently accomplished in its filmmaking and on point.

This 7th in the series of Mission Impossibles, Dead Reckoning, begins in a super stealth Russian sub that yields a lot of dead Russians bobbing up beneath the Arctic ice cap and a two-part, interlocking brass key vital to defeat the enemy and save the planet. The hunt is on! Through two hours and 43 minutes, I never did figure out who the enemy is that Cruise as the returning rogue agent Ethan Hunt is battling. He’s got it going on two fronts: his own CIA on the one hand and on the other what?, who? huh?

It helps if the times you live in afford an enemy that corresponds to the real world, but here it’s abstracted into a metaphor called The Entity. (How’s that for a screenwriter hedge?) After all the high tech stuff the CIA uses and Cruise abuses in this film, I never did get how the fate of the planet hinges on finding a brass key? I kept thinking that key sure looks like the one my parents used to open a Chinese dry bar (with pearl inlays) that my father bought for our living room in 1958 at the LS Ayres Dept store in Indianapolis and which my brother transferred from my pile to his pile when we closed up the house in Toledo. “Ethan, don’t kill yourself, my brother has a key like that on Fullerton Ave in Chicago,” I wanted to shout.

No worries, as Cruise, Hayley Atwell as hot female agent Grace, Ving Rhames as the sidekick and Simon Pegg as the techie, engage in a millisecond by millisecond never-ending pitched battle with The Entity, transversing the globe to do chop-socky stunts on the roof of a speeding train, a slap-stick shift tear through Rome in a circus yellow Fiat 500, and leaps of faith over rooftops in Venice and the Swiss Alps and across the sands of Abu Dhabi in a mission that plays out as really quite possible after all to save the world. Yes, Tom Cruise is a Unicorn, as my son calls him. And as with all franchise victories, Carvel Cone afterwards.

2023-07-22 17:15:00+00:00,Ranking every ‘Mission: Impossible’ movie from worst to best,"With 'Dead Reckoning Part One' in theatres now, let's look back at all the missions accomplished in a ranking of the 'Mission: Impossible' franchise.","Ranking every ‘Mission: Impossible’ movie from worst to best

The Mission: Impossible franchise is a curious tale of evolution and reinvention, from its inception as a 1960s TV show to its rebirth as a modern cinematic behemoth led by Tom Cruise. A wild kaleidoscope of spy-jinks and audacious action, it began as the brainchild of Bruce Geller, whose high-concept television series focused on the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) and their covert operations. It was a sign of the times, a product of Cold War anxieties and the burgeoning spy genre, epitomised by the iconic line: “Your mission, should you choose to accept it…”

Fast forward three decades to 1996, when the sands of Hollywood started to shift. The genre had grown stale, and the spy game needed a new player. This was Tom Cruise’s cue – a leading man with a reputation for high-octane performances and an unquenchable thirst for adrenaline. Backed by Paula Wagner and Cruise/Wagner Productions, Mission: Impossible was about to get a much-needed facelift. The television show was dusted off, repackaged and presented as a blockbuster movie under the direction of Brian De Palma, a maestro of suspense and psychological thrillers. This new iteration was grittier, sleeker, and, most importantly, led by a bona fide movie star.

Cruise, reprising the role of Ethan Hunt, brought with him a raw intensity and passion for practical stunts that became the franchise’s signature. Despite changes in directors and varying tones, each instalment carried this thread, embodying Cruise’s fearlessness and relentless pursuit of authenticity. The franchise morphed into an ever-escalating series of impossible stunts, from scaling Dubai’s Burj Khalifa to hanging off an airborne plane, most performed by Cruise himself. The transformation was stark: from a quiet, methodical show about subterfuge and deception, Mission: Impossible became a roaring testament to Hollywood’s capacity for spectacle.

Over the years, the franchise, much like its relentless star, has refused to slow down. Seven films in, with Part Two of Dead Reckoning on the horizon, Mission: Impossible has become synonymous with Cruise’s daredevil persona and “high-risk, high-reward” action filmmaking. What began as a leap of faith in the mid-1990s has become a cinematic institution, forever changing how we perceive spy thrillers and the boundaries of film stunts. And now, for our mission, should we choose to accept it…

Ranking every Mission: Impossible movie:

7. Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (Christopher McQuarrie, 2023)

Dead Reckoning Part One represents a seriously unfortunate stumble in the franchise’s otherwise impressive stride. Despite boasting the combined talents of Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie, this entry felt like a tepid intermission rather than a gripping standalone chapter. Even the stunning action set pieces couldn’t lift it above the feeling of being a placeholder for a future instalment.

The action feels disoriented, lacking the clear purpose and urgency that the franchise is renowned for. Although a few high-octane stunts hint at the franchise’s former glory, the overall narrative fails to build up substantial suspense, and its high-concept AI villain feels severely undercooked.

6. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (Brad Bird, 2011)

This one is a noteworthy entry in the franchise due to its visual spectacle and the smooth transition of director Brad Bird, known for The Incredibles, from animation to live-action filmmaking. However, its antagonist, the somewhat bland Cobalt, lacks the dramatic weight that adversaries in other instalments have brought to the table.

Despite this shortcoming, the film does manage to entertain, mainly due to its commitment to practical effects and breathtaking stunt sequences – including an incredibly memorable prison sequence. This film truly solidified the franchise’s reputation for daring stunt work, including the now-famous scene with Tom Cruise scaling Dubai’s Burj Khalifa.

5. Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (Christopher McQuarrie, 2015)

McQuarrie’s directorial debut in the franchise Rogue Nation brings a fresh new voice and direction. It introduces an exceptionally threatening villain with Solomon Lane, portrayed by British actor Sean Harris, whose croaky voice and quiet menace infused the series with a real threat.

Despite some narrative complexities that had some viewers scratching their heads, the film delivers a singularly engaging experience filled with high-stakes espionage and thrilling stunts. McQuarrie’s knack for crafting sleek, heart-pounding action sequences combined with Cruise’s trademark fearlessness is on full display.

4. Mission: Impossible II (John Woo, 2000)

Mission: Impossible II, with its flair for slow-motion action and a plotline that revels in its over-the-top nature, is a distinctive entry in the franchise. John Woo’s distinct direction and the inclusion of Anthony Hopkins add a unique touch to this instalment, making it a fun rollercoaster of a film – and a bizarrely drastic departure from the first film.

Although not as sophisticated or nuanced as some other entries, this instalment perfectly captures the spirit of early 2000s action cinema and is still great fun to watch today. Its blend of stylistic action sequences and unabashedly cheesy dialogue makes for an entertaining throwback to a different era of filmmaking.

3. Mission: Impossible – Fallout (Christopher McQuarrie, 2018)

Fallout was, and still is, an exceptionally high point in the franchise. It introduced the audience to a formidable new adversary played by Henry Cavill, equipped with an iconic moustache. It’s a thrilling adventure, offering a solid antidote to some of the less satisfactory spy thrillers of recent years – many considered it an answer to the disappointing 007 film Spectre.

The story, woven around a tense nuclear threat, brings a sense of previously unseen urgency that adds to the film’s surprisingly high level of tension. The stunning Paris chase sequence and the climactic helicopter showdown are among the most intense and best-executed action scenes in the entire franchise.

2. Mission: Impossible III (J.J. Abrams, 2006)

J.J. Abrams’ Mission: Impossible III ventures into darker territories, offering a grittier and more character-focused instalment in the franchise. Philip Seymour Hoffman’s turn as the ruthless antagonist is an absolute, bonafide standout performance. His grounded portrayal of an arms and information dealer brought the series into a terrifying new place.

With its themes of personal loss and shockingly grim consequences, the third Mission Impossible brings a sense of realism lacking in other Hollywood action blockbusters. Its real-world approach results in a high-stakes thriller that provides the perfect backdrop for some of the series’ most powerful performances and character-defining story beats.

1. Mission: Impossible (Brian De Palma, 1996)

The first film in the franchise, Brian De Palma’s Mission: Impossible, remains its best, with its captivating blend of suspense and intrigue. It’s less about flashy stunts and more about high-tension espionage, reminiscent of a Hitchcockian thriller and utilising De Palma’s penchant for stylistic and heightened cinematography.

It really feels more like a De Palma film than a Mission: Impossible film, and despite the objective quality of the later instalments, that defining quality is what makes it the best. Hunt’s resourcefulness and intelligence take centre stage over brute force, creating a nuanced character study within the frame of a spy thriller. This film’s unique focus on cerebral action over physicality sets it apart in the franchise – not a single shot is fired by our hero.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZmFyb3V0bWFnYXppbmUuY28udWsvcmFua2luZy1ldmVyeS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtbW92aWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,"Vanessa Kirby on bringing ""The White Widow"" to life in ""Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One""",The film hits theaters today.,"Vanessa Kirby on the higher stakes for the ""White Widow"" in new ""Mission: Impossible"" movie

When actor Vanessa Kirby reprised her role as Alanna Mitsopolis, widely recognized as the White Widow in ""Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,"" she focused her portrayal of the White Widow to be a powerful and dangerous international arms dealer, adding an electrifying dynamic to the film.

""I wanted to just try and capture the essence of what she had done,"" Kirby said.

Her character is known to have a quiet, yet menacing look and aura surrounding her which Kirby said was a challenge to learn.

""I would never have thought about myself to be somebody that sort of so in charge of this really dark, you know, hugely powerful organization, but to do it with lightness and play,"" she said.

She performs stunts throughout the movie with Tom Cruise, who plays protagonist Ethan Hunt, and also performs his own stunts in the ""Mission: Impossible"" series.

The film hits theaters today. It is a production of Paramount Pictures, a division of CBS News' parent company. Its highly-anticipated release follows a four-year gap since the release of the previous installment, ""Mission: Impossible – Fallout.""

To express gratitude to the audiences and embracing their enthusiasm for the franchise, Cruise and other members of the cast recently visited movie theaters across multiple cities. Kirby said this speaks to their bond, which got stronger as the cast and crew filmed together during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""We were a little family in our bubble for it now to be out there in the world is really thrilling. I think everybody is so fantastic and and I'm very proud to be a part of it,"" Kirby said.

2023-07-20 10:27:33+00:00,‘Mission: Impossible’,"“Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, some language and suggestive material.","In December, Paramount Pictures released an enthralling behind-the-scenes video for its upcoming big-budget release “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” detailing a high-stakes stunt.

In it, Tom Cruise — not a stuntman, but Cruise, the enduring and ageless Hollywood heavyweight — jumps a motorcycle off a mountain in Norway.

It’s crazy.

Crazier? The perfectionist Cruise executed the jump seven more times.

The first couple of pages of production notes for the movie — now in theaters — are devoted to the stunt as well. Shot on the first day of principal photography in September 2020, the effort was the culmination of a year of prep work by Cruise, a skydiver who’d dreamt about executing the daredevil move for decades.

The good news is the work pays off, as it and other large-scale action sequences in “Part One” — the seventh installment in the popular “Mission: Impossible” big-screen franchise — are constantly thrilling and impressive.

The bad news: Almost anytime the movie isn’t in the midst of one “Dead Reckoning” comes pretty close to becoming deadly boring.

It’s surprising just how stagnant the film feels in several stretches given Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie’s penchant for collaborating on winning projects, including the most recent installments in this series. (McQuarrie co-wrote 2011’s “Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol” and since has directed and co-written 2015’s “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation” and 2018’s “Mission: Impossible — Fallout.”)

McQuarrie and co-writer Erik Jendresen have crafted an exposition-heavy tale of an artificial intelligence gone rogue that never feels as if it needs two parts to tell. (“Dead Reckoning Part Two” is set for a theatrical release June 28.) At more than two and a half hours, “Part One” is plenty long enough for a self-contained story.

We meet the persistently pesky AI aboard a Russian sub, a state-of-the-art war machine that runs into problems thanks to what becomes known as “The Entity.”

We then catch up with the franchise’s central figure, Cruise’s Ethan Hunt, operative extraordinaire with the top-secret Impossible Mission Force. He’s lying low in Amsterdam, but he accepts a mission from Henry Czerny’s Eugene Kittridge — not seen since 1996’s franchise-launching “Mission Impossible,” the character is now the director of the CIA — that takes him to the Arabian Desert.

And so begins Ethan’s reconnecting with friends, enemies and frenemies, including Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Alanna Mitsopolis (Vanessa Kirby), aka The White Widow.

The Entity sees Ethan as such a threat that it has recruited an old nemesis to work on its behalf, Esai Morales’ Gabriel. The movie leans so hard into flashbacks involving the pair that you have to convince yourself that you’ve never seen these scenes, their dalliance set prior to Ethan becoming an IMF agent. McQuarrie simply needs to FEEL just how much Gabriel-related baggage Ethan apparently has been carrying around this whole time, but this works only so well.

Also new to the mix — and adding more to it than Gabriel — is Hayley Atwell’s Grace, a high-priced thief hired to steal a key that could be, well, the key to controlling The Entity. Grace is both ambitious and in over her head, a combination that helps keep you guessing as to what she will do at any given time when paired with Ethan, and Atwell (“Agent Carter”) proves to be a solid addition.

They are chased through the streets of Rome — another of the movie’s international shooting locales along with, among others, Venice and the aforementioned Norway, standing in for the Austrian Alps — by Gabriel’s French henchwoman, Paris (Pom Klementieff of “Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3”). The latter is in a giant armored vehicle and Ethan and Grace in a very small car, which allows for a nice amount of humor to be infused into what otherwise is a well-executed but familiar-feeling sequence. (The recently released “Fast X” boasts an even crazier, if less satisfying, sequence set in the streets of the Italian capital.)

Give credit to McQuarrie and others for a well-timed AI-centric story, but it’s simply hard to become invested in it. In part, that’s because it provides no real food for thought beyond what if an AI did this or that horrifying thing? It doesn’t help that this greatest of enemies is represented by visuals that often feel like Windows screensavers.

And there’s the movie’s MacGuffin, the all-important key. It consists of two separated halves that must be united to have any worth. That “Dead Reckoning” uses a central plot device so similar to that of the recently released and entirely mind-numbing “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” is an unfortunate coincidence.

Part of the secret sauce of movies such as those in the “Mission: Impossible” and James Bond series are plots so convoluted that you feel like you’re barely keeping up. If nothing else, it makes them seem a little smarter than they actually are.

“Dead Reckoning Part One” is ultimately so simple — unite key, stop AI — that you wish characters would at least spend less time explaining everything.

There’s so much explaining.

“I’m going to need just a few more details,” Grace tells Ethan, Luther and Benji when they try to recruit her into helping her with a nearly impossible mission.

“They tend to just get in the way,” counters Benji.

How right you are, sir.

We do get a pretty nifty action sequence before the closing credits in “Part One,” leaving us at least a little hungry for “Part Two.”

And we know we’ll accept that “Mission, too, as it’s impossible to believe we won’t see Cruise do something even crazier in that one.

The actor is also boarded as a co-producer.,"At 61, Tom Cruise is enjoying his career's best phase. After reviving the box office with Top Gun: Maverick (2022), Cruise has returned with Mission Impossible 7. Titled Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, the seventh installment of the Mission Impossible franchise, has finally arrived in cinemas, and it proves why the Hollywood superstar is one of the highest-paid actors in the world right now.

While many franchises fail to live up to the expectations of the audience, Cruise and the team of Mission Impossible have managed to take the excitement to a whole new level. The actor even admitted to attempting his career's most dangerous stunt in Mission Impossible 7 as he drove a motorcycle off a cliff. ""This is far and away the most dangerous thing I’ve attempted. I wanted to do it since I was a little kid,"" he told Variety.

Find out how many Crores Tom Cruise charged for 'Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One'

While the last Mission Impossible installment, Mission: Impossible — Fallout (2018), was made with a total budget of $190 million (approximately Rs 1,562 crore), the pandemic restrictions and Cruise's willingness to dial up the action factor propelled the budget of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One to $290 million (approximately Rs 2,385 crore), according to Variety, almost tens time more of what the makers have initially planned for.

Billed as one of the most expensive Mission Impossible movies, Mission Impossible 7 features Cruise reprising his role as IMF agent Ethan Hunt. According to The Sun, the 61-year-old actor, who has earned around $100 million (approximately Rs 822 crore) from previous Mission Impossible movies, has charged $12-14 million (about Rs 98 - 115 crore) upfront for the seventh part. Furthermore, the report also stated that Cruise's salary includes a percentage of the box office profits, and with the actor coming on board as a co-producer, he will take home credits for that too.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdxaW5kaWEuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvZmluZC1vdXQtaG93LW1hbnktY3JvcmVzLXRvbS1jcnVpc2UtY2hhcmdlZC1mb3ItbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLTfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

This isn’t always the case with actors or even movie stars, some of whom may be good at faking it but really are more interested in fame and fortune than they are the cinematic experience. And while Cruise may be one of our last, true movie stars, it’s pretty hard to question that his feelings for the art of moviemaking are real.

I mean, Steven Spielberg himself gave Cruise credit for saving “Hollywood’s ass” after the pandemic.

In that particular case, Spielberg was talking about Cruise’s insistence on releasing Top Gun: Maverick in theaters during a time of great uncertainty in the industry. A billion and a half dollars later, Cruise clearly made the right call there. But there’s another key ingredient to the once and future Ethan Hunt’s strategy to keeping cinema alive – and that’s his frankly insane stunt work. So with Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One hitting theaters, let’s look at how Tom Cruise approaches stunts in the Mission: Impossible movies, and how his lifelong love of film has fueled that methodology.

Ranking Tom Cruise's Mission: Impossible Team From Worst to Best 21 Images

Tom Cruise has been making movies since 1981, and became a star within two years of that with the release of Risky Business. He’s had his ups and downs over the decades of course, but one thing that audiences have come to expect from the actor in recent years is him doing his own stunts. And not just that, but one-upping himself with each subsequent Mission: Impossible movie.

Director Christopher McQuarrie, who is currently on his third film in the series, with a fourth in the works, says that there’s a simple reason why Cruise does these huge stunts himself.

“Immersion, plain and simple,” McQuarrie told IGN. “It connects you to the characters and to the story in a way that you couldn't do otherwise. The challenge of that obviously is putting the camera in a place where you can see that the actor is actually doing it. For us, it's really important not that you are watching a stunt, but that you are experiencing that stunt with the protagonist.”

But where does this dedication to the art of the stunt come from? In Dead Reckoning, we see Ethan Hunt’s oath to the IMF, so we asked Cruise what his personal oath to Hollywood would be. He had thoughts.

“I'm first and foremost the audience. The audience,” Cruise responded. “So when you look at the films that I have, it's not about me. It's about us. It's about that experience together. … That's why Top Gun: Maverick, I was like, no, this movie's coming out in the theaters. And when we were going through that time period, I kept calling the distributors and the theaters. I said, no, it's coming. And I showed them the movie and I said this will be in the theaters. I want you to have that experience. And, you know, in the ’80s I was the first guy, again in modern cinema, to shoot 65 mm [film] for Far and Away. I want that big-screen experience for an audience. I want it for myself to watch. I want other filmmakers, and also I want actors to have that opportunity where their movies come out in the cinemas. And I want to show them how to do it.”

“ I want that big-screen experience for an audience. I want it for myself to watch.

And that comes back to the stunts, whether he’s hanging from the side of a plane or climbing the side of a building or pulling off a HALO skydive. Cruise, and McQuarrie with him, are looking for ways to make the cinema the way to experience these films.

“We're finding ways to immerse an audience into a movie,” Cruise told IGN. “Everything, my whole training, and when I watch movies, I want to feel connected with that character. And how do we do it? That's one way. You know, I enjoy doing it. I enjoy the challenges of it, but it all comes down to story. How do we invest the audience in the story?”

In the case of Dead Reckoning Part One, the big – capital B – stunt to get that investment involved a motorcycle jump off a cliff which then leads into a base jump. Easy-peasy, right? But Cruise figured the best plan was to film it on day one of production… just in case he got killed doing it.

“Either we will continue with the film or we’re not,” he laughed in an interview with ET . “Let’s know day one! Let us know day one what is going to happen. Do we all continue or is it a major rewrite?”

Of course, that doesn’t include all the prep that Cruise and the team did to get the stunt right – and to make sure the actor didn’t get killed in the process. This meant Cruise did over 500 skydives and over 13,000 motocross jumps just during rehearsals and while planning the stunt. 500 skydives! And then when the actual shoot came, Cruise rode a motorcycle off a cliff six times that day. Or rather, six motorcycles, since they didn’t have parachutes like he did.

McQuarrie admits that this was the scariest stunt to execute… for this movie anyway. But Dead Reckoning Part Two isn’t done yet, either.

“In terms of this movie, definitely the motorcycle jump,” McQuarrie said when asked about the scariest stunt they’ve shot. “But we have continued and we've pushed ourselves even further in Part Two. And you'll see. It's terrifying.”

It all goes back to Tom Cruise’s Hollywood oath, doesn’t it?

“I love this industry, and I've been blessed to be able to live my dreams since I was a kid,” Cruise said. “I was four years old and I wanted to travel the world, make movies. I wanted to go to different cultures and not just visit as a tourist. I wanted to work there. I wanted to be there. And this has given me my dream and afforded me to be able to share it and put it on screen. And I've dedicated my life to this art form. … I make movies for audiences. I don't really think about awards either. For me, it's about the audience. It's not about all of that other stuff. When I'm making movies, I'm not thinking about that. I'm literally thinking about that family that are going out to the theater. For them to have that experience. That's what's important.”

,"Your Weekly Roundup of Movies: In the Battle Between “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie,” Cinema Wins",,"OPPENHEIMER

**** At the start of Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, raindrops fall; at the end, fire rages. You’ll feel it burn long after the end credits roll. Nolan has made violent movies before (including Inception and Dunkirk), but Oppenheimer is not just about physical devastation. It submerges you in the violence of a guilt-ravaged soul, leaving you feeling unsettled and unclean. Confronting the film’s moral and spiritual weight is a fearsome challenge, and one well worth rising to.

With agitated charisma and vulnerability, Cillian Murphy embodies J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist whose mind birthed the atomic bomb. When we first meet him, he’s a curly-haired lad staring at a puddle, but he swiftly evolves into an excitable visionary leading a cadre of scientists into the deserts of New Mexico, where they will ultimately build and test a plutonium device (referred to as “the gadget”) on July 16, 1945.

While Nolan exists a world apart from Oppenheimer—his creativity far exceeds his fascination with destruction—he has absorbed some of his subject’s frantic energy. Attempting to squeeze decades of a man’s intellectual and emotional life into a mere three hours, Nolan sometimes reduces moments to fragments, egged on by Ludwig Göransson’s eerie and pulsating score (which is excellent but overused).

What saves the film from becoming a connect-the-dots biopic is Nolan’s ingenious chronicle of the post-World War II rivalry between Oppenheimer and Atomic Energy Commission chair Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). The more Oppenheimer fights to put “the nuclear genie back in the bottle,” the more Strauss seethes and schemes, thrusting the movie into a maze of double-crosses that echo the exhilarating games of perception in Nolan’s 2001 breakout hit Memento.

Of course, the thrill can’t (and shouldn’t) last. A decade ago, I applauded jubilantly as Nolan wrapped his Dark Knight trilogy, but Oppenheimer left me silent and still. As many as 226,000 people were killed when the U.S. bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and they haunt the film like ghosts—especially when Oppenheimer imagines a charred corpse beneath his foot. A man dreamed; people died. All a work of art can do is evoke their absence. R. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

BARBIE

*** Once upon a time, Barbie dolls liberated all women from tyranny. The end…at least according to the first few minutes of Barbie, a sleek and satirical fantasia from director Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women). Set in the utopian kingdom of Barbieland, the movie dramatizes the existential crises of the winkingly named Stereotypical Barbie. She’s played by Margot Robbie, who was last seen battling a rattlesnake in Damien Chazelle’s Babylon—and her misadventures in Barbie are hardly less bizarre. Plagued by flat feet, cellulite and fears of death, Barbie seeks the source of her ailments in the real world, bringing along a beamingly inadequate Ken (Ryan Gosling) with catastrophic consequences: Awed by images of Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, Ken becomes a crusading men’s rights activist, leading a revolt against the government of Barbieland and instituting bros-first martial law. And they say originality is dead! With its absurdist wit, glitzy musical numbers, and earnest ruminations on whether matriarchy and patriarchy can coexist, Barbie is easily one of the most brazen movies released by a major studio. Yes, its tidy ending betrays its anarchic spirit—after insisting that empowerment can’t be neatly packaged in a doll box, the film seems to say, “No, wait! It can!”—but it would be churlish to deny the charm of Gerwig’s buoyant creation. In an age when genuine cinematic joy is rare, we’re all lucky to be passengers in Barbie’s hot-pink plastic convertible. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

AFIRE

**** In the tradition of his many compromised romances (Phoenix, Transit, Undine), writer-director Christian Petzold explores connections missed, made and retroactively illuminated during a novelist’s work-cation on the Baltic Sea in Afire. In black denim and gray New Balances, Leon (Thomas Schubert) is practically in uniform as someone who hates the beach. He’s destined to miss out, but the audience doesn’t. Petzold lets us enjoy Leon’s companions—his friend Felix (Langston Uibel), their unexpected housemate Nadja (Paula Beer) and a local lifeguard (Enno Trebs)—and Germany’s north coast. All the while, Leon frets over his manuscript, and a forest fire rages in the distance. Dreamy yet frustrated, blunt yet forgiving, Afire holds space for modern life’s many scales—a creative’s navel-gazing, less selfish characters’ acceptance of provincial life, existential dread. Reveling in Nadja’s beauty, intelligence and generosity (she’s always making goulash), Petzold keeps challenging the audience with Leon’s shaky grip on protagonist status. Often, this sour lump is the last character whose vantage point you’d want in this film, but that’s all part of Petzold’s ever-fascinating “both/and” filmmaking. People will still take meaningful vacations as the world burns; a bad writer can tell a good story; and Nadja will offer Leon a welcoming smile because they’ve shared a deeply imperfect moment. NR.

MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – DEAD RECKONING PART ONE

**** Danger is a drug—and in his third Mission: Impossible film, director Christopher McQuarrie simultaneously shoves it up your nostrils and stabs it into your veins. As usual, daredevil secret agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is chasing after an explosive MacGuffin that he must protect from a doomsday-loving maniac (Esai Morales, in this case) lest the world go boom. Rather than vary the formula, McQuarrie simply refurbishes it (brilliantly) with fresh flourishes of suspense. You’ve seen Ethan race against the clock, but you’ve never seen him rushing through an airport in Abu Dhabi during a countdown to a nuclear explosion. You’ve seen him in one-on-one fights, but never with a demented French swordswoman (Pom Klementieff) in a terrifyingly cramped alley in Venice. You’ve seen him battle his adversaries on trains, but never run through one as it tumbles into…oh, just see the movie already, will you? Dead Reckoning Part One isn’t just cinema. It’s the essence of everything cinema was made for—not just triumphantly tense violence, but delicious glamour and sex appeal (a nighttime negotiation with Alanna Mitsopolis, a broker played with a lascivious grin by Vanessa Kirby, is nearly erotic enough to deserve an NC-17 rating). And while the apparent death of a main character strikes a sour note—these films work best when they’re disposable and delightful, not tragic and ruthless—I’m hopeful that it’s a red herring designed to goose our sympathies before Part Two arrives next year. It wouldn’t be the first time that a Mission: Impossible movie has manipulated its audience to irresistibly grand effect. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

PAST LIVES

**** As Nora (Greta Lee) is about to share a first kiss with her future husband, Arthur (John Magaro), she explains the Korean phrase in-yun—fate’s hand in human connection and reconnection. Intentionally or not, she’s referring just as much to Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), her best friend and crush from before she immigrated from Seoul to Canada. Ever since, Hae Sung has reappeared to Nora like a 12-year comet, and in director Celine Song’s Past Lives, Hae Sung visits Nora in present-day Brooklyn. Both unambiguous romance and genre experiment, Past Lives sustains itself on love’s textures and musings: endless gazes, mirrorlike skyscrapers, a twinkling synth score (by Christopher Bear and Daniel Rossen), and a vibrant but melancholy obsession with New York City. Gorgeous 30-somethings who can’t keep guileless vulnerability off their faces, these characters aren’t looking to blow up their lives for the sake of movie contrivances, but through every private conversation, they’re drawn to discussing the same narrative possibilities on the audience’s minds. Who is the right lover in a story sense? Even Arthur wonders. Are in-yun and Nora’s brief, almost multiversal encounters with Hae Sung potent enough to alter the years in between? And when she glimpses the past in his kind, mournful eyes, is she dreaming or seeing? PG-13. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Living Room.

JOY RIDE

** In a seeming attempt to reflect the diverse array of untold Asian narratives—a shared pressure among many Asian American artists—Joy Ride accomplishes the opposite, offering a rushed 90 minutes overcrowded by underdeveloped characters and plot turns. Adopted Chinese American Audrey (Ashley Park) travels to her birth country for the first time, along with two eccentric best friends, Kat (Stephanie Hsu), a Chinese soap opera actor hiding her sexual past from her God-fearing virgin fiancé, and Lolo (Sherry Cola), a fledgling artist who makes playground models resembling genitalia to “get the conversation going” (Lolo also brings along her BTS-obsessed cousin, played by a wide-eyed, scene-stealing Sabrina Wu). Audrey’s business trip to China quickly turns into a cross-continental search for her birth mother, and the film sharply illustrates certain minority challenges—internalized shame, dissonance between internal and external perceptions of self. Yet its efforts to provide a comprehensive cultural education (the work of not one, but many, many more representative films) result in stilted dialogue and a hasty denouement. The comedy’s saving grace lies in its effectively over-the-top humor; filled with riotous bits and clever one-liners, Joy Ride promises to leave the audience feeling lighter than before they entered the theater. And, sometimes, that’s all we need from a movie. R. ROSE WONG. Eastport, Fox Tower.

QUICKSAND

* A bickering couple on the brink of divorce gets stuck in a muddy hole in the forests of Colombia in Quicksand. Carolina Gaitan and Allan Hawco play Sofia and Josh, health care professionals who have journeyed to the country to assist a friend. After going on a hike and winding up in an area they were warned about, Sofia and Josh end up in a fight for their lives. The two have to put aside their differences in order to survive the ordeal, but Matt Pitts’ screenplay never rings true as it jumps from scene to scene. Quicksand could have worked as a survival scenario crossed with a therapy session, but the couple’s conflict feels underwritten and their inept decision making makes it hard to root for them. Director Andres Beltran tries to overcome the thin screenplay by overselling many scenes with music and style; many sequences are well shot, but the messy editing often betrays the images. Quicksand does provide some minor enjoyment with unintentional laughs (some involving a snake), but most of the time the film is alternately boring and annoying. NR. DANIEL RESTER.

After quite a lengthy break (in no small part thanks to the pandemic), Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt is back at it again in ""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One."" It's a long movie, and as the name implies, just the first part of a larger story cooked up by writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, who has been steering the ship since ""Rogue Nation."" While many familiar faces returned for this latest adventure, one notably missing was Angela Bassett's Erika Sloane. But rest assured, she has not been forgotten.

Speaking recently with Variety, McQuarrie addressed the absence of Bassett's character, who was first introduced in 2018's ""Mission: Impossible – Fallout"" as the director of the CIA. Originally, Bassett was going to be in the latest installment, but unfortunately, all of the pandemic-related delays created a scheduling conflict. McQuarrie explained that she would have returned as the head of the CIA, while also heavily implying that she's coming back in the future.

""She was going to be the head of the CIA. She would have been in that room with all of the other heads of the intelligence community. And we're not done with Angela Bassett. Angela is too fabulous, you could never ever let Angela get away, so there's always a plan in the future.""

Does that mean we're going to see Erika Sloane back in the mess in ""Dead Reckoning, Part Two"" next year? Maybe, maybe not. As Tom Cruise recently said, he wants to keep making these movies until he's 80, so there may well be further opportunities down the line as well.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTMzODkzMi9hbmdlbGEtYmFzc2V0dC1tYXktcmV0dXJuLXRvLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1ub3QtZm9yZ290dGVuLWluLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

International hotel, river cruise and rail company Orient Express is stealing the show on the silver screen.

For the newly-released blockbuster, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, the company built a replica of its historic, art deco-era trains. Orient Express is taking viewers behind the scenes in a new activation, showing off technical know-how and creative spirit just in time for the film’s premiere.

“The Mission: Impossible team has taken the use of trains as locations to a whole new level,” said Simon Pielow, cofounder of Luxury Train Club, Swindon.

“We have enjoyed for some years providing trains, carriages, and rail facilities such as stations for movies and more, but we acknowledge that Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning has hugely raised the bar!”

Making the mission possible

Engaging in what it calls “practical filmmaking,” Orient Express worked with director and writer Christopher McQuarrie to bring adventurous storytelling to life.

With minds set on having one of the signature fight scenes set on a vintage locomotive, the filmmaking team and the rail company came together to create a train for the job. In a 150-second video, Orient Express gives consumers, moviegoers and travel fans alike a glimpse at the process that went into it.

Orient Express takes viewers behind the action

“When we started talking about this movie in terms of a sense of adventure, an action sequence on a train was something we’d always wanted to do,” says Mr. McQuarrie, in the video.

“We wanted to build upon the previous films and apply all of that knowledge to something practical and real, and bring this train sequence to another level,” he says. “There was not a surplus of trains available to be wrecked.

“We had to build the train if we wanted to destroy it.”

Upon request, the Orient Express engineers made an exact copy of the famous luxury trains that carried affluent guests in the early 1900s.

The finished product set the tone for key scenes in the Mission: Impossible movie, with each car specifically designed for the plot, and stunt doubles and actor Tom Cruise performing fights on its roof as it barrelled down the tracks in Norway.

Though used as an elaborate setting and prop for the film, the train was completely functional and was conducted on working railroad tracks in the fjord-speckled country. Inside, actors – including luxury favorite Vanessa Kirby (see story) – played out their parts of the narrative, walking and running through twinkling passenger seating, shining kitchens and gold-gilded dining cars as the Orient Express moved at 60 miles per hour through Nordic valleys outside.

As mentioned, the purpose of building a new train entirely was so that the locomotive could be destroyed.

The crash scene was shot in a quarry in the United Kingdom, a track built off a cliff for the train to barrel off of. With such a precarious task, the filmmakers only had one chance to get the shot.

Multiple cameras were deployed, as a helicopter took angles overhead. If the train fell into the rocks below without it captured well, the destruction would be for naught.

This level of old-world filmmaking is unique amongst the movie magic of computer-generated images, calling back to Hollywood’s westerns and golden era films of old.

“Everything you’re seeing in this spectacular train sequence is done to invest the audience in these characters,” says Mr. McQuarrie, in the video.

“We could only do it with a team like this and an actor like Tom.”

All aboard

Orient Express is no stranger to the big screen (see story), but its feature in the Mission: Impossible franchise marks a new milestone for the brand.

Other luxury names have showed up in the series before, including German automaker BMW, which had a role to play in the 2015 release, Rogue Nation (see story). Now, as train travel picks up as a trend (see story), it is Orient Express’s time to shine.

Starting in 2025, a year after Dead Reckoning's second installment premieres, modern voyagers will be able to experience the same train model for themselves.

The company is inviting travelers aboard 17 original Orient Express cars from the 1920s and 1930s. Like the train used for Dead Reckoning, the vehicles are adorned with time-period-appropriate decor, now updated with contemporary luxury design codes.

The cars, historically known together as the “Nostalgie-Istanbul-Orient-Express,” are the work of architect Maxime d’Angeac, a former collaborator of French fashion and leather goods house Hermès and French beauty brand Guerlain. Mr. d’Angeac fittingly is a fan of storytelling, as guests will be able to tell from the theatrical touches put on the Mission: Impossible inclusion.

Though there are still a few years to go before luxury travelers can come aboard the vintage vehicle, for now, fans of the brand can head to theaters to see the train in action.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1eHVyeWRhaWx5LmNvbS9vcmllbnQtZXhwcmVzcy1sZW5kcy1sb2NvbW90aXZlLXRvLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1jcmV3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
,Mission: Impossible Director Reveals Why Dead Reckoning is Two Parts,Christopher McQuarrie always knew Dead Reckoning would 'be bigger and longer than Fallout.',"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is now playing in theaters, and it marks the third film of the Tom Cruise-led franchise to be helmed by Christopher McQuarrie. It's also the first time that a Mission: Impossible story has been split into two parts. Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two is scheduled to be released next June, but that will likely be pushed back because the production is currently on pause due to the WGA and SAG strikes. Recently, McQuarrie spoke with Collider and explained why Dead Reckoning has been split into two parts.

""Well, we knew with Fallout. Fallout really grew because of all the character and emotion we were putting into the story, all the things that we had discovered in Rogue Nation that was so unexpected,"" McQuarrie explained. ""I knew I wanted to expand the cast, and I knew I wanted to give each one of those characters more to do, so I knew the movie was going to be bigger and longer than Fallout.""

He continued, ""And at which point I said, 'Why are we fighting this? Why are we going to try to jam this into two hours? Let's just break it in half and make it two movies.' That really was the rationale behind it being a two-part movie. It just it wasn't just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie."" He added, ""At that time, the studio were actually very genuinely excited about it ... And, you know, I think we were excited about it too. And then there were times when we were on set, and Tom would look at me, and he'd say, 'This was your idea. Just remember that.'""

Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One at the Box Office:

Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One has gotten rave reviews, but it hasn't had a very successful run at the box office. The movie is currently up on Rotten Tomatoes with an impressive 96% critics score and a 94% audience score, but it's just not matching the success of other July releases such as Barbie and Oppenheimer. However, the movie isn't exactly a flop, and even reached a box office milestone this week. According to Collider, the seventh Mission: Impossible film has now made $450 million worldwide.

While $450 million after three weeks isn't exactly terrible, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is the second-lowest-grossing movie in the franchise. The last installment, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, remains the highest-grossing movie in the franchise with a total of $791 million worldwide. Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation made $688 million worldwide, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol made $694 million worldwide, and Mission: Impossible II earned $550 million worldwide. The original Mission: Impossible earned $457 million worldwide, which means Dead Reckoning Part One is guaranteed to beat its numbers, however, the first movie was a much bigger success than the current installment when adjusted for inflation. That just leaves Mission: Impossible III, which earned the lowest of the franchise at $399 million worldwide.

What Is Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning About?

Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which premiered in theaters on July 12th. It's the beginning of the end for the action-packed franchise, as Cruise reteams with longtime collaborator and filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie for more death-defying and breathtaking stunts. Hunt and allies Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) attempt to track down a new weapon with the power to tear the world apart.

2023-06-20 22:22:13+00:00,Tom Cruise Shot ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ Motorcycle Stunt on Day One So the Crew Would Know: ‘Do We Continue or Is It a Major Rewrite’ If I Fail?,"Tom Cruise filmed the ""Dead Reckoning"" motorcycle stunt on the first day of filming so that if he died other parts of the movie wouldn't be wasted.","“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” director Christopher McQuarrie made headlines at the start of June after revealing to Empire magazine that Tom Cruise‘s insane motorcycle stunt was shot on the first day of filming. The stunt, billed as the most death-defying one of Cruise’s acting career thus far, finds Cruise riding a motorcycle off the edge of a cliff and then parachuting to safety while in free fall.

“Doing that on day one gave us all the time in the world to understand why he [Ethan] was doing what he was doing,” McQuarrie told the publication. “If we sat around and tried to figure out these movies the old-fashioned way, you’d never find it, simply because it’s such a living, breathing thing.”

For Tom Cruise, however, there was a far more practical reason for putting the motorcycle stunt on the first day of the “Mission: Impossible 7” shoot. If production on the $200 million-plus tentpole was already underway and Cruise got severely injured or died because of the motorcycle stunt, then a lot of money would’ve been wasted. Cruise suffered an ankle injury on “Mission: Impossible 6” that impacted production, but riding a motorcycle off a cliff was far deadlier than any “Mission” stunt prior.

“Well we know either we will continue with the film or we’re not. Let’s know day one!” Cruise recently told Entertainment Tonight about filming the stunt at the very start of production. “Let us know day one what is going to happen: Do we all continue or is it a major rewrite?”

“I was training and I was ready,” Cruise added. “You have to be razor sharp when you’re doing something like that. It was very important as we were prepping the film that it was actually the first thing. I don’t want to drop that and go shoot other things and have my mind somewhere else. Everyone was prepped. Let’s just get it done.”

The latest “Mission: Impossible” sequel finds Cruise’s Ethan Hunt teaming up with IMF agents to track down a terrifying weapon that threatens humanity. Cruise is once again joined by returning franchise players Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Henry Czerny, Vanessa Kirby and Frederick Schmidt. Newcomers to the franchise include Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, Cary Elwes, Rob Delaney, Indira Varma, Shea Whigham, Mark Gatiss, Esai Morales and Charles Parnell.

“Dead Reckoning” is expected to be one of the biggest Hollywood tentpoles of the summer movie season, if not the biggest. Cruise is riding high off the blockbuster success of “Top Gun: Maverick” last year, which ended its run as the 11th highest grossing film in history (unadjusted for inflation) with $1.49 billion. While “Dead Reckoning” may not reach those box office heights, it’s certainly expected to outgross 2017’s “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” ($791 million) and become the franchise’s new top earner.

2023-07-14 17:08:30+00:00,"The story behind Barbenheimer, the summer’s most online movie showdown","The very online showdown between Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” all started with a date: July 21.

It’s not uncommon for studios to counterprogram films in different genres on a big weekend, but the stark differences between an intense, serious-minded picture about the man who oversaw the development of the atomic bomb and a lighthearted, candy-colored anthropomorphizing of a childhood doll quickly became the stuff of viral fodder.

There’s even some disagreement over whether it’s “Barbieheimer” or “Barbenheimer” or “Boppenheimer” or yet another tortured portmanteau — a phenomenon on which the AP Stylebook has yet to offer guidance, but for the purposes of this article will be “Barbenheimer.”

It didn’t hurt that both Nolan and Gerwig have very passionate and very online fandoms eager to join in. Never mind that many of those fans overlap — the memes, allegiances, and T-shirts were just too fun.

Both movies often trend on social media when the other releases a new asset — a trailer, a picture, an interview. On one level, it’s a marketing department’s dream. Awareness could not be higher, the conversation couldn’t be louder, and neither film even has official reviews out yet.

“’Barbenheimer’ is a marketing gift borne out of social media and I think it’s benefiting both films,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for analytics firm Comscore. “You’re certainly aware of both movies in a more profound and compelling way than I think might have otherwise happened had they been released on different weekends.”

AMC Theaters reported that 20,000 of its AMC Stubs members had purchased tickets for a double feature. If you’re counting, that’s 294 minutes of moviewatching. Even Margot Robbie — Barbie herself — and Tom Cruise, the star of another summer blockbuster, have started plotting the ideal “Barbenheimer” day.

“It’s a perfect double bill,” said Robbie at her movie’s London premiere Wednesday. “I think actually start your day with ‘Barbie,’ then go straight into ‘Oppenheimer’ and then a ‘Barbie’ chaser.”

Cruise — whose “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” opened a little over a week before the “Barbenheimer” showdown — said at his premiere he’d plan to see both on their opening day, likely starting with “Oppenheimer,” which seems to be the internet’s preferred viewing order as well.

“Barbie” actor Issa Rae thinks there’s a reason for that.

“I think that there’s a very specific order that if you see them in. If you see ‘Oppenheimer’ last then you might be a bit of a psychopath,” she diagnosed at the London premiere.

The showdown has made armchair marketing experts out of everyone, quick to scrutinize every move by Warner Bros. and Universal — as though it’s possible to compare two extraordinarily different campaigns.

One has infinite opportunities for very pink, sparkly photo opportunities, whimsical brand partnerships for seemingly everything from underwear to pool floats, large-scale fan events with autograph signings and pop stars like Billie Eilish posting about the soundtrack. In other words, the “Barbie” campaign can go nuclear.

“Oppenheimer” has the bomb, the alluring mystery and the big screen hook, but it’s not the kind of movie that lends itself to, say, a frozen yogurt collaboration.

Is the competition real, though, or just a meme? Some in Hollywood wondered if Warner Bros. plopped “Barbie” on the weekend as a slight to Nolan, who had opened many films for the studio in that corridor including “Inception” and “Dunkirk.” He left Warner Bros. amid its controversial decision to send a year’s worth of movies to streaming and made “Oppenheimer” with Universal instead. But a pointed box office war doesn’t exactly make sense for a studio that has talked recently about wanting to lure Nolan back.

There is an unspoken code of conduct: Never badmouth another studio’s film, publicly at least. This is partly decorum, especially when it comes to “box office showdowns” which all will say are a creation of the press and sideline spectators. But it’s also rooted in some truth: The conventional thinking is that having eyes on one movie is good for other movies — you see their posters and trailers and on some level everyone benefits.

And social media has allowed movie stars to get in on the game, too. Following reports that Cruise was irked the latest “Mission: Impossible” was going to lose its IMAX screens to “Oppenheimer” after only a week, Cruise posted photos of himself and director Christopher McQuarrie standing in front of posters for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” holding tickets for each.

“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters. These are just a few that we can’t wait to see on the big screen,” Cruise’s Instagram caption read.

The official accounts for “Indiana Jones,” “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” responded with supportive notes. Gerwig and Robbie even followed with a similar photo series a few days later, which the official “Oppenheimer” Instagram account reposted in its stories. Charged with playing Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy told the AP at his movie’s London premiere that “of course” he’d be seeing “Barbie.” The sporting cross-promotion between four studios — Universal, Warner Bros., Disney and Paramount — is something the film business has not quite seen before.

“Not only is Tom Cruise the biggest box office star in the world, but he’s also an incredible ambassador for the movie theater, for the movie theater experience and boosting other movies,” Dergarabedian said. “And that collegial atmosphere within the framework of what is seen as the very competitive box office derby is kind of a nice thing.”

Still, everyone likes a No. 1 debut, and both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” reportedly carry $100 million production price tags (not including the millions spent on marketing). As far as box office tracking goes, “Barbie” has it in the bag with forecasts showing that it could open above $90 million in North America. “Oppenheimer” meanwhile is tracking in the $40 million range. Then there’s the wild card of “Mission: Impossible 7’s” second weekend, which could snag second place.

Still even with a second- or third-place start, “Oppenheimer” could be destined for a long, steady, profitable run into awards season. Adult audiences for R-rated movies are not often the ones who pack theaters the first weekend.

Back in 2008, in the midst of the recession, Warner Bros. and Universal faced off on the same July weekend with another Nolan film that went up against a lighthearted confection: “The Dark Knight” and “Mamma Mia!” — both of which went on to be enormously profitable (though Nolan did win the first weekend).

The bigger worry is that what’s been heralded as Hollywood’s post-pandemic comeback summer has had more ups and downs than anyone might have hoped. That’s putting quite a bit of pressure on “Barbenheimer” to overperform and boost the lagging summer box office, which pales in comparison to the bigger issues facing the industry as actors join the writers on strike.

But with just over a week to go, it’s still a source of amusement. Even “Barbie” co-star Will Ferrell threw the gauntlet in his winking way at the London premiere.

“I think the world maybe wants to see ‘Barbie’ a little bit more right now,” Ferrell said. “Just saying!”

2023-07-15 13:10:36+00:00,"Hayley Atwell And Chris McQuarrie Reveal Why The Mission: Impossible Fiat Car Chase Was A Technical Nightmare, But The Scene They Are Most Proud Of",We can listen to Christopher McQuarrie talk about how he makes Mission: Impossible movies all day.,"The Mission: Impossible films are best known for their death-defying stunts , often performed practically by the virtually ageless Tom Cruise. We covered, extensively, the amount of prep that Cruise put in to filming the motorcycle jump into a freefall base-jump cliff stunt for the new movie Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, Part One. But if you ask director Christopher McQuarrie, he’ll tell you that the Fiat car chase around Rome is the scene that he’s most proud of, and for good reason.

You have seen the scene teased in the trailers . Tom Cruise and Hayley Atwell are running for their lives, escaping some heavy hitters (including Pom Klementieff, acting like a lunatic). They escape in a series of vehicles. Motorcycles. Cars. And they end up in a tricked out yellow Fiat… handcuffed together.

(Image credit: Paramount Pictures)

That should be challenging enough, right? Well, no. While speaking with Christopher McQuarrie regarding the planning and execution of that chase scene, he talked alot about how Rome, and the conditions of the location, dictated what they could do… and not do. As McQuarrie told CinemaBlend:

There was a lot of experimentation between Tom and Haley. What their relationship was, and how that relationship was supposed to evolve over the course of that sequence. On top of that, when you got to Rome with that car, and all the work we had done to increase its power – which made it very unpredictable – and you are very fortunate in that you have someone like Tom Cruise behind the wheel, admittedly with one hand cuffed to somebody else. Tom has so much experience shooting car chases that he was able to safely navigate all of that.

But there’s a technical element to the Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, Part One Fiat car chase around Rome that might go unrecognized unless you know to look out for it. Because as Hayley Atwell went on to explain that throughout the chase sequence, she and Tom Cruise are framed by McQuarrie in a two shot. Meaning, the take of the scene that the director could use had to be good for both actors, and not something that could be covered up by quick edits. Atwell went on to say:

And that’s because of the work that we did together as a team going, ‘How do we stay present in the moment with each other, where we know each other’s character inside out and we trust each other as actors to remain present. So that none of us drop balls. So that I can react to anything that he’s offering me, and vice versa.’ It’s such a small thing, seemingly. Most people would never pick up on this. But to be able to achieve that in a two-shot within the context of a car chase sequence is a HUGE, huge achievement technologically, as well as creatively. It’s something I’m really proud of.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaW5lbWFibGVuZC5jb20vaW50ZXJ2aWV3cy9oYXlsZXktYXR3ZWxsLWFuZC1jaHJpcy1tY3F1YXJyaWUtcmV2ZWFsLXdoeS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZmlhdC1jYXItY2hhc2UtdGVjaG5pY2FsLW5pZ2h0bWFyZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,

It seems like a tight competition is ahead of everyone, and people are keeping a close eye on which movie will bring home the trophy, at least between Barbie and Oppenheimer, whose rivalry has been creating a buzz on social media for the past few months.

Box Office Tracking Predicts Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer Behind Barbie And Mission: Impossible 7

The latest box office projection is looking a bit hazy for Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer. Considering it is rated R, it will most likely have a limited number of viewers. As per NRG (via Matthew Belloni on Twitter), the box office tracking for Oppenheimer is $43 million, while Barbie is expected to open with $93 million and Mission: Impossible 7 with $68.5 million.

The two biggest tent poles for the month, also called “Barbenheimer”, will give fans the most interesting showdown for the year. Each film has secured its target market, with Barbie focusing on mostly female audiences under the age of 35. Its marketing schemes and advertisement all over social media are also appealing to male viewers.

Oppenheimer, on the other hand, will most likely target older audiences. Still, the $43 million box office projection would mark one of Christopher Nolan’s lowest openings since The Prestige in 2006.

Meanwhile, Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible 7 is already taking advantage of the IMAX screens this week before Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer completely devour the premium theaters. The Cillian Murphy-led film is specifically tailored for IMAX screen viewing, and while everyone looks forward to its critical and commercial success, it is not guaranteed to cross the billion-dollar mark. IMAX tickets are also pricey, so if fans would be willing to shell out a few more bucks to watch it in all its spectacular glory, then it will probably be worth the experience.

The stiff competition brewing between the three highly-anticipated movies is more than enough to revive the art of moviegoing. Since the pandemic, the theater business has experienced drought, and many studios had to face a great loss of income.

Can Oppenheimer Cross The $1 Billion Mark?

Although Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer has a restricted set of viewers, it is not impossible to break the box office record. The film is currently one of the most hyped and talked about titles for the past few months, and if Todd Phillips’ Joker (2019) can achieve that milestone, Oppenheimer also has the potential to set a new record for a hard-R film.

Nolan describes his magnum opus as a horror movie, and those who watched the early screening all felt devastated leaving the theaters. The graphic scenes and extreme visualization might have been too much for some moviegoers. It is most plausible that Oppenheimer will be a critical success, but its attempt to beat Barbie and Mission: Impossible 7 at the box office is one uphill battle.

Oppenheimer and Barbie will arrive on July 21, 2023. Mission: Impossible 7 is now showing in theaters worldwide.

Qu’on soit bien d’accord : le 2e volet n’est pas un mauvais film, un mauvais blockbuster, ou même un mauvais Mission impossible. C’est du pur John Woo, qui pète dans tous les sens, plus porté sur l’action que sur l’espionnage et qui transpire les années 2000. Foncièrement cool et kitsch, il en demeure peut-être l’épisode le plus faible malgré tout. Mais on avait prévenu : c’est une saga de haut niveau !


On sait, c’est celui qui relance la franchise, qui lance la grande machine, la grande histoire d’amour centrale. Et oui, on est d’accord pour dire que Philip Seymour Hoffman est le vilain le plus intéressant de tous les Mission impossible. Mais pour autant, il faut reconnaître que le J.J. Abrams n’est pas encore au niveau du reste — ni de sa filmo, le cinéaste allant peut-être un peu trop piocher dans sa série Alias.


On connaît plus Brad Bird dans l’animation que dans le live action. Pourtant, entre le sous-estimé Tomorrowland et celui-ci, il y avait de quoi lancer une belle carrière. Après, et ce même si on aime une fois encore beaucoup le film et la vraie leçon de réalisation de Bird, le fait est que 12 plus tard, on ne se souvient que de la scène d’escalade du building de Dubaï.


Pour ce nouveau volet, on revient à l’espionnage le plus pur. Mais la course à la cascade la plus folle continue. Ce qui est fascinant avec le film, c’est qu’étrangement, le fait de connaître en avance la cascade ultime (la chute à moto du haut d’une montagne pour atteindre un train) devient un enjeu d’attente et de montée en pression. Si on ne savait pas, la cascade en serait presque moins puissante, ce qui interroge un peu sur la construction du récit autour de son marketing. Il n’empêche que voir Tom Cruise se battre contre une IA et des algorithmes, à l’heure du combat pour les salles de cinéma et contre les plateformes de streaming, a quelque chose d’assez jouissif. Au final, malgré certains pans de l’histoire qu’on trouve un peu plus faibles, l’épisode est vraiment un excellent volet — et au-dessus de 90 % des productions hollywoodiennes actuelles.


L’arrivée de McQuarrie sur la franchise a permis de trouver l’ADN définitif de ce qu’est un Mission impossible. Le réalisateur arrive et casse les codes en ouvrant le film sur la grosse cascade, et concluant sur une poursuite, alors qu’habituellement, c’est l’inverse. Il solidifie ce que les précédents tentaient de faire, à savoir des films de bande qui ne soient pas uniquement centrés sur Ethan Hunt. L’intrigue demeure du pur Mission impossible.

Et puis, bon. Rebecca Ferguson, quoi.


Sa place n’est pas là que pour les séquences parisiennes. Ni pour la cascade en chute libre/parachute, ou pour le braquage de fourgon. Ni pour la course-poursuite à moto à contresens. Ni pour les gros bras et la moustache de Henry Cavill. Ni pour l’aspect martyr hanté par le deuil de Hunt, creusant la psyché de son personnage plus que jamais. Ni pour le fait que McQuarrie s’approprie plus encore la franchise à changeant de compositeur, de chef op. Mais on ne peut nier qu’il n’est pas loin d’être le meilleur de la saga.
