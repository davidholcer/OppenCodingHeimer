8/17/2023 15:23,‘Blue Beetle’ director Ángel Manuel Soto says the DC film is a ‘love letter to our ancestors’,"“Blue Beetle,” director Ángel Manuel Soto says that he didn’t think too much about the “Latino side of things” when visually crafting the film alongside Mexican screenwriter Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer.","WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif.. (AP) — Director Ángel Manuel Soto didn’t think too much about the “Latino side of things” when visually crafting DC’s “Blue Beetle” alongside Mexican screenwriter Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer.
The film — starring “Cobra Kai’s” Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes, aka Blue Beetle and DC’s first Latino superhero — oozes with Mexican references and elements of other Latin American cultures through almost every scene. Still, the Puerto Rican director says that all of this came naturally due to his and Dunnet-Alcocer’s backgrounds.
“We never were like, ‘Okay, so how are we going to make this Latino?’ We cannot hide who we are. If we have the opportunity to tell our collective experiences because we are Latino, they’re going to come out Latino.”
In “Blue Beetle,” Reyes finds himself in possession of an ancient scarab named Khaji Da made of alien biotechnology that chooses Reyes as its symbiotic host. In a hilarious scene, the scarab attaches itself to Reyes, transforming the hesitant young adult into a superhero.
Soto is promoting the film by himself due to the ongoing Hollywood strikes, which prohibit actors and screenwriters from promoting work under television and theatrical contracts. Still, he made sure to bring his cast along for the ride via a culturally relevant white shirt with illustrations of his lead cast as Mexican Loteria characters during the Los Angeles leg of the press tour. The game is similar to bingo and is popular in Mexican and Mexican-American households.
“I know they’re sad that they cannot be here, but they understand that what they’re doing is important for the future generations, and they have my full support, so the least I could do was bring them with me,” said Soto. “I know they’re here in spirit.”
Soto hopes that audiences will still show up to support the film when it opens Friday.
“Hopefully, people will watch the movie because it is a good movie, and our cast killed it and they’re going to fall in love with them,” said Soto.
The Associated Press sat down with Soto to chat more about the film’s seamless Mexican and Latino cultural references and why he was initially hesitant to take on the project.
Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.
AP: What has it been like being on this press tour, having to promote it on your own?
SOTO: I love talking about what I love. I think as exhausting as it might be, because it’s a lot for one person to do, connecting with fans and having experiences with people from other cultures, from other countries definitely fuels the energy cause I’m learning a lot. I learn a lot when I talk to people. I get reassurance, I get empowered. So any depletion of energy caused to forced nights of sleep and constant travel are immediately replenished when interacting with beautiful people.
AP: I read that you originally wanted to pitch a Bane origin story, but instead, DC presented you with this film. What was it like for you mentally having to pivot from wanting to tell a supervillain origin story to this coming-of-age superhero one?
SOTO: I had no idea they were working on something like “Blue Beetle.” Coming out of the success of a film like “The Joker” and understanding there’s other characters that might have so many things to explore, I wanted to pitch that Bane idea. So they came in and was like, ‘Yeah, that’s a great idea. But we got this product here, and it’s “Blue Beetle.” I knew a little bit about Blue Beetle. I knew that Jaime Reyes was in it. My first reaction was that I didn’t want to brownwash something, you know, that already existed. It’s okay if there’s familiarity with certain things, but I didn’t want to be that person that my Latinidad had to conform to somebody else’s expectations of Latinidad. I wanted to be able to be free, and I wanted the actors that I hired that are Latino to be authentically themselves.
So when I said that, they were like, ‘Oh, no, no, don’t worry. Our writer is Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer. He is a Mexican from Querétaro and just read the script. Let me know what you think.’ And when I read the script, I could see that the person who wrote it not only is Latino, but he wrote characters that he knows and they were so relatable because we’ve realized that even though we’re both from different countries, we’re so similar. Our families are so similar. The music, the TV shows, we grew up exactly the same, just in different countries. And we’re like, ’Oh my gosh, this is special because not only Mexicans are going to connect. I think all Latinos are going to connect. And consequently, all the people that are not Latino also are going to connect if they’re open and curious.
AP: Can you talk more about how you and Dunnett-Alcocer settled on the story? I love how you found a way for the women to all be strong figures and also to blend all of these Latino cultures in the film.
SOTO: We know the tropes, right? We know the hero’s journey, and we all know the superhero genre, how it works. We didn’t want to miss the opportunity (to) tell the story through a different lens. For us, it’s hard to keep a secret from your mother or family because they’re always in your face, always up your nose. And we wanted to like, ‘Okay, that’s going to happen, then let’s just keep them in from the beginning.’ They were in the transformation. They’re still going to be their family, and they’re going to bully him because he is a reluctant hero. Not reluctant for a moment, the whole film, he just wants this (scarab) out and then he ends up understanding that that’s his destiny and that could not have happened without his family.
And we wanted to create this love letter to the people that came before us, to our ancestors, especially to the women in our life. None of my family are damsels in distress. They’re tougher than I can ever be. And we wanted to honor that. They paved the way and they are heroes in their own right. So we wanted to give them heroic arcs because it is important to see the women in our lives differently than society has pushed them to be.
AP: The soundtrack seemingly includes every Latino music legend. Why was it important for the soundtrack to be mostly Latinos?
SOTO: You know, the movies that you have seen, every time they go to a Latin country, if they go to Mexico, its always the same music. If they go to the Caribbean, it’s always the same music. And the truth is that, yeah, we listen to that, but we also listen to other stuff. Not only do we consume stuff from the U.S., but we also have great rock bands in our countries. Just because other people have not heard it doesn’t mean that they’re not great. So the same way that I’ve been introduced to other music from the U.S. without any complaints, I wanted to introduce to the world, to the music that I grew up with, hoping they don’t complain about it either.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2JsdWUtYmVldGxlLWRjLWZpbG0tYW5nZWwtbWFudWVsLXNvdG8tNDUyZWE1YjgzOTY3NGI5NjFhOWJmOTY2OTVlYWY0M2PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,When does 'Blue Beetle' come out in theaters? Details to know about superhero movie,"Are you excited about ""Blue Beetle"" having a connection to El Paso? Find out how excitement is spreading in the Sun City.","Beetlemania is brewing in El Paso as ""Blue Beetle,"" the Warners Brothers/DC Comics film featuring the first Latino superhero, officially opens in theaters Friday, Aug. 18. Some theaters are showing the film Thursday, Aug. 17.
Talented El Paso artist, Jesus' Cimi' Alvarado, is working on a mural of the superhero on the front wall of the theater and has a quick shot of his work in the film. Skater and Juarez filmmaker Luis Galindo Hernandez was hired to get a van painted in tribute to Blue Beetle and the van has been spotted at various skating events around town.
El Paso filmmaker Valentin Sandoval, who is creating a docuseries for Warner Brothers on the Blue Beetle promotion said the hoopla is well deserved.
""He's based off an El Paso inspiration. The character was from El Paso in the 1939 novel. And I think this is so serendipitous in terms of timing with all the turn of events — all that is happening globally, including the mass shooting on Aug. 3 and the immigration issues with different administrations ― all of this and the fact that El Paso plays the birthplace of an archetypal superhero.
""I know we can say it's fantasy. It's a creative interpretation and it has its place in unlimited space. But I think it's contrary to that. I think it's really the power of the story, the power of the human archetype to persevere over obstacles inwardly and outwardly. I think that's what the story of ""Blue Beetle"" is — the story of Latinos that are making the movie behind the camera and in front the camera,"" he said. ""The whole cast is Latino family.""
Here are all the ways Blue Beetle is being celebrated in El Paso.
Where is Blue Beetle from?
In the comics, Jaime Reyes is from El Paso. In the movie, the story takes place in Palmera City, a new locale created for the film. Producers wanted their superhero to have his iconic place like Gotham for Batman.
El Pasoan James Terrazas, who got to see the advanced screening, was skeptical before seeing the movie and disappointed the story no longer took place in El Paso.
Afterward, Terrazas said the film is a must-see for El Pasoans.
""Despite the movie's changes, I am elated to say this movie is the definition of Hispanic representation in the modern day. This movie shines the brightest when it's focused on the Reyes family. The dynamic of the family was warm and very relatable. Audiences shouldn't be surprised to hear whispers of ""Ese eres tú (that's you!)"" in auditoriums around the country. The dialogue exchange between the family was as authentic as it gets,"" Terrazas said. ""Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer really captured the voices of various family members of a Mexican household.""
Fans left the film with souvenirs, including Blue Beetle T-shirts, fans and tote bags. The theater also sells Blue Beetle-shaped popcorn containers for $25 plus tax.
Blue Beetle release date
The movie's national release date is Friday, Aug. 18 but some theaters have show times on Thursday, Aug. 17.
Blue Beetle run time
The movie is 2 hours and 7 minutes.
Blue Beetle suit in El Paso
The scarab suit worn by Xolo Maridueña, as Jaime Reyes, is in town and on display through Aug. 28 at the Cinemark Tinseltown Las Palmas XD, at 11855 Gateway West Blvd.
Blue Beetle Rotten Tomatoes
As of Aug. 17, the film has a ""Tomatometer"" score of 81%.
Blue Beetle gives nod to El Paso in superhero film
Several El Pasoans got to see an advance screening of ""Blue Beetle"" Monday, Aug. 14, through a Warner Bros. promotion and it was evident they found the flick entertaining and with plenty of Latino flare.
Spanish is spoken throughout the movie, including common swear words and monikers uttered in Hispanic homes like ""pendejo"" and ""cabezon."" Even the lines preceding the action-packed fight scenes have more punch in Spanish.
Fans who got to see the movie noticed and cheered when they saw an El Paso Street sign and the main character, Jaime Reyes, having an Old Sheepdog Brewery labeled beer with his sister on their home's roof.
And there might be a few more El Paso easter eggs fans can look out for.
El Paso brewery featured in Blue Beetle
Old Sheepdog Brewery owner Gus Delgado is another proud El Pasoan, knowing his beer and growler are featured in the superhero movie. Delgado got to hang out with the director Angel Manuel Soto in El Paso last year to get a feel of the city Reyes' character is from.
""Our growler comes out on every scene that is filmed inside the house, on top of the fridge,"" Delgado said. He owns the brewery with his wife Brisa.
""Even though it was not filmed in El Paso, it's very relatable and the interaction between the family is relatable to what I grew up with. It does have that feeling of being El Paso,"" Delgado said. ""And I still have no words for having screentime for such a small business. As a superhero fan, to now be able to say we're a part of the DC world, it's pretty amazing.""
The business had a contest for someone to design the label for the Blue Corn Lager that is being promoted as part of the movie fandom. The winner, Christin Apodaca, was chosen by Soto.
Blue Beetle mural goes up on Cinemark Tinseltown
El Paso artist Jesus' Cimi' Alvarado, who prides himself in documenting the history of the Mexican American community in his work, was honored to have his mural work featured in the film, if only for a few seconds. And now he is also painting a mural of Blue Beetle along with the Star on the Mountain on the front facade of Cinemark Tinseltown. The artist has been spending a few hours every day atop a crane to have it completed by Thursday.
Alvarado said he got to spend time with the director showing him around Segundo Barrio, with Soto finding similarities between the historic neighborhood and his own in Puerto Rico. Alvarado, later on, was invited to Puerto Rico to paint a mural that is flashed in the film's first few minutes. The mural features a Zapatista woman holding a baby with Puerto Rican activist Lolita Lebrón in the background.
Alvarado said he almost got emotional seeing the film and a true representation of a close-knit Mexican family.
""I was talking to my daughter and wife about that. I got a little emotional through the movie, maybe it's my age, but it was great to see so much representation of our culture, of our people, in a film like this,"" he said.
""(The director) really captures the Mexican American superhero ― there are a lot of references that are Chicano, and Mexican. You see the Chapulin Colorado (a comical but Mexican superhero in his own right) — a lot of us grew up with that and you see the Adelita in the grandma,"" Alvarado said.
He added, ""Angel Manuel Soto is Puerto Rican which is not the same culture. He did a lot of great research. Now we have a superhero in the DC comic world that is going to represent.""
El Paso filmmaker creating docuseries for Warner Brothers/DC Comics
El Pasoan Valentin Sandoval, a filmmaker for over 25 years, is excited about working on a docuseries on ""Blue Beetle.""
Sandoval's Power at the Pass production team is documenting the mural's development and filming promotional content with local heroes and influencers to speak on 'Blue Beetle' being a fully Latino-centered cast and the cultural relevance of a broader Latino representation on a global scale.
""I think the story of Cimi and Juárez filmmaker Luis Galindo is that they are archetypes of Fronterizo artists who are emblematic of a collective family. And I'm talking to other people involved in the arts and it's really more about El Paso and Juarez being a portal of creative tension,"" he said.
""It's a celebration of that Latino/Chicano/Hispanic ethos here in the Frontera,"" he said of the video, which will be finished Thursday, Aug. 17. It will run about 20 to 30 minutes.
Sandoval said he will be sharing snippets on social media, including Power at the Pass. He said Warner Brothers still has to decide on distribution.

,"In ‘Blue Beetle,’ a superhero movie expands Mexican American representation in Hollywood — finally","One of the most extraordinary aspects of the film is the refreshingly ordinary way it presents Latino culture — there's no fanfare or explanation, it's just one more fact of these people’s lives.","It’s difficult to explain why I was crying five minutes into watching the new superhero movie Blue Beetle. It wasn’t a sad scene. On the contrary, it was a celebration of lead Jaime Reyes coming home after college to his loving Mexican American family, who had papered over their struggles and sacrificed much for the benefit of the kids.
If nostalgia means the pain from an old wound, what do you call the pain from recognition?
It’s not just that Reyes and I share a hometown in El Paso, Texas, (at least in the comics; in the movie he lives in the fictional Palmera City, a kind of Mexican American Miami), or that my grandmother also hated imperialists. It’s that the movie presents Mexican culture with little fanfare or explanation; just one more fact of these people’s lives.
The characters are Mexican and Mexican American, and they live their lives normally — or as normally as a story where an extraterrestrial scarab gives Jaime superpowers. The family is surrounded by cultural touchstones and quirks. Their Thalia telenovelas, their Virgen de Guadalupe paintings, and Selena on the radio.

If that doesn’t seem like a big deal to shed some tears over, congratulations — you’re part of the dominant culture.
Do you know how rare it is to see Latinos in the movies? A recent study from the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found that out of 1,600 films released in 2022, 5.2% of speaking parts featured a Latino actor. (Don’t get me started on the even lower numbers behind the cameras.)
We are almost 20% of the U.S. population and buy about 30% of movie tickets sold, yet to see ourselves on screen is one special effect that apparently Hollywood can’t afford. Even when we are represented, it’s more of a box check or part of a Fast and Furious-style rainbow coalition with no discernible cultural signifiers. I mean, Latinos aren’t having a backyard barbecue and slamming Coronas every time they save the world (wait, no, that’s pretty accurate).
Seeing Latino characters on screen is sadly uncommon. Rarer still is the kind of cultural representation on display in Blue Beetle. And this isn’t some small-scale independent production meant for a niche audience; this is a mass market, $100 million-plus, big studio picture — which dethroned Barbie at the box office last weekend.
And it’s pretty good.
The film takes the characters’ predicaments seriously, and there are consequences for the Reyes family going up against a billionaire, high-tech weapons manufacturer played by a malevolent Susan Sarandon. Yet it never forgets that superhero movies are supposed to be fun, and the family dynamic that takes center stage feels fresh.
Xolo Maridueña, who plays Jaime, leads a winning ensemble that includes Damián Alcázar as his father Alberto, Elpidia Carrillo as mother Rocio, Belissa Escobedo as sister Milagro, George Lopez as Uncle Rudy, and Adriana Barraza as grandmother Nana.
I checked in with one of the youngest members of my own family — my nephew Nathan, 10, in San Antonio — to ask if representation was something he thought about or even noticed. After all, while Latinos are still woefully underrepresented, you can at least point to animated movies such as Coco, Encanto, and the Spider-Verse films centered on Afro-Latino Miles Morales.
“When your dad and I were growing up, I always felt like I would look at shows on TV and movies and I would never see anybody that looked like me,” I explained as preamble. “More like …”
“A bunch of jacked white dudes?” he asked, mainly because we were talking superheroes, but he may as well have said, “A bunch of white dudes named Jack.”
Clearly, I didn’t need to do much explaining.
“In some sense, it’s nice to see people that are like you, because then you feel like you’re acknowledged,” Nathan said. “Like people know that you’re a kind of person.”
Ouch. I almost started crying again.
As a person of color, it is so very easy to be dehumanized by the dominant culture. So easy to be “othered.” To be made the dark face of crime, or the faceless waves flooding the border. And it’s not only about how others see us, but how we see ourselves. If you don’t recognize yourself in the larger cultural conversation, can you ever feel that you belong?
When I was younger, there were times when I was embarrassed to be Mexican. The word itself — a simple descriptor of nationality — felt like (and was used as) a slur. I grew beyond that, but I don’t think you can ever grow out of it.
I wish I had had a Blue Beetle back then, but I’m happy it exists now, for all the brown kids to see that our culture is part of the fabric of America. No more, but certainly not less.
It seems silly to hang so much on a story about a blue bug. Call it the magic of the movies.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbW1lbnRhcnkvYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtbW92aWUtYm94LW9mZmljZS1zdXBlcmhlcm8tcmVwcmVzZW50YXRpb24tbWV4aWNhbi1jdWx0dXJlLTIwMjMwODI1Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-21 14:39:33.913000+00:00,Blue Beetle Is One Superhero Movie Actually Worth Seeing,"Though we’re sick of comic book adventures in general, an exception can be made.","Over the weekend, the new DC Universe superhero film Blue Beetle grossed just over $25 million at the North American box office, barely edging out Barbie (also from Warner Bros), which had held the top spot every week since its release. That may sound like some kind of bragging right, and I suppose it is. But in a broader context, Blue Beetle’s debut was a fizzle.
Superhero movies are supposed to make more than that on their opening weekends, even ones as limply marketed and (it seems) modestly budgeted as Blue Beetle. Here is yet another example of the genre’s declining effectiveness, another chapter at the end of a story that began, with so much fanfare, 15 years ago. (Or, arguably, 20 plus years ago, with the first X-Men and Spider-Man movies—depends on how you measure these things.)
On the one hand, this may be a positive development. As discussed before in these very pages, the superhero genre has become stale and repetitive and uninspiring. Only a few glimmers of ingenuity have, of late, added dashes of brightness to what is otherwise a moribund, tiresome form, one ready to be put out to pasture for another few decades. So, sure: bring on the decline of comic book crusaders. It’s time for a shakeup, an exploration of new shapes and structures that studios can mine for profits while, hopefully, entertaining as many people as possible.
But in the singular case of Blue Beetle, directed by Ángel Manuel Soto and written by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, it would have been nice to see the movie find a larger audience. Because it’s actually pretty good, a fresh and lively divergence from all the sameness. I caught the film at one of the first public screenings last week, a mostly empty multiplex showing in a lonely corner of downtown Manhattan on a glum and humid day at the end of a stressful week. Maybe that solitary experience made me too susceptible to Blue Beetle’s onslaught—or, maybe, it’s just a charming movie.
The film is set in Palmera City, a sprawling metropolis styled like Miami with even more Caribbean flair, particularly in the outskirt island neighborhoods of the “Edge Keys.” That’s where the film’s hero, Jaime (Xolo Maridueña), has returned from college at the start of the story. He’s dismayed to learn that the family’s auto body shop has closed, and that they are going to lose their home after an inhumane rent hike.
Quickly, Blue Beetle sets up its themes. This is a movie about economic disparity and the long history of mistreatment suffered by Latinos at the hands of American economic and military imperialism. Blue Beetle is not the first superhero movie to consider the terrible overreach of the military-industrial complex, but it’s a rare one that does so thoughtfully, with a specific political consciousness. Its argument is damning and mordantly funny, a shout of merry defiance to join a newly invigorated chorus.
Inasmuch as a studio film like this can have a revolutionary edge, Blue Beetle does, in a way palatable—but not unmoving—to younger audiences who may not exactly grok the references to, say, the sinister legacy of the School of the Americas, but can certainly understand the relentless crush and manipulations of warmongering capitalism. The film does, annoyingly, locate a noble hero billionaire in the end, because superhero stories are obsessed with billionaires. But in many other instances throughout, Blue Beetle feels like a movie for the people—again, as much as a franchise film released by a major corporation can be.
Those deeper impulses are well complemented by the film’s lighter touches. While many of its jokes could have benefited from more honing, Blue Beetle unfolds at a lively patter, balancing genuine drama with the delightful discovery of sudden new powers. The film borrows heavily from Spider-Man, but cleverly shifts that appropriated framework from a lonely puberty allegory into a boisterous family affair. Among Jaime’s nattering clan are his hippie-ish, conspiracy theorist uncle, Rudy (George Lopez), and his kindly Nana (Adriana Barraza), both of whom get their due in a way Aunt May usually doesn’t.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbml0eWZhaXIuY29tL2hvbGx5d29vZC8yMDIzLzA4L2JsdWUtYmVldGxlLWlzLW9uZS1zdXBlcmhlcm8tbW92aWUtYWN0dWFsbHktd29ydGgtc2VlaW5n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,Becky G's Secret 'Blue Beetle' Role Explained (Exclusive),Director Ángel Manuel Soto raved about how the pop superstar's 'charisma' made her perfect for the part.,"Blue Beetle director Ángel Manuel Soto knew that making the first major superhero movie with a Latino lead would require a pitch-perfect cast. That included the voice of the alien Scarab, which becomes the Blue Beetle's exoskeleton supersuit when it attaches to host Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña).
So, whom did he cast? None other than Mexican-American pop superstar Becky G!
""I really wanted to work with Becky G,"" Soto raved to ET's Ash Crossan in a recent interview. ""She represents a lot to the community, and she is a testimony also of that resilience and being able to represent. And for us, it was very important to have somebody with that charisma, with that expertise, with that reach to play this world-destroying weapon.""
Blue Beetle is just the start of the new DCU slate of superhero films, and Soto said he knows that the relationship between Jaime and the Scarab, named Khaji-Da, will be an important part of the character's evolution moving forward.
""This is the beginning of their relationship,"" he said. ""As we keep going on the other iterations -- like the second movie, the third movie -- that relationship is gonna grow and the dynamics and the banters are gonna grow. So we wanna be able to track the growth.""
A powerhouse cast -- which also includes George Lopez, Harvey Guillén, Bruna Marquezine, Belissa Escobedo, Adriana Barraza, Damián Alcázar, Raoul Max Trujillo, Elpidia Carrillo and Susan Sarandon -- wasn't the only thing Soto employed to give the world of Blue Beetle its authentic flavor. He and screenwriter Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer also worked together to subvert some classic superhero tropes in ways that felt more true to their culture.
""He's from Mexico, and I am from Puerto Rico. So one of the things that we really wanted to hone in is things that connect us as Latinos, right?"" the director recalled of shaping the Blue Beetle story. ""There's a lot of specificities that I think when we embrace that in the story we open up ourselves to the universality that connects us as different cultures. And one of the things that we started to connect on was the fact that... it's very hard to keep a secret from our mothers, from a Latino mother.""
""We wanted to play with that idea of not being able to hide your identity from the people that love you the most,"" he continued. ""And on top of that, if one family member knows it, everybody else is gonna know right away. It identifies us in a beautiful way, and brings the family to be, not just part of the story, but an integral part of the development of our superhero.""
Not only are they there to support Jaime, Soto explained, but the Reyes family is an integral part of his hero's journey.
""We wanted to give each family member a heroic arc,"" he shared. ""We didn't want them to be one dimensional. We want them to actually be representative of the people that have actually paved the way for us Latinos for our generation to be where we are now.""
Soto lamented that his talented cast was missing out on the chance to ""receive their flowers,"" as they're unable to promote the film during the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. But he reiterated that the Blue Beetle stars ""understand that there's a heroic moment right now, that they need to be part of the right side of history.""
""They know what this means, not just for the cultural side, but for every other kid out there who has never seen themselves represented, being able to do that for them,"" he marveled. ""For me, having them fight the good fight, knowing that all the sacrifices that they're doing are gonna pave the way for future generations to enjoy better pay and better treatment, it only fills me with energy to keep promoting this film for them.""
""The best way to recognize, not only their sacrifice, but also support them for their future careers, and hopefully, the future of more diverse storytelling by people who come from those communities, is by showing up at theaters on Aug. 18 and letting the people know that we have their backs,"" he continued. ""It's taken us this long to be here, and it's sad that the strike is happening right now, so that they cannot receive their flowers, when they're supposed to receive it. I think the best way to show them that we love them is by showing up in the theaters.""
Blue Beetle flies into theaters Aug. 18.

2023-08-11 17:37:25+00:00,"‘Blue Beetle’ First Reactions: DC’s Latest Praised as ‘Funny,’ ‘Emotional’ and ‘A Love Letter to the Latino Culture’","The first reactions to DC Studios' “Blue Beetle,” starring Xolo Maridueña, are flying in.","The first reactions to DC Studios‘ “Blue Beetle,” starring Xolo Maridueña, are flying in, with early viewers calling the film a “huge surprise.” While some of the reactions quibble with parts feeling shaky or playing things a bit too silly, they mostly praise the film’s action, heart and specific touchstones to Latino culture.
The film, which hits theaters on Aug. 18, follows teenager Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) and his encounter with an alien relic that attaches to his body, bestowing the adolescent with extraordinary powers. Blue Beetle, notably, is one of the most preeminent Latino superheroes in comic book history. The rest of the “Blue Beetle” cast is predominantly Latino, including Bruna Marquezine, George Lopez, Raoul Max Trujillo, Adriana Barraza, Elpidia Carrillo, Damián Alcázar and Belissa Escobedo, along with Susan Sarandon.
“Charm City Kings” director Angel Manuel Soto helmed “Blue Beetle” from a screenplay by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer. The DC Comics film was originally slated as an HBO Max original, alongside the now-shelved “Batigrl.” Warner Bros. elected to shift to a theatrical release for the feature prior to James Gunn and Peter Safran becoming co-CEOs of DC Studios.
The film represents the penultimate release of the current DC Studios regime, with the upcoming “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” representing the final installment before the comic book universe’s continuity reboots with Gunn’s “Superman: Legacy” in 2025. However, Maridueña and Soto have spoken openly about hopes for the hero’s on-screen future under the new regime.
See the first reactions below.
Impressed by the pop culture details & historical references in BLUE BEETLE. From MACARIO, to CRONOS, and El CHAPULÍN COLORADO. But even more so that the infamous School of the Americas is integral to the story. This is the work of filmmakers who know & care about Latin America. pic.twitter.com/Li7ZTK629m — Carlos Aguilar (@Carlos_Film) August 10, 2023
It’s an action packed, highly entertaining superhero story about family…& there’s nothing more important than family.
The film is unique in that it lovingly & unabashedly shares the Reyes family’s Mexican culture. @bluebeetle 🧵 pic.twitter.com/o6Q9kUrbeC — POC Culture (@POCculture) August 11, 2023
The #BlueBeetle movie is mostly a blast.
Some is too silly or childish for me, a lot had me laughing loud (George Lopez!). Practical suit rocks. The Latino representation is awesome.
Enjoyed the family-centric stakes, solid action beats. Overall, it’s fun. pic.twitter.com/5qzWIkmDyE — BD (@BrandonDavisBD) August 11, 2023
DC should’ve marketed #BlueBeetle more. It's a fun, self-contained, emotional story about family. Xolo Maridueña is perfectly cast and SHINES as Jamie Reyes. George Lopez and Bruna Marquezine are also standouts. I'm so happy #BlueBeetle is the first DCU character. pic.twitter.com/ANyyx2gPXv — BSL 🔜 #TIFF23 (@bigscreenleaks) August 11, 2023
Happy to report that @angelmanuelsoto’s #BlueBeetle is definitely a great time at the movies! Not only is it a fantastic introduction to Jaime Reyes as a character/hero, but also a love letter to the Latino culture, that focuses on family as its foundation. @bluebeetle 1/3 pic.twitter.com/ieVw0DSR2Z — Fico (@FicoCangiano) August 11, 2023
2023-08-28 23:31:56+00:00,Box Office: $4 Ticket Day Boosts ‘Blue Beetle’ and ‘Ninja Turtles’,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and Blue Beetle were among those who saw the biggest boost from $4 tickets on Sunday.,The results are in for the second annual National Cinema Day.",,,,,,,,,,,,
On Sunday, more than 3,000 theaters across the U.S. and Canada offered patrons the chance to see any movie in the theater, in any format, for only $4. That’s a huge discount, considering the average movie ticket price is at least $10.53, while the cost can be notably higher in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago. And if electing to see a film on a premium large format, including Imax, expect to pay $25 or more in some cinemas.,,,,,
The Aug. 27 promotion resulted in 8.5 million moviegoers taking a trip to the cinema. That’s an uptick of 5 percent over the 8.1 million people who participated in last year’s National Cinema Day, which fell on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend. A major difference: Tickets were $3 last year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
According to Comscore, moviegoers aged 18-24 and 25-34 each made up 22 percent of the National Cinema Day audience, and the next-largest age group was 13-17 with 16 percent. Women turned out in slightly higher numbers than men, making up 52 percent of the audience.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Total revenue for this year’s National Cinema Day was $34 million, a gain of nearly 42 percent over 2022’s haul of $24 million, thanks in large part to ticket prices being raised to $4. Looking at other comps, Sunday revenue was up by 16 percent over the previous Sunday (Aug. 20). One unknown factor is how much the Sunday discount impacted Friday and Saturday attendance.,,,,,,,,,,,,
National Cinema Day is the brainchild of the Cinema Foundation, a nonprofit organization affiliated with the National Association of Theatre Owners. Jackie Brenneman, who was recently ousted as president of the Cinema Foundation and general counsel of NATO, led the effort.,,,,,,,,,,,,
In terms of general trends, films appealing to younger adults or families who are perhaps more mindful of their spending saw the biggest revenue boost from Saturday to Sunday, led by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and Blue Beetle at 37 percent and 32 percent, respectively. The R-rated raunchy canine comedy Strays also saw a hearty 25 percent boost.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Barbie led National Cinema Day in terms of sheer grosses with $5.7 million, followed by Blue Beetle ($5.5 million), Gran Turismo ($4.7 million), Mutant Mayhem ($3.3 million) and Oppenheimer ($2.7 million). Barbie was up 6 percent from Saturday to Sunday, while Gran Turismo saw a 12 percent day-over-day boost. Oppenheimer, which has a stronghold in terms of Imax screens, was down 21 percent day-over-day.,,,,,,,,,
Consumers could choose from an array of other offerings timed to National Cinema Day, including The Super Mario Bros. Movie and The Little Mermaid Sing-Along, along with rereleases of such classics as Jurassic Park (3D), American Graffiti, Lady Bird and Oldboy.,,,,,,,,,,,
“The positive response to National Cinema Day is just another reminder of how much people love going to the movie theater,” said Michael O’Leary, the newly installed president-CEO of NATO. “These numbers show us that the future of exhibition is strong," and that consumer enthusiasm for the theatrical experience continues unabated.”""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtMTIzNTU3NTc2MS_SAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3MvYm94LW9mZmljZS1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLWJsdWUtYmVldGxlLTEyMzU1NzU3NjEvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-28 15:27:05+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’ Director Was Ready to Pitch a ‘Bane Origin Story’ Film When Warner Bros. Called About a DC Movie,"When Warner Bros. called Angel Manuel Soto about a DC movie, he was ready to pitch a Bane origin story.","When Warner Bros. contacted “Charm City Kings” filmmaker Angel Manuel Soto about potentially directing a DC comic book tentpole, he geared up to pitch the studio on a much different movie.
“I wanted to pitch ideas, and one of them was the Bane origin story,” Soto recently told Den of Geek magazine. “I always thought that there was something interesting in exploring his reality and how a character like that comes to be… [but] the conversation was not about that.”
According to Soto, Warner Bros. already had “Blue Beetle” in mind for him to direct. He recalled the studio saying, “There’s this character that we’ve been developing for a couple of years. The Blue Beetle, a Latino superhero.”
It’s not the first time someone has tried to bring Bane back to the big screen following Tom Hardy’s portrayal in Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight Rises.” Dave Bautista revealed revealed in April 2021 that he met with Warner Bros. and demanded he play Bane. The studio wasn’t planning for the villain to appear in a movie at the time, but that didn’t stop Bautista from trying again when his “Guardians of the Galaxy” director James Gunn took over DC Studios.
“I have had conversations with James about that,” Bautista told Insider earlier this year about his dream Bane role, “but I think the direction he’s leaning in, completely rebooting that whole universe, he’s starting from scratch and starting younger and fresher and I think you need to do that. I think for the DC Universe to be revived, you need to start from scratch.”
As for Soto, he wasn’t so sure “Blue Beetle” was the right project for him at first when Warner Bros made the offer. “I didn’t want it to be another story where 15 minutes in, something happens, and 50 minutes later, he’s dominating the experience, and by the end, he’s saving the world,” he said. “I get it, I enjoy it, I go watch those movies and eat the popcorn and it’s fun, but it was hard for me to relate to an experience like that. If someone gives me a lot of power, the first thing I’d do is say, ‘I don’t want it.’ I just wanna provide for my family; I don’t need it, more power, more problems!”
Getting the keys to a comic book movie was hard to pass up, so Soto found his way into the “Blue Beetle” story by grounding it in the real world as much as possible.
“He’s not going to save the world yet; he doesn’t deserve to yet,” Soto said about creating believable stakes for the film. “We wanted to find a way to really explore his growth, how it relates to how his family and community see him in this role, as well as how his relationship with Khaji grows as well.”
“Blue Beetle” stars “Cobra Kai” actor Xolo Maridueña as Jamie Reyes, a college graduate who gains superpowers when an alien Blue Beetle scarab grabs onto him. The film co-stars Adriana Barraza, Damián Alcázar, Raoul Max Trujillo, Susan Sarandon and George Lopez.

2023-08-25 11:00:03+00:00,The All-New 2024 Toyota Tacoma Makes Big Screen Debut in “Blue Beetle”,,"Multiple Generations of Tacoma, including a bespoke 2024 Tacoma, designed by Toyota’s CALTY Design Studio, are featured in Warner Bros. Pictures’ film “Blue Beetle”
Tacoma’s versatility and legacy are showcased throughout the fun-filled DC Super Hero film
Tacoma is the best-selling mid-size pickup for last 18 years
PLANO, Texas (August 25, 2023) – On the heels of the highly anticipated reveal of the 2024 Tacoma, Toyota teamed up with DC’s newest Super Hero in his debut movie, “Blue Beetle,” which made its world premiere in theaters last week. The action-packed movie, filled with heart and humor, features multiple generations of Tacoma as Jaime Reyes is forever changed when an ancient piece of alien technology, the Scarab, transforms the college grad into the hero The Blue Beetle.
Jaime and the entire Reyes family depend on their favorite 3rd generation Toyota Tacoma throughout the movie. The “Taco” is the pride and joy of Jaime’s Uncle Rudy, played by George Lopez. Watch how Blue Beetle, his family, and their trusty Tacoma are able to take on anything. Also, be on the lookout for a special cameo appearance by the All-New 4th generation Tacoma.
Toyota’s design and engineering teams collaborated with DC to develop a unique 2024 Tacoma design and signature paint featured in the film.
“We tasked our talented CALTY Studio team, led by Scott Roller, to conjure up a Tacoma that matched the singular style of the beloved, soon-to-be-iconic ‘Taco’ Uncle Rudy has made his own over the years, but in a way that was modern and integrated with the new 2024 Tacoma design,” said Tacoma Chief Engineer Sheldon Brown. “This is where the design of the ‘Blue Taco’ came from, and it was a pleasure to work on.”
Toyota trucks have a history in Hollywood, as the 1985 Toyota SR5 Xtra Cab was the coveted truck of Marty McFly in the 1980s film “Back to the Future.” Additionally, the first-generation Tundra was featured in “Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,” with 600 T3 Special Edition Tundras sold that same year.
The 2024 Tacoma is the latest iteration of this off-road 4×4 icon and features an available i-FORCE MAX hybrid powertrain offering up to 326 horsepower and 465 lb-ft. of torque. This new truck has a rugged style, multiple powertrain options, 4×4 capability, and the latest safety and tech features. Also, new for 2024 is the first ever Trailhunter grade, which has been engineered from the ground-up to be the ultimate overlanding machine. The all-new 2024 Tacoma will be in dealerships by the end of the year.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vcHJlc3Nyb29tLnRveW90YS5jb20vdGhlLWFsbC1uZXctMjAyNC10b3lvdGEtdGFjb21hLW1ha2VzLWJpZy1zY3JlZW4tZGVidXQtaW4tYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-10 00:53:42+00:00,27 Latino Organizations Unite in Support for ‘Blue Beetle’ During Hollywood Strikes,"27 Latino groups have issued an open letter to support ""Blue Beetle"" and other Latino films opening during the Hollywood strikes.","Latinos were optimistic about making a great stride in representation in the summer box office season with films like “Blue Beetle,” the first superhero movie directed and written by and starring Latinos. However, writers and actors aren’t able to promote their projects during the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, as guild members advocate for new contracts. So multiple Latino organizations have united and signed an open letter calling on the community to “amplify the work that countless Latino artists have worked so hard to create.”
Signed by 27 Latino Hollywood orgs – such as the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute (CHCI), LA Collab, Latino Film Institute, National Association of Latino Independent Producers (NALIP) and the National Hispanic Media Coalition (NHMC) – the letter is a call to action with the hashtag #SupportLatinoCreatives proposed to back the creatives and their stories.
“Stories are more than entertainment,” the letter begins. “They are a powerful tool for social change that fuels our collective movement to build a more equitable, just world for those who have been historically underrepresented and marginalized. Actors, writers, and directors are essential to this work. As we watch them do what they do best, we are reminded that their art influences how people think and feel about our communities – both at home and abroad. While we’re encouraged by some of the changes we have seen in recent years, we continue to deal with the repercussions from years of being actively erased and invisible on screen.”
In a Variety interview, “Blue Beetle” director Ángel Manuel Soto expressed his understanding of the strikes and how they can affect the film’s performance, especially without the help of his cast, including breakout sensation Xolo Maridueña, George Lopez and Oscar nominee Adriana Barraza. “We want the movie to succeed,” he said. “But I also want my actors and writers to be treated as they should. If that happens, we’ll have more stories like this. Things that are often deemed impossible are not.”
In a 2021 study by USC Annenberg that looked at over 1,300 films over a 13-year timeframe, only 5% of 51,158 characters identified were Hispanic or Latino.
In the letter, which highlights the decades of work the organizations have advocated, including talent development, serving as cultural experts, and pushing for fair and adequate resources for creatives, it acknowledges the work is far from over.
“Actors and writers deserve a deal that protects their work and livelihoods, so we will continue to support them as they fight for better treatment and fair compensation. And since we represent a rapidly growing demographic with tremendous influence over the global cultural landscape, we also remain dedicated to recognizing and celebrating their artistic excellence and its invaluable role in reflecting our community and culture on screen. For the sake of current and future generations of Latinos, we will not delay our progress any longer. We invite you to join us in our effort to amplify the work that countless Latino artists have worked so hard to create. It’s important that we show up for them at a time when they are not able to promote their projects,” the letter says.
Other films with Latino talent set to open this year include Amazon’s “Cassandro” with Gael Garcia Bernal and Raul Castillo, Lionsgate’s “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes” with Rachel Zegler and Netflix’s “Rustin” with Colman Domingo.
The letter concludes: “Our stories are universal and need to be told. Together, we must continue to advocate for a more equitable and inclusive industry, one that respects and honors our storytellers and stories.”
The letter with the list of orgs is below. “Blue Beetle” opens in theaters on Aug. 18.
An open letter from Latino leaders
Stories are more than entertainment. They are a powerful tool for social change that fuels our collective movement to build a more equitable, just world for those who have been historically underrepresented and marginalized.
Actors, writers, and directors are essential to this work. As we watch them do what they do best, we are reminded that their art influences how people think and feel about our communities – both at home and abroad. While we’re encouraged by some of the changes we have seen in recent years, we continue to deal with the repercussions from years of being actively erased and invisible on screen.
For decades, our network of organizations has advocated for more authentic, inclusive representation of the Latino community in film and television, both in front and behind the camera. • We’ve invested in creative talent development and executive pipeline programs to prepare aspiring creators and a new generation of business leaders to succeed across our industry. • We’ve created our own platforms to celebrate Latino excellence in media and honor work that uplifts our communities.
We’ve served as cultural experts to studios, networks, and producers to ensure that their projects authentically reflect our complex diversity.
We’ve pushed those in leadership to provide fair, adequate resources to our writers, directors, and talent so they don’t encounter unnecessary barriers in bringing their stories to life. • We’ve insisted on better representation within existing narratives by calling out harmful and dangerous stereotypes, and we’ve held studio leadership accountable when they make irresponsible creative decisions that have serious real-world consequences.
It’s clear that we still have a long way to go, but we’re proud of our Latino creatives who are elevating our humanity and moving culture forward through their work.
We were particularly optimistic about this summer. We were approaching a critical turning point for Latino representation as we saw the return of some of our favorite shows and characters, the launch of exciting new series, and prepared for a groundbreaking moment on the big screen – the first superhero movie directed, written, and starring Latinos. We were hopeful that our long overdue cultural moment had finally arrived.
And now we are confronted with this pivotal moment across the media industry; a double strike that will have a significantly disproportionate impact on artists from underrepresented communities.
Actors and writers deserve a deal that protects their work and livelihoods, so we will continue to support them as they fight for better treatment and fair compensation. And since we represent a rapidly growing demographic with tremendous influence over the global cultural landscape, we also remain dedicated to recognizing and celebrating their artistic excellence and its invaluable role in reflecting our community and culture on screen.
For the sake of current and future generations of Latinos, we will not delay our progress any longer. We invite you to join us in our effort to amplify the work that countless Latino artists have worked so hard to create. It’s important that we show up for them at a time when they are not able to promote their projects.
Our stories are universal and need to be told. Together, we must continue to advocate for a more equitable and inclusive industry, one that respects and honors our storytellers and stories.

This week’s update takes an early look at two releases slated for mid-August debuts, providing counter-programming options in the final weeks of summer movie season.
As usual, current forecast ranges for other upcoming films—such as Haunted Mansion, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, and Meg 2: The Trench—are below.
Blue Beetle
Warner Bros. Pictures
August 18, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $12M-$17M
Domestic Total Range: $27M-$55M
PROS:
The DC brand has a modest strength of its own, and Blue Beetle being an unfamiliar-to-the-masses character might make this film feel fresh among audiences.
Appeal to Latin American families could be notable, particularly with the back half of the summer and early fall seeing a relative lack of youth-friendly content hitting the big screen.
CONS:
With the comic book era not being the novelty it once was, audiences have become increasingly selective about which superhero films they spend money on in theaters. To that end, early tracking models for this title are trailing Shazam! Fury of the Gods by a fair margin.
Competition from mid-to-late summer family-friendly holdovers—like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and Haunted Mansion—plus action films like Meg 2 and Gran Turismo, could diminish potential in the waning days of summer.
Strays
Universal Pictures
August 18, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $18M-$28M
Domestic Total Range: $45M-$80M
PROS:
A strong voice ensemble led by Jamie Foxx and Will Ferrell lends itself well to this R-rated comedy, hitting theaters in late summer—when films like Sausage Party and Good Boys have taken off at the box office in previous years.
Universal has a reputable history of turning adult-centric content into mid-range success, as in the case of the recent Cocaine Bear. Early social trends are also somewhat more encouraging than those of Violent Night at the same point before release.
CONS:
Depending on the severity of fictionalized animal abuse portrayed in the film, audience appeal and eventual reception is somewhat difficult to predict. A lean on male audiences is also expected.
On the subject of Cocaine Bear, Strays hasn’t quite reached the pre-release social metrics of that sleeper hit.

2023-08-20 16:17:31+00:00,‘Strays’ Stumbles at Box Office Without Its Stars’ Promotion,"The R-rated comedy opened to a fifth place showing this weekend, while the comic book movie “Blue Beetle” came in at No. 1. Both were hurt by the actors’ strike.","When selling a movie about raunchy talking dogs, it helps to have some star power to get moviegoers into seats.
And “Strays,” which opened Friday, has it — at least on the screen. Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Randall Park and Isla Fisher are among those who contribute their comic voice talents. Normally, a cast like this would translate into countless promotional appearances in settings like “Saturday Night Live,” late-night talk shows and on social media platforms. Not during the actors’ strike, when such efforts by the actors are forbidden.
Instead, the most exciting thing to happen during the press tour for the film may have been during a rehearsal for a segment on NBC’s “Today” show when Dylan Dreyer, a meteorologist, took a tumble while practicing a trick with an Australian Shepherd.
“Strays,” which had a budget of $46 million, is one of four movies that opened widely across the country this weekend. It grossed an estimated $8.3 million for a fifth place showing, a poor opening and not close to the number Universal Pictures was hoping for when it greenlit the film. (The studio’s previous R-rated comedy that paired raunchy material with family-friendly characters, “Good Boys,” opened in 2019 to $21 million. “Cocaine Bear,” also from Universal, had a far more robust opening, $23 million, in February.)",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMjAvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVkaWEvc3RyYXlzLWJsdWUtYmVldGxlLWJveC1vZmZpY2UuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

Xolo Maridueña gives a stunning performance as DC’s titular Blue Beetle in what feels like resounding box office success.
According to Box Office Mojo, in just two weeks “Blue Beetle” has surpassed its budget of $104 million.
Maridueña, known for his breakout performance as Miguel Diez in Netflix smash hit “Cobra Kai,” stars as Jaime Reyes, an average guy just trying to make it in the world. His life is forever changed when he accidentally merges with the Scarab, a sentient bio-weapon of incredible power.
The Scarab manifests as a blue and black suit with insectoid and human-like characteristics. The suit’s style is a combination of Iron Man and Spider-Man’s suits.
The suit itself has many defensive and offensive capabilities and gives Jamie increased durability, strength, flight, laser blast and more.
Visually, this movie is very well done. I liked the special effects and action sequences, and I thought they were spot on. They felt a bit over-the-top but I like how they added to the story and made it feel more dynamic.
I also really enjoyed the musical score and it fit well with the pacing and tone of the film.
Another stand out for me was the actors. While the writing is a bit lacking in places, I felt like the actor’s performances really helped to elevate the work.
Besides Maridueña, I really enjoyed Adriana Barraza as Nana and George Lopez as Jaime’s uncle Rudy. The dynamic and chemistry of the family really is what sold me. They felt like a real Hispanic family, and I thoroughly enjoyed this.
One of the things I like about having a Hispanic writer and actors for a film like this is that the overall feeling is much more authentic. Being part of the community they are representing really adds a level of realism and believability that wouldn’t be possible otherwise.
Another character I loved was Victoria Kord, portrayed by the delightful Susan Sarandon. Kord is a typical militaristic villain trying to get power for the sake of power. However, Sarandon brings edge and seriousness that really brings this character to life.
One thing I also really liked was that this movie stands on its own. While superheroes do technically exist in this world, the film is not confined to the DC Extended Universe and takes place in a separate reality.
Overall I feel like this movie is one of the better DC films. Only time will tell if it’s going to pump some life into the DC properties.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbm9ydGhlcm5zdGFyLmluZm8vMTA3NTk1L2xpZmVzdHlsZS9ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1tb3ZpZS1vZi1pbmNyZWRpYmxlLXBvd2VyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,The ad for DC’s ‘Blue Beetle’ movie on the Museum of Art’s Rocky steps bugs me out,“What’s the next thing? Are we just going to project ads on the Liberty Bell?” asked Philly art blogger Conrad Benner.,"A runner heads up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which are covered with a temporary vinyl poster for the new DC Comics superhero movie, ""Blue Beetle,"" which premieres Friday. Read more
When I saw a photograph of the poster for Warner Bros. Pictures and DC Comics’ upcoming Blue Beetle movie plastered across the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art this week, my first thought was: “This has to be photoshopped.”
Spoilers: It was not.
As I slowly came to the realization that one of Philly’s most renowned landmarks had been rented out like a billboard on I-95 and covered with a giant image of a dude in a mechanical bug suit, I knew I had to put my Lois Lane blazer on.
Who approved this monstrosity? What was the cost? Where’s the money going? When will this thing be removed? And why is this happening now?
Advertisement
Conrad Benner, who documents Philly’s public art scene for his blog, StreetsDept.com, and has written about outdoor advertising posing as art, had an even more visceral reaction.
“Gross. It’s so corporate and gross,” he said. “Can’t there be one place in this society where we’re not forced to engage with advertisements?”
The museum stairs, often referred to as the Rocky steps, and the museum itself are owned by the city. The stairs are maintained by the city’s Parks and Recreation Department.
Andrew Alter, a Parks and Rec spokesperson, said in an email that the city was approached by Allied Global Marketing, the Philly-based firm handling local marketing for the film, about installing the “temporary activation” (a.k.a. the ad).
The company was approved for a “special event” permit at a rate of $4,000 a day, Alter said. The temporary vinyl ad, which covers 72 steps, was installed Monday and will be removed Sunday, for a total cost of $28,000.
Alter said the proceeds “can be reinvested” into maintaining the east terrace area of the museum, which includes the steps. When I asked if they will be, he said funds from similar “activations” have “traditionally been used in maintaining the surrounding area.”
So whether the funds will be used to power wash the steps, which could do with a good cleaning, or repurpose the fountains alongside them, which haven’t worked for decades, remains to be seen. But if the city approved this sheerly for money, it doesn’t seem like a great deal.
“If this is going to be the city’s answer to fundraising, I think it’s a pretty lazy and uninspired answer,” Benner said. “That’s not a lot of money, but it’s a huge return on the studio’s investment.”
Almost as curious as the fact that the city allowed a major motion picture studio to advertise on the museum’s stairs is the fact that Blue Beetle, the latest superhero flick in the DC Universe franchise, has absolutely nothing to do with Philadelphia. It’s not set here, it wasn’t filmed here, and yet, we’re the only city to get one of these ads.
Jesse Cute, vice president of field marketing for Allied Global, said the company wanted to bring excitement for the film to the Philly region in a big, nontraditional way.
“Someone asked me what was my plan B. There was no plan B. It was the Philadelphia Museum of Art, we knew that was the place to be,” he said. “You not only get Philadelphians running there, you get a lot of tourists running those steps, as well.”
Speaking of tourists, can you imagine going to the steps to get your picture taken, only to be photo bombed by machine-bug-man hybrid? As for locals, of 108 people who responded to an informal poll on X (the platform formerly known as Twitter), 18 liked it, 23 were confused/unenthused by it, and 67 were against it, using words like “ugly,” “tacky,” and “depressing” to describe it.
Museum spokesperson Maggie Fairs said the museum didn’t receive compensation for the advertisement, but doesn’t oppose it.
“The Philadelphia Museum of Art is happy to have a strong working relationship with the city, and we think the use of these stairs, which are such a recognizable landmark in the city, for promotional purposes is great,” Fairs said via email. “We look forward to opportunities to use these stairs to promote Philadelphia’s emerging artists.”
That’s exactly what the iconic steps should be used for, Benner said, promoting the work of local artists as the museum did in June with Philly-based Lindsay Bedford’s The Petal Procession, an installation of pink paper petals along the stairs.
“Is our city just a big billboard for big studio and out-of-town advertisers or can we use these steps to promote our own uniqueness and our own artists?” he said.
Alter said the Eagles have done activations at the museum and steps, and held a drone show there during their playoff run this year. But that feels like a whole different ballgame, one more about city pride than just profit.
It’s not lost on me that I’m criticizing that a movie poster was plastered on steps made famous in a movie; steps that then became nicknamed after that movie. But at least Rocky was set and filmed here. It’s no Monet or Van Gogh, but at least it’s got heart — and us in it.
I’m not sure what Blue Beetle has. I’ve heard little about the film, which, according to IMDB, is about an alien scarab that chooses a human to be its symbiotic host. But it’s interesting this marketing ploy is happening now — during the ongoing writers and actors strike when union members aren’t participating in publicity tours — instead of when DC’s Shazam, which was set in Philly, was released in 2019.
“It’s like an anti-union statement on top of it just being a gross ad, too,” Benner said.
Like the Jawn Morgan billboards that litter our city, photos of which continue to spread across social media fueled by our ire, could this ad be more about the shock value than the actual ad itself? When you strike at a part of our city that’s so intrinsic to our identity, it becomes something that people who deeply love Philly, as Benner and I do, can’t ignore.
That being said, I can’t help but wonder if this column is exactly what the studio wants, if I haven’t been Lex Luthor-ed into writing this piece. But if I don’t write it, what will come next? Ads for Twisted Tea or Viagra?
“It’s hard to say whether we’ll see more or fewer activations like these, but all special event and festival permit applications undergo a review process,” Alter said.
Benner also worries about what this could portend.
“What’s the next thing? Are we just going to project ads on the Liberty Bell? Will Independence Hall be draped in something?” he said. “This is a silly, silly mistake I hope they make once. It’s not worth selling our public space to get pennies from these corporate folks who just want to use us.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9jb2x1bW5pc3RzL2RjLWNvbWljcy1ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1hZC1waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEtbXVzZXVtLW9mLWFydC1yb2NreS1zdGVwcy0yMDIzMDgxNy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,'Blue Beetle' superhero movie scarab suit on display in El Paso Aug. 14,"Excited about DC Comics ""Blue Beetle"" movie? Here is what to know about the film's budget, cast and special scarab suit in El Paso.","Latinos across the country are getting excited to see one of their own as a superhero in the upcoming movie, ""Blue Beetle."" The film opens Aug. 18 in major theaters.
The film is based on the DC Comics character Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle, produced by DC Studios and the Safran Company and directed by Angel Manuel Soto.
Warner Bros. is building excitement by letting fans get up close and personal with the Scarab suit worn by Xolo Maridueña during filming, according to a release.
The Blue Beetle suit will be on display at Cinemark Tinseltown Las Palmas XD, at 11855 Gateway West Blvd., from Aug. 14 to 28.
Some interesting facts about the suit:
Made by Mexican costume designer, Mayes C. Rubeo.
The suit was in development for nine months.
There were over 500 designs created before they locked in the final design.
The suit came together via a collaboration with Ironhead Studios in Los Angeles, California.
Every piece of the Blue Beetle suit is custom — the concept, digital designs, 3D printing, the fabrics, and physical armor pieces — everything had to be created and all built for an exact fit that allowed star Maridueña to bring the character Blue Beetle to life.
The fabric was designed to evoke an alien-derived pattern, with every element crafted to reflect the out-of-this-world nature of the Scarab's alien biotechnology.
Don't be surprised if you get a promotional souvenir if you go check out the blue jumpsuit.
Blue Beetle cast
Aside from Xolo Maridueña in the title role, thecast list includes:
Belissa Escobedo (""Hocus Pocus 2"") as Milagros Reyes, Jaime's younger sister.
Elpidia Carrillo (""Predator"")as Rocio Reyes, Jaime's mother.
Damían Alcázar (""Narcos"") as Alberto Reyes, Jaime's father.
Adriana Barraza (Rambo: Last Blood) as Nana, Jaime's grandma.
Bruna Marquezine as Jenny Kord.
Comedian and actor George Lopez as Rudy Reyes, Jaime's uncle.
Raoul Max Trujillo (Sicario) as Conrad Carapax.
Susan Sarandon as Victoria Kord.
Harvey Guillén as Dr. Sanchez.
Blue Beetle synopsis
Jaime Reyes graduates from college, returns to his hometown, and suddenly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology called the Scarab. In the comics, cartoons and TV versions, Reyes is from El Paso, which is why El Pasoans might be very interested in seeing the film.
However, the trailer has shown the character as living in Palmera City with his immediate family including a little sister.
When the Scarab chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, he's bestowed with an incredible suit of armor capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the superhero Blue Beetle.
The suit is derived from the Scarab, a sentient being named Khaji-da who symbiotically fuses with its host. It can create any form of weapon the host can imagine.

,Connecting the Kords: How Jaime Reyes Picked Up the Blue Beetle Legacy,"When Jaime Reyes became Blue Beetle, he had never taken a class with Ted Kord, never even met the guy. So, how did he wind up following in his superhero footsteps?","Since 1956, the cornerstone of superhero evolution in the DC Universe has been the concept of legacy. New heroes are inspired by their predecessors, or trained by them, or even take over a generational role from their parents. Ted Kord, for instance, the second Blue Beetle, was a student of the original, Dan Garrett. In 1967’s Blue Beetle #2, Garrett intervenes when Ted is manipulated by his uncle, the evil scientist Jarvis Kord, into building an army of indestructible robots. Defeating Jarvis proves to be Garrett’s last adventure, and with his dying breaths, he passes the mantle on to the promising young Ted.
Jaime Reyes, our modern Blue Beetle since 2005, had no such passing of the torch. He wasn’t the son of a superhero, or a student, or even a fan. When he became Blue Beetle, he had never taken a class with Ted Kord, never even met the guy. He didn’t even know what a Blue Beetle was before he already was one.
Jaime came to possess the scarab that empowered the original Blue Beetle when it fell from the sky in the destruction of the Rock of Eternity during Day of Vengeance, where its inheritor Ted had placed it for safekeeping at the time of his death. Like Kyle Rayner inheriting the Green Lantern ring, it was simply a matter of being at the right place at the right time (or the wrong one).
For most of his first comic book adventures as the Blue Beetle, Jaime bore little connection to the Blue Beetle legacy. His first connection to his forebears, apart from the scarab itself, comes from an unlikely source—that of Danni Garrett, granddaughter of the original Blue Beetle and amateur superhero historian. It’s with Danni’s guidance that Jaime learns the Blue Beetle legacy, which ends up raising more questions than answers. So, here is Jaime Reyes, clad in full Blue Beetle armor and with access to more functions than he knows what to do with. So what gives?
It’s not until 2008’s Blue Beetle #25, two years into his solo run, that we learn why the scarab, Khaji Da, activated for Jaime. Dan Garrett had the knowledge to use the scarab, Khaji Da, to limited effect, but it was still damaged at the time from its tumultuous journey to Earth. With Ted, residual energy from his proximity to Booster Gold retroactively prevented Khaji Da from operating at all. It was only with Jaime that Khaji Da had the means and opportunity to assume its full functionality. Unique among scarabs across the universe, Khaji Da would work with Jaime as a partner, as opposed to a parasite.
The main obstacle between Jaime really connecting with any of his predecessors as Blue Beetle had always been that, well, they were all dead. Jaime gets the opportunity to confront a zombie Ted Kord in 2009’s Blackest Night, a trial Ted himself once had to endure when facing a resurrected Dan Garrett in his own ’80s solo series. Jaime also got to know more about Ted through team-ups with his predecessor’s best friend Booster Gold, who provides his own dubious mentorship to Jaime from time to time where he’s shared memories of the previous Beetle.
It was in 2016’s DC Universe: Rebirth that Jaime meets a living Ted Kord for the first time. With Ted’s murder undone by DC’s 2011 and 2016 continuity reshuffles, Ted finally has the opportunity to take Jaime under his own wing, although it became very apparent in the 2016 Blue Beetle series that the two had entirely different approaches to the Blue Beetle mantle. With Jaime still mastering the scarab’s more mystic properties, and Ted out of his depth in a more modern age of superheroes, the two have to learn to readjust to the hero game together.
A superhero, however, cannot live on good deeds alone. Unless you’re born into wealth like a Batman or Green Arrow, you do have to find work. And that’s where we find Jaime in Blue Beetle: Graduation Day —a series which answers a lot of questions for us about Ted Kord. Questions like why he isn’t running Kord Industries after his father died and has been messing around with Booster to play superhero influencer instead.
Jaime graduates from high school to confess to his parents that he doesn’t feel like college is necessarily right for him. His parents are supportive of his decision, on the condition that he starts looking for work immediately. That decision takes him from El Paso to Palmera City, working in food service with his aunts there—but also picking up an unpaid internship with the relocated Kord Industries. Only it’s not Ted who’s running the show.
Meet Victoria Kord, Ted’s older sister and CEO of Kord Industries. We first learned about Victoria’s existence in the press leading up to the Blue Beetle movie, but comics beat the film to the punch for her first appearance. (A not unheard of phenomenon. The same thing was true of Barbara Gordon, who was created for the Batman TV show but made her comics debut shortly prior.)
Victoria, as ruthless in business as she is mad about science, is far more suited for the corporate world of super science than her brother ever was. But with more in common with their treacherous uncle Jarvis than the lovable goofball Ted, Victoria teeters on the same precipice of amorality and evil danced upon by so many modern-day tech billionaires. Will Jaime’s work with Kord Industries as Ted’s inside man keep Victoria’s steady acquisition of super science gadgets from spilling over into catastrophe? Will he finally start getting paid? What happened to his aspirations to be a dentist? The answers to all that still lie in Jaime’s future—one you can see for yourself in the new Blue Beetle movie and the upcoming Blue Beetle comic series launching this September.

PLANO, Texas (July 25, 2023) – This summer, the highly anticipated first-ever Blue Beetle film takes audiences on an action-packed journey with Jaime Reyes and the entire Reyes family as he undergoes an incredible transformation to become Blue Beetle.
Toyota is Warner Bros. Pictures’ official automotive partner in the feature film, in theaters August 18, 2023. The film, marking the DC Super Hero’s first time on the big screen, is directed by Ángel Manuel Soto, and stars Xolo Maridueña in the title role as well as his alter ego, Jaime Reyes.
The story follows recent college grad Jaime Reyes, who returns home full of aspirations for his future only to find that home is not quite as he left it. When fate intervenes, Jaime unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab. When the Scarab suddenly bonds to Jaime, he’s bestowed with an incredible suit of armor capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes Blue Beetle.
A Tacoma appears throughout the film as the Reyes’ beloved family vehicle, referred to as the “Taco” – the pride and joy of Jaime’s Uncle Rudy. With its rugged capability, the Tacoma joins the exhilarating escapade with a starring role in the new film. Additionally, the all-new 2024 Tacoma also makes a special cameo.
“We can’t wait for viewers to see the unstoppable Tacoma in theaters with Blue Beetle,” said Lisa Materazzo, group vice president, Toyota Marketing, Toyota Motor North America. “The Tacoma was the perfect co-star for the thrilling, action-packed adventure marking the DC Super Hero’s first time on the big screen.”
Additionally, Toyota created a Blue Beetle-inspired 2024 Tacoma campaign in support of the film partnership. In the spot featuring Blue Beetle star Xolo Maridueña, a lively discussion about the Tacoma vs. Blue Beetle’s powerful and heroic capabilities ensues until a resolution is determined – the two icons should simply team up!
“We were thrilled when the Blue Beetle filmmakers opted to include a true ‘role’ for the Tacoma in the film, one that allows the ‘Taco’ to drive the action alongside our stars,” said Louise Soper, Senior Vice President, Global Brand Partnerships, Warner Bros. Pictures. “Toyota is an iconic global brand and a terrific partner, and together we are eager to deliver the action to audiences everywhere when the film debuts in theaters.”

The film is currently generating attention due to its potential casting of Jason Momoa and Dave Bautista, although negotiations were temporarily halted by the SAG-AFTRA strike. Details surrounding The Wrecking Crew have been closely guarded, but it's described as a buddy action movie that will feature both intense action sequences and a comedic and warm rapport between the two leading actors. If Momoa and Bautista indeed join the project, their on-screen chemistry is anticipated to be a significant element of the film. The film's script, written by Jonathan Tropper, was in progress before the WGA strike.
What is Blue Beetle all about?
With Blue Beetle, Soto marked his foray into the superhero genre. The film was earlier supposed to be a direct-to-streaming release but it was then sent for a theatrical release. The movie follows the journey of Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña), a young Mexican law school graduate from Palmera City, Texas (a fictional city). He stumbles upon an artifact known as the Scarab, which is connected to Kord Industries, a company led by CEO Victoria Kord (played by Susan Sarandon). The artifact has the power to transform into a powerful suit of armour, which is both arcane and high-tech, and it merges with Jaime, giving him enhanced abilities and advanced weaponry. Blue Beetle review
WION gave the film a positive review. ""Blue Beetle skilfully weaves Jaime Reyes' family dynamics into its narrative, showcasing the significance of his relationships and the impact they have on his journey as a hero. Even when the, um, superheroics got too much for me at one point (more on that later), the interactions between Jaime and his family got me hooked on the story and invested in their fates. They are all excellent and I believe the setup established within the movie could make way for quite an amazeballs sitcom,"" a section of the review read.

2023-08-22 12:40:52+00:00,Blue Beetle vs. Iron Man: Who Is More Powerful & Would Win in a Fight?,The battle between Blue Beetle vs. Iron Man would be epic. Here is a comparison of their power level and who would win in a fight.,"Blue Beetle vs. Iron Man is an intriguing superhero matchup fans dream of seeing one day. (As much as it resembles Iron Man, the villain in the Blue Beetle movie isn’t Tony Stark, but Carapax.) If that DC–Marvel heroes clash happened one day, who would win? And who’s more powerful, the live-action version of Blue Beetle or Iron Man? Here’s what we have to say about that.
Is Blue Beetle more powerful than Iron Man?
Blue Beetle looks to have an edge over Iron Man thanks to the powerful alien technology he possesses.
You can make a case for both superheroes being more powerful than the other, and no one could say the contrary. However, Blue Beetle looked slightly above Marvel Cinematic Universe‘s Tony Stark. Khaji-Da scarab grants Jaime Reyes a high-tech suit with energy-based abilities, flight, enhanced strength, durability, and potentially any weapon Jaime can imagine. The scarab can also adapt and evolve on the battlefield, making Blue Beetle a formidable opponent.
In turn, Iron Man relies on his suits equipped with advanced technology, ranging from energy weapons to flight capabilities to an array of sensors and gadgets. The armors are highly customizable and can be tailored to specific situations, giving him versatility in battles.
Would Blue Beetle win against Iron Man in a fight?
Blue Beetle would defeat Iron Man in a fight.
If we were to pit their powers against each other, the battle would likely be intense and potentially close. Iron Man’s vast array of advanced weaponry could give him an advantage in firepower and adaptability. Still, Blue Beetle’s scarab-derived abilities might provide him with unique powers that Iron Man’s technology can’t counter easily, especially not without some time to prepare for the battle.
Tony Stark’s broader experience might be pivotal in the clash, but the odds still slightly favor Jaime Reyes. On paper, there is no doubt that Blue Beetle could win against Iron Man in a fight.

2023-08-20 15:04:00+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’ Lands At $25M+; ‘Strays’ Goes To The Dogs With $8M+ – Sunday Box Office Update,Blue Beetle is expected to take the weekend with $28M-$32M and knock off Barbie in its fifth weekend in the No. 1 spot.,"Sunday AM: Writethru after Saturday AM Post Even though this weekend’s new entries – Warner Bros/DC’s Blue Beetle and Universal’s Strays – aren’t coming in at the top of their projections, with respective lower weekends of $25.4M and $8.3M, the overall health of the theatrical business is still in good shape. It’s being further bolstered by the fifth weekends of Barbie ($21.5M) and Oppenheimer ($10.6M), which are fueling an estimated $100.7M weekend that’s +28% over the same August frame a year ago. That was a dry spell, led by CrunchyRoll’s Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero ($21.1M).
It remains to be seen what the toll will be on today’s box office in Los Angeles from the onset of Hurricane Hilary. If it’s heavy rains, no one is going out. Blue Beetle is currently overperforming in LA.
Seriously, this weekend could have seen the subtraction of Blue Beetle because ofthe SAG-AFTRA strike. Warner Bros. kept the movie on track and the marketplace is $25M richer.
‘Blue Beetle’ hits theaters August 18 Warner Bros.
After making $10M on Friday, Blue Beetle eased 15% on Saturday for $8.5M; which indicates front-loading. According to ComScore, more kids returned to school on Friday, with those K-12 off at 46% versus a week prior, which was 70%. EntTelligence reports 2 million admissions for Blue Beetle, repping 23% of the weekend’s foot traffic vs. Barbie, which pulled in 19% of the weekend’s admissions.
Why the under-delivery here on Blue Beetle? Even at $30M, that isn’t a big enough start for this $104M production. The movie gets a B+ CinemaScore overall, which explains it all. Under 18 on CinemaScore gave it an A. Grades were better on Comscore/Screen Engine’s PostTrak, where the movie gets a 90% with Latino and Hispanic moviegoers, who led the charge at 39% to Caucasians’ 27% turnout and 75% grade.
‘Spy Kids,’ 2001 Everett
However, the result here for Blue Beetle isn’t shocking next to other Latino and Hispanic fueled action pics, i.e. Alita: Battle Angel ($28.5M 3-day), Spy Kids ($26.5M), and the R-rated Once Upon a Time in Mexico ($23.4M) — all unadjusted for inflation.
Why wasn’t this movie even strutted at San Diego Comic-Con? In a perfect world, without a SAG-AFTRA strike, it would have been with Cobra Kai star Xolo Maridueña and Blue Beetle‘s cast spreading the gospel on the film, much like Gal Gadot on the first Wonder Woman.
There was buzz that Warners had Hall H cobooked with Legendary for a Blue Beetle-Dune: Part Two combo. But still, even sans stars, how much does it cost for a studio to rent two movie auditoriums, popcorn and soda, and two-night hotel accommodations for a director so that the movie can be shown off to fans and screamed across social media? Warners opted to focus more of their marketing on the Latino and Hispanic marketplace (during early August, iSpot saw that Univision was pulling in a bulk of the ad impressions on Blue Beetle at 11%, with studio spending on such shows as Eternamente amándonos (2.6%).
Social media stat firm RelishMix says that Blue Beetle‘s social media reach of 462.5M across Facebook, Twitter/X, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok are 14% under superhero genre norms. Heck, the social media reach of The Flash was higher at 670.5M. Still, RelishMix says that “the cast has handed over buzz-making duties to fans, who have posted and re-posted materials at a rate of 81:1 on YouTube and 137K fans on official pages.”
In addition, much like what we saw with Shazam: Fury of the Gods, which crashed with a $30M start, the loudspeaker of the new DC Universe under James Gunn and Peter Safran has stolen thunder from the current slate of previously Walter Hamada-hatched DC projects. Hence, the larger set of DC fans aren’t rushing to these movies as must-sees. Still, Gunn has been supportive of Blue Beetle on social, retweeting ads and saying that the protag will be an essential part of the new DC going forward.
Still, you can always tell how much a studio supports a movie when it comes to the number of one-sheets they print up, and Blue Beetle touted 11 next to a paltry four from Universal’s Strays.
Other diagnostics on Blue Beetle: Pic gets an overall 82% positive in the top two boxes, with a 65% recommend for the general audience. Kids under 12 love it at 99% positive and a 61% must-see-right-away. Dude-skewing at 66%, with 58% between 18-34. The biggest demos are currently tied between 18-24 and 25-34 at 29% apiece. Blue Beetle is playing the best in the South, South Central, and West, which is to be expected. All those PLF and Imax screens are working in Warner’s favor and responsible for 42% of the current weekend gross.
Adam Aron’s AMC Burbank is the top-grossing theater in the nation for the DC pic with $91K currently. Other top grossing theaters for Blue Beetle were 2) AMC Empire New York, 3) Harkins Estrella Falls Phoenix, 4) AMC Grove Los Angeles, 5) AMC Century City Los Angeles, 6) AMC Puente Hills Los Angeles, 7) Santikos Casa Blanca San Antonio, 8) Cinemark Tinseltown El Paso, 9) AMC Orange Los Angeles, and 10. AMC Disney Springs Orlando.
EntTelligence shows that the bulk of Blue Beetle‘s were 67% between 1pm-8pm
Still, it doesn’t help that the SAG-AFTRA strike started one month before this pic’s promotion, and the wattage of the cast could have made all the difference for this deep-universe superhero movie.
The availability of actors and late night talk shows could have certainly raised the profile of Strays. However, the marketing campaign and the positioning of the movie was off.
Still, that could have been partially corrected by simply putting Will Ferrell out there on late-night talk shows in a tour with dogs. His bit at CinemaCon with the pup Sophie, one of the canine stars of the film, was one of the few hysterical highlights from the exhibition confab. That alone would have helped sell the message that this talking animal movie is for adults, not kids. While Ferrell was available back in June before the SAG-AFTRA strike, on the old release date for this R-rated comedy on June 9, late night talk shows were not because of the WGA strike.
Part of the problem here is that Universal has released a few family dog movies, read: A Dog’s Journey and A Dog’s Purpose, and the posters here for Strays looked quite similar. Even the trailer appeared kid-friendly.
Compounding problems for Strays is that it didn’t have any on-screen stars, unlike Universal’s other foul-mouthed talking teddy bear movie, Ted, which starred Mark Wahlberg. Stars would have helped break up the whole look of this film, which screams family. Can’t wait to hear stories from this weekend of the parent who bought a ticket to Strays and took their kids, then yelled at theater management, unbeknownst that the movie was really for adults.
Universal was able to pull off a R-rated hit in the foul-mouthed, kid-starring Good Boys, which opened exactly four years ago this weekend to $21.4M. But not this time. However, more to the point: It’s harder to execute comedies than ever since they’ve been cannibalized on streaming menus, and Strays screams streaming in its execution. What works, comedy-wise, on the big-screen? More edgier, far more clever, and more hybrid. Deadpool 3, please don’t move off your first weekend of May summer 2024 start date.
The few who bought tickets to Strays were 56% guys, 53% 18-34, 67% over 25 and 46% Caucasian, 30% Hispanic and Latino, 13% Black and 6% Asian.

There’s another wide release in Luminosity Entertainment/GVN/5120’s R-rated comedy, Back on the Strip, directed by Chris Spencer and starring Tiffany Haddish, JB Smoove, Bill Bellamy, Gary Owen, Kevin Hart and Faizon Love. It did $170K last night for an estimated $461K opening at 1,317 theaters. At the last minute, the indie pic got a SAG-AFTRA interim agreement to have its cast promote. However, the pic’s marketing had to get more creative because of the strike, with stunts like the Laugh Factory’s “Stand Up for Strikers” fundraiser, Martha’s Vineyard African American Film Festival, and the EssenceFest Trailer Launch After Hours party. Pic wasn’t received well by critics at 27% Rotten, nor moviegoers on RT at 40%.
Back on the Strip did get 78% in PostTrak exits, pulling in 57% women, 43% between 18-34, with 40% over 35. The diversity mix was 38% Caucasian, 30% Black, 15% Hispanic and Latino, and 17% Asian/other. Best results were in the South and Midwest. The iPic in Atlanta was the highest- grossing theater so far in the U.S. with close to $2K.
Other highlights on the specialty side this weekend:

Friday Midday: Early numbers show Warner Bros/DC’s Blue Beetle with $9.8M today and a $25M opening at 3,871. This is higher than what others are showing given the expectation that Latino and Hispanic audiences will show up tonight and during matinees. Remember that Blue Beetle has all the PLFs, Imax and premium upcharges working in its favor.
Warners can boast second place in the fifth weekend of Barbie at 4,003 theaters with a $6M Friday, -40% from a week ago, and a $20M-$21M 3-day, -39%. On the high end, Barbie gets to $566.7M by EOD Sunday.
Third and fourth respectively go to Universal with Oppenheimer and Strays. Oppenheimer at 3,321 theaters will see $3M in its fifth Friday, -40%, for $10.9M 3-day, -42% and running total of $285.5M — the Christopher Nolan film will soon overtake Inception‘s domestic of $293M. Bad news, the $46M production, R-rated Strays, is coming in at $8.5M at 3,223 after a $3.5M Friday.
Blue Beetle has an audience score on RT of 93%, while Strays isn’t currently registering one.

RelishMix says about the online chatter that it’s “mainly positive as fans welcome a fresh superhero face — with Xolo Maridueña, a beloved figure from Cobra Kai bringing heat. While many are comping iconic characters like Spider-Man and Iron Man, they’re also praising the film’s cultural depth with some drawing young parallels to Spy Kids and Power Rangers.”

On Strays, RelishMix notes “Audiences are barking about Strays as the convo tracks raucous and mixed — comping to Sausage Party with nods for the film’s originality featuring foul-mouthed live-action dogs. Enthusiasts argue that it’s about time the genre takes bold strides, pushing boundaries and redefining comedic tastes. Snarks question the nuances, debating whether it’s genuine innovation or just a fleeting experiment. Regardless of its ultimate place amidst comedies, Strays has sparked a passionate debate.”
Paramount’s third weekend of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is at $2.2M for Friday, -45% from a week ago, a $8.4M 3-day, -45%, for a running total of $88.1M by EOD Sunday.
Friday AM: Even though kids are heading back to school, the summer box office isn’t giving up yet, and there’s a chance we could near $4 billion thanks to the final act power of Barbie and Oppenheimer. Warner Bros is hoping the first Latino superhero movie, Blue Beetle, will stoke its core moviegoers; that DC title seeing $3.3M last night in previews that began at 2PM from 3,400 locations, while Universal is looking to give guys something to laugh at after Oppenheimer with the R-rated bawdy doggy comedy, Strays, grossing $1.1M from showtimes that began at 5PM at 2,700 theaters.
Blue Beetle is expected to take the weekend with $28M-$32M, the hope being that Latino and Hispanic moviegoers fuel it with walk-up business. The Angel Manuel Soto directed movie is expected to take No. 1 away from Warner Bros.’ Barbie in her fifth weekend, that Mattel doll expected to stay beautiful with $22M-$24M.
Blue Beetle‘s previews aren’t that far from Shazam: Fury of the Gods which did $3.4M before making $11.7M on its first Friday, $30.1M over three-days. That DC sequel, which cost $125M, was a major disappointment, its wattage deafened by the news of the new DC universe that James Gunn and Peter Safran are building. While a $30M start for Blue Beetle would be notable for a Latino-Hispanic movie –a great comp here is Alita: Battle Angel which opened to $28.5M ($37.2M over 4)–that opening for this DC superhero likely won’t trigger a sequel. Blue Beetle cost a reported net of $104M, and was originally conceived for HBO Max, but then the studio pivoted to theatrical after a solid test screening. Reviews haven’t been shabby for Blue Beetle at 79% certified fresh, higher than Shazam 2‘s 49% Rotten, but lower than Shazam‘s 90%. Shazam received an A CinemaScore, the sequel a B+. Shazam Fury of the Gods died at the domestic box office back in the spring with a $57.6M final.
Strays is expected to do in the teens; critics hate the comedy already at 56% Rotten (vs. Uni’s pre-pandemic August 2019 Good Boys which had 80% fresh). Strays‘ preview figure is under that of Good Boy’ $2.1M which turned into an $8.3M Friday, and $21.4M 3-day.
Among titles in regular release, Barbie made $3.8M yesterday at 4,178 theaters, -15% from Wednesday, for a running total through four weeks of $545.7M.
Uni’s Oppenheimer was second with $2M on Thursday at 3,761, -20%, for a four-week running total of $$274.6M. The Christopher Nolan-directed 3-hour drama looks to do another $12M.
Paramount/Nickelodeon/Point Grey’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem grossed $1.3M at 3950, -17% for a running two-week and two day total of $79.7M.
Fourth is Warner’s The Meg 2: The Trench did $1M yesterday, -18% from Wednesday, for a running two week cume of $59.8M.
A24’s Talk to Me was fifth with an estimated $600K at 2,379 theaters, -16%, for a $33.8M three-week running total.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvYm94LW9mZmljZS1ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1zdHJheXMtYmFyYmllLTEyMzU1MjIyMzUv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWJsdWUtYmVldGxlLXN0cmF5cy1iYXJiaWUtMTIzNTUyMjIzNS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

National Cinema Day is this Sunday and it could be *** great time for movie lovers to see their favorite films at *** pretty big discount. So to help us learn how to save, let's bring in San Diego and Rotten Tomatoes correspondent Niki Nova and Nicky, thank you so much for joining. It's great to see you and Sunday is *** big day. How is the Cinema Foundation celebrating National Cinema Day? So I actually feel like *** superhero right now because you're talking about how expensive it is to go to the movies. And so this Sunday, the National Cinema Foundation has announced their second annual National Cinema Day. And what does that mean for audiences and people who like to go to the movies? Well, all day long on Sunday, August 27th movies are $4 dollars. That's going to be across the country over 6000 movie theaters and about 30,000 screens. So, yeah, $4 and there's *** lot, *** lot, *** lot of movies coming out. Ok. So in terms of viewers who want to say they want to take advantage of *** $4 ticket, how do they know whether or not the theater near them applies. Ok. So all you would do is go to Fandango. You could either go to Fandango dot com or to our app. Tickets are on sale now, they're gonna be on sale all week. The thing that I love about Fandango is that you can go on and I like to sometimes gauge what time I'm gonna go see *** movie based on the, the seats that are available and where I like to sit, I have my specific seat. I like to see. So you can check the app and you can check what's available. Um, and it's gonna be busy. I mean, last year was the first annual National Cinema Day and basically it was the highest number of people that went to the cinema all year. So I'd recommend going as early as possible to get your tickets. Ok, I like that. Now, do you have to get them day of or can you book them in advance? Like today, you can get them day off or you can book them in advance. But like I said, I'd recommend getting them early because movies like Oppenheimer have tended to be sold out all summer and this weekend is going to be no exception. We've been talking *** lot about deals. Uh My last guest actually join from *** ARP if you are *** senior citizen, um, do the same deals apply to you if you want to see the film on ***, on *** Sunday. Yeah, this is basically *** flat rate situation. So, no matter what age you are. But the nice thing is like *** family of four could go see *** movie, you could bring your grandma and it's $4. So *** family of four or five could see *** movie, could see the movies for about $20. Uh, standard screens. What about IMAX screens? What all applies? So this is the beauty of it. If so, for some people who have never seen *** movie in IMAX or never seen *** movie in *** premium uh format like *** L, it's $4 no matter what cinema you go to or what theater you sit at. So for example, if you did want to see Oppenheimer and IMAX or there's *** movie coming out this weekend called Grand Charism, which I would recommend in four DX. That's where, you know, your seat moves and sometimes you get air in your face, you really get the immersive experience. Um But yeah, across the board, every movie theater, every ticket, every seat is four bucks. Ok. So I think the other big question is snacks, right? We asked our viewers on our social media pool, you know, basically like our snacks. What's tipping the edge here in terms of making the theater too expensive these days? Obviously, the discount applies to tickets. What about snacks? Well, every theater fandango sells tickets, but every theater will have different deals and I know *** lot of, I've read *** lot about *** lot of different theater chains and exhibitors that are offering snacks deals to go along with the $4 to make it just *** really affordable day for everybody. Ok, that's good. And especially something to do on *** hot day on any other ways to save Nicky. Well, I mean, we have *** Fandango Rewards program which you can sign up for. You can become *** Fandango VIP. And what that means is every ticket that you buy earns you points. Sometimes you can get double the points. So for example, about every four tickets you buy will earn you enough points to get $5 off the next movie. Or you could use it on our streaming service, Voodoo and you could, that's an *** la carte service. So there's no subscription involved. It's pay as you go. So if you wanted to see *** movie like Jennifer Lawrence, no hard feelings that I just saw. It's an R rated raunchy comedy, we have that and you could put it towards that. Do you know if any like old films are playing in the theaters on Sunday that it maybe could be like *** throwback for viewers for movie goers. This is the fun part, Kristen is that there's such *** wide variety coming out this weekend and there's going to be *** lot of re releases. So like for example, if you didn't watch the Super Mario Brothers, which is right now, the highest grossing movie of the year you, it's going to be re released in theaters for this one day only. But the fun thing is *** lot of old, old throwbacks are gonna be available. For example, Jurassic Park, the original that came out in the nineties is gonna be available in 3d. And then this is the one that I'm definitely doing. There's *** little Mermaid sing along. So the 2023 movie starring Halle Bailey, you can go in and you can sing as loud as you want to all the songs in the movie because I tend to have to like hold it back what I'm watching. So, um and then for people who love Barbie and have not seen any of Greta Gerwig, the director's other movies, Lady Bird is getting re-released in theaters. That was her solo directorial debut that earned her five Academy Award nominations. Um Indiana Jones five is getting rereleased just *** ton. Yeah. So check your local, um the fan app and your local theaters to see what's playing on Nicky. Such great insight. I think *** lot of people including myself are now excited to celebrate. So thank you for the deals and thank you for joining.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtdXIuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmF0aW9uYWwtY2luZW1hLWRheS1tb3ZpZXMtdG8td2F0Y2gvNDQ5MTA1MzXSAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy53bXVyLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9uYXRpb25hbC1jaW5lbWEtZGF5LW1vdmllcy10by13YXRjaC80NDkxMDUzNQ?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-02 17:00:00+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’ Director Ángel Manuel Soto Talks Latino Resilience and Creating ‘Cronenberg for Kids’,"""Blue Beetle"" director Ángel Manuel Soto talks Hollywood strikes and Latino culture represented in the new superhero movie.","“Blue Beetle” director Ángel Manuel Soto is an eternal optimist.
It was January 2020 when Soto’s coming-of-age story “Charm City Kings” debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, winning the U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Prize for ensemble acting. Sony Pictures Classics planned to release the film on April 10, which would have come after its intended bow at South by Southwest on March 15. Yet, as for so many movies, a global pandemic changed those plans. It eventually ended up in the hands of HBO Max ahead of its rebrand, but if anyone visits Max, it’s not available, as it was one of the movies that was quietly removed from the platform.
And here Soto is again, sitting in a hotel room on Zoom amid his travels without his actors and writers to promote the film, which opens Aug. 18. He’s going at it alone due to the ongoing Hollywood strikes, hoping to get moviegoers to come out and see his latest vision. “I think it’s just the way it goes with me,” he says. “If anything, let it be a testament to my resilience. It’s part of my Puerto Rican DNA.”
Soto with the Blue Beetle Hopper Stone/SMPSP
In addition to being the first film under the guidance of new DC Studios heads James Gunn and Peter Safran, “Blue Beetle” marks the first Latino superhero character for Warner Bros. Amid the difficult climate in Hollywood, Soto might be echoing a line spoken by his lead character Jaime Reyes (played charismatically by Xolo Maridueña) in a scene in “Blue Beetle” where he yells in despair: “This shit doesn’t get better for us!”
Soto can see the obstacles stacked against him, but he’s determined to emerge victorious. “I think about it constantly and how this could have been our moment,” he tells Variety. “But no, it’s not could. It’s still our moment.”
“Blue Beetle” follows Jaime Reyes as he returns to his hometown after college graduation, where his family struggles to make ends meet. Soon after, he is chosen to become a symbiotic host to the Scarab, an ancient alien biotechnological relic that grants him a powerful exoskeleton armor, turning him into the titular superhero. The film also stars Latino talent like Oscar nominee Adriana Barraza (“Babel”), George Lopez, Damián Alcázar, Bruna Marquezine, Belissa Escobedo and Raoul Max Trujillo, along with Susan Sarandon.
Soto, 40, didn’t attend film school like many of his colleagues in the industry. A native of Santurce, Puerto Rico, one of the most densely populated areas on the island, he attended university on a soccer scholarship studying architecture. Despite being a die-hard cinephile and wanting to make movies, film school had too high a pricetag. Instead, he shelved his passion for later in life. “I had to spend a lot of money to create a network where I would learn by doing, not by going to school,” he says.
That natural talent is what executives like Peter Safran, co-chairperson, and CEO of DC Studios, saw in Soto’s “Charm City Kings,” which convinced him Soto was the right person for the job. “It was a coming-of-age story that had similar elements that were translatable to ‘Blue Beetle’ on a larger scale,” Safran says. “When you look at some of the great superhero movies, they’ve come from filmmakers not known for that particular genre.” Safran points to blockbuster and critical hits such as “Iron Man” from Jon Favreau, “Shazam,” directed by David Sandberg, or his co-CEO Gunn with “Guardians of the Galaxy.”
Soto began his career in entertainment as a TV producer, later focusing on art direction at an advertising agency. He made his directorial debut with “La Granja,” a film looking at the harsh realities of his native island, something Soto knows too well. Soto’s father was a lifelong Teamster and union advocate and one of the many protestors to remove Ricardo A. Rosselló, the corrupt Puerto Rico governor, in 2019.
You see Soto’s cinematic inspirations in every frame, referencing classic tentpole franchises like “Mission: Impossible” and “Indiana Jones.” He utilizes this nostalgic energy to portray the first superhero that does not want his superpowers. In fact, Soto knew what he wanted for Jaime’s transformation into the blue exoskeleton. “How can we do [David] Cronenberg for kids?” he says. “I wanted the energy to be fun but also tell the story about the movies that made me love movies.”
Filming on the “Blue Beetle” set Hopper Stone/SMPSP
Incorporating humor and action-packed battle sequences, “Blue Beetle” tells an origin story that shows promise for future iterations.
The filmmaker saw too much of himself in Jaime to not tell this story. One aspect that was important to him was the accurate pronunciation of their names, which is often disregarded in American culture — Jaime (pronounced “hay-meh”) and Ángel (“ahng-hehl”). In addition, a scene with Sarandon’s villainous Victoria Kord calling her employee scientist Sanchez (Harvey Guillén), despite it not being his name. The goal is to show that Latinos are not a monolith, and as underrepresented and misunderstood as we are in Hollywood, we are powerful when united. That’s why he’s meticulous when presenting Jaime’s family, whom he wants the audience to love and see themselves represented in, Latino or not. “By the end of the first act, you know this family. You feel the warmth. You can almost smell the food,” he says.
For decades, Latino artists have faced numerous barriers in Hollywood, including typecasting and limited opportunities. The lack of diversity behind the scenes has often resulted in a skewed representation of Latino characters, perpetuating stereotypes rather than reflecting the rich complexity of their culture and experiences.
Furthermore, securing financing for Latino-led projects can be particularly challenging due to the perception of limited market appeal. It’s a curious perception since Latinos comprise 20% of the U.S. population and represent more than 25% of domestic box office ticket sales.
The disparity in data tells the story. In a 2021 study by USC Annenberg that looked at over 1,300 films over a 13-year timeframe, only 5% of 51,158 characters identified were Hispanic or Latino. Furthermore, only 4.2% of the movies had Latino or Hispanic directors attached; even worse, only three Latina women were among them all.
While there have been Latino characters in the DC universe previously – Jay Hernandez as El Diablo in “Suicide Squad,” and Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya in “Birds of Prey” – the pressure for the film’s success couldn’t be any more pronounced after seeing the cancellation of “Batgirl” with Leslie Grace, and the underwhelming reception of “The Flash” which featured Sasha Calle as Supergirl. The fear beginning to seep into Latino communities is that if “Blue Beetle” is deemed a “failure,” it will only worsen Latinos’ visibility, preventing more projects like these for decades.
“It’s up to people like us to ensure that doesn’t happen,” says Safran. “Whether it’s Pam [Abdy] and Mike [DeLuca] or us in DC, it’s in our hands to make sure that we show a diverse slate of movies with different kinds of people represented on screen. I believe the audience will turn up for ‘Blue Beetle.’ It’s a success story that people will want to replicate.”
Filmmakers are also voicing their support for the upcoming superhero flick such as “Justice League” director Zack Snyder, who shared his excitement with his 1.4 million Twitter followers, which will surely help increase public awareness. “Looking forward to taking my kids to see Blue Beetle. #RepresentationMatters.”
With a screenplay by Mexican writer Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer (“Miss Bala”), the film is anchored with messages that can connect all viewers. Dunnet-Alcocer and Soto turn the idea that “Latinos are invisible” on its head with the line, “Invisibility is our superpower.”
“They tell us about this ‘glass ceiling’ and then tell us we should feel complacent and be grateful that we’ve even reached that ceiling. Every time someone like us excels, it’s a big surprise. We always knew we could do that. I believe in the power of community, and I’m not a fatalist. I’m a relentless optimist,” says Soto.
It’s hard to recall a mainstream movie in which so many crew members and actors’ names with accent marks and tildes on their names can be seen when the credits roll, showing the vast diversity of artists behind the camera.
Plenty of Easter Eggs are sprinkled in “Blue Beetle,” pointing to the connection with other DC titles.
There are scenes with a “Gotham Law” jacket and where George Lopez’s Uncle Rudy hilariously calls Batman “a fascist.” We even see some open boxes of Oreos, the favorite snack of the Martian Manhunter, a core member of the Justice League. With Warner Bros. reportedly discussing some shuffling of its 2023 projects including “The Color Purple,” “Dune: Part Two” and another DC Studios sequel “Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom,” Warner Bros. insiders tell Variety the Jason Momoa film is expected to hold its Dec. 20 release date.
Soto realizes that despite the promotional hurdle the strikes have imposed, the guilds are striking to help the people that make up his team.
“We want the movie to succeed, but I also want my actors and writers to be treated as they should. If that happens, we’ll have more stories like this. Things that are often deemed impossible are not.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2JsdWUtYmVldGxlLWRpcmVjdG9yLWFuZ2VsLW1hbnVlbC1zb3RvLWxhdGlub3MtaG9sbHl3b29kLXN0cmlrZS0xMjM1Njg1MTM0L9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2JsdWUtYmVldGxlLWRpcmVjdG9yLWFuZ2VsLW1hbnVlbC1zb3RvLWxhdGlub3MtaG9sbHl3b29kLXN0cmlrZS0xMjM1Njg1MTM0L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-22 12:00:00+00:00,Movie Review: ‘Blue Beetle’,"The resilience of the indestructible loving family, in this case, a Mexican American clan, forms the heart and soul of ""Blue Beetle"" (Warner Bros.).","NEW YORK (OSV News) – The resilience of the indestructible loving family, in this case, a Mexican American clan, forms the heart and soul of “Blue Beetle” (Warner Bros.). Even as the DC Comics-derived adventure occasionally lapses into cliches, moreover, this solid core endures – and helps to make the film built around it acceptable for a fairly broad audience.
The arrival on screen of the titular character (Xolo Maridueña) constitutes a landmark in cinematic history since he’s the first Latino superhero. Although Blue Beetle, like Superman, has been around in print form since 1939, it wasn’t until 2006 that he was given a specific ethnic identity by way of his current alter ego, Jaime Reyes.
Director Ángel Manuel Soto and screenwriter Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer frame their fantasy elements within the story of Jaime’s all-too-realistic travails and those of his struggling relatives. Although they believe in the dignity of work and will accept any available employment to get ahead, the Reyes are about to get kicked out of the house they rent due to gentrification.
On the brink of homelessness, they can only gaze from afar at the gleaming skyscrapers of Palmera City, the wealth of whose upper class is not trickling down to them. As Jamie’s sister, Milagro (Belissa Escobedo), ruefully observes, “We used to have the other side of the tracks. Now they want that, too.”
Yet, in the midst of it all, dad Alberto (Damián Alcázar) reminds Jaime, the first Reyes to graduate from college, of the fundamentals: “The familia, that’s what lasts. Everyone has a purpose.”
But enough social realism, at least for now. As an opening sequence has shown us, Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) – the scheming CEO of the Palmera City-based conglomerate founded by her late brother, Ted, and named for her family – has recently unearthed a powerful artifact for which she had long been searching, a blue scarab from outer space called the Khaji Da.
Victoria intends to use the magical amulet to build a world-conquering army. But her niece, Jenny (Bruna Marquezine), Ted’s daughter, has other ideas. Jenny steals the curio and, as she makes her escape, hands it off to Jaime, who is trying to get a job at Kord Industries.
It turns out that the scarab has a mind of its own, and attaches itself quickly to Jaime in the midst of one of his family’s many crises. He’s instantly clothed in an azure-highlighted outfit that, among other things, enables him to fly and makes him impervious to bullets. The suit, however, melts away the moment danger has successfully been averted.
A comedy-lightened struggle against the forces of evil, fought in alliance with Jenny, ensues. Some of the humorous detours, however, seem disappointingly out of place in a work that aspires to be viewed as pioneering.
Thus Jaime’s slogan-spouting Uncle Rudy (George Lopez) has a Tacoma pickup truck he calls the Taco, with a horn that plays La Cucaracha. In a similar vein, the lad’s Nana (Adriana Barraza) unexpectedly proves to be a dab hand at weaponry, based on her hidden past as a south-of-the-border revolutionary. Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
While the mayhem along Blue Beetle’s path is too strong for little kids, teens will handle it easily. The smattering of vulgarity in the dialogue is doled out with equal restraint, though parents may regret that it’s present at all.
Still, commendable basic values and a positive, if flawed, portrayal of Hispanic life make this debut for Jaime Reyes – whose true superpower, it turns out, is familial love – an attractive choice for moviegoers.
The film contains stylized but intense action, fleeting crude and crass language and a couple of scatological references. The OSV News classification is A-II – adults and adolescents. The Motion Picture Association rating is PG-13 – parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.

Taylor Swift Sells More Tickets In Presales For ‘The Eras Tour’ At Just AMC Theaters Than ‘Blue Beetle’s’ Entire Domestic Opening Weekend
Taylor Swift in Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour via Taylor Swift YouTube
Taylor Swift and the recently announced The Eras Tour has already grossed more in pre-sales at just AMC Theaters than Blue Beetle’s entire domestic opening weekend.
Swift announced The Eras Tour would be getting a theatrical release yesterday on her social media channels.
On X she wrote, “The Eras Tour has been the most meaningful, electric experience of my life so far and I’m overjoyed to tell you that it’ll be coming to the big screen soon.”
From there she added, “Starting Oct 13th you’ll be able to experience the concert film in theaters in North America!”

Swift’s Eras Tour was her sixth tour and her second all-stadium tour. The tour kicked off in Glendale, Arizona on March 17th and is expected to conclude in November 2024 in Toronto, Ontario.
Each tour date sees Swift sing 44 of her songs with 10 acts and is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length.
Box office analyst Valliant Renegade predicts this film could be the highest grossing film of the fall box office season. He noted, “I think this could be a $100 million surprise weekend for theaters with this thing.”
He goes on to point out that Swift’s film is taking the place of Dune Part II, which was recently delayed to March 2024, “Dune 2 certainly would have been in contention for one of the biggest if not the biggest box office draw this fall season. That is no longer. Taylor Swift is moving into claim the mantle.”
RELATED: The Walt Disney Company’s 2022 Domestic Box Office Grosses The Worst In Over Two Decades
Valliant Renegade might have actually been underestimating Swift’s command at the box office. AMC reports the film sold over $26 million in pre-sales in just one day. For those keeping count that’s more than Blue Beetle’s entire opening weekend. The most recent DC release only brought in $25 million domestically.
Oh, and that $26 million number is just for AMC Theaters, it does not include sales at Regal and Cinemark.
Exhibitor Relations reports, “$26M in one day of pre-sales. And that’s just from AMC. Yes, a $100M debut is definitely in the cards for TAYLOR SWIFT: THE ERAS TOUR, which rolls out Oct. 13. Swift saves cinemas.”
RELATED: AMC CEO Responds To Reports That AMC Theaters Are Suppressing ‘Sound Of Freedom’
AMC also revealed the pre-sale total of $26 million far surpassed the previous record for a single title at AMC. Spider-Man: No Way Home held the previous record at $16.9 million. AMC also noted it shattered Spider-Man: No Way Home’s previous claim to the top spot for 24-hour ticket sales revenue, but it didn’t take 24 hours to do it. It took less than three hours.
Senior VP at Fandango Ticketing Jerramy Hainline also told Variety, “Not only is Taylor Swift’s concert film the best first-day ticket seller of the year on Fandango, but the concert film is performing like the superhero she is and ranking among the best first-day ticket sellers of all time from franchises like Marvel, Star Wars, DC Comics and more.”
The movie is forcing a shakeup from competitors as well. Jason Blum and Universal chose to move The Exorcist: Believer up a week so as not to compete with Swift.
He announced on X, “Look what you made me do. The Exorcist: Believer moves to 10/6/23. #TaylorWins.”
Given Valliant Renegade and Exhibitor Relations are predicting a $100 million opening weekend, it’s quite possible if Swift and company decide to add more showings that it could easily become one of the top grossing films for 2023. Sound of Freedom currently holds the 10th spot with a domestic gross of $181 million.
In fact, AMC noted in their press release they plan to add showtimes stating, “Recognizing this unprecedented demand, AMC is adding additional showtimes to increase capacity where necessary and available. During its run at AMC, TAYLOR SWIFT | THE ERAS TOUR concert film will play at least four showtimes per day on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, at every AMC theatre location in the United States.”
It’s not of the realm of possibility that they expand it to a second weekend or even third weekend.
What do you make of Taylor Swift outgrossing Blue Beetle in presales at just AMC Theaters?

Director Gareth Edwards (2016’s Rogue One: A Star Wars Story $533.5M domestic/$1 billion global, 2014’s Godzilla $200.6M domestic/$524.9M global) brings a new science-fiction epic to the screen with The Creator. His first feature since Rogue One, The Creator is set amidst a future war between the human race and a topic that’s currently making headlines–artificial intelligence. Joshua (John David Washington), a hardened ex-special forces agent grieving the disappearance of his wife (Gemma Chan), is recruited to hunt down and kill the ‘Creator’, the architect behind the advanced AI, who has developed a mysterious weapon with the power to end the war and life itself (September 29th).
Blue Beetle launches a new DC superhero, the first DCU character in the new universe, according to DC Studios Co-CEO James Gunn. Recent college grad Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) returns home full of aspirations for his future. As he searches to find his purpose in life, fate intervenes when an ancient scarab chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, bestowing him with an incredible suit of armor and forever changing his destiny (August 18th). The DC Universe’s most recent entry, The Flash, currently stands at $106.9M as of Monday.
Director Alexander Payne (Downsizing $24.4M domestic/$55M global, Nebraska $17.6M domestic/$27.6M global), returns to cinemas with his first film since 2017. The Holdovers follows a curmudgeon (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who is forced to remain on campus during Christmas break to watch troublemaker (Dominic Sessa), who has nowhere to go for the holidays. Da’Vine Joy Randolph co-stars as the school’s head cook, who has just lost her son in Vietnam. The film arrives in select theaters on October 27th, before opening wide on November 10th.
Sophie Barthes (2014’s Madame Bovary $44K domestic/$658K gobal) helms The Pod Generation, in which a New York couple (Emilia Clarke and Chiwetel Ejiofor) in the not-so-distant future suddenly enter parenthood after landing a coveted spot at the Womb Center, which offers detachable, artificial wombs called ‘pods’ (August 11th).

2023-08-02 15:14:33+00:00,Blue Beetle Popcorn Bucket: Where To Buy the Limited Edition Vessel,"Here's how to buy the Blue Beetle popcorn bucket, as well as the tin, plush, cup, and vessel at Cinemark theaters.","The Blue Beetle popcorn bucket is the latest themed popcorn vessel to pop up on social media. With fans going wild for the Barbie bucket, a push is clearly being made to highlight any limited-edition vessels, cups, plushies, and other cinema-related items. Here’s a breakdown of where you can buy the limited-edition popcorn bucket and how much it is.
Where to buy the Blue Beetle popcorn bucket
Cinemark has the Blue Beetle popcorn bucket available to buy at select US theaters.
Eager fans can expect the Blue Beetle popcorn bucket items to become available on, or shortly before, August 18. This is when the Blue Beetle movie launches, so it makes sense for the accompanying popcorn bucket to launch alongside it.
The wording of “while supplies last” confirm that there is a limited quantity of the popcorn bucket items available. If you’re a big fan of Blue Beetle who is desperate to get their hands on one or more of the items, I recommend getting there early on release day.
How much is the Blue Beetle popcorn bucket?
The Blue Beetle popcorn bucket container is $25 without popcorn or $30 with popcorn.
There are other Blue Beetle items available at Cinemark. The full catalog is as follows:
Cup $7
Popcorn Tin $16
Popcorn Container $25
Popcorn Container with Medium Popcorn $30
Tin & Cup Combo $22
Plush $12
Buddy Cup $15
As mentioned above, these items are available in limited quantities, meaning stock might not last until the end of launch day. If you’ve got your eye on a specific Blue Beetle item, you’ll want to head to the nearest Cinemark theater early on launch day.

,"The 50 best superhero movies ever, ranked (from 'Blue Beetle' to 'Superman')","The new DC superhero movie ""Blue Beetle"" has us thinking: Which is the best of all? So we're ranking the top 50, from ""The Avengers"" to ""Superman.""","Who needs a crown and scepter when you've got capes, cowls and the occasional magic hammer?
For most of this century – and a couple pockets of the past one – Hollywood has been ruled by the kings and queens of superhero movies. From the sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe where Captain America and Spider-Man hang out to the world of Superman, Batman and the rest of the DC contingent, guys and gals with cool powers and righteous attitudes – as well as their resident villains – have won over movie fans' hearts and minds. They've also made made ridiculous amounts of money: Of the 10 highest-grossing films worldwide, four feature beloved comic-book heroes (""Avengers: Endgame,"" ""Spider-Man: No Way Home,"" ""The Avengers"" and ""Avengers: Infinity War"").
And with the MCU trucking along with movies scheduled until 2026 and DC plotting a reset, they're probably not going anywhere anytime soon. With ""Blue Beetle"" the latest to arrive in theaters – featuring the first Latino superhero in DC movie history – we're ranking the 50 best superhero movies of all time.
50. 'Chronicle' (2012)
While director Josh Trank's ""Fantastic Four"" was a fiasco, this standout coming-of-age/found-footage thriller delved into why teenagers with superpowers is realistically not a great idea, with Michael B. Jordan, Dane DeHaan and Alex Russell as the immature youngsters given the gifts of gods and not treating them with care.
49. 'The Last Dragon' (1985)
A kitschy '80s cult kung-fu movie with ninjas, martial artists who glow and DeBarge on the soundtrack is going to make the list, period. Taimak stars as the Bruce Lee fan who rescues a New York VJ (Vanity), takes on a bad dude named Sho'Nuff (Julius Carry), plus can dance and karate kick to the rhythm of the night.
48. 'Blue Beetle' (2023)
Karate kid Xolo Maridueña kicks fools in the face regularly on Netflix's ""Cobra Kai,"" and his star heads to the next phase of the stratosphere as Jaime Reyes, a recent college grad (Gotham Law, baby!) who gets taken over by an alien scarab, gains superpowers but more importantly takes on baddies with his loving Mexican American family.
47. 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' (2004)
It's a crime this innovative steampunk throwback adventure was never a thing, but it just was before its time. Alongside A-listers Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, Jude Law plays the heroic title pilot who has to save the world in a narrative with giant robots, flying zeppelins, a ""Wizard of Oz"" jones and digitized Laurence Olivier.
46. 'Ant-Man' (2015)
Marvel deserves a lot of credit for its big swings, like director Peyton Reed's superhero heist film with a guy who can shrink and ride ants. The immortal Paul Rudd is the secret sauce, as the ex-con cat burglar given these crazy abilities − though instead of doing it for the attaboys and kudos, he just wants to be a good dad.
45. 'Watchmen' (2009)
Say what you will about Zack Snyder's DC movies but this faithful adaptation of the seminal ""Watchmen"" source material is the best thing he's done outside of ""300."" His signature visual style – with slo-mos and hero shots aplenty – lend themselves well to the alt-history epic and the deconstruction of the caped do-gooder.
44. 'Fast Color' (2018)
Gugu Mbatha-Raw headlines the emotional and grounded take on the superhero genre as a former drug addict on the run from those trying to study her telekinetic abilities. The post-apocalyptic scenario adds some flavor, as does the narrative of generations of women mending what’s been shattered between them.
43. 'X-Men: First Class' (2011)
So many X-movies are just X-tremely bad. Not so this groovy 1960s-set adventure that doubles as an origin story for the team of superpowered mutants, putting them at the center of the Cuban Missile Crisis and going deep on the relationship between frenemies Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender).
42. 'Joker' (2019)
What's this doing here? Well, Batman's a kid in it! And, yeah, Joaquin Phoenix is pretty good, too. He won a best actor Oscar for what's essentially a supervillain origin story that is brutal and cynical and even toxic, though it takes some real chutzpah to ask an audience to have empathy for the devil.
41. 'Shazam'! (2019)
Zachary Levi is a natural to inhabit the body of a teen boy in a souped-up body. Like ""Big"" meets ""Superman,"" the family-tinged fantasy tracks the wish-fulfillment high jinks of a kid trying (and often failing) to be a hero, leans into the importance of family and is the rare mainstream film that touches on the foster-care system in a tangible way.
40. 'Dick Tracy' (1990)
Al Pacino chewing scenery like a buffet. Madonna slinking around. Dustin Hoffman mumbling a lot. There's so much to adore about the colorful gangland comic-book movie, and at the center of it is Warren Beatty as the hard-nosed detective with the radio watch, bright yellow overcoat and unshakable righteousness.
39. 'Spider-Man' (2002)
OK, so Tobey Maguire didn't look like a teenager. The sight of the OG Spidey swinging around New York City in Sam Raimi's origin story still holds up, as does J.K. Simmons' newsman J. Jonah Jameson chomping cigars and an unhinged Willem Dafoe tearing up Manhattan as the superhero's most dangerous enemy, the Green Goblin.
38. 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army' (2008)
There is only one Hellboy, Ron Perlman, and the big horned guy with the Right Hand of Doom is a joy to behold in director Guillermo del Toro's fantasy sequel. Del Toro loves his monsters and he unleashes all sorts, from nasty tooth fairies to goblin blacksmiths, as Hellboy is tasked with stopping an army of clockwork mechanical soldiers.
37. 'Blade' (1998)
Neither Spider-Man nor X-Men were Marvel's first big success at the cinema. That honor goes to Wesley Snipes' fanged vampire hunter, who took out gore-covered bloodsuckers and had all the swagger in a cult flick that boasted B-movie antics, '90s style and set the stage for the heroes who came after.
36. 'Robocop' (1987)
In a futuristic and extremely crime-ridden Detroit, cop Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is killed in the line of duty and brought back as a cyborg warrior by a shady corporation. Director Paul Verhoeven's violent '80s action film is also a well-crafted social satire that tackles themes of capitalism and identity and only gets better with age.
35. 'Iron Man' (2008)
Robert Downey Jr. snagged a heck of a career revival playing Tony Stark, an arms manufacturer who gets a high-tech heart and a conscience – plus one really sweet suit of armor. Jon Favreau's action-packed character study turned out to be a game-changer, kicking off what would become the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
34. 'Sky High' (2005)
The Disney high school comedy still works as a superhero gateway for kids. Michael Angarano is the teen son of hero parents wondering if he'll ever gets his powers in this clever take on young adolescence and family legacy, and Kurt Russell's square jaw was born to play a dude named Steve Stronghold.
33. 'Flash Gordon' (1980)
New York Jets star quarterback rockets to a strange planet, tussles with a guy named Ming the Merciless, gets in a love triangle, and teams up with a bunch of hawkmen. (Follow that, Aaron Rodgers!) The campy space opera is lustier than you might expect from a comic-strip do-gooder, and that Queen soundtrack rocks as hard as it ever did.
32. 'Deadpool 2' (2018)
Ryan Reynolds' masked ""Merc with a Mouth"" broke the fourth wall ""Looney Tunes"" style and blew up the genre with a bunch of Acme dynamite in the 2016 original. The zanier time-traveling meta sequel ups his hallmark lampooning game, while also methodically redefining how funny and completely messed up these flicks could be.
31. 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' (2017)
Tom Holland proved that having a young dude play teenage Peter Parker is definitely for the best. Instead of an origin story, Peter is thrown into the stressful situation of navigating high school life, being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man and crushing on the daughter of Michael Keaton's villainous Vulture.
30. 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' (2022)
In the wake of Chadwick Boseman's death, Ryan Coogler's sequel became a soulful and profound look at life, legacy and dealing with grief. It gave Wakanda a female-centered story to tell – with Letitia Wright's Princess Shuri taking on the Panther mantle – and a standout Marvel antagonist in Tenoch Huerta Mejía's charming Namor.
29. 'The Lego Batman Movie' (2017)
The joyously bonkers animated comedy tackled Batman (voiced by Will Arnett) in a fun new way, showing him as a complicated mess who can’t get out of his own way long enough for the greater good. The brick-built bro-dude Dark Knight shreds a mean guitar and also learns the importance of friendship.
28. 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' (2010)
Mixing video-game boss battles with coming-of-age tropes, Edgar Wright's electrifying musical action comedy cast Michael Cera as the Canadian title slacker, who falls for enigmatic Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). To date her, he has to literally fight her seven evil exes and along the way earn the power of self-respect.
27. 'Wonder Woman' (2017)
Gal Gadot had already appeared as the Amazon warrior but she came into her own in this World War I adventure. Her relationship with a pilot (Chris Pine) opens her heart to humanity, and the sight of her bravely walking across the battlefield of ""No Man's Land"" has become an emotional touchstone in the annals of comic-book movies.
26. 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' (2023)
How many Spider-people is too many? Trick question: There's never enough. The snazzy animated sequel sends the Brooklyn teen (voiced by Shameik Moore) into the multiverse to grow up some more: He learns he's part of a huge connected web of folks, yet puts all that in jeopardy to save a loved one.
25. 'The Suicide Squad' (2021)
James Gunn is now in charge of DC's movie future, and this violently subversive retooling of the supergroup was a successful job interview. The director's love for quirky characters and a dark sense of humor blended well with stars like Idris Elba, John Cena and Margot Robbie (whose Harley Quinn has never been more gloriously wacky.)
24. 'Captain America: The First Avenger' (2011)
Cap was punching Nazis in comic books way before Indiana Jones, and Chris Evans captured that appealing righteousness onscreen in the stirring World War II origin tale. When the super soldier puts up his dukes and says, ""I can do this all day,"" you believe him – and Evans did, for several more Marvel movies afterward.
23. 'Superman II' (1980)
The one where Supes gets beat up by a trucker. In order to be with his beloved Lois (Margot Kidder), Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel has his powers removed and that's of course when General Zod (Terence Stamp) and his crew show up wanting to take over Earth and Gene Hackman's top-notch Lex Luthor reappears as a pest.
22. 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' (2023)
James Gunn's swan song with his motley crew of cosmic misfits couldn't have been better, with Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) and Co. scrambling to save their raccoon buddy Rocket (Bradley Cooper) in a sprawling heartfelt adventure that, in its own profound way, tackled issues of animal cruelty and abuse.
21. 'Batman Returns' (1992)
If ""Die Hard"" is a Christmas movie, then so is the art deco Tim Burton sequel that pitted his Caped Crusader (Michael Keaton) against the ghoulish and freaky Penguin (a never-scarier Danny DeVito). The real gift in this holiday-tinged Bat-bonanza: Michelle Pfeiffer's purr-fect Catwoman, a fierce and alluring vision in black leather.
20. 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' (2021)
""Spider-Verse"" doesn't have a monopoly on multiple web-slingers, and Tom Holland's third Marvel solo film – and alternate-reality smorgasbord – teamed him with past screen Spideys Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. (The welcome return of Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin and Jamie Foxx's improved Electro were awesome, too.)
19. 'Avengers: Infinity War' (2018)
Be honest, who's still catching their breath from half the Marvel heroes horrifically turning to ash? The Avengers and other good guys rally to try and keep Thanos (Josh Brolin) from collecting the all-powerful Infinity Stones. They fail, miserably, and the consequences lead to a cliffhanger not soon forgotten.
18. 'Batman Begins' (2005)
The British came to Gotham City and redefined the Dark Knight for a new generation of Bat-fans. Christian Bale nailed the delineations between rich guy Bruce Wayne and his vigilante alter ego, and director Christopher Nolan's outstanding redo of the Caped Crusader's origins was a twisty masterstroke.
17. 'X-Men' (2000)
Marvel's mutant squad made an auspicious big-screen debut that paid tribute to the deep comic themes of them not being accepted by humanity and saving the world anyway. It was also a straight-up blast, especially with Halle Berry's weather-manipulating Storm and Hugh Jackman's mutton-chopped, clawed wonder Wolverine.
16. 'The Batman' (2022)
Robert Pattinson's younger riff on the Dark Knight leans into the ""World's Greatest Detective"" angle from the comics. Director Matt Reeves also populated a neo-noir Gotham with reinvented, realistic Bat-villains: serial-killing Riddler (Paul Dano), vengeful Catwoman (Zoe Kravitz) and power-hungry gangster Penguin (Colin Farrell).
15. 'The Rocketeer' (1991)
In the thrilling ode to the days of pulp serials, Billy Campbell threw on a jetpack and aerodynamic helmet as the 1930s title character, a stunt pilot whose airborne exploits put him on the radar of the FBI, Howard Hughes (!) and Nazi spies. And none of that's helpful in mending fences with his beloved squeeze Jenny (Jennifer Connelly).
14. 'Unbreakable' (2000)
Yeah, it's a bit of a somber affair, but woo boy, M. Night Shyamalan's love letter to comics works exceedingly well with a pair of origin stories and a couple of Hollywood icons. Bruce Willis is the train-wreck survivor turned reluctant, quasi-immortal hero, while Samuel L. Jackson stuns as the totally breakable bad-guy mastermind.
13. 'Logan' (2017)
James Mangold's Western-tinged adventure strips away the superhero trappings to get down and dirty with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine in his twilight years. Even an old man Logan is still a brutal warrior, though rather than dustups, the drama focuses more on a surly X-Man realizing he needs loved ones in a thoughtful exploration of age and mortality.
12. 'Spider-Man 2' (2004)
Not that Sam Raimi's first Spidey outing was shabby by any stretch, but the sequel set a high bar for superhero movies for a good while. Tobey Maguire's hero wrestles with personal problems in a more emotional story line and Alfred Molina shined as an entertaining Doctor Octopus with plenty of metal tentacles and gravitas.
11. 'The Incredibles' (2004)
The best Fantastic Four movie – even considering there were three actual ""Fantastic Four"" movies. Director Brad Bird's animated Pixar gem took the family of superheroes theme to new heights, with strong main characters appealing to a wide base of filmgoers. (The MVP: Craig T. Nelson's relatable and embattled dad Mr. Incredible.)
10. 'Black Panther' (2018)
Ryan Coogler's first journey to Wakanda became a phenomenon for Black culture, with kids doing ""Wakanda Forever"" salutes and Chadwick Boseman turning in a performance befitting a king. His death has given new weight to all his roles, none more than the dignity, grace and quiet power he brought to T'Challa.
9. 'The Avengers' (2012)
Let's face it, we've been spoiled by all the superteam blockbusters during the past decade. But even after ""Justice League"" and its ilk, the OG ""Avengers"" still holds up as a banger. Marvel's shawarma-chomping A-listers have to put differences aside to stave off an alien attack on Manhattan. Until it all falls apart again in ...
8. 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016)
Cap vs. Iron Man is the main event, of course, and the heroes-batting-each-other airport showdown is an all-timer. What makes this one special is how it deals with the real-world ramifications of superpowered beings among us, and the watchable messiness of good guys divided down political and personal lines.
7. 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' (2018)
Spidey is often the superhero that little kids connect with first. And wielding eye-popping animation and a coming-of-age narrative, the daring first ""Spider-Verse"" embraced that universality with Shameik Moore's Miles Morales, a multicultural Brooklyn kid navigating self-confidence and identity issues with entertaining moxie.
6. 'Batman' (1989)
Do we want to get nuts? Yes, Michael Keaton, we would like to get nuts. In Tim Burton's striking and gonzo Bat-flick, Keaton was a slightly crazy Bruce Wayne who you'd believe was a nighttime vigilante – and the right guy to be taking on a Joker that oozes Jack Nicholson's signature kooky charisma.
5. 'Avengers: Endgame' (2019)
After the events of ""Infinity War,"" Earth's mightiest survivors go on a spiffy time-travel heist in order to bring back their friends and the rest of the galaxy that got whisked away. That, and the numerous MCU movies prior, was merely prelude to a monumental brawl against Thanos for all the marbles that may never be surpassed in sheer epicness.
4. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' (2014)
Always remember, James Gunn made the world fall in love with an alien tree and a talking raccoon. As much as the first ""Guardians"" is full of big stakes and save-the-universe derring-do, it's the themes of family and friendship, and little oddities like a convo about how ""Footloose"" is the most heroic movie in the cosmos, that make it sparkle.
3. 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' (2014)
It's not just a great superhero movie, it's just a great movie. An ace political thriller, the flick taps into timely themes of privacy concerns, an enemy growing from within, and military might used in ethically questionable ways. And if that timeliness doesn't impress you, maybe Cap wrecking a bunch of heavies in an elevator will.
2. 'The Dark Knight' (2008)
The late Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance as a chaotic, unpredictable Joker completely hijacks Christopher Nolan's breathtaking Bat-sequel, and will likely never be matched. Dealing with this colorful psychopath, Christian Bale's hero wrestles with personal choices and his gig as Gotham's resident protector in a white-knuckle affair about the fine line between good and evil.
1. 'Superman: The Movie' (1978)
Richard Donner's masterpiece covers the action-packed bases, from an exploding Krypton to disastrous quakes on Earth – you know, a job for Superman. What sets it apart from all the rest of the superhero pack is Christopher Reeve's magnificent showing as the ultimate Man of Steel. This alien is nurtured to be the best of us, embracing humanity and falling in love (see: Supes and Margot Kidder's Lois going on a stellar first-date flight). Reeve brings so much heart to a role where, with just little shifts in posture and mannerisms, he effortlessly switches from bespectacled Clark Kent to the legendary boy scout. Simply put, Reeve was super, man.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L21vdmllcy8yMDIzLzA4LzIwL2Jlc3Qtc3VwZXJoZXJvLW1vdmllcy1hbGwtdGltZS83MDU3NjE4MDAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-28 20:07:04+00:00,George Lopez Was the Improvising King on ‘Blue Beetle’ — Here’s What Happened,Our Thing,"If it were up to Blue Beetle director Ángel Manuel Soto, his superhero movie would’ve extended a few more minutes past the studio’s self-imposed two-hour limit thanks to George Lopez improvising.
According to Collider, Soto gave the cast time to go off the script to see if they could create something that would make the final cut. As a veteran comedian, it was no surprise that Lopez understood the assignment.
“It was fun because we developed this thing where we shoot the script and then … everybody can do whatever they want,” Soto said. “That’s where George Lopez thrives. He gave like a seven-minute improv rant.”

Although all of Lopez’s improvised dialogue didn’t make the final movie, Soto said he was able to keep a few lines in. “We only had one line in the script, and we just had the camera there, and he gave like a seven-minute improv rant of all the different things that Kord is doing to the community.” Soto shared before adding, “[His rant] went crazy – like stuff that couldn’t be there, but it was fun.”
To narrow down what they did want to keep, they left the improvised moments in a nearly 3-hour cut of the movie. “On the first friends and family screening, when the movie was like two hours and 40 minutes long, we played the whole thing just to hear the ones that people are laughing and connecting with. So, we left three in it.”
George Lopez as Uncle Rudy absolutely stole every scene he was in. He had my entire theater laughing at every line! pic.twitter.com/0F4jScvt6m — ogbrownnerd (@ogbrownnerd) August 20, 2023
Considering how funny and dynamic Uncle Rudy was in Blue Beetle we wouldn’t mind seeing this extended cut. When asked if it would be released, Soto said, “We should. I should!”
Along with Lopez and Maridueña, Blue Beetle stars Mexican actors like Adriana Barraza, Damián Alcázar, and Elpidia Carrillo. Casting Mexicans was something Soto made a point to do since the family in the movie is portrayed as such.
“They bring their own authentic experiences to the movie, and that helps a lot to inform the conditions we want to put the Reyes family in,” he said. “We want the Reyes family to live in a world that affects their environment, that affects their decisions.”

2023-09-17 13:09:48+00:00,Blue Beetle gets disappointing Max release update,"If you're hoping to stream Blue Beetle on Max in the coming weeks, we have some disappointing news for you as it seems the wait could be a long one.","If you’re hoping to stream Blue Beetle on Max in the coming weeks, we have some disappointing news for you as it seems the wait could be a long one.
We’ll admit, we weren’t expecting Blue Beetle to begin streaming on Max this September. The movie wasn’t on the September streaming release schedule and then there’s the fact that the movie is still under the 60-day theatrical window having only just been released in theaters on August 18. We did, however, think there could be a chance the movie could arrive in early or mid-October but that no longer seems to be the case.
In celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month, Max will look to amplify voices that uplift and inspire & spotlight Latino talent and programming. The celebration will unfold across the month-long celebration which runs from September 15 to October 15, and will highlight Latino content including seven films from their Latino Short Film Competition winners.
There are some amazing titles Max spotlighted in the promotional materials announcing its Hispanic Heritage Month including its new video spot which you can watch below. One title that is notably missing from the highlights is Blue Beetle which broke barriers this summer becoming the first superhero film featuring a Latino-led hero and cast.
Blue Beetle streaming release date predictions
The exclusion of Blue Beetle in the promotional materials for its Hispanic Heritage Month content line-up seems to have confirmed that only will the movie not begin streaming in September, but it likely isn’t coming in October either. Or at least, it won’t be coming in the first half of October.
Recently, Max has been releasing new DC Comics movies in roughly 70 days or less which suggests there is a chance the movie could arrive in late October. This hinted that we could see Blue Beetle stream on Max as early as October 13, but that date no longer seems likely.
If the movie was coming on October 13, there’s no way Max wouldn’t have promoted the movie’s streaming release date as part of its Hispanic Heritage Month celebration. After all, the movie has been celebrated for its Latino representation and would have been the perfect feature title to drop in celebration of Latino creators and talent.
With an early October window seemingly ruled out, it seems like the earliest the movie could arrive on Max would be Oct. 25 as that would put it close to the 70-day mark. However, there is a strong chance Max might look to release the movie sometime in November instead, as a way to give it a major streaming release closer to the Thanksgiving holiday.
September is coming to an end which means we should receive Max’s October release highlights soon. At that time, we’ll have a better idea of whether DC’s latest movie will or will not be coming during the month of October.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vYmFtc21hY2twb3cuY29tLzIwMjMvMDkvMTcvYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtZ2V0cy1kaXNhcHBvaW50aW5nLW1heC1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-28 16:13:38+00:00,Movie Monday: ‘Gran Turismo’ Edges ‘Barbie’,"When the checkered flag fluttered over this weekend’s box-office derby, Gran Turismo beat Barbie and her convertible pink Corvette by the width of a bumper.","It came down to the wire. But when the checkered flag fluttered over this weekend’s box-office derby, Gran Turismo beat Barbie and her convertible pink Corvette by the width of a bumper.
According to domestic box-office estimates, Gran Turismo (based on the real-world success of a video-game race-car driver) squealed into first place with $17.3 million. The film gunned to a quick start, earning anywhere from $3.9 million to $5.3 million (depending on the source) from early showings, then held off the hard-charging Barbie for the win. Gran Turismo tore it up overseas as well, collecting $36.5 million internationally to bring its worldwide tally to $53.8 million.
But don’t imagine that Barbie was shaking her fist at Gran Turismo (a la Sebulba in Tatooine pod races). This entertainment queen still has plenty to smile about. Not only did her movie almost take the trophy in a cloud of pink-colored dust (earning $17.1 million in North America), but it became (earlier last week) the year’s biggest film. Barbie has now earned $594.8 million in North America, running past The Super Mario Bros. Movie for the honor. To think that Mario thought Bowser was his biggest threat: Who knew it’d come from Princess Pink?
Oh, and we’re not done with the doll just yet. Barbie has earned $1.34 billion worldwide, which means it’ll certainly pass Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 to become Warner Bros.’ biggest movie ever. (Barbie’s just about $2 million behind, according to Box Office Mojo, though some sources say Barbie has already sprinted past.)
And that makes this weekend’s box-office results a bit of a good news/bad news situation for Warner Bros. While Barbie continues to make money like Starbucks makes overpriced lattes, Blue Beetle lost 50% of its audience and fell to No. 3. The superhero flick collected $12.8 million in North America, pushing its total earnings to a less-than-super $46.3 million. Blue Beetle was to be the start of a relaunch of Warner Bros.’ DC Universe. But with Blue Beetle getting a bit squashed, that franchise relaunch seems to be on shaky ground.
Oppenheimer continues to blast its way to big box-office gains. It earned another $9 million to finish fourth. Christopher Nolan’s three-hour historical drama has now collected $300 million domestically. And Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem hasn’t gone back into its shell, either. The $6.1 million the film collected didn’t exactly shred the box office, but it was more than enough to finish fifth and buy a few pizzas besides.
Outside Gran Turismo, the weekend’s other newcomers struggled a bit. Retribution, Liam Neeson’s latest action flick, earned $3.3 million to finish eighth. The Hill, Dennis Quaid’s latest foray into Christian films, earned $2.5 million to land in ninth place. And Golda, Helen Mirren’s latest turn as a head of state, banked $1.7 million for 14th.
One final film to make note of: Bottoms—a really harsh-but-heralded R-rated flick, banked just $516,000 to land in 17th place. Hardly something to write home about, right? But here’s the thing: It was playing in just 10 theaters, giving Bottoms a staggering $51,625-per-theater average. That’s more than 10 times what Gran Turismo (which opened in nearly 3,900 theaters) earned per theater. So by some metrics, at least, Bottoms is on top of the box-office food chain.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsdWdnZWRpbi5jb20vYmxvZy9tb3ZpZS1tb25kYXktOC0yOC0yMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,The Humorous History of Blue Beetle and Booster Gold’s DC Comics Friendship,"Blue Beetle and Booster Gold are coming to James Gunn's DCU, so let's explore the complete history of their fun friendships in the comics.","Blue Beetle and Booster Gold are among DC Comics’ myriad of iconic duos. But in contrast to character pairings like Green Lantern and Green Arrow, Hawk and Dove, Icon and Rocket, Batman and Robin, The Flash and Kid Flash, Big Barda and Mister Miracle, and Midnighter and Apollo, Blue Beetle and Booster Gold are two best friends whose DC Comics’ relationship is deeply comedic at its core. As much as they would love for others to take them seriously, this pair is charming because of how little self-awareness they possess. Let’s dig into the friendship story of Blue Beetle and Booster Gold and look at its place in the DC universe.
Dan Jurgens/Ryan Sook
The Origin Stories of Ted Kord’s Blue Beetle and Michael Jon Carter’s Booster Gold
The particular Blue Beetle in the iconic DC Comics friendship with Booster Gold is not Jaime Reyes, who will make his movie debut in the upcoming Blue Beetle movie. Instead, it is actually the second Blue Beetle, Ted Kord, who is friends with Booster Gold in the comics. (The first Blue Beetle was Dan Garret.) Steve Ditko created Ted Kord as a Charlton Comics character in 1966. After he joined the DC Universe in the wake of Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1986, he developed into a squishier version of Marvel’s Iron Man. Like Tony Stark, Ted Kord is the head of a tech company, Kord Industries. He uses the company’s technology to build his own gadgets and superhero gear. But while Tony Stark is a confident womanizer, Blue Beetle Ted Kord is a nervous wallflower.
In contrast, Michael Jon Carter, a.k.a. Booster Gold, is from the 25th century and uses his futuristic tech to be a superhero in the present. While he has a good heart, Booster Gold is incredibly vain and overconfident. Created in 1986 by Dan Jurgens, Carter/Booster Gold is a satirical look at superheroism under capitalism.
When Did Booster Gold and Blue Beetle Become Friends in DC’s Comics?
Ted Kord’s Blue Beetle and Michael Jon Carter’s Booster Gold became friends after Carter joined the newly formed Justice League in its “Justice League International” era in the late 1980s. The team got its name from the fact that they were not based out of the Hall of Justice anymore, but out of an embassy in New York City. The Justice League had satellite teams based around the world, including Justice League Europe and even the Justice League Antarctica.
J.M. DeMatteis/Keith Giffen/Kevin Maguire/Joe Rubinstein
Justice League International reimagined DC’s flagship superhero team as a workplace comedy. It was about ordinary people caught in the trap of late-stage capitalism under Ronald Reagan. Blue Beetle and Booster Gold’s friendship was emblematic of this idea. Writer J.M. DeMatteis and artists Kevin Maguire and Keith Giffen were a dynamite creative team, capable of hitting comedic beats in the throes of action sequences. Even though its members included an alien (Martian Manhunter), two New Gods (Mister Miracle and his wife Big Barda), and an ever-grumpy Batman, the JLI’s problems were refreshingly down to Earth. This team worried about filing their taxes, argued over the merits of Sylvester Stallone’s filmography, and expressed their disdain for yuppies.
Why Booster Gold and Blue Beetle’s Friendship Works
Within the events of Justice League International, it was logical for Blue Beetle and Booster Gold to become fast friends. Booster was good-looking and a former a college football player. However, neither he nor Beetle fit the bill for perfect superhero men. Ted startled easily, was reluctant to get his hands dirty in combat, cracked jokes at inopportune times, and would awkwardly try to ask out his crush, Wonder Woman. Booster, on the other hand, loved the spotlight of being a superhero. But he was ill-equipped to thrive as a normal person in the 20th century.
Ty Templeton/Keith Giffen
Where Booster Gold was assertive, Blue Beetle was timid, and where Beetle was prudent, Booster was impulsive. Under DeMatteis’ pen, Booster Gold and Blue Beetle’s friendship blossomed organically, as the two tried to make being a superhero a financially viable career. Later on, Justice League International got a new title, Justice League America, and Booster Gold and Blue Beetle were active members into the 1990s.
The Death of Ted Kord, Booster Gold’s Guilt, and the Rise of Jamie Reyes, a New Blue Beetle
In the 2000s, Blue Beetle and Booster Gold’s friendship took a much darker turn. Blue Beetle was murdered by his former Justice League International teammate, Maxwell Lord, in the lead-up to DC’s Infinite Crisis event in 2005. Later on, Booster blamed himself for failing to protect Beetle. The DC Universe was not without a Blue Beetle for long, though, as Jaime Reyes debuted during Infinite Crisis.
Jaime Reyes signaled a different direction for the Blue Beetle mantle. Reyes was a teenager and not a CEO like Ted Kord. Likewise, Booster Gold went his own path, taking on a much more significant role in the DC Universe’s time stream. His 2007 solo series by Geoff Johns and Jeff Katz would eventually lead into the 2011 Flashpoint storyline. This came after the revelation that Booster was the father of the time traveler, Rip Hunter.
Ted Kord Returns and Their Friendship Goes to a New Level
Fortunately, with the relaunch of the DC Universe in 2016, Ted Kord’s Blue Beetle came back to life after making sparse appearances during DC’s New 52 era. The series Heroes in Crisis by Tom King and Clay Mann revealed the extent to which Booster helped Beetle with his trauma as a superhero. Issue four of the series had a therapy-focused take on superhero comics. In it, Beetle explained how Booster has always been there for him and the difference that made in his life. Beetle’s character went through dark moments, like dying at the hands of someone he once trusted. But Heroes in Crisis was a rare moment where Ted Kord broke his usual comedic façade to speak candidly.
Tom King/Clay Mann/Tomeu Morey
Most recently, Blue Beetle and Booster Gold’s friendship was explored at length in the 2021 series, Blue and Gold, by Dan Jurgens and Ryan Sook. The series followed the two buddies as they opened their own small business, Blue and Gold Restoration, after the Justice League turned them down. Booster became a content creator, livestreaming his and Beetle’s superhero activities. He hoped to build an audience that would make them A-list heroes again. The livestream comments peppered throughout the book make it clear that Blue and Gold are still seen as jokes outside of their small but loyal fanbase.
In Blue and Gold, Booster repeatedly referred to Beetle as his “sidekick,” which became a source of conflict between the two of them. Beetle acknowledged that he lacked self-confidence and that Booster’s over-confident nature was enough for both of them. However, their partnership needed to be equal. By the end of the series, the two friends had reconciled their differences, underscoring what makes them so lovable.
The Continued Pairing and Possible Future for Booster Gold and Blue Beetle in the DCU
Booster Gold turned Blue Beetle into a bonafide comedic pillar of the DC Universe. Despite Ted’s anxious personality and bouts of angst, his friendship with Booster Gold pushes him to be a braver superhero. Likewise, Booster’s friendship with Beetle has elevated him beyond being a precise observation about a historical moment in time. Booster and Beetle have a unique sense of platonic male intimacy in superhero comics. Their devotion to each other is an inspiring sight for many readers. Now, Blue Beetle and Booster Gold are coming to James Gunn’s DCU. The Blue Beetle movie and Booster Gold TV show will hopefully lead to a live-action friendship in the future.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbmVyZGlzdC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90aGUtY29tcGxldGUtZGMtY29taWNzLWhpc3Rvcnktb2YtYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtYW5kLWJvb3N0ZXItZ29sZC1mcmllbmRzaGlwLWRjdS1mdXR1cmUv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXJkaXN0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RoZS1jb21wbGV0ZS1kYy1jb21pY3MtaGlzdG9yeS1vZi1ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1hbmQtYm9vc3Rlci1nb2xkLWZyaWVuZHNoaXAtZGN1LWZ1dHVyZS8_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

Including Blue Beetle, Bottoms and Red, White & Royal Blue – Nicholas Barber lists this month's unmissable movies to watch.
Universal Studios
1. Strays
In Josh Greenbaum's live-action / CGI comedy, Will Ferrell provides the voice of Reggie, a border terrier who gets lost in the city, and meets some other dogs, including a Boston terrier (Jamie Foxx), an Australian shepherd (Isla Fisher) and a great Dane (Randall Park), who help him find his way home to his master, Doug (Will Forte). Sounds sweet, doesn't it? The twist is that Strays isn't for children. Unlike the characters in most talking-animal films, these ones swear at each other and get up to all sorts of other antics which account for the film's R rating in the US. ""It's really very funny but emotionally grounded,"" Greenbaum told Tamera Jones at Collider. ""It's a film about relationships, unhealthy, toxic relationships, how we deal with them, how we found our own self-worth, how our friends play into that."" But mostly it's about dogs swearing at each other.
On general release from 17 August
Amazon
2. Red, White & Royal Blue
An on-and-off transatlantic affair between a posh Brit and a free-spirited American? So far, so Richard Curtis. The key difference in Red, White & Royal Blue is that both the Brit and the American are men. Adapted from Casey McQuiston's novel – a BookTok sensation – this romantic comedy revolves around Alex (Taylor Zakhar Perez), the son of the US president (Uma Thurman), and Prince Henry (Nicholas Galitzine), the grandson of the British king (Stephen Fry). Its director is Matthew López, who won a Tony for his play, The Inheritance. ""I never imagined I'd read a book with a queer Latine character at the centre – a character who is smart and passionate and flawed and hopeful,"" López told Anna Moeslein at Glamour. ""I think having this book in my life when I was younger might have made it a little easier. I knew immediately that I wanted to bring it to the screen.""
Released internationally on Prime Video on 11 Aug
MGM
3. Bottoms
Emma Seligman and Rachel Sennott, director and star of 2021's Shiva Baby, reunite for another outrageous comedy, although this one features a lot more black eyes and broken noses. Sennott and Ayo Edebiri (The Bear) play two queer best friends who are tired of being the most unpopular people in their high school. Their plan is to start a self-defence class in the gym, mainly to attract cheerleaders, but it soon becomes a brutal fight club. ""Ready for American Pie to look tame?"" says Kristy Puchko at Mashable. ""With Bottoms, Seligman and Sennott, who co-wrote the screenplay, reveal a story that is way wilder, way wackier, and way, way more gay than the typical teen sex comedy churned out by Hollywood... Bottoms is not only riotously entertaining but also sure to establish itself as a queer, chaotic landmark among its iconic predecessors.""
Released on 25 August in the US and Canada

4. Blue Beetle
In DC's latest superhero extravaganza, Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña from Cobra Kai) becomes the host of the Scarab, an alien gadget that turns into a suit of high-tech armour, and puts him into conflict with the villainous Carapax (Raoul Max Trujillo). The trailer might make Blue Beetle look too close to Iron Man for comfort, but this is the first superhero blockbuster to have a Mexican lead character, several scenes with Spanish dialogue, and a largely Latino cast and crew (including a Puerto Rican director, Angel Manuel Soto). ""The only thing that is on my mind right now is just the fact that he's Latino,"" Maridueña told Variety when he was cast. ""I have so much pride in getting to be a part of this project with Ángel [Manuel Soto]... I don't want to stand on the soapbox for too long, but representation is so important.""
On general release from 18 August
SBS Production
5. Passages
Ira Sachs (Love Is Strange, Little Men) moves from the US to France for his latest nuanced romantic drama. Co-written with frequent collaborator Mauricio Zacharias, Passages sketches a jagged love triangle, although how much actual love is involved is open to question. Its narcissistic anti-hero is Tomas (Franz Rogowski), a German director working in Paris, who tries to juggle his husband Martin (Ben Whishaw) and his girlfriend Agathe (Adèle Exarchopoulos). With ""a streak of caustic humour and a cool, bristling intensity... Passages may not be Sachs' best, but it's his boldest,"" says Jon Frosch in The Hollywood Reporter. ""The writer-director packs more incident, life and unassuming complexity into 90 minutes than most filmmakers muster in twice that run time.""

6. King on Screen
Stephen King might not write screenplays, but he is still one of the most significant writers in cinema history. Beginning with Carrie, Brian de Palma's 1976 film of his first novel, more than 80 films and TV series have been based on King's books and short stories, including such beloved horror movies as The Shining, Pet Sematary and It, and plenty of major works in other genres, including Stand by Me and The Shawshank Redemption. In Daphné Baiwir's documentary, several of the directors who have adapted King's books discuss the idea that his relatable characters and small-town settings are just as important as the monsters that beset them. ""While it obviously helps if you're familiar with his body of work,"" says Louisa Moore at Screen Zealots, ""King on Screen is an enjoyable and informative documentary with plenty for the uninitiated to savour.""

7. Fremont
Fremont, California is home to around 30,000 people of Afghan descent. This film, named after the city, follows Donya (newcomer Anaita Wali Zada), who feels alienated and alone. A young woman who worked as a translator for the US government in Afghanistan, she is stricken by insomnia and guilt about leaving her family behind. But Babak Jalali's low-budget, black-and-white comedy drama offers Donya some hope when she opens up to her therapist (Gregg Turkington), and gets a job writing the messages for Chinese fortune cookies in nearby San Francisco. ""It's an intimate dramedy that strikes a delicate balance between melancholy and wryness,"" says Hannah Strong in Little White Lies, ""Fremont is a stylish, sweet evolution for Jalali, and a poignant reflection on the modern immigrant experience.""

Gal Gadot in Heart of Stone
8. Heart of Stone
There is no shortage of spectacular action movies about globe-trotting secret agents, but, even now, almost all of those secret agents are men. Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) wants to change that. Intended as the first film in a franchise, Heart of Stone features Gadot as Rachel Stone, a spy who must stop a powerful device, the Heart, from falling into enemy hands. (Yes, really: the device is called the Heart, the heroine is called Stone, and the film is called Heart of Stone.) ""The thing that Gal and [producers at] Skydance spoke about a lot was they wanted Rachel to be a character that wasn't just a female actress playing a sort of male character, but a woman at the heart of it who was responding differently,"" the film's director, Tom Harper, told Sydney Bucksbaum at EW, going on to describe how the character's humanity was central to the film. ""She has emotions, she finds things difficult. It's not straightforward. The relationships were real and there was always a sort of emotional reality all the way through.""

9. Dreamin' Wild
Bill Pohlad's Love & Mercy told the bittersweet story of the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson, with Paul Dano as the young Brian, and John Cusack as his middle-aged self. Pohlad's directorial follow-up is another unconventional rock'n'roll biopic with a similar back-and-forth structure and casting technique: Noah Jupe and Jack Dylan Grazer play the teenage Don and Joe Emerson, who record an album on their family farm in 1979. Unlike the Beach Boys, though, they never hit the big time. Their music didn't become popular for 30 years, by which time they are played by Casey Affleck and Walton Goggins. Is the brothers' belated success a dream come true, or a crushing reminder of the lives they could have had? Dreamin' Wild is ""another moving tale of personal and artistic redemption"", says Marshall Shaffer at Playlist. ""Pohlad deals in people, not legacies or iconographies. He's rooted in hardscrabble humanity, not the heightened stakes of hagiography.""

10. White Bird
Adapted from RJ Palacio's hit novel, Wonder (2017) was a drama about Auggie (Jacob Tremblay), a boy who was bullied at school because of his facial deformity. White Bird is the sequel, but it isn't the sequel you might expect. Rather than continuing Auggie's story, it follows Julian (Bryce Gheisar), one of the boys who bullied him. And rather than focusing on Julian, it has Julian's grandmother (Helen Mirren) recounting her memories of being hidden from the Nazis as a Jewish-French schoolgirl during World War Two. The film is directed by Marc Forster (A Man Called Otto, Finding Neverland, Quantum of Solace). ""Sometimes life brings us the rare and beautiful possibility to inspire and uplift the human spirit through the act of storytelling,"" Forster told Matt Grobar at Deadline, ""and it is my heartfelt hope that this film will do just that. White Bird is a story about the power of kindness and its ability to grow exponentially once set free.""

2023-08-20 19:09:00+00:00,"‘Oppenheimer’ Rises To $718M Global, ‘Barbie’ Basks In $1.28B, ‘Meg 2’ Chomps Past $300M; ‘Blue Beetle’ Scurries To $18M Overseas Start – International Box Office","This weekend saw milestones for Oppenheimer and Meg 2, continued success for Barbie and local-language movies as well as the entry of Blue Beetle","UPDATED: It’s been another very busy weekend at the international box office with milestones and great holds, as well as a new entry and local-language movies adding to the mix.
Coming off of a record-breaking debut in Korea, Christopher Nolan and Universal’s Oppenheimer led the overseas frame for the studios with a $32M session in 80 markets, pushing the global cume well past $700M, as we noted would be the case yesterday.
Warner Bros, meanwhile, has a lot going on. Barbie added $26.7M in 75 markets to lift worldwide to a high-heeled $1.279B. The studio’s China coproduction Meg 2: The Trench has now crossed $300M global, and its new offering, DC’s Blue Beetle landed within the expected range, bowing to $18M from 63 overseas markets.
At the same time, there is action aplenty for local titles in China and India (see more below).
Starting with the new studio entry this weekend, Warner Bros/DC’s Blue Beetle scurried to an $18M opening in 63 markets, landing within the range we were hearing ahead of the weekend. In those starts, the Xolo Maridueña-starrer was No. 1 in 17. Combined with domestic, the global debut is $43.4M.
Regionally, Blue Beetle, from director Ángel Manuel Soto, was tops in Latin America, surpassing the debuts of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves by 27% and DC comp The Suicide Squad by 26%. The film was also the No. 1 title in many Asia markets, including Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan, Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam. Western Europe was mixed, although France and Italy overperformed.
Breaking it down, Mexico was the top play at $2.7M, a No. 1 launch over the above comps and 478% ahead of the recent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (the market may have been impacted by Hurricane Hilary). Brazil grossed $2.1M at open, No. 1 on par with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and 42% over The Suicide Squad. France and the UK both took $1.5M – the former on par with The Suicide Squad and well ahead of TMNTMM, and the latter in line with Into the Spider-Verse on a weekend impacted by good weather and the women’s World Cup final. Rounding out the Top 5 openers, Indonesia bowed to $1.2M, dominating at 55% share of the market, above Into the Spider-Verse by 50%, The Suicide Squad by 964% and TMNTMM by over 2K%.
There are still 12 markets to come, including the Middle East this week and Australia in September.
Looking at the holdovers, Oppenheimer, as we reported yesterday, crossed $700M globally on Saturday, now with an estimated $717.8M through today. Just five weeks into release, it’s the 4th highest grossing Nolan film ever worldwide, having overtaken Interstellar. Oppenheimer is also the 4th biggest film of 2023 globally behind The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Barbie and Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3
The current international frame is eyed at $32M in 80 markets for a $432.6M offshore cume to date. This is Nolan’s top film of all time at the international box office when restated to today’s dollars and excluding un-released markets.
The Cillian Murphy-led epic is the biggest Nolan film ever in 51 markets.
Korea had a fantastic debut, breaking records on Tuesday as the biggest Nolan launch day and the biggest Hollywood opening day of the year. The 6-day opening weekend of $12.6 million is the second biggest opening weekend for a Nolan film (only behind The Dark Knight Rises), the biggest Hollywood drama opening of all time and the 3rd biggest Hollywood start of the year. The standard 4-day weekend is well above Inception, almost double The Dark Knight and more than double Tenet – and in a competitive environment, to boot. It has already surpassed the lifetime of No Time To Die.
Also notable, the UK is now at $63.9M, performing in line with The Dark Knight Rises and Dunkirk. The $13M IMAX portion of that has exceeded Avatar: The Way of Water to become the No. 2 IMAX title ever in the market, behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
Germany has cumed $39.5M, France is at $31.2M, Australia has grossed $22.9M and Netherlands had a great hold at No. 1 (down just 28%) with a $16.1M cume through Sunday.
The IMAX global cume is $146.4M, now the 5th highest grossing IMAX title ever. For perspective, the Top 4 IMAX movies each earned over $2B in lifetime worldwide box office (Avatar, Avatar: The Way Of Water, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Avengers: Endgame) whereas Oppenheimer is currently at the aforementioned $718M.
Internationally, the IMAX cume is $65.6M, good for Nolan’s best result ever in the format and the No. 7 biggest ever (No. 3 in like-for-like markets behind Avatar 1&2).
Italy and Greece open Oppenheimer this week, with China set for August 30.
The living doll that is Barbie is also continuing to show great strength. The 5th frame added $26.7M from 75 markets for a 42% drop. The overseas cume is now $711.9M with $1.279B global.
Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie have delivered the 2nd biggest movie ever for WB globally and the 5th best internationally. This is the studio’s highest-grosser in 30 markets including the UK, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and Poland.
Barbie’s Top 5 overseas markets through Sunday are the UK ($109.6M), Mexico ($53.2M), Australia ($51.1M), Germany ($47.4M) and Brazil ($43M).
Also from WB, Meg 2: The Trench had a meaty $21.9M third frame in 76 markets. The international running total now stands at $250.1M and the global cume to date is currently $316.6M. China is leading all play with $106.3M thus far, followed by Mexico ($18.3M), the UK ($12.5M), France ($9.9M) and Spain ($9.8M). Japan is still to release on August 25.
Sony’s Gran Turismo: Based on a True Story took a sophomore lap of $6.3M, down a slight 37% in the small first wave of 34 offshore markets as it looks to build word of mouth ahead of wider rollout. The overseas total is $22.7M to date. Notable holds include the UAE (+36%), Kuwait (-12%), Qatar (-16%), Saudi Arabia (-29%) and France (-29%). Still to release are Brazil and Mexico next week, and China, Japan, Italy and Korea in September.
Paramount/Skydance’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One ran up another $6.2M in 67 markets with a 45% drop. The offshore cume on the Tom Cruise-starrer is now $376.4M with $541M globally. Japan continues to race along at No. 1, now with a $31.5M cume, just under the UK which is at $32.3M to date.
Disney/Pixar’s Elemental fired up another $5.9M in 51 markets, lifting the overseas cume to $307.2M and global to $458.3M. The international weekend hold was -37%. Korea leads all play at a total $52.4M, followed by the UK ($20.8M), Mexico ($20.7M), France ($20.7M) and China ($15.9M).
In local titles, after a stellar start last frame, India’s Gadar 2 added an estimated $13.3M (the 2nd best 2nd weekend ever for a Bollywood title), for a $54M cume (448 crore) to date. It’s currently the No. 4 Bollywood movie ever in India, behind Pathaan, Dangal and PK. Also in its sophomore session, Jailer added an estimated $7.25M for a local cume of $40M.
China’s No More Bets anted up another estimated $65M, leading to a local running total of $376M. Maoyan currently has the Super Lion title reaching a final of $520M+. Getting there would make it the No. 3 movie of the year in the market. The IMAX cume is $9.7M. With this weekend, 2023 officially becomes IMAX’s biggest local-language year ever at $184M and with over four months still to go.

James Gunn has cleared up a point of confusion surrounding the recasting of Henry Cavill as Superman.
Cavill had played the role of the Kryptonian superhero in several DC comics films, including Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Justice League.
Despite the actor reprising the role for a recent cameo in The Flash , it was confirmed last year that Cavill would be replaced in the DC universe going forward.
The decision was said to have rested with Guardians of the Galaxy directorJames Gunn, who along with producer Peter Safran was appointed co-chairman and co-CEO of DC Studios last year.
In June, Gunn announced that the role of Superman would be played in the forthcoming Superman: Legacy by The Politician star David Corenswet. The film is set to come out in cinemas in 2025.
Gunn had initially written that Cavill was being recast because Superman: Legacy was set to focus on a younger version of the character.
“In the initial stages, our story will be focusing on an earlier part of Superman’s life, so the character will not be played by Henry Cavill,” he wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter).
However, this week, Gunn issued a clarification on the social media platform Threads, after a question from a fan concerning the recent DC release Blue Beetle.
“So in Blue Beetle at least in the commercial Jaime knows who Superman is, and you’ve said Blue Beetle is in your DCU,” they asked. “So is your young Superman movie set in the past?”

“I was never making a ‘young Superman’ movie, just a Superman movie!” Gunn responded.
Henry Cavill as Superman (Warner Bros)
As well as producing the film, Gunn is also set to direct Superman: Legacy. Rachel Brosnahan will star alongside Corenswet as Lois Lane.
Superman is the second major role Cavill has stepped down from in recent months, with the Mission: Impossible – Fallout star also standing down from the Netflix fantasy series The Witcher.
Cavill had played the lead role of demon slayer Geralt of Rivia in three seasons of the popular fantasy series. He will be replaced by The Hunger Games star Liam Hemsworth.
Fans effusively praised Cavill’s performance in his final episodes, with many lamenting the actor’s exit.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL2FydHMtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9maWxtcy9uZXdzL2phbWVzLWd1bm4tc3VwZXJtYW4tZGN1LWJsdWUtYmVldGxlLWIyMzk2NDUxLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

2023-08-23 21:59:48+00:00,"DC Drops Bombshell, Kills Most Recent Movie While Still in Cinemas - Inside the Magic",Warner Bros Discovery are actively taking steps to kill their latest movie in theaters due to underwhelming box office numbers.,"In the wake of the Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) merger last year, there were some significant organizational shifts resulting in the replacement of Walter Hamada, the former head of DC. Subsequently, WBD acquired James Gunn, the esteemed Marvel director recognized for his work on the Guardians of the Galaxy series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), who was then appointed as the fresh leader of DC Studios, alongside Peter Safran.
It’s noteworthy that Gunn possessed prior experience within the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), now rebranded as the DC Universe (DCU), having directed films like The Suicide Squad (2021) — notably distinct from the earlier Suicide Squad (2016) starring Jared Leto as the Joker. Currently, DC Studios is reportedly embarking on a totally unique endeavor — allegedly completely different from the offerings of Marvel Studios.
As part of the DC Universe’s (DCU) new Chapter One – Gods and Monsters, James Gunn is gearing up for a significant “reboot” of the former DCEU, aiming to start anew. Presently, the focus centers on DCU’s inaugural film, Superman: Legacy, already penned by Gunn just prior to the Writers Guild of America/WGA strike that’s now impacting Hollywood. The plot details of Superman: Legacy remain mostly under wraps, but what’s clear is that it will portray a younger Clark Kent as he navigates his role as Superman. Speculation regarding the casting of the titular Superman/Clark Kent and his partner Lois Lane created a buzz for a while, until recently when it was unveiled that David Corenswet (Hollywood) and Rachel Brosnahan (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel) would respectively assume these roles.
DC’s Doomed Blue Beetle
In the groundbreaking Latino culture-centric superhero film Blue Beetle (2023), Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña), a recent law school graduate, takes a job under Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) to save his family’s home. Tasked with protecting the Scarab, a cosmic weapon, Jaime inadvertently bonds with the Scarab, and becomes the mighty Blue Beetle, gaining the powers to counter Victoria’s sinister plot and save the world.
The film’s ensemble includes Adriana Barraza as Nana, Damián Alcázar as Alberto Reyes, Elpidia Carrillo as Rocio Reyes, Bruna Marquezine as Jenny Kord, and Raoul Max Trujillo as Ignacio Carapax / OMAC. The story unfolds as Jaime navigates his newfound abilities, confronts Victoria Kord’s ambitions, and ultimately becomes the hero the world needs.
DC Studios Actively Killing off Own Movie
The year 2023 has posed significant challenges for DC Comics properties at the box office. With the official end of the Justice League Snyderverse helmed by Zack Snyder, Shazam! Fury of the Gods (2023) was the first significant setback for the studio since WBD reshuffled DC Studios. Preceding this was another DC flop, Black Adam (2022) (AKA the infamous Dwayne Johnson passion project). This was followed closely by an even larger box office disappointment, The Flash (2023), which similarly fell short of meeting DC fans’ expectations.
Now, DC Studios has recently dropped some news that caused a fair amount of fan uproar.
Twitter (now X) user @NicholasPas5 posted the following reaction to The Hollywood Handle’s shocking news from DC Studios — that Warner Bros. Discovery have already announced the date that Blue Beetle will go digital. Nicholas is astonished, believing that WBD are actively sabotaging their own film with a move like this — seeing as the film merely came out last Thursday:
The movie came out LAST THURSDAY and already has a digital release date… WB what are you doing??? The Hollywood Handle (quoted): ‘BLUE BEETLE’ hits digital platforms on September 19. Find out what other movies are releasing on digital next month: http://bit.ly/DSep23

Users like @SpiritDiveRamon were shocked, reminding everyone that the movie was not even out around the world — referencing Disney’s Pixar Animation Studios sleeper hit, Elemental (2023), which turned its box office performance around after sticking it out in theaters throughout the summer:
Ramon: Movie not even out around the world, and did they not learn anything from elemental Nicholas: This could be a sleeper hit if they just let it try and gain some legs at the box office, now this is just telling ppl to wait a month

This definitely sounds like DC Studios is more or less sounding the death knell for the severely underrated film.
Do you think DC Studios is making a mistake by announcing Blue Beetle‘s digital release already? Share your thoughts in the comments below!
The DC Universe (or DCU) is owned by Warner Bros Discovery, and originally termed the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). Previously, the DCEU was more or less helmed by Zack Snyder, whose popular “Snyderverse” Justice League (2017) had its fair share of fans. Finished by Marvel alum Joss Whedon, which consists of Superman/Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), Wonder Woman/Diana Prince (Gal Gadot), Batman/Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck), Aquaman/Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa), The Flash/Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) and Cyborg/Victor Stone (Ray Fisher). The DCU is now run by ex-Marvel director James Gunn, writer and director of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, in conjunction with Peter Safran. Based on the DC Comic world, the new reboot of the DC Universe under Gunn is set about to begin, with anything from the comic books — everything from Superman (and upcoming Superman Legacy), to Lex Luthor, and even the Green Lantern, or Black Adam — about to be reshaped for the new DCU.
Upcoming DC Comic-inspired movies include Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023) by director James Wan and Joker: Folie á Deux (2024) starring Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn and Joaquin Phoenix as the eponymous Joker.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbWFnaWMubmV0LzIwMjMvMDgvZGMtYm9tYnNoZWxsLWtpbGxzLW1vdmllLXdoaWxlLXN0aWxsLWluLWNpbmVtYXMtYWYxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,How BLUE BEETLE’s OMAC Could Tie Into the DCU’s Future,Blue Beetle's introduction of OMAC and its DC Comics ties to Superman and the Authority could lead to its inclusion in James Gunn's DCU.,"With James Gunn and Peter Safran’s DC Universe on the horizon, one Blue Beetle character could provide the connective tissue between the previous studio regime and the future that’s to come: OMAC. The film introduced OMAC—an acronym for “One Man Army Corps”—as a technological enhancement for the villain Carapax (Raoul Trujillo). It was featured as an armored exoskeleton that could be implanted into the spines of ordinary humans. It then turns them into bulky weapons of war. Blue Beetle (Xolo Maridueña) and his family and friends destroyed the OMACs at Kord Industries. However, the OMAC mythos is too big and too promising to be contained in one film. A film about DC’s Authority is in development and OMAC could tie the emergent threads of the DC Universe together.
The Origin Story and Purpose of the First OMAC, Explained
Jack Kirby/Mike Royer
The original OMAC first appeared in Jack Kirby and Mike Royer’s OMAC #1 (1974). We meet Buddy Blank, a mild-mannered office-worker chosen by an omnipotent peace-keeping agency to become OMAC. Using an enormous eye-shaped satellite called Brother Eye, the peace-keeping agency imbued Blank with superhuman strength, speed, and durability. He also got a costume reminiscent of the Greek god of war, Ares, complete with a decorative fin.
From the very beginning of OMAC’s history, the character focused on the relationship between technology and the human body. In the beginning pages of his first issue, OMAC muses, “Where does humanity stop and technology begin? We no longer know…”
Seeing how much Blue Beetle explores the connections between Jaime Reyes and the Scarab, OMAC is a natural point of comparison for the protagonist.
OMAC, Superman, and the Authority’s DC Comics Relationship
Grant Morrison/Mikel Janín/Travis Foreman/Jordie Bellaire/Alex Sinclair/Steve Wands
OMAC could be an essential part of the DCU because of a relationship with a team on the horizon: the Authority. The Authority is traditionally made up of members like Apollo, Midnighter, and Jack Hawksmoor. In the nineties, The Authority was the edgy alternative to the Justice League. Their members were flawed and disinterested in being the model of heroism for anyone.
But recently, The Authority’s lineup and purpose got a new reimagining in print form. Grant Morrison and Mikel Janín’s 2021 series, Superman and the Authority, debuted a new OMAC as a team member. This OMAC, nicknamed “Mac,” is distinct from Buddy Blank’s iteration of the character as well as the militaristic vision of OMAC presented in Blue Beetle.
Warner Bros.
Blank’s OMAC suit includes a warlike fin and eye insignia. Conversely, Mac dons a pink mohawk hairstyle and pink facial marking shaped like an eye on his forehead. When Mac introduces himself to Superman and the rest of the new Authority team, he mentions that he uses he/him and they/them pronouns. Mac’s OMAC suit includes heavy armor. It works by him verbally commanding how much power he wants to use on a scale of one to ten. Mac is from Earth 9, and is in love with Earth 9’s version of Lightray. This makes him a character from DC’s multiverse.
Because of Mac’s uniqueness, as well as his comic book ties to the characters in future film projects involving the Authority and Superman, he presents a striking opportunity to strengthen this emergent lore in the DC Universe. This new OMAC has shaped the course of Superman’s mythology over the past two years in DC Comics.
We see their journey in the Warworld Saga arc, spanning principally Action Comics #1029-1036 and Superman: Warworld Apocalypse by Phillip Kennedy Johnson, Daniel Sampere, Riccardo Federici, David Lapham, and more. Along with the rest of Superman’s new Authority team, Mac went to Warworld, a desolate gladiatorial planet ruled by the tyrant, Mongul, in order to liberate the people trapped there. The Warworld Saga laid the foundation for a new era for Superman and redefined the Authority within DC’s status quo.
The Future of OMAC in James Gunn’s DCU
Grant Morrison/Mikel Janín/Travis Foreman/Jordie Bellaire/Alex Sinclair/Steve Wands
James Gunn said the comic book influences for the new DC Universe includes stories written by Grant Morrison. These include stories such as All-Star Superman and their Batman run. Morrison’s Superman and Batman work is setting the stage for two pillars of the DC Universe. Therefore, it isn’t a stretch to wonder if Superman and the Authority’s OMAC will make an appearance in Superman: Legacy or The Authority as a member of the team. There is no way of knowing if another OMAC was already operating outside of Palmera City in Blue Beetle. And we also don’t know if there is one like Mac existing someplace else within the multiverse.
Grant Morrison explored the multiverse heavily in works like The Multiversity. So fans will have to wait and see if this element is adapted into the DC Universe. Featuring OMAC in the Authority’s team would cultivate a greater sense of cohesion between Blue Beetle and the future DCU. Mac’s version of OMAC in The Authority would be relatively accessible to newcomers, even if they don’t know much about this collective.
OMAC’s thematic focus on the hybridity between technology and the human body is relevant to today’s world and era of superheroes. It would be a huge missed opportunity if OMAC is just a one-off character. From everything that James Gunn and Peter Safran have revealed about the new DCU, it’s clear that the franchise will pull from the lore from DC Comics. OMAC is a powerful example of the creativity in DC’s superhero comics and it’s time to bring it into full focus.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL25lcmRpc3QuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtZmlsbS1vbWFjLWNvdWxkLXRpZS1pbnRvLWphbWVzLWd1bm4tZGN1LWZ1dHVyZS1zdXBlcm1hbi1sZWdhY3ktdGhlLWF1dGhvcml0eS1jb21pYy1oaXN0b3J5L9IBhwFodHRwczovL25lcmRpc3QuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtZmlsbS1vbWFjLWNvdWxkLXRpZS1pbnRvLWphbWVzLWd1bm4tZGN1LWZ1dHVyZS1zdXBlcm1hbi1sZWdhY3ktdGhlLWF1dGhvcml0eS1jb21pYy1oaXN0b3J5Lz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

According to studio estimates, 'Barbie' has made $572.3 million at the American box office as of Wednesday
NEW YORK -- ""Barbie"" is now within striking distance of becoming the highest-grossing movie at the domestic box office this year, taking the crown away from ""Super Mario Bros."" CNN reported.
According to studio estimates, ""Barbie"" has made $572.3 million at the American box office as of Wednesday, edging closer to Mario's domestic haul of $574.2 million.
It's likely that ""Barbie,"" based on the iconic doll, will officially snatch the title from the video game adaptation, ""Super Mario Bros."" on Thursday, when Wednesday's box office results are released.

Since premiering July 21, ""Barbie"" has broken numerous records. The film made $155 million domestically in its opening weekend, making it the largest opening weekend of the year and the biggest-ever debut for a female director.

It also placed director Greta Gerwig as the highest-grossing woman movie director in history.

The movie's reign of sitting at the top of the box office came to an end last weekend, when ""Blue Beetle"" unseated ""Barbie."" The newest DC superhero film grossed an estimated $25.4 million, while ""Barbie"" slipped to second, bringing in $21.5 million, according to studio estimates.

,Blue Beetle: 9B Collective Details Creative Process Behind Bringing Jaime Reyes's Suit to Life (Exclusive),Uwandi and Boutté created the concept art that eventually birthed Blue Beetle's costume.,"From the first set pictures of Xolo Maridueña donning the scarab-based suit, fans were confident that Blue Beetle would do the popular comic character justice. This past August's DC Studios release tells the story of Jaime Reyes (Maridueña), the third incarnation of Blue Beetle. Reyes is a fairly young character in the grand scheme, first debuting on the comic page in 2006, but has quickly cemented himself as the modern face of the rotating superhero mantle. The Reyes iteration of Blue Beetle has popped up in cartoon shows like Batman: The Brave and the Bold as well as video games such as Injustice 2.

When his live-action movie came around, many were thrilled to see that Maridueña's costume essentially leaped straight from the comic. While the physical creation of that suit is attributed to costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo, the concept creds go to 9B Collective.

This concept art studio is the brainchild of Phillip Boutté Jr. (costume department, Black Panther), Mike Uwandi (costume illustrator, The Book of Boba Fett), and Aldis Hodge (actor, Black Adam). All three men have dozens of individual credits to their resumes, but Blue Beetle represents their first project as 9B Collective.

Bringing 9B Collective's Creative Flavor to Blue Beetle

Speaking to ComicBook.com, 9B Collective's Mike Uwandi and Phillip Boutté Jr. detailed their unique creative process when it came to bringing Blue Beetle to live-action life.

""We want to modernize what was already existing,"" Uwandi said. ""We really wanted to help build the world but make sure that it was able to stand out amongst the many comic book projects that are out there. One of the cool things with (director) Angel [Manuel Soto] is that he's really into pop culture. He's into things like anime. He's into the comic books as well and brings his own cultural aspects to it. We wanted to find a way to meld all of those things together.""

""You start with the source material and you respect it because that's why you're here,"" Boutté said. ""I think that one thing that happens sometimes is people lose perspective of the fact that the reason this property ever got to you in the first place is there's already a fan base and it's big enough to garner enough attention to be made into a film. You can't forget that. You have to pay tribute to that. You have to honor it.""

Blue Beetle's suit is much more than just a direct translation from the page to the screen. As Boutté noted, the costume is infused with subtleties that he hopes elicits a thought-provoking reaction with viewers a la not understanding a laugh.

""After the movie you'd say, 'What was that joke and why was it funny?' You have to go back and research and learn something new,"" Boutté said. ""We tried to do that visually as well and tried to put in little cues. If you look at Blue Beetle's face, it's inspired by Lucha Libre masks and things of that nature.""

What made its way to the 127-minute film was just a small taste of what Uwandi and Boutté played with during Blue Beetle's early development.

""There were plenty of things that were cut, but we know that eventually they'll probably be seen if there's a sequel or something like that,"" Uwandi said. ""There was a lot that was cut. We loved a lot of the different designs, but at the same time, I think that they picked all the best ones.""

""There were also little cues in there. The Ted Kord mannequin is missing a suit and it has a pillow attached to it to hint at Fat Ted,"" Boutté added. ""He's gotten a little overweight. There's a lot of little Easter eggs foreshadowing things that could come. It is really wide open to give this character as much legs in the universe as possible.""

,'Blue Beetle' Director on Casting Xolo Maridueña and How the Strike Affects the DC Movie (Exclusive),"Ángel Manuel Soto opened up to ET about casting his lead, Xolo Maridueña, and why it's 'bittersweet' for the film to premiere now.","Blue Beetle is the newest hero in the DC universe, and he's got his work cut out for him!

Director Ángel Manuel Soto recently sat down with ET's Ash Crossan to talk about making the first major superhero movie with a Latino lead -- and the uphill battle that has been releasing it amid the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.

""The strike was not in my bingo card,"" Soto admitted. ""But at the same time, you know, actions like that are necessary and they have to happen when they have to happen. Unfortunately, it happened while we were on premiere, and it's no secret that it affects us disproportionately, people of color and marginalized communities, for that matter, and minorities.""

""But the truth is that our actors, our talent -- which is the main reason why we want to support them -- they really, really gave it all... They gave their heart and soul,"" he added.

The film's talented cast is anchored by its lead, Cobra Kai and Parenthood star Xolo Maridueña, who steps into the role of Jaime Reyes, a young college grad who becomes host to the Scarab, an ancient alien relic that gives him the powerful exoskeleton armor to become the superhero Blue Beetle.

Soto told ET that watching Maridueña play Miguel Diaz on Cobra Kai helped him realize that he was the perfect actor to take on the lead role in the Blue Beetle movie. As a bonus, the young actor already had plenty of martial arts training. But that wasn't ultimately what won Soto over.

""It really struck me, his personality,"" he recalled. ""A kid who was like, the star of this TV show, who happens to be his age, acting his age, but really wise. He had all this charisma and energy with him, and on top of that, his family was always with him... Those were qualities and values that I respected for a kid his age.""

Soto also joked that Maridueña's personality felt like a ""copy-paste"" of the comics' Jaime Reyes.

""Right off the bat, it was, 'It's him or him,' type of scenario,"" he admitted. ""It was really cool to see how the studio backed me up in that decision, and even better seeing him stepping up to the plate.""

Warner Bros. Pictures

The Blue Beetle has gone through three major iterations in the history of comics. The character was first introduced by Fox Comics in 1939, as Dan Garrett took on the mantle -- first as a police officer and then, in a later revamped version from Charlton Comics, as an archaeologist, tapping into the ancient Egyptian powers of the Scarab.

Ted Kord was the second Beetle, a student of Garrett's who took up the mantle himself in the Charlton Comics, and later, DC Comics runs. When Jaime Reyes was introduced in 2006 as a successor to Ted Kord, the Blue Beetle origins were retconned to be an alien being.

""Once I came to the project, it was always the story of Jaime Reyes,"" Soto explained. ""We wanted to focus this film solely on him and his family.""

However, Susan Sarandon's role in the film as Ted's sister, Victoria Kord, adds a new layer of canonical intrigue to the story.

""We didn't wanna keep away from the fact that the legacy of Ted Kord still looms and intersects with the story of Jaime Reyes,"" Soto explained. ""So in the film, we do mention and honor the Blue Beetles that came before Jaime Reyes... There's plenty of Easter eggs.""

While Soto was motivated to keep his Blue Beetle story ""self-contained"" within the newly-created ""Palmera City,"" there are also references to what might pop up for the character in the future of the DCU. Jaime studied at Gotham Law, and there's a background newscast mention of Bruce Wayne, but Soto said his goal was to keep references to other well-known DC characters to a minimum.

""This serves as an introduction card for Jaime Reyes,"" he said of his film. ""If anybody has any questions what his background is, anybody can go back to this movie and know where he came from.""

Where Jaime/Blue Beetle might show up in future adventures, however -- and who he might fight alongside -- remains to be seen.

""This project has survived through regimes, this project survived cancellations,"" Soto noted. ""To have James Gunn now communicate openly that Blue Beetle is the first hero of his new DCU is definitely a testament to the effort and the love and the passion that everybody has put into this project, especially our actors.""

""We always saw this movie as the first act of a bigger saga,"" he continued, explaining what it meant to him to introduce the first Latino superhero to lead a movie. ""We wanted to introduce this character into the world. We wanted to introduce our community, our values, our history, our relationship with our family front and center. Because we've never had that opportunity before. We wanted to show the world who we are before we start fighting cosmic battles and saving the universe. We wanted to keep it grounded. personal, intimate, so that then the next movies that come, we can dive into the whole action sequences. We can go crazy with all the explosions.""

That desire to keep things intimate and personal doesn't always translate when promoting a superhero blockbuster, however, and Soto lamented that his cast was missing out on the chance to ""receive their flowers"" amid the strike. But he reiterated that the Blue Beetle stars ""understand that there's a heroic moment right now, that they need to be part of the right side of history.""

""They know what this means, not just for the cultural side, but for every other kid out there who has never seen themselves represented, being able to do that for them,"" he marveled. ""For me, having them fight the good fight, knowing that all the sacrifices that they're doing are gonna pave the way for future generations to enjoy better pay and better treatment it only fills me with energy to keep promoting this film for them.""

""The best way to recognize, not only their sacrifice, but also support them for their future careers, and hopefully, the future of more diverse storytelling by people who come from those communities, is by showing up in theaters on Aug. 18 and letting the people know that we have their backs,"" he continued. ""It's taken us this long to be here, and it's sad that the strike is happening right now so that they cannot receive their flowers when they're supposed to receive it. I think the best way to show them that we love them is by showing up in the theaters.""

The film also stars George Lopez, Harvey Guillén, Bruna Marquezine, Belissa Escobedo, Adriana Barraza, Damián Alcázar, Raoul Max Trujillo, Elpidia Carrillo and Becky G as the voice of the Scarab, Khaji-Da.

,Inka Magnaye on DC's 'Blue Beetle': 'It made my year!',"Voice talent Inka Magnaye is still in cloud nine weeks since she first learned that she will voice the Scarab in the Philippine release of Warner Bros. Pictures' upcoming movie, 'Blue Beetle.'","Inka Magnaye to voice the Scarab in the Philippine release of Warner Bros. Pictures' upcoming movie, ""Blue Beetle."" Shiela Reyes, ABS-CBN News

MANILA -- Voice talent Inka Magnaye is still in cloud nine weeks since she first learned that she will voice the Scarab in the Philippine release of Warner Bros. Pictures' upcoming movie, ""Blue Beetle.""

“[I learned about it when I got] an email from Warner Bros. I didn’t see the email myself because I have my wonderful team behind me doing that. They sent the email to our chat group without anything, just the screenshot of the email. And then I looked at it, I was a little confused. I’m like, ‘What? Oh my gosh! This is real!’” she said in a press conference on Wednesday.

Magnaye said she was on a high for the next few days and even until now.

“It’s sinking in little by little. I don’t even know if I am fully here. At the back of my head, there is an Inka going, ‘Is this really happening? I am dreaming right?’”

Magnaye said discovering that she was personally selected for the role made it even more significant.

“We had a call with Warner Bros. I was like, ‘Yeah. Okay!’ It made my year. They wanted me from the very beginning of everything,” she said.

While she did her regular physical preparation for the role, given her familiarity doing voiceovers, she felt that she needed to invest more effort into her mental preparation given how big this project is.

“It was quite the same as any other voice over gig but also with the knowledge and understanding that it was the biggest. I was walking into that studio conditioning myself to be like, ‘Okay, let’s get this voice right because this is the recording. There’s no do-over here after this is done.’ So I did a lot of trying to look for my most-AI voice because that’s something that I like to do,” she said.

“It’s more of the mental preps knowing that this is going to be the biggest project I’ve ever taken on so far. This is going to make waves. There’s a different kind of responsibility knowing that I am the first ever Philippine-based Filipino talent that DC is going to get for their superhero movie,” she added.

When she lent her voice to the Scarab, Magnaye said the biggest challenge was how to set her voice apart from all the other voices in superhero movies.

“I’d like to put a mark on that. I want people to set that apart from others. I think to make it sound more personal while making it sound synthetic is the challenge there – finding the balance to do that.”

Magnaye will voice the Scarab, described by Warner Bros. Philippines in a statement as ""an ancient alien relic pivotal to the titular DC Super Hero's story.""

Called Khaji-Da, the Scarab is voiced by singer-actress Becky G in the original version of the movie.

According to Warner Bros. Philippines, Magnaye is the first Philippine-based Filipino talent to do voiceover work in a DC film.

The movie will come out in theaters nationwide on August 16.

While Warner Bros. may have announced in late 2022 that James Gunn was stepping away from Marvel and Guardians of the Galaxy to take the creative helm of a new DC Universe, it still had a handful of existing films to deal with in the meantime – none of which have gone down well with fans or critics.

In March, DC released its follow-up to Shazam! (2019). Shazam! Fury of the Gods (2023) flopped at the box office, earning just $133.8 million on a $125 million budget. DC’s next film, The Flash (2023), bombed even harder. The controversial multiverse film led by Ezra Miller has earned the title of the biggest flop in the 100-year history of Warner Bros., as well as attracting endless critiques for everything from its CGI to its unethical cameos.

There are now just two more pre-Gunn movies left on DC’s release schedule: Blue Beetle (2023) and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023). Considering its recent history – and considering that both will likely be irrelevant to the reimagined DC Universe – hopes weren’t exactly high for either installment.

However, first reactions are in for Blue Beetle, and it seems like the prospects may be better than we first thought.

The film follows Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña), a recent college graduate who returns to his hometown of Palmera City, where he is chosen to become the symbiotic host to the Scarab – an ancient relic that turns him into the superhero Blue Beetle.

Critics have heaped on the praise for Maridueña and his “charismatic star-making performance” that, according to journalist Vanessa D., makes Blue Beetle “the best film to come out of the DCU since Wonder Woman.”

This seems to be a common comparison, with The Washington Post reporter David Betancourt claiming that it’s “right up there with the first Wonder Woman,” as well as pushing for Maridueña’s character to become a part of the new DCU once James Gunn takes the reins. Others have gone so far as to dub it the best DC superhero movie since Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy.

A major high point is said to be the film’s focus on family and Latin culture. Director Angel Manuel Soto has reportedly “filled the film with the heart of Latin culture and focused on the importance of family and believing in yourself against all odds.”

Happy to finally share #BlueBeetle is everything I hoped it would be! @angelmanuelsoto filled the film with the heart of Latin Culture and focused on the importance of family and believing in yourself against all odds. It’s the best film to come out of the DCU since Wonder Woman! pic.twitter.com/uG7hKg7ttG — Vanessa D. (@BriteandBubbly) August 11, 2023

Fortunately, it seems like Gunn is on the same page. The writer and director has previously commented that while Superman: Legacy (2025) is the first DCU film, Blue Beetle will technically count as the first character in the DC Universe. Angel Manuel Soto has also expressed interest in making a Blue Beetle trilogy.

2023-08-22 23:48:06+00:00,How ‘Gran Turismo’ Could Take The Checkered Flag At Weekend Box Office – Preview,'Gran Turismo' boosted by previews could see a $15M No. 1 opening at weekend box office.,"In the midst of a weekend with National Cinema Day, in addition to several previews, Sony’s feature take of PlayStation game, Gran Turismo, is bound to take No. 1 at the box office. This despite the fact that tracking has lowered its projections on the film down to $12M from $15M.

Gran Turismo originally was scheduled to open on Aug. 11, but Sony unconventionally decided to pivot to previews for two weeks prior to the pic’s opening this Friday in an effort to drum up word of mouth on the Neill Blomkamp directed movie since the cast wasn’t available due to the SAG-AFTRA strike. Per industry sources, not Sony, previews are estimated to be in the $3M-plus range. That cash will be rolled into Gran Turismo‘s first Friday. This would boost the movie’s opening weekend to an estimated $15M in 3,800 theaters. In major markets such as LA, cinemas have been playing Gran Turismo on Friday, Saturday and Sunday; two weekends back-to-back. Thursday previews start at 2PM in 3,100 sites. So far, critics aren’t fans of Gran Turismo at 59% on Rotten Tomatoes, but moviegoers who’ve seen it are at 98%. The production was $60M before P&A.

What also remains to be seen is the halo effect from National Cinema Day, which falls on Sunday this year whereby all movies, all showtimes, all formats are $4. Last year, National Cinema Day was held on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend, clocking 8M admission off $3 tickets in a three-day weekend that counted 10.5M admissions. Will business crater on Friday and Saturday this weekend? Will Sunday box office wise be flat with Saturday? Last year, business went up dollar wise on Saturday with pics like Top Gun: Maverick and Bullet Train seeing respective Friday-to-Saturday jumps of +26% and +117%.

No. 2 is a toss-up between the second weekend of Warner Bros.’ Blue Beetle and the sixth frame of Barbie with $12M-$13M apiece, however, many believe the latter will be fueled by repeat business off $4 Sunday tickets. Through Monday, Barbie counts a running domestic take of $569.3M while Blue Beetle stands at $27.1M. Next is Universal’s sixth weekend of Oppenheimer with around $6M, -44%. The Christopher Nolan epic stands at $286.7M in U.S./Canada. As we told you, Barbie will become the highest grossing movie of 2023 on Wednesday, beating Uni/Illumination’s Super Mario Bros Movie‘s $574.2M total cume.

Indie movies will try to take advantage of the availability of screens at this late stage of the summer box office, which is headed toward $4 billion. Briarcliff Entertainment’s faith-based title The Hill will be booked in around 1,500 theaters with an eye at $2M-$3M. The biopic follows the true story of Rickey Hill (Colin Ford), who was born with degenerative spinal disease that gave him small, weak legs. He becomes a baseball phenonmeon and ultimately signs with the Montreal Expos in 1975 and plays with the team for fours seasons. Dennis Quaid plays Rickey’s stern preacher dad.

,Barbie movie review & film summary (2023),"A lot like Barbie the doll: ravishing to look at, but with much more on its mind than initially meets the eye.","“Barbie” can be hysterically funny, with giant laugh-out-loud moments generously scattered throughout. They come from the insularity of an idyllic, pink-hued realm and the physical comedy of fish-out-of-water moments and choice pop culture references as the outside world increasingly encroaches. But because the marketing campaign has been so clever and so ubiquitous, you may discover that you’ve already seen a fair amount of the movie’s inspired moments, such as the “2001: A Space Odyssey” homage and Ken’s self-pitying ‘80s power ballad. Such is the anticipation industrial complex.

And so you probably already know the basic plot: Barbie (Margot Robbie), the most popular of all the Barbies in Barbieland, begins experiencing an existential crisis. She must travel to the human world in order to understand herself and discover her true purpose. Her kinda-sorta boyfriend, Ken (Ryan Gosling), comes along for the ride because his own existence depends on Barbie acknowledging him. Both discover harsh truths—and make new friends –along the road to enlightenment. This bleeding of stark reality into an obsessively engineered fantasy calls to mind the revelations of “The Truman Show” and “The LEGO Movie,” but through a wry prism that’s specifically Gerwig’s.

This is a movie that acknowledges Barbie’s unrealistic physical proportions—and the kinds of very real body issues they can cause in young girls—while also celebrating her role as a feminist icon. After all, there was an astronaut Barbie doll (1965) before there was an actual woman in NASA’s astronaut corps (1978), an achievement “Barbie” commemorates by showing two suited-up women high-fiving each other among the stars, with Robbie’s Earth-bound Barbie saluting them with a sunny, “Yay, space!” This is also a movie in which Mattel (the doll’s manufacturer) and Warner Bros. (the film’s distributor) at least create the appearance that they’re in on the surprisingly pointed jokes at their expense. Mattel headquarters features a spacious, top-floor conference room populated solely by men with a heart-shaped, “Dr. Strangelove”-inspired lamp hovering over the table, yet Will Ferrell’s CEO insists his company’s “gender-neutral bathrooms up the wazoo” are evidence of diversity. It's a neat trick.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvZ2VyZWJlcnQuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvYmFyYmllLW1vdmllLXJldmlldy0yMDIz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

From ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" to ""Poor Things,"" ""Saw X,"" and more.","Summer 2023 brought a dizzying array of awe-striking movies to theaters from the bittersweet joys of Barbie to the thought-provoking history lessons of Oppenheimer, the punchy queer comedy of Bottoms, and the reinvigorating action of Blue Beetle. But could it be that fall will offer an even better season of cinema?

This fall, Mashable will be covering the 80th Venice International Film Festival, the 48th Toronto International Film Festival, the 61st New York Film Festival, and the 18th Fantastic Festival to stay on the front lines of all things freaking awesome in film.

Looking ahead, we've collected the highlights for a fall movie season that's sure to knock out audiences over and over.

1. Perpetrator

Director Jennifer Reeder delivers a singular horror film with Perpetrator , a convention-defying coming-of-age tale complete with strange powers, buckets of blood, and commentary on bodily autonomy.

The film's opening conceit of a masked assailant kidnapping young women may feel familiar, but it's not long before Perpetrator veers into much stranger territory. We meet rebellious teenager Jonny, sent to live with her Aunt Hildie (played by a delightfully witchy Alicia Silverstone). On her 18th birthday, she'll inherit a supernatural familial power known as ""the Forevering,"" which she'll use to investigate the abductions of her classmates. What follows is a surreal, free-wheeling journey through genres, including slashers, giallo films, and dark teen comedies. It's a tough movie to describe, but an absolutely exhilarating movie to experience. Trust me when I say, you've never seen horror quite like Perpetrator. — Belen Edwards, Entertainment Reporter

Starring: Kiah McKirnan, Alicia Silverstone, Christopher Lowell, Melanie Liburd, and Ireon Roach.

How to watch: Perpetrator opens in select theaters and on Shudder Sept. 1.

2. The Nun II



The Conjuring universe is vast and mighty, with over eight films digging deep into its demonic lore and blessing us with spin-offs centered on its most feared (yet beloved) characters. Perhaps the most infamous face to come out of the franchise is the demonic nun Valak. Played by Mulholland Drive's Bonnie Aarons, this character made her first appearance in The Conjuring 2 and has since gotten her own origin story with The Nun. Now she's getting a fully fledged sequel with The Nun II .

The ninth installment in The Conjuring franchise, The Nun II brings Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) to France, where she must do battle yet again with her demonic nun nemesis. The film's trailer promises a significant step up from its prequel, with absolutely terrifying jump scares — not to mention a script from everyone's favorite horror scribe, Akela Cooper (M3GAN, Malignant ). If you're ready to kick off spooky season, then The Nun II is a sure-fire add to your watch list this fall. — Yasmeen Hamadeh, Freelance Contributor

Starring: Taissa Farmiga, Bonnie Aarons, Anna Popplewell, Jonas Bloquet, and Storm Reid.

How to watch: The Nun II opens in theaters on Sept. 8.

3. A Haunting in Venice

After solving a Murder on the Orient Express and a Death on the Nile , Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh, who also directs) is back for an especially seasonal mystery. A Haunting in Venice follows Poirot as he's forced out of retirement to solve the spooky case of a séance gone terribly wrong on Halloween night.

Based on Agatha Christie's novel Hallowe'en Party , the film untangles a crime from beyond the veil, with Poirot's top suspect being a ghost hellbent on haunting him. A Haunting in Venice marries mystery with the macabre — and an all-star cast — to deliver a whodunnit that just might be Poirot's creepiest one yet. — Y.H.

Starring: Kenneth Branagh, Jamie Dornan, Kelly Reilly, Tina Fey, and Michelle Yeoh.

4. The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar

Earlier this year, Wes Anderson charmed audiences with his unique spin on science fiction with Asteroid City. This fall, he's stepping back to more familiar territory with a short film full of stars.

The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar is an adaptation of a Roald Dahl story, Anderson's second after his enchanting animated heist flick, Fantastic Mr. Fox. This time around, he's going live-action, bringing familiar faces to the story of a rich man who is mystified by a guru who can see without using his eyes. Naturally, the rich man aims to exploit this to cheat at gambling. If all this isn't enough to lure you to Netflix to see this 39-minute film, check out that cast list and consider again. — Kristy Puchko, Film Editor

Starring: Ralph Fiennes, Benedict Cumberbatch, Dev Patel, Ben Kingsley, and Richard Ayoade.

How to watch: The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar opens in select theaters on Sept. 20 and comes to Netflix on Sept. 27.

5. The Creator

Director Gareth Edwards's The Creator has all the makings of a promising sci-fi blockbuster. An original story? Check. A stacked cast? Check. An interrogation of humanity's relationship with Artificial Intelligence ? Double check.

The film sees humans in an all-out war against AI. As the battle wages on, ex-special forces agent Joshua is tasked with hunting and killing the AI's architect, known simply as the Creator. Whoever they are, they've developed a weapon strong enough to end the war — and wipe out mankind. However, as Joshua fights his way past enemy lines, he discovers that this all-powerful weapon is none other than an AI child. Will Joshua protect the child or see his mission through? — B.E.

Starring: John David Washington, Gemma Chan, Ken Watanabe, Sturgill Simpson, Madeleine Yuna Voyles, and Allison Janney.

How to watch: The Creator opens in theaters Sept. 29.

6. Saw X

Jigsaw returns for the 10th installment of the franchise that spawned the torture porn craze and its corresponding moral panic. Tobin Bell reprises the role that made him a horror icon, and this time the story begins with an act of hope leading to horror. In a curious twist, Saw X is actually a prequel. Bear with me.

Set between Saw and Saw II, Saw X sees cancer patient John Kramer (aka Jigsaw) traveling to Mexico as he chases down an experimental procedure that might cure him. When it turns out this promise is actually a scam, the serial killer goes to work, masterminding a twisted revenge scheme. You can see from the trailer that these fun and games will get gruesome. — K.P.

Starring: Tobin Bell, Shawnee Smith, Synnøve Macody Lund, Steven Brand, Michael Beach, and Renata Vaca.

How to watch: Saw X opens in theaters Sept. 29.

7. Dicks: The Musical

A24 has had a phenomenal 2023 so far, unleashing some of our fave films of the year, like the mind-bending thriller Beau Is Afraid, the tender romantic drama Past Lives, the nerve-rattling horror movie Talk to Me, and the macabrely funny murder mystery Medusa Deluxe. Now this awesome indie studio that won the Oscar for Everything Everywhere All At Once is rolling out something completely different, giving writers/actors Josh Sharp and Aaron Jackson a chance to spin off their off-Broadway musical Fucking Identical Twins into a movie. And it's one that not only boasts a dazzling cast of stars (see below) but also bonkers song numbers, a profoundly dumb take on The Parent Trap, and Sewer Boys.

When a pair of douchebags learn they're long-lost twins, they decide to trick their parents into reuniting. How does this lead to puppets, murder plots, coming-out scenes, obscene songs, and Megan Thee Stallion being boss in at least two senses of the word? Attendees of the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival will be the first to know, as that's where Dicks: The Musical will make its world premiere. (Stay tuned for Mashable's coverage out of the fest!) But not long after, you can see this freaky flick at a theater near you. — K.P.

Starring: Nathan Lane, Megan Mullally, Bowen Yang, and Megan Thee Stallion.

How to watch: Dicks: The Musical opens in theaters Oct. 6.

8. Foe

The pairing of Saoirse Ronan and Paul Mescal should be enough to convince you to watch Foe, but in case you're (somehow) not sold by the star power of two Academy Award nominees, you'll definitely be drawn in by the film's haunting story.

Ronan and Mescal play Henrietta and Junior, a married couple enduring the climate apocalypse 40 years in the future. When stranger Terrance appears at their rural farmhouse, he turns their world upside down with the revelation that Junior must depart on a space mission to help save mankind. What follows is part twisty psychological thriller, part marital drama, and part apocalyptic science fiction, all anchored by three captivating performances. — B.E.

Starring: Saoirse Ronan, Paul Mescal, and Aaron Pierre.

How to watch: Foe opens in theaters Oct. 6 , and will be streaming on Prime Video at a later date.

9. Strange Way of Life

Credit: Sony Pictures Classic

If you’re in Pedro Pascal withdrawal after binge-watching The Last of Us and The Mandalorian, we have got a Western for you. Written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar, this short film has sparked intense interest, not only because it boasts the internet’s favorite beau of 2023, but also because it casts him as a cowboy in a queer romance with Ethan Hawke.

The trailer teases Old Hollywood influences, from a Hitchcock-like score to imagery plucked from Howard Hawkes's Red River, but the heat and love of melodrama is pure Almodóvar. And Pascal is perfect for it. — K.P.

Starring: Pedro Pascal and Ethan Hawke.

How to watch: Strange Way of Life will opens in select theaters Oct. 4, with a nationwide rollout to follow on Oct. 6.

10. Dear David

It began on the internet. Specifically, a cartoonist for Buzzfeed named Adam Ellis began to share his experiences with a ghost that plagued his home. It was a Twitter thread that grabbed fans by the throat, sending shivers down our spines as we zoomed into photos of the specter Ellis called Dear David. Some have decried his story as a hoax. Some scoffed at the idea this curious bit of internet lore could be spun into a satisfying movie. But this fall, we'll see for ourselves.

Personally, I have faith in helmer John McPhail, a Scottish filmmaker who made his mark with the splashy genre-mash-up Anna and the Apocalypse . For those who haven't seen this blood-splatted wonder, it's a teen-comedy/zombie horror flick/holiday musical. So even if the trailer for Dear David might seem a bit basic, I believe. — K.P.

Starring: Augustus Prew, Justin Long, Andrea Bang, René Escobar Jr., and Cameron Nicoll.

How to watch: Dear David opens in theaters Oct. 13.

11. Killers of the Flower Moon

Martin Scorsese has uncovered the underbelly of American crime in such truly iconic films as Goodfellas, Casino, The Wolf of Wall Street, and Gangs of New York. Now, he's turning his cinematic lens to David Grann's non-fiction book Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI.

As the title suggests and the teaser makes clear , the film focuses on a series of mysterious deaths and seeming murders that befell the wealthy Osage people in 1920s Oklahoma. Grann's book explored the case from the perspective of the tribe, that of the white investigator tasked to look into these killings, and the survivors who carry the weight of this tragedy a hundred years later. Scorsese is known for crafting captivating narratives about criminals, but this is sure to play out differently than his tales of charismatic gangsters. And you can bet this film will be a heavy-hitter come Oscar season. — K.P.

Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, Lily Gladstone, Jesse Plemons, Tantoo Cardinal, John Lithgow, and Brendan Fraser.

How to watch: Killers of the Flower Moon opens in theaters Oct. 20, and on Apple TV+ at a later date.

12. The Killer

Credit: Venice Film Festival

Director David Fincher has brought audiences some of the most electrifying crime thrillers of the modern age with Se7en, Zodiac, and Gone Girl. This fall, he returns with a tantalizing new offering that promises action, adventure, and assassins.

Based on the graphic novel series written by Alexis Nolent and illustrated by Luc Jacamon, The Killer centers on a professional hitman who — after a fatal near-miss — goes to war with his former employers. But hey, it's not personal. It's just business, a bloody, bloody business. If this promising premise, plus this heralded filmmaker, aren't enough to excite you, take a look at that cast. — K.P.

Starring: Michael Fassbender, Charles Parnell, Arliss Howard, Sophie Charlotte, and Tilda Swinton.

How to watch: The Killer opens in select theaters Oct. 27, before premiering on Netflix Nov. 10.

13. Priscilla

Last year, Baz Luhrmann gave us an epic biopic about the King of Rock and Roll , and now Sofia Coppola is entering the ring with her portrait of another famous Presley — Priscilla (Cailee Spaeny). Based on Priscilla Presley's 1986 memoir Elvis and Me , Coppola's Priscilla unfurls the relationship between Elvis ( Euphoria 's Jacob Elordi) and Priscilla over the years, from the day they met at a party to their turbulent marriage.

The film's bittersweet trailer already promises a melancholic love story loaded with incredible visuals, a killer soundtrack, and that specific type of broken yearning only Sofia Coppola can do. It's sexy. It's sad. It's Priscilla's story finally getting the spotlight. — Y.H.

Starring: Cailee Spaeny, Jacob Elordi, Dagmara Domińczyk, Jorja Cadence, Rodrigo Fernandez-Stoll, and Dan Abramovici.

How to watch: Priscilla opens in theaters on Nov 3.

14. The Marvels

Forget the Avengers assembling. MCU Phase 5 is bringing us a trio of superheroines with The Marvels. Captain Marvel 's Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) joins forces with Ms. Marvel 's Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), and Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris), who kicked butt in WandaVision . And naturally, Samuel L. Jackson is back as Nick Fury, post- Secret Invasion .

A sequel to 2019's Captain Marvel sees the space-trekking stunner discover a curious tangle. Specifically, Carol learns her powers have been entangled with those of her friend Monica and her No. 1 fan, Kamala. Along with plenty of action, this collision of characters promises to bring plenty of laughs. What else will director Nia DaCosta (Candyman, Little Woods) bring to the Marvel Cinematic Universe? We can't wait to find out. — K.P.

Starring: Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, Iman Vellani, Zawe Ashton, Park Seo-joon, and Samuel L. Jackson.

From absurd workplace sketches to music videos with the likes of Taylor Swift, the comedy trio known as Please Don't Destroy has become a hilarious Saturday Night Live staple. This fall, they make the leap from digital shorts to feature films with Please Don't Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain.

The film follows three childhood friends who hate their lives. In an attempt to switch things up, they set off to uncover the treasure rumored to lie beneath a nearby mountain. If you're familiar with any of Please Don't Destroy's work, you can probably guess that their epic quest will quickly devolve into bizarro misadventure. Along the way, they'll cross paths with characters played by comedians like Bowen Yang, Conan O'Brien, and Meg Stalter, making The Treasure of Foggy Mountain a real who's-who of current-day comedy. — B.E.

Starring: Ben Marshall, John Higgins, Martin Herlihy, Conan O'Brien, Bowen Yang, Meg Stalter, X Mayo, Nichole Sakura, Cedric Yarbrough, Sunita Mani, and Jordan Mendoza.

If you grew up idolizing Katniss Everdeen , allow us to introduce you to Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), District 12's very first victor who arguably set off the cataclysmic events we see in The Hunger Games trilogy. Based on Suzanne Collins's novel of the same name , The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a prequel to The Hunger Games, set 64 years before the events of the first film and book .

It follows Lucy as she takes part in the 10th annual Hunger Games, where her mentor is none other than a young Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth). As their relationship blossoms into something neither of them were anticipating, Lucy and Coriolanus embark on a journey that leaves one of them erased from history forever, and the other, well, we know what becomes of him. — Y.H.

Starring: Rachel Zegler, Tom Blyth, Hunter Schafer, Jason Schwartzman, Peter Dinklage, and Viola Davis.

This year marks Disney's 100th anniversary, so what better way to celebrate than with Wish , a movie about literally wishing upon a star.

Wish introduces a new Disney princess in Asha, an idealistic young woman from the kingdom of Rosas, where wishes come true. Their leader, King Magnifico, has been entrusted by people from around the world with their wishes, but the vibes are off with this guy. Luckily, Asha's wish-making powers are so awesome that when her wish is granted, it takes the form of a powerful cosmic sidekick named Star. Asha and her magical new pal are in for a fight to protect themselves and the people of Rosas against whatever the king is scheming.

In classic Disney tradition, expect sweeping songs and talking animal sidekicks, all paired with a new, more illustrative animation style. — B.E.

Starring: Ariana DeBose, Chris Pine, and Alan Tudyk.

Scorsese isn’t the only acclaimed director taking a big swing with a historical drama. Ridley Scott, who in 2021 gave us the wild double whammy of true crime that was The Last Duel and House of Gucci, returns with his take on Napoleon Bonaparte. The French military leader, who rose to prominence during revolution, will be depicted not only in his humble origins and ascension to power but also through his influential and volatile romance with his Josephine.

Scott is a filmmaker lauded for his riveting portraits of emotionally complicated and morally questionable anti-heroes. So when it comes to this director teamed with heralded headliners Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby, we expect greatness. — K.P.

Starring: Joaquin Phoenix, Vanessa Kirby, and Tahar Rahim.

How to watch: Napoleon opens in theaters Nov. 22, and on Apple TV+ at a later date.

19. Saltburn

Earlier this year, Emerald Fennell made an eye-catching cameo in Barbie as discontinued doll pregnant Midge . Now, the actress/writer/director is back with her much-anticipated follow-up to the wrathful thriller Promising Young Woman . Saltburn, which is set in the mid-'00s, looks to play with many of the same themes as Fennell's scorching directorial debut: privilege, desire, power, and excess.

Barry Keoghan stars as Oxford University student Oliver Quick, whose infatuation with aristocratic classmate Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi) leads to a summer at the Catton family estate that neither will forget. Details are thin on this drama, which will open the 67th BFI London Film Festival on Oct. 4, 2023. However, based on Fennell's past work and penchant for the provocative, we're nibbling our nails in anticipation. — K.P.

Starring: Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Rosamund Pike, Richard E. Grant, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, and Carey Mulligan.

How to watch: Saltburn will open in select theaters on Nov. 24, before expanding wide on Dec. 1.

20. Poor Things

If you loved The Favourite, mark your calendar for Poor Things, which reunites director Yorgos Lanthimos, screenwriter Tony McNamara, and leading lady Emma Stone. Based on Alasdair Gray's 1992 novel of the same name, Poor Things is a Frankenstein-like story, centering on Bella Baxter (Stone), a young woman brought back from the dead by an eccentric scientist (Willem Dafoe).

From the looks of its trailer, this curious sci-fi tale seems to be a coming-of-age story, where the naive Bella strives to chase romance, freedom, and experience, relishing every moment of her second shot at life. Lanthimos's unique vision promises this one will be visually exhilarating, And an ensemble that pitches Stone against Dafoe and a seemingly besotted Mark Ruffalo has us already already crushing on Poor Things. They had us at ""Ow!"" — K.P.

Starring: Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe, Ramy Youssef, Jerrod Carmichael, Margaret Qualley, and Hanna Schygulla.

How to watch: Poor Things opens in theaters Dec. 8.

21. Leave the World Behind

What would you do if an unknown disaster interrupted your vacation? If you're anything like the characters in Netflix's Leave the World Behind, you'd stay put in your luxury AirBnB until you could figure out what, exactly, is going on.

Based on the novel by Rumaan Alam, Leave the World Behind introduces two couples: Amanda and Clay, a white couple who have brought their kids to Long Island for vacation, and George and Ruth, the Black owners of the house Amanda and Clay are staying in. When George and Ruth return home early with news of a devastating blackout, what was meant to be a relaxing getaway becomes fraught with questions of survival. Both families must reckon with how to weather the ongoing catastrophe, whatever it may be, all while navigating their own racial and class-related prejudices. With Mr. Robot creator Sam Esmail directing, expect Leave the World Behind to be a sleek, unnerving psychological thriller. — B.E.

Starring: Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke, Myha'la Herrold, Kevin Bacon, Farrah Mackenzie, and Charlie Evans.

How to watch: Leave the World Behind premieres on Netflix Dec. 8.

22. Wonka

From sci-fi epics like Dune to heart-wrenching cannibal romances like Bones and All, there's no doubt that Timothée Chalamet has major range. This year, he expands that range even further with the sugary sweet Wonka, an origin story for Roald Dahl's iconic chocolatier. As the film's first trailer showed, the road to making chocolate will not be an easy one for Willy Wonka to tread. He'll have to face down the sinister Chocolate Cartel if he wants to open his own shop and introduce his madcap creations to the world. Fanciful musical numbers ensue.

Wonka's trailer practically set the internet ablaze with memes and questions about whether Chalamet has enough whimsy to pull off the role made iconic by Gene Wilder. (We think he does.) Yet, despite the trepidation about Wonka and Chalamet's lead performance, there's no denying the magic director Paul King created with Paddington and Paddington 2. Can he recreate it with this prequel? There's only one way to find out — bring on the chocolate! — B.E.

Starring: Timothée Chalamet, Olivia Colman, Sally Hawkins, Rowan Atkinson, Keegan-Michael Key, Hugh Grant, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton, Paterson Joseph, Tom Davis, Jim Carter, and Natasha Rothwell.

It's been over 20 years since Aardman introduced us to the charming hand-crafted world of Chicken Run, which remains the highest grossing stop-motion animated film of all time. This December, a long-awaited sequel shows us what Ginger and friends have been up to ever since their daring airborne escape from Tweedy's Farm and its terrifying pie-making machine.

As Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget opens, the free chickens are enjoying an idyllic life on an island of their own. Ginger and Rocky even have a daughter, a hatchling named Molly. However, the flock soon gets wind of foul (or fowl) happenings on the mainland that spell danger for all chicken-kind. Ginger's flock may be safe, but they're willing to risk their perfect lives to pull off another daring mission — only this time, instead of breaking out, they're breaking in. — B.E.

Starring: Thandiwe Newton, Zachary Levi, Bella Ramsey, Jane Horrocks, Imelda Staunton, Lynn Ferguson, Josie Sedgwick-Davies, David Bradley, Romesh Ranganathan, Daniel Mays, and Nick Mohammed.

How to watch: Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget premieres on Netflix Dec. 15.

24. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom

The DCEU has had a rocky year with Shazam! Fury of the Gods underwhelming critics and the box office, then The Flash doing epically worse on both counts. (In case you missed it: The Flash sucked.) Blue Beetle in August seemed a promising turn, delivering a fun and action-packed story that didn't get weighed down by bad CGI overkill or a tediously maudlin storyline. So, what will the sequel to 2018's Aquaman bring to finish off the year? (That is, if WB doesn't bump it like it has Dune 2.)

Working in favor of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is Jason Momoa reprising his role as the titular superhero. At the helm of this sea-set adventure is James Wan, responsible for a slew of Saw and Insidious movies, as well as the first Aquaman. Other than this, details are sparse. WB has been pretty tight-lipped on the details here. So dare we be hopeful? Or concerned? — K.P.

Who's in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom? Jason Momoa, Ben Affleck, Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman, Dolph Lundgren, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.

How to watch: Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom will open in theaters Dec. 20.

25. Rebel Moon Part 1: A Child of Fire

Zack Snyder's upcoming Rebel Moon is a space opera of interstellar proportions — and a classic tale of scrappy rebels facing down an evil empire.

Snyder transports us to a peaceful colony on the moon of Veldt, all the way at the edge of the galaxy. When the evil Imperium threatens Veldt with tyrannical rule, one mysterious young woman must recruit warriors from across the galaxy to help the people of Veldt make a stand. Inspired by Star Wars and Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, Rebel Moon promises sci-fi action and excitement aplenty. — B.E.

Starring: Sofia Boutella, Djimon Hounsou, Ed Skrein, Michiel Huisman, Bae Doona, Ray Fisher, Charlie Hunnam, Staz Nair, Anthony Hopkins, Cary Elwes, Corey Stoll, Jena Malone, Cleopatra Coleman, Alfonso Herrera, and Stuart Martin.

How to watch: Rebel Moon Part 1: A Child of Fire premieres on Netflix Dec. 22, while Rebel Moon Part 2: The Scargiver is slated for April 19, 2024.

26. The Iron Claw

A24 brings to the big screen the true story of the Von Erich family, a clan of pro wrestlers whose tragedies led to talk of a curse on their name. Although the subject matter may give pause, writer/director Sean Durkin isn’t known for ghoulish exploitation. He broke through with the nerve-jangling drama Martha Marcy May Marlene in 2011, about a young woman dealing with PTSD after escaping from a Manson-like cult. So, we are expecting a family drama that embraces the complications of the ties that bind, for better and for brutal.

Plus, this ensemble is electrifyingly promising, boasting not only Harris Dickinson (Triangle of Sadness), Holt McCallany (Mindhunters), and Zac Efron, but also The Bear’s blue-eyed star Jeremy Allen White. — K.P.

Starring: Zac Efron, Jeremy Allen White, Harris Dickinson, Maura Tierney, Holt McCallany, and Lily James.

How to watch: The Iron Claw will open in theaters Dec. 22.

27. The Color Purple

In 1985, Steven Spielberg brought Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Color Purple to the big screen in a moving adaptation that earned 11 Academy Award nominations and was a box office smash. While Ghanaian filmmaker Blitz Bazawule is technically following in Spielberg's footsteps, the multi-hyphenate artist is not doing a remake. Instead, this version of The Color Purple is translated from stage to screen, drawing inspiration from the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical.

Centering on the struggles of Celie Harris Johnson, an African-American woman living in the South during the early 1990s, The Color Purple tells a story of tragedy, resilience, and love. Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey, who starred in the first film, are producers, and Walker herself is an executive producer.

Bazawule has brought on the show's Broadway stars, Danielle Brooks and Fantasia Barrino (making her film debut here), to reprise their roles as Celie and Sofia, respectively. They'll be joined on-screen by an array of dazzling Black stars, including The Little Mermaid's headliner Halle Bailey. Get ready: This incredible cast is going to bring the house down. — K.P.

Starring: Fantasia Barrino, Danielle Brooks, Taraji P. Henson, Colman Domingo, Corey Hawkins, H.E.R., Halle Bailey, Aunjanue Ellis, and Phylicia Pearl Mpasi.

Movies pushed to 2024...

Dune: Part Two

Credit: Niko Tavernise

Denis Villeneuve proved he could do justice to Frank Herbert's Dune back in 2021, so it's no surprise that we're foaming at the mouth for round two (and then promptly recycling that foam back into our stillsuits because we simply cannot waste water). While the first Dune set up the politics of Herbert's expansive sci-fi epic, Dune: Part Two will plunge headfirst into Paul Atreides and the Fremen's battle to free Arrakis from the Harkonnens.

But by no means should you go into Dune: Part Two expecting a straightforward fight between good and evil. As Paul's influence grows, the film promises to interrogate his actions, asking whether he's really the savior the Fremen believe him to be or just another conqueror ready to subjugate them anew. Plus, Dune: Part Two will also delve into some of the weirdest parts of Herbert's novel, delivering more spice, more space politics, and more glorious sandworms. If Villeneuve sticks the landing here, we could be looking at one of the best sci-fi film series ever put on screen. — B.E.

Starring: Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Stellan Skarsgård, Léa Seydoux, Dave Bautista, Christopher Walken, Charlotte Rampling, and Stephen McKinley Henderson.

How to watch: Dune: Part Two opens in theaters March 15, 2024.

,Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom Expected to Hold Christmas Release Date,It looks like DC fans will still get to celebrate the holidays with Jason Momoa this year.,"It looks like DC fans will still get to celebrate the holidays with Jason Momoa this year.

Last month, the actor's guild SAG-AFTRA went on strike after negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers broke down with no deal in place. Between the SAG strike and the ongoing Writers Guild of America strike, most film and television productions have halted and some major movie release dates have been pushed back. Many moviegoers are wondering what else might get postponed now that actors cannot promote their films. One upcoming film that has been in question is Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. It's unclear how the DC film will fair at the box office after The Flash became one of the biggest bombs in comic book movie history. However, a new report from Variety says the Aquaman sequel is expected to keep its Christmas release date.

Variety previously reported that Warner Bros. was considering pushing back films such as Dune: Part Two and The Color Purple, and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom was also mentioned. However, a new article about the upcoming DC movie, Blue Beetle, is singing a different tune. ""Warner Bros. insiders tell Variety the Jason Momoa film is expected to hold its Dec. 25 release date,"" Variety writes.

The first Aquaman grossed $1.150 billion worldwide, but its huge success might not help the follow-up. Before the pandemic, the Fast Saga was also a billion-dollar franchise, but the latest installment was a letdown at the box office. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom also has the disadvantage of being a part of an ending saga. Now that James Gunn and Peter Safran have taken over as co-CEOs of DC Studios, the upcoming sequel could be the final movie of the Snyderverse era that started with Man of Steel back in 2013. With this era of the franchise winding down with no clear ending, folks could be waiting to see what the Gunn and Safran's revamp has in store.

Will Blue Beetle Be Part of the New DC Universe?

Blue Beetle is hitting theaters this month and will see Xolo Maridueña taking on the role of Jaime Reyes, the comics hero who becomes fused to an alien scarab and gains superpowers.

""I mean the first DCU character for sure is Blue Beetle and the first DCU movie is Superman,"" Gunn recently explained.

However, during a press conference, Gunn confirmed Blue Beetle was ""totally disconnected"" from any other DC-related property.

""I think that we've gotten lucky with the next four movies, frankly, because we have [Shazam! Fury of the Gods], which leads into Flash, which resets everything, which then goes into Blue Beetle, which is totally disconnected. He can totally be a part of the DCU, goes into [Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom], which leads into Superman, our first big project,"" Gunn said at the time. ""But the one thing that we can promise is that everything from Superman forward, or from our first project forward, will be canon and will be connected. We're using some actors from the past. We're not using other actors from the past, but everything from that moment forward will be connected and consistent.""

Blue Beetle is scheduled to be released on August 18th, and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is expected to arrive on December 20th.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vY29taWNib29rLmNvbS9kYy9uZXdzL2FxdWFtYW4tYW5kLXRoZS1sb3N0LWtpbmdkb20tZXhwZWN0ZWQtdG8taG9sZC1jaHJpc3RtYXMtcmVsZWFzZS1kYXRlL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vY29taWNib29rLmNvbS9kYy9hbXAvbmV3cy9hcXVhbWFuLWFuZC10aGUtbG9zdC1raW5nZG9tLWV4cGVjdGVkLXRvLWhvbGQtY2hyaXN0bWFzLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

Writer/director James Gunn has been given the keys to Kingdom Come (not that one, sadly), and Superman: Legacy has been established as the formal reboot of the DC Universe, which means that it will be responsible for the tone and future of the franchise.

Sorry, Blue Beetle.

While James Gunn is still playing his cards close to the chest when it comes to the actual plot of Superman: Legacy, enough has been revealed (or strongly rumored) that we decided to put together everything we know about the movie right now.

We are going to have to wait until 2025 to actually to see the movie, but we’ve done the homework for you, just like Warner Bros apparently wants us all to do.

‘Superman: Legacy’ Inspirations

James Gunn has been clear about one thing: Superman: Legacy will not be another origin story for the Man of Steel, much like the rival Marvel Cinematic Universe did away with explaining how Peter Parker became Spider-Man when the Tom Holland version was introduced in Captain America: Civil War (2016).

Instead, James Gunn has said that the movie will feature a younger version of Clark Kent than we are used to seeing, as he adapts to life in Metropolis and learns the ropes as a reporter at the Daily Planet. It sounds more like the movie is something of a coming-of-age story, which is interesting considering the source material Gunn has referenced.

DC Studios has referenced Superman: Birthright, Superman: Brainiac, Superman: Ending Battle, and All-Star Superman as inspirations for the upcoming movie. In particular, James Gunn has specifically mentioned All-Star Superman as a primary source for the tone of the movie, although that does not mean that the movie will necessarily replicate its plot in any way.

However, the Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely series prominently invoked the tone of a lighter Silver Age Superman than the grimmer Zack Snyder version we have since seen in films, so we likely can expect that we will have a more humorous yet philosophical Man of Steel in Superman: Legacy.

The Cast Confirmed So Far:

Superman

Obviously, Superman: Legacy will star the Big Blue Boy Scout, though that has not been without controversy. The dying embers of the DC Extended Universe last saw Superman appear in Black Adam, Dwayne Johnson’s attempt to rally the franchise around him, in a post-credits cameo that promised an epic brawl between the two characters.

However, much like the Darkseid battle promised by Zack Snyder’s Justice League (2021), such is not to be. Unexpectedly, Henry Cavill was passively ousted from the role of Clark Kent; James Gunn has denied reports that Cavill was fired and put it more as he wasn’t hired back for the character.

While a sizable contingent of DC fans are still fuming that Henry Cavill will no longer be the official Kryptonian superhero (even as Gal Gadot is reportedly still in her role as Wonder Woman), it has been announced that David Corenswet will portray Superman in the upcoming movie.

The casting appears to have been made at least in part to reflect James Gunn’s vision of a younger, less experienced Superman, so it will be interesting to see how David Corenswet balances the difference between the most powerful being in the world and a guy from Kansas still figuring things out.

Lois Lane

We also will likely never have a Superman movie that does not involve intrepid Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane in some capacity, even if Superman III (1983) did sideline her in favor of Richard Pryor.

It appears that Superman: Legacy will feature Lois Lane far more than that, given that at least part of the plot has been described as a workplace comedy involving Clark Kent and Lane. Many modern portrayals of Lane depict her as a far more experienced and aggressive journalist than Kent (Ol’ Smallville himself), so it seems likely that the new movie will fall in that direction.

Lois Lane was portrayed most recently by Amy Adams in the DCEU, beginning in Man of Steel (2013). However, much like Henry Cavill, Adams was not invited back for James Gunn’s new DCU, and the role has been recast with Rachel Brosnahan.

The Lesser Known Characters

While the characters of Clark Kent and Lois Lane are some of the best-known in all of modern pop history, James Gunn has revealed that Superman: Legacy will feature some pretty obscure characters from DC Comics lore. This makes a lot of sense, considering it comes from the writer/director behind Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), the most obscure Marvel superhero team to become megastars in the toy aisle.

However, many casual moviegoers could probably use a reminder of who some of these weirdos are, and we are here to guide you around the more dusty corners of the DC Universe.

Hawkgirl

Of all the secondary characters that James Gunn has announced will appear in Superman: Legacy, Hawkgirl might be the most familiar to audiences, if only because her male counterpart Hawkman (Aldis Hodge) recently appeared in Black Adam.

However, it is fair to say that the Hawk family has one of the most tangled, convoluted backstories in the entire canon of DC Comics, to the point that the company gets confused about exactly what Hawkgirl and Hawkman are about.

The original Golden Age Hawkgirl (created by Gardner Fox and artist Dennis Neville) was the reincarnation of an Egyptian princess who fought crime through the simple method of smashing things with a giant mace. However, she was updated in the 1960s by Gardner and Joe Kubert to now be an alien space cop from planet Thanagar who came to Earth in pursuit of a space criminal. At some point, those two stories merged, separated again, and Hawkgirl was, at one point, revealed to be the earthbound version of a kind of Biblical angel.

However confusing that may be, it is nothing compared to the most recent version of Hawkgirl, who will be portrayed in Superman: Legacy by Isabela Merced.

The Kendra Saunders version of the character that Isabela Merced will portray was a human woman who died and whose body was inhabited by the spirit of the Golden Age Hawkgirl, who initially believed herself to be the human Saunders. Also, in some sense, she was still from Thanagar and had some (but not all) memories from all her different incarnations.

It is unclear exactly how Isabela Merced will be portraying Hawkgirl, but we will just have to trust James Gunn will find a way to streamline things.

Metamorpho

In contrast, the backstory of Metamorpho is relatively simple. As often happens with Golden Age characters, Egypt is once again involved.

Metamorpho (created by Bob Haney and Ramona Fradon) is the superhero name of Rex Mason (an awesomely old-fashioned name), an all-purpose adventurer hired by an evil industrialist to steal the Orb of Ra, a mysterious Egyptian artifact. As it turned out, the Orb was made out of a radioactive meteorite, and exposure to it transformed Mason into an inhuman, indestructible creature with the ability to transform his body into any naturally occurring element.

However, that would not be complicated enough for comic books, so it eventually turns out that Metamorpho is just one of many humans transformed by the Egyptian god Ra as his servants in a battle against a snake deity; at times, he was joined by a female counterpart who called herself Element Girl.

Metamorpho will be portrayed by Anthony Carrigan in Superman: Legacy, although his relationship with the Kryptonian is still unknown.

In DC Comics lore, Anthony Carrigan’s character is an important hero and is frequently a member of the Justice League. He is also a tragic hero in the classical sense, able to transform his invulnerable body into any element but unable to appear human or pass as normal by putting on a pair of glasses.

Anthony Carrigan is best known for his soulfully comedic work on HBO’s Barry, so it will be fun to see how he brings humanity to a character who has been stripped of it.

Mr Terrific

James Gunn seems to have a real fondness for Golden Age superheroes, because the third of the announced supporting characters to appear in Superman: Legacy is another one of them: Mr Terrific.

We’ll put an asterisk on that because this particular version of Mr Teriffic (to be played by Edi Gathegi) is the modern-era Mr Terrific, who took on the persona originated by Terry Sloane (created by Charles Reizenstein and Hal Sharp).

The first Mr Terrific was a self-made millionaire, Olympian, and martial artist whose origin story is darkly rooted in suicidal ennui. Terry Sloane’s mastery of every part of human skill basically depressed him and drove him to contemplate killing himself until he decided fighting crime would be a better idea.

However, Superman: Legacy will feature Edi Gathegi as Michael Holt, a similarly brilliant and physically perfect man who is driven to suicidal thoughts by the deaths of his wife and daughter. The character (created by John Ostrander and Tom Mandrake) encounters the supernatural force known as the Spectre, who inspires him to superheroics and take on the mantle of Mr Terrific.

Edi Gathegi’s character is a technological genius and basically a friendly rival to Batman (who owns Holt’s company in comics lore), but most notably, is one of the few DC Comics characters whose character is fundamentally rooted in his skepticism of spirituality and religion.

It would be interesting if Mr Terrific is a counterpoint to Superman’s sense of faith in the upcoming movie, both as a human and a hero, but we’ll just have to see.

Guy Gardner

Of all the heroes that James Gunn has revealed will appear in Superman: Legacy, Guy Gardner is the sole non-Golden Age character. However, his inclusion in the movie does appear to be a reason to cast Gunn’s buddy Nathan Fillion, so that probably evens out.

Guy Gardner is best known as one of the most prominent characters to have carried the role of Green Lantern, which is how he will be portrayed in the film. Gardner was created by John Broome and Gil Kane but heavily revamped by Steve Englehart and Joe Staton into the version best known to most DC Comics fans: a big dumb galoot.

Originally, Guy Gardner was one of two humans deemed to be worthy of using a Green Lantern power ring when the alien space cop (DC has a lot of space cops) Abin Sur crash-landed on Earth. However, it turns out that Hal Jordan was slightly closer in physical proximity, so he got to be a superhero first.

While Nathan Fillion’s character was initially depicted as a fairly generic character, Englehart and Staton’s version of the character was a cocky, kinda-dumb, and macho lunkhead who still managed to be an interstellar superhero. Over the years, Guy Gardner has been a Green Lantern, an unaffiliated hero with a yellow power ring (it’s complicated), a shapeshifting human-alien hybrid, and a prominent member of the Justice League.

If we had to guess, it’s likely that the Nathan Fillion version of the character will lean into the “bonehead with a bowl-cut” version of the character and serve as an introduction to the more cosmic aspects of the DC Universe.

At the moment, there are a few characters that have been rumored to join Superman: Legacy (including Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor and the world-shrinking menace Brainiac), but we’ll update those as they are confirmed!

Based on the 1966 tv show created by Bruce Geller, the Mission Impossible franchise centres around Ethan Hunt, an agent of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF), and the missions he and his team embark upon to combat enemy forces and prevent global disasters. The films have been well-received by critics and audiences, making this one of the highest-grossing and most acclaimed movie franchises of all time. Released in 2018, Mission Impossible Fallout is the highest-grossing film in the series (so far), with the most recent entry to the franchise being Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One. Part Two, which is also said to be the final movie in the franchise, is set for release in 2024.


While there are many metrics that can be looked at to judge the success of an action movie franchise – the level of stunts, the car chases, the action choreography – there is one particular metric that can accurately determine the epic scale of a franchise – its kill count.

The Mission Impossible movies, in particular, have a significantly high kill count, which isn’t surprising considering the IMG agents in the centre of them. So, without further ado, let’s take a closer look at the full kill count of the Mission Impossible movies.

A look at the kill count in ‘Mission Impossible’ movies’

Mission: Impossible (1996)

In the first Mission Impossible movie, we were introduced to the iconic Ethan Hunt in the most dire of circumstances – he was framed for the murders of his teammates during a failed mission to recover the NOC list. The film then focuses on Ethan’s endeavours to clear his name and catch the true culprit within the force while being pursued by his own agency.

The total kill count in this film stands at a relatively small number – nine. However, as you’re about to see, things are only going to be scaling up from here. Speaking of which…

Mission: Impossible 2 (2000)

In Mission: Impossible 2, Ethan Hunt is tasked with recovering a deadly virus, Chimera, created by agent Sean Ambrose. Ambrose plans to unleash the virus and then sell its antidote for enormous profits. To foil his plans, Hunt recruits a thief, Nyah, who has a romantic history with Ambrose.

In the first sequel, it is estimated that the approximate body count stands at a … wait for it…. jaw-dropping 108 kills! This is largely thanks to the action-filled climax where … spoiler alert … Hunt manages to destroy the virus and save the world from a devastating pandemic.

Mission: Impossible 3 (2006)

Mission: Impossible 3 revolves around a retired Ethan Hunt leading a quiet and simple life with his fiancée Julia. However, things change when he is pulled back into action after his former student, Lindsey Farris, is kidnapped by arms dealer Owen Davian. When Lindsey gets killed, Ethan assembles a team with Luther Stickell and Declan Gormley to look for Davian and bring him to justice.

The film dials things down a notch with a kill count of 26. However, think of this as the calm before the storm. Which brings us to…

Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)

Released in 2011, Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol finds Ethan Hunt and his team being disowned after getting framed for a terrorist attack on the Kremlin. With all the chaos unleashed in the world, the team must go rogue to clear their names and stop a nuclear extremist, Kurt Hendricks, from destroying the world. To achieve this objective, Ethan’s team embarks on a global mission that includes dangerous challenges and thrilling stunts. Throughout their intense journey, they eliminate numerous adversaries, resulting in a whopping 225 kills. Ultimately, they manage to destroy Hendricks’ chaotic plot and prevent a catastrophic nuclear war.

Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015)

In this film, Ethan Hunt faces the deadly organisation called the Syndicate, led by Solomon Lane. With the IMF disbanded, Hunt and his team, including Benji Dunn and Ilsa Faust, go undercover to expose the Syndicate’s disturbing plans. The action-packed mission takes them across the globe, with the team registering approximately 36 kills during the course of the movie. Ultimately, Hunt and his team dismantle the Syndicate and curb their destructive plans.

Mission: Impossible – Fallout (2018)

In Mission: Impossible – Fallout, Ethan Hunt and his team face the consequences of a failed mission to recover stolen plutonium cores. Because of their failure, the Apostles, a terrorist group led by John Lark and White Widow, is threatening a global demolition. During his mission, Hunt must navigate new alliances and confront people from his past, including former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust, to once again, save the world.

Amidst the thrilling stunts and high-stakes action, this instalment sees a total of 71 kills.

Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)

In the recently released Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One, Ethan Hunt and his IMF colleagues are faced with a critical mission – locating a highly dangerous weapon that is capable of posing a huge threat to mankind if in the wrong hands. As they face a powerful enemy, Hunt realises that nothing is more important than the mission’s success, not even the well-being of his closest companions.

While we aren’t sure about the exact number of kills in the new film Dead Reckoning Part One, we do know that it features at least two deaths – including one of a MAJOR character (no spoilers).

What’s the total number of kills in the ‘Mission Impossible’ movies?

With nine kills in the introductory film, 108 kills in the second film, 26 kills in the third, 225 kills in Ghost Protocol, 36 in Rogue Nation and 71 in Fallout, the total number of kills in the entire Mission Impossible franchise, excluding the latest part, stands at 475. We also know of at least two deaths in the latest film so you can add those to the final count as well.

Well, that total number of kills in the Mission Impossible films makes one thing clear – no one should mess with Ethan Hunt or his team.

,Box-office : Blue Beetle signe l'un des pires démarrages d'un film DC,"Pour sa sortie, le film de super-héros Blue Beetle n'a engrangé que 43,4 millions de dollars dans le monde.","Blue Beetle est un gigantesque flop pour DC. © Warner Bros. Pictures

Cela devait être un renouveau… Et c'est un nouvel échec (de taille) pour un film de super-héros. Blue Beetle, sorti le mercredi 16 août 2023 en France et ce week-end aux États-Unis, a signé l'un des pires démarrages au box-office pour une adaptation DC Comics. Pire que Shazam 2 Blue Beetle a beau trôner à la première place du box-office américain ce week-end, son règne est amer. Avec 25,4 millions de dollars engrangés lors de ses trois premiers jours d'exploitation outre-Atlantique, l'adaptation du super-héros DC fait pire que The Suicide Squad (26,2 millions), Shazam : la rage des dieux (30,1 millions) et Birds of Prey (33 millions).

Blue Beetle n'a récolté que 43 millions de dollars au box-office pour sa sortie. © Warner Bros. Pictures

Si on omet Wonder Woman 1984, sorti dans la période exceptionnelle de la Covid et qui n'ayant récolté que 16,7 millions de dollars, ce long-métrage subit le pire début s'agissant de super-héros. Une introduction terrible pour le justicier hispanique censé constituer la première pierre du futur univers de James Gunn.

Cet échec total se confirme dans le monde avec un cumul de 43,4 millions de dollars. Le film avait certes un budget modeste (104 millions), mais cela n'empêchera pas Warner de perdre beaucoup d'argent, après les douloureux échecs de The Flash et Shazam 2.

Certes, Barbie a perdu sa couronne, mais n'est pas mal lotie. Pour sa cinquième semaine d'exploitation, le film avec Margot Robbie engrange 21,5 millions de dollars et totalise 567 millions sur le sol étasunien pour un cumul monde impressionnant de 1,279 milliard. Encore un petit effort et la poupée pourra détrôner Super Mario Bros, le film et son 1,355 milliard de dollars au titre de plus gros succès 2023. En troisième place cette semaine, Oppenheimer tient aussi bien la longueur. L'œuvre atteint 717 millions de dollars au box-office mondial et dépasse Interstellar (715 millions) pour devenir le quatrième plus gros succès du réalisateur Christopher Nolan, derrière Inception (825 millions), The Dark Knight (1,003 milliard) et The Dark Knight Rises (1,081 milliard).

En fin de période de vacances, le box-office a livré son verdict. Les grands vainqueurs sont évidemment Barbie et Oppenheimer. Du côté des perdants, Disney accuse le coup avec les échecs consécutifs d'Indiana Jones 5, Élémentaire et La Maison hantée. Tom Cruise et son Mission: Impossible 7 ont également souffert du phénomène “Barbenheimer”. Box-office US du 18 au 20 août 2023

2023-08-15 07:00:27+00:00,Highest-Grossing World War 2 Movies For True Fans Of The Genre,Oppenheimer and Saving Private Ryan are some of the highest-grossing World War 2 movies ever made. Here are the others on the list.,"With a worldwide gross of over USD 600 million, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is now the highest-grossing of all World War 2 movies ever made. It surpassed the director’s own film, Dunkirk (2017), which earned USD 512 million worldwide. Nolan is now the only director with two movies, among the 14 biggest earners whose theme is World War 2.

The War, which took place from 1939 to 1945, is a major cinematic genre that is not restricted to Hollywood alone. This is because World War 2 affected almost every country in every continent. Only 14 countries, including Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal and Ireland, maintained official neutrality, but not all of them effectively adhered to it.

Due to the large-scale devastation and long-term impact the war had on the lives of millions of people the world over, any well-scripted story set during the conflict has continued to captivate moviegoers for decades. This is why World War 2, as a theme, includes some of the best movies ever made in cinematic history.

Christopher Nolan’s success with Oppenheimer is proof that the war genre maintains a very strong pull. Indeed, eight of the top 14 highest-grossing World War 2 movies by global revenue have won Academy Awards, with The English Patient (1996) leading the pack with nine wins, including Best Picture.

What are World War 2-related movies?

It is important to note that several movies may be related to World War 2 because of their setting, but where the war itself does not influence the progression of the story. These movies fall primarily in other genres that may or may not have anything to do with the war itself.

One of the biggest examples of such films is The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005), which earned USD 720 million at the box office. Based on the 1950 high fantasy novel of the same name by C. S. Lewis, the story follows four Pevensie children who enter a magical world through a hidden door. Even though it begins with an evacuation of the children during World War 2, it is not a war film as the characters and the story are far removed from the real world of the war.

Similarly, The Others (2001), a supernatural horror film starring Nicole Kidman has a connection to World War 2, but the war is not the subject of the story.

Thus, any list of the best World War 2 movies will include only those films the story is set during the war and the characters, too, are either part of it or directly impacted by it.

2023-08-14 14:58:00+00:00,‘Man of Steel’ Producer Unsure Of DC Universe Return,"Now that James Gunn and Peter Safran have taken over DC Studios, Man of Steel producer Charles Roven is unsure if he’ll return for a new project.","Charles Roven has been an integral producer of DC Studios properties ever since Man of Steel. Now that James Gunn and Peter Safran have taken over with their own plans for the DC Universe, he’s unsure if he’ll return.

While every DC Studios movie has a different creative team, similar names repeat in producing the films. Charles Roven is one of those names, having produced films from The Dark Knight to Man of Steel to James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad. While seemingly an integral part of bringing these superhero films to life, Roven is unsure how he fits into Gunn and Peter Safran’s plans for a new DC Universe, though is open to returning if his friend asks:

“Right now, they’re really rebooting everything, and it’s a little bit unclear to me exactly how finite their desire is to use or not use any DCEU actors in the same roles,” Roven told The Hollywood Reporter. “So I’m not really sure, but at the moment, we’re not really having any discussions. James and I are good friends. My wife and I are very good friends with him and his wife, Jenn [Holland]. And so we see each other socially, but we’re not currently talking about any business. But that could change.”

While producers like Charles Roven don’t get the glitz and glamor as directors and actors, they’re just as integral to a film’s development. James Gunn and Peter Safran have a long road ahead of them in proving their new DC Universe to fans, so having such an experienced producer along for the ride at DC Studios would certainly help ease the load.

The future of the DC Universe

James Gunn and Peter Safran told journalists that their vision for the DC Universe includes locked scripts, wiggle room and a unified storyline across film, teleivsion, animation and video game projects. The two explained that the DC Universe could bring back elements from previous DC regimes, meaning that their eight-to-year plan is not a full reboot.

Blue Beetle and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom are currently in various stages of post-production at Warner Bros. Discovery, with both DC Universe movies slated to hit theaters in 2023. Will the characters from those movies make appearances in the new DCU? Only Gunn and Safran know.

DC lässt den blauen Käfer auf die Kinofans los und holt sich in den USA die Nummer eins der Kinocharts. Ob sich dieser Beetle aber in den Charts besser halten kann als Kollege «Flash»?

Mit dem Blue Beetle ist aktuell ein neuer DC-Actionfilm an den grossen Kinostart gegangen - allerdings mit einem etwas ernüchternden Ergebnis. Denn zwar konnte man mit dem Einspielergebnis von 25 Millionen Dollar in Nordamerika und 43 Millionen weltweit die Führung der US-Kinocharts übernehmen, aber die Zahlen dürften nicht zufriedenstellend sein. So hatte DC-Vorgängerfilm The Flash damals 55 Millionen Dollar am Startwochenende eingespielt, bevor dann, ab der zweiten Woche, der grosse Absturz begann. Black Adam startete sogar mit 67 Millionen Dollar.

Barbie dürfte bald The Super Mario Bros. Movie als erfolgreichsten Film des Jahres ablösen. Es fehlen nur noch sieben Milliönchen, bis der Klempner sich geschlagen geben muss. Vielleicht ist es ja nächste Woche schon so weit. Oppenheimer und Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem liefern weiterhin starke Zahlen. So steht der Dreistünder von Christopher Nolan weltweit schon bei über 700 Millionen Dollar.

Strays ist ein Film über einen von seinem Herrchen verlassenen Hund, der zusammen mit gleichgesinnten Vierbeinern auf Revanche-Tour geht. Mit Stimmen von Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx und Will Forte dürfte es da recht witzig zu- und hergehen. Das Einspielergebnis am ersten Wochenende von nur acht Millionen Dollar lässt uns am Erfolg dieses Konzeptes aber etwas zweifeln. Bei uns geht der Spass Ende August an den Start.

Gruselfilme wie Talk to me, Haunted Mansion oder auch The Last Voyage of the Demeter haben es wegen der Konkurrenz nicht einfach und performen entsprechend auf den hinteren Positionen der Top Ten.

Nächstes Weekend liegt der Fokus auf Gran Turismo. Bei uns ist der Rennfahrerfilm mit Orlando Bloom und David Harbour nach der ersten Spielwoche auf Platz vier der Charts zu finden. Wir sind gespannt, ob es in Nordamerika bis auf die oberste Treppe reicht. Dafür müsste aber erst «Barbenheimer» überwunden und der Blue Beetle geschlagen werden.

Is there a post-credit sequence after the credits?,"For those wondering whether or not there’s an Ahsoka episode 4 end credits scene or post-credit sequence, this article provides the definitive answer without any spoilers. Here’s what you need to know about any potential Ahsoka episode 4 post-credit scene.

Does Ahsoka episode 4 have an end credits scene?

No, Ahsoka episode 4 does not have an end credits scene.

There is nothing after the fourth episode’s credits. This means that you can safely exit the show and put something else on. Don’t worry, you won’t be missing any big reveals. It’s just names upon names and then a dramatic fade to black.

While there’s now an expectation for superhero movies and TV shows to save big reveals for after the credits, Star Wars content rarely does this. Instead, any reveals are usually included at the very end of an episode or film. This ensures that the entire audience sees it, while after-credits scenes can often be missed by those who turn the TV off too early or are too quick to leave the cinema.

Though the first four episodes haven’t had anything extra sequences after the credits, it’s still possible that future installments will have a bonus scene. Therefore, for those who are worried about missing any bonus content, it’s a good idea to find articles like this one for confirmation.

For now, you can continue to assume that Ahsoka does not have post-credits scenes. However, you still might want to stick around for the names of the people who helped to create the series, as a way of showing that you appreciate the work they have done.

It’s been five weeks since Blue Beetle released, and yet it’s even lagging a million miles behind the majority of the superhero genre’s modest hits.

Having passed $67 million domestically and $115 million worldwide, the origin story of Jaime Reyes has at least recouped its production costs in ticket sales, but profitability is a long way away. It’s a shame when the film comfortably ranks as one of the rare bright spots to have arrived amid a sea of near-constant darkness for the beleaguered franchise, but it’s still nigh-on impossible to find a commercial silver lining.

To put things into perspective, Eternals is generally viewed as one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s most notable misfires after becoming its first installment ever – and still just one of two – to secure an unwanted Rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes, as well as being one of the superhero sandbox’s lowest-grossing entries in recent memories after barely scraping past $400 million worldwide.

And yet, Academy Award winner Chloe Zhao’s millennia-spanning epic still managed to bring in $71 million through its first three days on domestic screens, which is more than Blue Beetle has cobbled together in total since landing on Aug. 18.

As a result, we’ve been left in the bizarre situation where the Guardians of the Galaxy filmmaker and co-CEO of DC Studios has been left to wade into some truly unexpected waters, whether he’s denying he had a word with the comic book division to bump up the presence of the character his wife plays in live-action, or incredulously shooting down the rumors he’d cast a porn star as Superman: Legacy‘s Lex Luthor.

The latest umbrage born against Gunn technically doesn’t have anything to do with DC, but somebody still felt it was the wisest course of action to chastise him on Threads for theaters across the country having the gall to screen an age-appropriate trailer for incoming horror sequel The Nun II right before Blue Beetle.

It probably wasn’t even worth his time to respond, but the writer and director nonetheless offered an explanation that the original poster somehow didn’t reach themselves, noting that “I’m not putting the trailers on movies,” which is a call ironed out between Warner Bros. and its various distributors.

The downside is that not many people will have a similar complaint, seeing as Blue Beetle is failing to catch fire as it heads towards the DCU’s lowest-grossing opening weekend ever, bar the pandemic-afflicted Wonder Woman 1984.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3dlZ290dGhpc2NvdmVyZWQuY29tL2NlbGVicml0aWVzL2NsZWFybHktcnVubmluZy1vdXQtb2YtdGhpbmdzLXRvLWJsYW1lLW9uLWphbWVzLWd1bm4taGVzLW5vdy1nZXR0aW5nLWJsYXN0ZWQtZm9yLXRoZS10cmFpbGVycy10aGF0LXBsYXktYmVmb3JlLWJsdWUtYmVldGxlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

,Blue Beetle and adidas Perfectly Aligned? #archwritingprompts – ARCH-USA,,"Spread the love Tweet

Conversion, in math and life, is difficult. In marketing it might be the hardest aspect of growing a business. In sportswear, a conversion happens throughout several points of engagement with a potential consumer. There is the moment of introduction, there is an attempt to reinforce and then a brand has to take both organic and paid engagements and move a potential fan into the funnel. All of these things require the target to accept and form a mental and emotional connection to an inanimate product that has millions of alternatives available all vying to become a part of the uniform of the individual. There are a variety of obstacles between the introduction and eventual wearing of the brand. Add in complex intrusions, an influencer or endorsed person saying or doing offensive things, and the process of conversion takes even longer. adidas is a brand facing a mountainous conversion of the consumer process even in a week of amazing emotional sports moments, Noah Lyles, and big screen promo in one of the most transformative superhero films for an underrepresented community in film.

adidas pulled an impressive funnel towards conversion with inclusion into DC’s Blue Beetle. It’s unclear if this was a paid placement, but it was definitely smart. Blue Beetle can be considered the Latino community’s Black Panther moment. The film was led by Xolo Maridueña, of Cobra Kai, which immediately ingratiates Blue Beetle to a new generation. The longstanding Blue Beetle character is an unknown to those who aren’t comic fans so tying the origin story to an actor who is adored from an amazing relaunch of a loved film series was a smart move. This isn’t a movie review so instead of delving into that aspect, it’s important to… convert. In the opening scenes Xolo, Jaime Reyes, is rocking a pair of Sambas. In several important moments the sneakers can be seen prominently.

Throughout the film adidas is obviously his favorite brand, there is a moment when he ‘converts’ to the Blue Beetle and his adidas Forum 84s are exploded. He screams in an exasperated, comedic tone, “Not my 84s, those are my favorite shoes.” It’s akin to the sneakerhead meme moment in Black Panther where Shuri says to T’Challa, “What are those?” The adidas moments in the film aren’t intrusive and they allow The Three Stripes to connect to a community that supports the brand because of soccer and a geography that has seen considerable growth for adidas. “The Latin Revenues in Latin America increased 44% on a currency-neutral basis. In euro terms, sales in Latin America improved 46% to € 2,110 million from € 1,446 million in 2021. On a currency-neutral basis, this improvement was driven by strong double-digit growth in both Performance and Lifestyle.” adidas report

Film allows for an emotional connection to a consumer, but paid placement is often so obvious it disrupts the storytelling. Did you have an opportunity to see Blue Beetle? I loved the movie and found myself headnodding to an amazing soundtrack that felt like I was kicking it in Chicano Park in San Diego. When Jaime takes on the entire enemy den in the obligatory kick ass moment of the film, and Cypress Hill’s “Ain’t Going Out Like That” plays, I was hyped. Will that moment make me go out and buy a pair of Sambas? Is this a perfect alignment and does it matter?",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vYXJjaC11c2EuY29tL2JsdWUtYmVldGxlLWFuZC1hZGlkYXMtcGVyZmVjdGx5LWFsaWduZWQtYXJjaHdyaXRpbmdwcm9tcHRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,Blue Beetle movie review & film summary (2023),"Blue Beetle might not break the mold, but it does break expectations.","While the Blue Beetle character dates back to 1939, the updated, culturally specific incarnation of Jaime Reyes didn’t grace DC pages until 2006. Since then, comic book movies have become the center of American pop culture. But those films have only recently attempted to touch every corner of human existence. Marvel Studios has, for instance, the “Black Panther” series and “Eternals,” Sony has the animated “Spider-Man,” while DCU has “Black Adam,” “Aquaman,” “Birds of Prey,” and, to a lesser extent, the “Justice League” film. While diverse, the DCU movies have mostly avoided locking characters into any sort of cultural specificity. “Blue Beetle” marks a sharp break from that unwritten edict.
Directed by Ángel Manuel Soto (“Charm City Kings”), this heartwarming, crowd-pleasing comic book flick is less serious and more colorful than the tonally dour mood of many contemporary superhero films.
A mountain of love falls fast when Jaime (an endearing Xolo Maridueña) arrives home from college to the fictional Palmera City; hugs, jokes, and genuine affection compose these early scenes. But all's not well with the Reyes family: Jaime’s father, Alberto (Damián Alcázar), recently lost his auto shop business. Now, Jaime’s childhood home is in danger of being repossessed by Kord Industry. Despite his pre-law degree, Jaime struggles to land a job. He goes to work with his younger waggish sister Milagro (Belissa Escobedo) as help at a resort.
Much of “Blue Beetle” concerns the economic disparity between the haves and have-nots, particularly regarding imperialist powers. A person like Jaime can do all the right things: go to college, remain humble, and be pleasant—yet his background, a poor Mexican residing in the disadvantaged Edge Keys neighborhood, will always limit his future. However, he thinks he finds a lifeline when he steps in between the philanthropic Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine) and her ruthless aunt Victoria. Though Victoria fires him, Jenny offers him a job if he’ll meet with her the next day at Kord headquarters.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvZ2VyZWJlcnQuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtbW92aWUtcmV2aWV3LTIwMjPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-16 21:15:44+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’ Review: A Hero Story That’s All in the Family,The plot is boilerplate and the superhero is not particularly compelling. At least his family members steal the show.,"Here’s what Warner Bros. and DC think we need: another superhero movie about an earnest young man suddenly forced to shoulder responsibility and fight for justice.
Here’s what we actually need: A superhero movie about a badass nana with a secret revolutionary past. Guess which movie “Blue Beetle,” premiering in theaters Friday, delivers?
However, credit must be given for including a rebel grandmother, who, though not the movie’s titular superhero, is one-fifth of the lovable Mexican family that enlivens this paint-by-numbers superhero film, directed by Ángel Manuel Soto and written by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer.
The actual protagonist is Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña), a fresh-faced college graduate who arrives home to find his family struggling financially. Reyes is fruitlessly casting around for a job until he meets Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine), the chic heiress of Kord Industries, a colossal tech company run by her great-aunt, Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon). When Jenny hands Jaime a stolen scarab hidden in a fast-food box, Jaime discovers the beetle is a sentient piece of ancient alien tech that has a mind of its own. It fuses with Jaime, protecting him and granting him the ability to fly, heal quickly and create any weapon he imagines. As Victoria aims to recover the beetle to create armies of destruction, Jaime must prevent her from getting it and keep his family — and the world — safe.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMTYvbW92aWVzL2JsdWUtYmVldGxlLXJldmlldy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-16 17:00:00+00:00,Blue Beetle is the kitschy sort of superhero throwback DC should have been making years ago,Blue Beetle — in theaters August 18th from director Ángel Manuel Soto — feels like the result of Warner Bros. pulling from Marvel’s old MCU playbook to a fault.,"Even if it weren’t being positioned as one of the first projects introducing audiences to Warner Bros.’ shiny new cinematic universe of films based on DC Comics characters, director Ángel Manuel Soto’s Blue Beetle movie would still have all the makings of a proper franchise starter. Unlike many of the studio’s superhero features from before James Gunn and Peter Safran came on to lead its efforts, Blue Beetle feels like the end result of a creative team thoughtfully executing a plan to replicate certain elements of what’s made rival studio Marvel’s films so successful — and not just Warner Bros. clumsily trying to play catch-up.
In Blue Beetle and its celebration of Mexican culture, you can plainly see the outsize influence that Marvel’s blockbusters like Black Panther have had on Warner Bros.’ thinking about what makes for a good origin story. But for all the promise Blue Beetle has, it unfolds like such a studied recreation of the hits that have come before it that the movie ends up feeling like an awkward throwback that should have been in theaters a decade ago.
Set in an aggressively neon corner of DC’s multiverse where masked vigilantes don’t seem to be a thing most people regularly think about, Blue Beetle tells the story of how recent college graduate Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) unwittingly becomes a superhero after a chance encounter with a strange bug-like piece of technology that fuses itself to his nervous system.
As the eldest child born to two proud immigrants who upended their lives in Mexico in order to start new futures in the US, Jaime feels a deep obligation to make his entire family proud. Jaime wants his father Alberto (Damián Alcázar) and his mother Rocio (Elpidia Carrillo) to know how much he appreciates everything they’ve done to give him and his sister Milagro (Belissa Escobedo) opportunities to succeed. That love also extends to Jaime’s sewing-obsessed grandmother Nana (Adriana Barraza) and his conspiracy theory-minded uncle Rudy (George Lopez). Even though they all take joy in embarrassing him at every opportunity they get, he’s able to take it in stride because he understands that’s just how his family expresses affection.
Whereas you could usually expect the civilian loved ones of a fledgling hero in the making to recede into the background as this kind of movie’s focus turns toward the fantastic, Blue Beetle pulls the other Reyeses even closer to Jaime as its story kicks into gear. It’s an interesting choice that’s meant to make Jaime’s transformation into the Blue Beetle feel distinct from other superhero movie narratives where young people are whisked away from everything they know while saving the world. It’s also one of the film’s ways of lovingly depicting the Reyeses as the average kind of tight-knit Latino family unit that audiences can recognize and see themselves in.
It’s actually kind of impressive how Blue Beetle manages to frame Jaime’s entire immediate family as his answer to your average superhero’s Guy in the Chair without really feeling like it’s stretching itself too thin by sending them all off to deal with different subplots. But that feat is somewhat undercut by the way that Blue Beetle uses much of its (thankfully breezy) two-hour runtime to tell a tale so rote and by the numbers that it feels like it’s mostly trying to play to younger theatergoers who just haven’t seen all that many of these types of movies yet.
In stark contrast to the Reyes family and the strong performances that bring their novel on-screen dynamic to life, Blue Beetle’s power-hungry villain Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) and her rebellious niece Jenny (Bruna Marquezine) are written with a noted lack of depth that leaves neither actor with all that much to sink their teeth into.
Though Blue Beetle brings all of its players together with an action-packed plot that puts Jaime forth as the one person capable of stopping Victoria — a war profiteer whose casual racism is embodied in her dark relationship with a man known as Carapax (Raoul Max Trujillo) — from becoming a global threat, it does so in a way that feels surprisingly dated.
There’s a lot about Blue Beetle that makes it seem like a well-polished relic from the bygone era of comic book films when Halle Berry was still doing double duty as Catwoman and Storm. The movie’s cheesy sense of humor and its whiz-bang action sequences — which put Jaime in the passenger’s seat as the Blue Beetle suit’s built-in artificial intelligence Khaji Da (Becky G) takes over his body — may delight kids and passionate comic book fans who are just hyped to see their favorite character in live action. But viewers hoping to get a taste of the new and improved approach to telling DC stories that Gunn and company have insisted DC Studios is committed to are likely to find Blue Beetle rather lacking despite all of its heart.
Viewers might be intrigued to see just what all Blue Beetle has to say and tease about the future that Warner Bros. and DC are cooking up for other heroes who, one imagines, Maridueña’s Jaime will end up meeting at some point in the near future. But by the time Blue Beetle’s end credits start rolling ahead of a pretty predictable mid-credits teaser, there’s just as solid a chance you’ll find yourself thinking that it would have been more memorable had Warner Bros. not taken so long to get it into theaters.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMzgzMzQ3NS9ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1tb3ZpZS1yZXZpZXfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-20 07:00:40+00:00,Blue Beetle review – superhero fun with immigrant survival subtext,How will a law graduate use beetle-based powers to help his beleaguered Latino family? Believable dynamics and boisterous comedy add charm to a familiar genre,"Cinemagoers could be forgiven for suffering from superhero fatigue of late, with outings such as Black Adam, The Flash, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and Shazam! Fury of the Gods failing to match spectacle with anything vaguely approaching substance. This latest offering from DC (and its extended universes) is a little different, focusing on a believable Latino family whose lively interaction really powers the drama. Directed by Puerto Rican-born film-maker Ángel Manuel Soto, it has something of the anarchic charm of Robert Rodriguez’s Spy Kids flicks, albeit welded to the chassis of a franchise-launching DC FX vehicle.
Originally intended to go straight to the streaming service HBO Max, Blue Beetle may be frontloaded with visual fireworks that neatly meld the practical and the virtual, but it is the likable interplay between its down-to-earth characters that gives the film oomph, making it more than just a Shazam-style romp.
Rising star Xolo Maridueña (best known for the Netflix series Cobra Kai) is excellently cast as Jaime Reyes, the Gotham law school graduate who returns home to find that his family is destitute, in danger of losing their house. “I’m gonna get the money to save this place,” Jaime assures his sister, Milagro (Belissa Escobedo), looking out over Palmera City – the fictional replacement for the comic-strip’s El Paso, Texas.
But when the benevolent industrialist Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine) offers to help him find a job, Jaime instead becomes welded to a biotechnical scarab – a glowing creature (“is that the new Tamagochi?”) that turns him into an armour-plated blue avenger with a mysterious inner voice (think Iron Man, but without the option of stepping out of the suit).
Wicked warmonger Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) had planned to use the beetle to power her One Man Army Corps – a range of Robocop-style weaponised law-enforcers. Now she must track down Jaime and extract his newly found superpowers, with inevitably fatal consequences.
It wouldn’t be half as much fun were it not for the boisterous dinner-table vibe that drives the film
“We’re invisible to people like that,” Milagro tells her brother, “It’s kind of our superpower”, a line that rings through Mexican-born writer Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer’s script, unexpectedly recalling a key plot point from Wim Wenders’ underrated 1997 drama The End of Violence.
Later, when Jaime’s family is confronted with the awful realities of their son’s predicament (“What do you think Kord’s gonna do when they find out some Mexican kid has that kind of military tech inside them?”), invisibility vanishes, leaving them exposed and endangered. Good job grandma Nana (Adriana Barraza) has a revolutionary past (“Down with the imperialists!”) and isn’t afraid to get back in the game.
“People think crossing the border’s hard,” says Jaime’s Uncle Rudy (George Lopez), a DIY tech-whiz who gets machines working by kicking them, and who frequently steals the movie. “You know what’s hard? The next 20 years.”
Meanwhile, spiralling CG visuals intertwine with Polish cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski’s sinewy camera moves, ensuring that our eyeballs are kept spinning even as our heartstrings are gently plucked.
There’s a slapstick quality to the action scenes that fits the film’s comedic tone, injecting pathos and humour into sequences that might otherwise descend into smashy-crashy tedium. As for the human-mechanoid transformation scenes, they are an alarming amalgam of Venom-style possession riffs from the Marvel Universe, and the flesh-and-metal squishiness of Shinya Tsukamoto’s Tetsuo: The Iron Man.
Nods to Japanese giant-monster “kaiju” flicks and Mexican “luchador” wrestling movies rub shoulders with good-natured messages about embracing your destiny and standing by your kith and kin, which never descend into the empty platitudes of the Fast and Furious movies.
This is, first and foremost, fun – and it wouldn’t be half as much fun were it not for the boisterous dinner-table vibe that drives the film. Composer Bobby Krlic’s score features a bombastic theme reminiscent of John Williams’ Imperial March from the Star Wars series, but it is the softer notes that get under the skin and tickle our insides.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjMvYXVnLzIwL2JsdWUtYmVldGxlLXJldmlldy1zdXBlcmhlcm8tZnVuLXdpdGgtaW1taWdyYW50LXN1cnZpdmFsLXN1YnRleHTSAW1odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZmlsbS8yMDIzL2F1Zy8yMC9ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1yZXZpZXctc3VwZXJoZXJvLWZ1bi13aXRoLWltbWlncmFudC1zdXJ2aXZhbC1zdWJ0ZXh0?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-23 10:39:54+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’ Review: Familia es el Corazón y Alma,"Anthony Flagg shares his thoughts on DC's newest hero in his Blue Beetle Spoiler review, starring Xolo Maridueña and George Lopez!","Share this:
It’s been an interesting year to be a DC fan, beginning with James Gunn’s announcement of the all-new DCU back in January. With his announcement, the end of the decade-long era known as the DCEU had reached its conclusion, with just a few movies left before DC officially rebooted its superhero world. Back in June, The Flash premiered, to varying levels of success depending on who you asked, ending its box office run with a dismal amount of profit. While The Flash was only the most recent film, the pattern of profitability and general appeal to the audience seems to have dwindled since Gunn’s presentation, bringing the investment down greatly for many fans. However, with the newest DC release, Blue Beetle, perhaps that pattern’s about to change. Read on to find out exactly what I thought!
[Warning: Spoilers from DC’s Blue Beetle are below!]
Ánimo Jaime & Reyes!
After what feels like a lifetime (or mine at least) we’ve got our first full outing of a DC Latino superhero on the big screen. Xolo Maridueña is a stand-out as the scarab-infused Jaime Reyes also known as the Blue Beetle. The film follows him on the journey of growing from a no-name into his own. It’ll ignite your insides just like your abuela’s pozole on a lazy Sunday and then follows up with the big hug they’re known for giving.
While Jaime is only a recent addition to comic book characters (2006!), this adaptation should inspire a wave of fans to discover him.
DC Showcase: Blue Beetle: Graduation Day Comics Review
La Llegada (del Escarabajo Azul)
There are no mincing words – Xolo Maridueña is a star. Dare I say, perfect casting for Jaime Reyes. The rest of the family cast were equally incredible and the changes for Milagro (Belissa Escobedo) from a kid to a teenager are welcome.
Filling out the parental roles are Damian Alcazar and Elpidia Carrillo as Alberto and Rocio Reyes, and Adriana Barraza as Jaime’s grandmother. As a Latino myself, family is so important and the director Angel Manuel Soto was masterful in incorporating all the distinctive flairs of a standard household. So often there were little moments between Jaime and his family where I could mentally drag and drop myself into it with my own relatives.
Un Cachito de lo Nuestro
Truly what elevated the feature for me were these exact relationships. While Jaime is of course the lead of this story, every one of the Reyes were equal pillars holding up their meager yet loving home. What is a Latino household if not full of family?
This of course means they added a fun element in the form of Uncle Rudy, portrayed by famed Mexican-American actor and comedian, George Lopez. Every young man needs a good Tio and Rudy is amongst the best. While he shoulders the lion’s share of the comedic relief, Lopez provides a couple of powerful and emotional inspirations through Jaime’s journey. Whether it’s deploying El Chapulin, (a red and yellow jammer machine named after an esteemed comedy show from Mexico) or hacking into Ted Kord’s personal Bug Lair and personal computer, Rudy is always there for Jaime.
Beyond the Reyes, there’s another family that is integral to the story: the Kords. So much mystery is wrapped up within Ted Kord’s disappearance and the handoff of Kord Industries. At times I feel as if Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) was behind it but this feels like a theory topic for later on down the road.
As soon as she came on screen, I was smitten with Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine) embodying her father’s values. Being a thorn in the side of her Aunt Vicky might be standard, but Jenny’s paranoia pays off when everything she fears is already happening. Namely, the militarization of technology powered by the code from the Scarab to make O.M.A.C. (One Man Army Corps) machines.
Cosmic Circle Ep. 38: Blue Beetle Movie Discussion (Spoilers)
Dale Mas Gasolina
While I found a lot to love about this origin story, it does suffer from some of the similar repetitive tropes that we’ve seen many times over. Does it do them any better? At this point, it’s just partially re-hashed but the injected flavors of the family do help them smooth over the roughness. I’ve lost count of how often we’ve had: interrupted kisses with a joke, a villain who wants to scorch the Earth because they were wronged, and a physically imposing villain who is similarly outfitted as the protagonist. So, these are things we’ve seen before many times. Does it impact the overall delivery? Sometimes.
I had the worst taste in my mouth with what they did with Victoria Kord, as I recall they wanted Sharon Stone initially. I’m left wondering how much of an improvement it could have been for the character and subsequent changes to the script. There were some parts that I liked about her character, mostly her “I’m in charge here!” demeanor that had the employees of Kord Industries scrambling.
The pivot of using Kord Industries as an analogy of imperialism had my jaw on the floor. It’s even further explored when you see Jaime’s Nana take a final stand and say “DOWN WITH THE IMPERIALISTS!” and provide cover for her grandson. Another simple but effective nod was the statue of Christopher Columbus right outside where Jaime fights Ignacio Carapax (Raoul Max Trujillo) for the first time.
Another hugely missed opportunity was the lack of personality with Khaji-Da! They went as far as casting Becky G to voice it and yet Siri on my iPhone shows more emotion than her. Truly a shame as we’ve seen AI/Hero (Jarvis, F.R.I.D.A.Y., E.D.I.T.H.) interactions before and they at least had some OOMPH with their deliveries, sad to say that they phoned it in.
While on the topic of what was lacking, at times yes the score could hit hard during action scenes. But Jaime’s theme reminded me more of a Call of Duty lobby sequence with the big orchestrated cyberpunk-inspired beats. Ultimately I did find it refreshing since it did lend itself well to the fact that the technology is “Alien”.
One symptom that’s been persistent is odd angles when it comes to flight scenes, make no mistake, we get that here too. While I understand the need to translate Jaime’s inexperience and lack of control over the suit, it has become ridiculous to see scenes that remind me of a GoPro in a front-loaded laundry machine.
La Despedida
Overall, Blue Beetle was a nice breather. Although the stakes were huge, there is a sense of relief from being so disconnected from DC’s past. Even though there are mentions of other heroes and their cities, they are throwaway lines that don’t force any type of impact. Many finer details such as the practical Blue Beetle suit and nods to Latin culture are respectfully presented.
While the story may be another slightly predictable origin story, it has enough corazón y alma (heart and soul) to really bolster a need for more of the Reyes’ in Jaime’s future. Multiple subtle cameos and references throughout the movie empower the impact brought forth by the collaboration of many Latin creators. Ánimo Xolo, Angel, George, Damian!
I do understand that due to many factors, including distrust in the DC brand and overall fatigue with CBM properties, Blue Beetle absolutely deserves a watch in theaters, especially with as much family as you can take with you.
What do you think about Blue Beetle?

,‘Blue Beetle’ Review,"Xolo Maridueña forever, Susan Sarandon never!","Despite hitting lower numbers in its opening week than the bigwigs at DC Studios would have liked, Blue Beetle has toppled the long-running number-one revenue streak claimed by Greta Gerwig’s Barbie this week with roughly $25 million in earnings—even if the very epitome of only OK. Sadly, however, Blue Beetle might fall prey to fewer production and marketing machinations due to its Chicano-heavy cast despite its being full of winners like George Lopez (because somehow studios still think audiences are more interested in white-heavy flicks; remember the bad CGI from the first Black Panther?).
Here we join Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña, Cobra Kai), fresh out of college and returned to his Miami-like fictional home town of Palmera City. He’s not off the plane two seconds before learning his dad (Damián Alcázar) had a heart attack and lost his auto shop business, but nobody wanted to worry him with that stuff while he was at school. Also terrible, the family (including mom Rocio, Elpidia Carrillo; sister Milagro, Belissa Escobedo; grandma Nana, Adriana Barraza; and uncle, Lopez) is about to lose their home to the local mega-corp Kord, which is run by the cartoonishly evil Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon). Jaime somehow comes into contact with Vicky’s niece Jenny (Bruna Marquezine), who has stolen some kind of space beetle (voiced by Becky G) from the company. The thing turns out to be space armor, and so begins Jaime’s Spider-Man-meets-Iron Man thing, all while a movie from a corporation tells us how evil corporations can be.
Maridueña is effortlessly charismatic between his wide-eyed “family forever!” thing and the pains of a young guy coming to terms with the way the world works while in possession of space armor. Escobedo steals the show as his sister, though, and most scenes are better with her—ditto the rest of the Reyes clan, who collectively find a believable familial dynamic crammed with broad and in-jokes about Mexican family. These are the best parts of Blue Beetle, especially Lopez’s paranoid Uncle Rudy, whose delusions turn out to be warranted.
Sarandon’s evil business lady character is terrible, however. She literally says stuff like, “As you know, our plan is to have the beetle so we can make better weapons!” What We Do in the Shadows’ Harvey Guillén lands on the receiving end of much of this janky exposition, and it’s only sad he doesn’t have a bigger role as he’s proven one of the more interesting actors working today. The rest is exactly what you think it is, though it might be important to see this one so we can prove to Hollywood that we’re ready for fewer Captain Americas and more varied representation. Besides, we want to see what more Maridueña can do with a less formulaic script, and maybe the sequel could go nuts.

2023-08-07 21:54:37+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’ Looks To Fly To $30M U.S. Opening – Early Look Box Office,Box Office: 'Blue Beetle' Eyes $30M Opening U.S.,"Unlike last August which was totally lacking product after Sony’s Bullet Train, the month looks to keep chugging even as the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes continue and many talent not permitted to promote. Recently, Warner Bros/DC‘s Blue Beetle hit tracking with an eye on a $30M start when it opens on Aug. 18.
With Blue Beetle, Warner Bros is delivering what is arguably the first feature film superhero for Latino and Hispanic audiences. The pic was originally conceived for streamer HBO Max, developed under the DC Walter Hamada-run regime, but transitioned quite early to the theatrical release schedule.
The Angel Manuel Soto-directed pic is very hot with Latino and Hispanic moviegoers, natch, right now on tracking; the movie’s unaided awareness (that section of polling whereby moviegoers aren’t prompted on upcoming movies, rather name them independently when polled) is soaring above that of Sony’s Gran Turismo. True, this projection right now is lower than the $55M start of The Flash, which didn’t see a huge turnout by its cast to promote, and Shazam: Fury of the Gods‘ $30.1M, but note movies aimed at Hispanic and Latino moviegoers can overindex in their first weekends due to walk-up business. That’s what happened this weekend with The Meg 2: The Trench coming in at the top of expectations with a $30M start and a strong turnout among Hispanic and Latino crowds at 25% per Comscore/Screen Engine’s PostTrak.
A $30M start for this genre title is right in the vicinity of another Hispanic/Latino conceived tentpole; that being Robert Rodriguez’s Alita: Battle Angel which posted a 3-day of $28.5M back in February 2019. Right now Blue Beetle‘s unaided awareness is 38% ahead of Alita‘s. Showing even more promise, Blue Beetle’s unaided is also 83% ahead of Meg 2‘s at the same point in time. Note Meg 2 notched its solid opening at the box office sans any cast interviews due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, a similar scenario that Blue Beetle is in this month.
Warners has been trailering Blue Beetle on all prints of Barbie and most prints of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.
TV spot tracker iSpot independently shows a campaign that’s currently drawing a near half billion in impressions with TV spots for Blue Beetle airing since April on ABC, Univision, NBC, Fox and AMC across such programs as NBA games, America’s Got Talent, MLB games, Eternamente amandonos, and Celebrity Family Feud. There’s also cross-promo adds from a tie-in with Reese’s which is counting 35M TV ad impressions as well as 4M TV ad impressions from Univision alone.
Universal’s R-rated talking dog comedy, Strays, is opening against Blue Beetle and it looks to do in the teens per industry projections.
In Blue Beetle, Xolo Maridueña stars as Jaime Reyes, a recent college grad that returns home with aspirations for his future, but finds out his home is not the same. As he searches to find his purpose in the world, fate intervenes when Jaime unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab.
Maridueña is joined by a cast that includes Adriana Barraza as Jaime’s grandmother, Nana, Damían Alcázar as his father, Elpidia Carrillo as his mother, Bruna Marquezine as Jenny Kord, Raoul Max Trujillo as Carapax, with Susan Sarandon as Victoria Kord, and George Lopez as Jaime’s Uncle Rudy. The film also stars Belissa Escobedo as Jaime’s sister, Milagro and Harvey Guillén as Dr. Sanchez.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvYm94LW9mZmljZS1ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1wcm9qZWN0aW9uLTEyMzU0NTY5MTEv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWJsdWUtYmVldGxlLXByb2plY3Rpb24tMTIzNTQ1NjkxMS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,Susan Sarandon's 'Blue Beetle' villain previewed by actress,Oscar winner Susan Sarandon unpacks her 'Blue Beetle' villain Victoria Kord.,"Oscar winner Susan Sarandon had never been asked to appear in a superhero movie prior to DC's Blue Beetle, which may seem strange since even the lovable curmudgeon that is Harrison Ford is involved with the Marvel Cinematic Universe these days. Sarandon points out that she appeared in 2008's Speed Racer, which was based on a comic book but still not a superhero story.
""I would've probably taken it,"" she tells EW in an interview (conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike) if she had received a prior offer from Marvel or DC. So, when the actress of Dead Man Walking and Thelma & Louise got a call from director Angel Manuel Soto to play a part in Blue Beetle, in theaters this Aug. 18, she was already open to the opportunity. ""I just was so impressed by his passion,"" she recalls. ""He has this art background, so he was this nerdy fan of superheroes.""
Xolo Maridueña (Cobra Kai) stars in Blue Beetle as Jaime Reyes, a college grad who returns home to Palmera City and finds his family in dire economic straits. Damían Alcázar (Narcos) plays Jaime's father; Elpidia Carrillo (Mayans M.C.) plays his mother; Belissa Escobedo (Hocus Pocus 2) plays his sister, Milagro; Adriana Barraza (Rambo: Last Blood) plays his grandmother, Nana; and comedian George Lopez plays his Uncle Rudy. His job search leads him to Kord Industries, run by Sarandon's Victoria Kord, and the Scarab, an alien artifact that bonds with Jaime and transforms him into the armor-clad hero known as Blue Beetle.

It was clear to Sarandon that Victoria Kord represents ""the theme of imperialism in the name of democracy."" She says, ""My character's really the one who's driving that charade in order to get wealth and uranium and what other natural resources, under the guise of making the world safe for democracy. That rang a bell. All of those themes I thought would really be fun to dabble in.""
Always flanked by her muscle, Carapax (Sicario's Raoul Max Trujillo), and her science guy, Dr. Sanchez (What We Do in the Shadows' Harvey Guillén), Victoria covets the otherworldly Scarab. She maniacally muses in the film, ""We are going to change the world"" with its power.
Victoria is a new character created for the movie, but she did begin to appear in DC comics in the past year, beginning with Blue Beetle Graduation Day. She's depicted on the page as the older sister of Ted Kord, who formerly held the moniker of Blue Beetle in DC lore. In the film, Bruna Marquezine (Maldivas) plays Victoria's niece, Jenny Kord, who gives the Scarab to Jaime.
""She's a woman who is very smart and was dedicated to the family business, and then the father gives it to the son, which is a huge shock,"" Sarandon explains of Victoria. ""On top of that, the son is very irresponsible and basically destroys the fortune that has been built, and then just disappears, leaving her to put the business to sleep. Then she builds it back, but with great resentment because she's been passed over.""
Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) scolds Dr. Sanchez (Harvey Guillén) in 'Blue Beetle'. Hopper Stone/SMPSP
Sarandon believes it's always more fun to play the villain than the hero, but she understood Victoria's need to be ambitious and prove herself. ""Here she is, the only one who really made [the family business] her life,"" the actress continues. ""She has no family, she has no friends. She's not interested in anything but Kord Industries. She doesn't shop, she doesn't hang out with her girlfriends. She doesn't have a lover; if she does, it's nobody important. So, everything has gone towards the building of power.""
When it came to her costume, Sarandon felt it was important that Victoria had something that felt more like a uniform over anything sartorially trendy. What costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo came up with based on those conversations was ""something that is rather masculine but at the same time very strong,"" Sarandon says. ""It doesn't look like Donna Karan. It's not something out of Vogue.""
The film's other big selling point for Sarandon was the rest of the cast, which predominantly consists of Latinx actors. Parts of the movie are even performed in Spanish. ""It means a lot to have that representation,"" she says. ""You really felt that people were there understanding that this was a chance to do something that hadn't happened before, which was this Latino superhero having his own movie,"" she adds. ""We didn't have anyone who came late or was in it for the money.""

It would be easy to write off this movie’s staggering averageness with a wide-brush line like “not a classic, not a disaster,” but I feel the need to stress the degree to which this movie is right on par. It isn’t so much that it’s dull or that I didn’t care about it, because that would be the mark of a bad superhero movie. It’s that the movie manages the curious feat of having just enough of a unique identity for me to recommend it with a bare minimum of passion.
Our hero is Jamie Reyes (Xolo Maridueña), a smart, resourceful recent college graduate. He’s happy to be back in his hometown of Palmera City with his family, including his mother Rocio (Elpidia Carillo), father Alberto (Damián Alcázar), sister Milagro (Belissa Escobedo), Nana (Adriana Barraza), and crazy uncle Rudy (George Lopez). But he’s less happy to hear that his family has fallen on hard times and is about to lose the house. He vows to help them out financially. A cleaning gig at the home of wealthy industrialist Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) goes badly, but he does make an impression on Victoria’s niece Jenny (Bruna Marquezine), who half-heartedly invites him to apply for a job at corporate headquarters the next day. When he gets there, a skittish Jenny tells him to flee with a mysterious box, keep it safe and hidden, and above all, not open it. It’s maybe an hour before he opens the box in front of his family.
Inside the box is The Scarab, an alien artifact that immediately attaches itself to Jamie and causes him to develop a metallic skin, destroy most of the house, and rocket into outer space. Eventually, Jamie figures out that he’s inside a super-suit that is certainly dangerous in his hands, but even more dangerous in the hands of the military or evildoers like Victoria or her mechanized henchman Carapax (Raoul Max Trujillo). He seeks out Jenny for help getting the Scarab out of his system, and she takes him to the hidden lair of her long-missing father, who was secretly a low-level superhero called Blue Beetle. Jamie and his family use some of Blue Beetle’s tech and resources, though I don’t believe Jamie ever officially takes on the name himself. Whatever, fans are going to call the Jamie “Blue Beetle” going forward no matter what.
Story-wise, it’s not hard to see the inspirations for “Blue Beetle.” The main character gets his powers from a bug at a corporate building like Spider-Man, he’s inside of a metal suit like Iron Man, he has a testy relationship with the symbiote (voiced by Becky G) attached to his body like Venom, some of his powers are imagination-based like Green Lantern, he hides out in an armory beneath a mansion like Batman, and I’m sure I’m missing several others. Maybe Blue Beetle’s real superpower is that he can
amalgamate every other superhero movie.
And yet, “Blue Beetle” compensates for this lack of originality with a healthy dose of heart. Not too much heart, characters like Jamie and Jenny are likable enough, but they’re pretty standard as far as superhero leads go. But there is an undeniable charm to the Reyes family, and it’s hard not to be swept up in their chemistry and care for each other. Then again, this movie isn’t much different than dozens of other superhero movies, and it’s not like most of them don’t have likable characters too. I was going to
give this movie a non-recommendation grade of C for being too bland, but then Nana showed up and saved the day. If you see the movie, you’ll understand why I had to bump the grade up to a B- just for her.
Grade: B-
“Blue Beetle” is rated PG-13 for sequences of action and violence, language, and some suggestive references. Its running time is 127 minutes.

,"'Blue Beetle' ad on Philadelphia Museum of Art steps receives bad reviews from locals, visitors","DC Comics superhero, ""Blue Beetle"" is sprawled across the famed Rocky steps​ ahead of the new movie's release and it seems like everyone has an opinion on it.","PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- There is a new advertisement installation on the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, however, locals and visitors don't seem to like it.
DC Comics superhero, ""Blue Beetle"" is sprawled across the famed Rocky steps ahead of the new movie's release and it seems like everyone has an opinion on it.
For Jim Osby Gwathney, the museum steps are the place to be as he sits at the base, watching tourists do what tourists do.
""This is one of my favorite spots,"" said Gwathney, who is an opera singer in Philadelphia. ""This is the happy place. People come here from all over the world and they do the, 'I'm going run up.'""
Now, he's hearing some of those tourists question the new advertisement.
""I'm not even sure what it is. Is it permanent,"" Joyce Buky, who visiting from Kentucky, asked.
According to the city, the ad will only be on the stairs for the rest of the week and then the Rocky stairs will be back to normal.
""The movie poster -- I don't like it because it ruins this location,"" said John Marco Cipolla, who visiting from Italy.
""I think it's tacky to put an ad like this on such an old prestigious place,"" said Haron Daniel, who is visiting from Dallas. ""There's plenty of spaces to put it.""
The ad, which uses a series of stickers to install the work, covers all 72 steps. It was approved by the parks department, which maintains the museum and the stairs. According to a parks department spokesperson, the city is being paid $28,000 for the seven-day installation.
""The thing I love about Philly is, I'm pretty sure this is just trash. I think it's there because they did what they wanted and then they left it, and were like, you deal with it,"" Gwathney said.
Then again, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
""It gives color, it gives emotions. It's cool, it's fine,"" said Diletta Dinalle, who is also visiting from Italy.
The Philadelphia Museum of Art released a statement on the installation:
""As the city of Philadelphia owns the East Terrance stairs (the Rocky Steps) and the Philadelphia Museum of Art, decisions about how to use these stairs are made by the city; not the Philadelphia Museum of Art. As such a recognizable landmark, we love the idea of using the stairs for promotional purposes and we would welcome opportunities to use these stairs to promote Philadelphia's emerging artists.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS9uZXdzL2JsdWUtYmVldGxlLWFkdmVydGlzZW1lbnQtcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhLW11c2V1bS1vZi1hcnQtc3RlcHMtYmFkLXJldmlld3Mv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS9uZXdzL2JsdWUtYmVldGxlLWFkdmVydGlzZW1lbnQtcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhLW11c2V1bS1vZi1hcnQtc3RlcHMtYmFkLXJldmlld3Mv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-15 10:08:31+00:00,"Book Review: ‘Red, White & Royal Blue’ by Casey McQuiston","Brian Kitson reviews the Red, White & Royal Blue novel by Casey McQuiston. Check out the film version on Prime Video!","Share this:
For those who read my Red, White & Royal Blue film review, you know that romantic comedies were an important part of my life growing up. While that is most definitely true, romance novels are a newer revelation. I grew up reading a ton of fantasy and science-fiction novels, however reading a novel about two people falling in love seemed like such a foreign concept. Sure, there were some such as Twilight that I did end up reading, however seeking books of this type wasn’t part of my natural reading behaviors. That is until I saw the trailer for the film currently streaming on Prime Video. It was at that moment that I felt the strong urge to purchase the Red, White & Royal Blue novel by Casey McQuiston.
Setting aside the societal chains dictating that romance novels are for women, I cracked open the book the first day I got it, not knowing what I would expect as I dove into the world of Alex and Henry. What I found was so much more than just your typical romance story. Among the pages of love and sex is also the story of two individuals attempting to find their way in the world, regardless of the societal pressures placed on them. A universal narrative that most individuals can relate to. Pile on a presidential election, some shady politicians, and a lot of heart, and you have Casey McQuiston’s Red, White & Royal Blue.
[Warning: Spoilers from Red, White & Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston are below!]
Alex and Henry front and center
Just like the film, the main attraction of the Red, White & Royal Blue novel is the relationship between the two main characters, Alex and Henry. Alex, the son of the first female President of the United States has big dreams of politics. Living in the White House and attending college, Alex is self-assured and confident, which at times comes off as arrogant, though only to those who don’t truly know him.
Prince Henry is the second child of the heir apparent over in England and almost the direct opposite of Alex in every way. While Alex is vocal and isn’t afraid of the spotlight, Henry is coy and reserved. He presents as the perfect son and prince to his people, with a charm that oozes off of every page. However, that being said, his pleasant attitude doesn’t extend to Alex in the slightest.
These two despise each other more than anything, stemming from an incident early in Alex’s time in the White House. At this conference, where Alex was nervous and approached Henry, the prince was cold and asked to leave. Unfortunately, Henry’s attitude was the result of having recently lost his father, but Alex instead took it personally and their infamous feud began.
The feud might have remained intact if it weren’t for an international incident the two become embroiled in. Who knew smashing a $75,000 cake at the royal wedding of Prince Henry’s older brother could cause a breakdown between the two nations? With the pressure of an election looming over President Ellen Claremont, she sends Alex back to the U.K. to become pretend friends with His Royal Highness. What could go wrong with forcing these two enemies to play nice on such a global stage?
From enemies to friends, to so much more
It pains both sides to be near each other at first. If it weren’t for their duty to their respective countries, they might have gone through with the publicity stunt. However, after their first event, the two begin an unlikely friendship through text messages and insults.
A good chunk of the first part of McQuiston’s novel is told through text messages and phone calls between Henry and Alex, as the duo slowly warms up to each other. However, it’s not until Alex’s New Year’s Eve blowout that the friendship switches to something else.
At that faithful party, where drinks are flowing, Henry kisses Alex and sends the trajectory of their friendship into a situation-ship. Henry had liked Alex from their first meeting, with Alex oblivious to his feelings. But now with a kiss from a prince, the relationship between the two begins, with first just sex, but eventually developing into something more. The excitement that builds in me as the reader as the two learn who they are within the confines of their relationship was intoxicating.
But being together is never that easy for two people in their positions. There’s a ton of pressure from both sides, with Prince Henry feeling the brunt of it from the royal family and the image they wish to uphold. Can these two figure it out and forge their path together? Or is the love of Henry and Alex even more doomed than that of Romeo and Juliet?
Sideshows of the circus in Red, White & Royal Blue
While the main gist of the novel made it into the film, some of the side stories from Casey McQuiston’s novel were sidelined. The novel provides a more extensive list of supporting characters, who are fleshed out more than those in the film. The biggest change to Alex’s family, who looks a little different in the novel.
Surprise! Alex has a sister, June, who is integral to Alex’s life as he progresses through his newfound relationship with Prince Henry. She’s the epitome of the protective older sister, who keeps Alex in line and rounds out the younger White House generation along with Nora, best friend to both siblings and the Vice President’s granddaughter. Together these three are inseparable, with June and Nora pulled into the embroiled mess of Alex and Henry’s relationship. Especially after their emails leak for the world to see.
Another major change from the film is that Alex is a child of divorce, with his parents separated and his mother remarried. The impact of the divorce isn’t dived into too deep, however, it is seen in the way that both June and Alex develop relationships with others. Both are fiercely independent and have to learn how to rely on others and open themselves to the happiness that love can bring. Again, this message is more explored through Alex and Henry’s relationship, but it’s present in some ways for June.
Wrapped up in the romance and the Presidential election is another political story, which involves a U.S. senator from Colorado, Rafael Luna. Luna was once a close friend of Alex and his parents but becomes the running mate for the President’s opponent in the election. However, not everything is what it seems, with Luna’s true motivations becoming clear by the end of the novel. This added storyline to the overall narrative, adding something more substantial to the Red, White & Royal Blue novel to the typical romance formula.
Perhaps the most interesting aspect for me was the emotional journey Henry takes to change the impossible pressure with his family and being the face of a country. This story comes into play a lot during the later third of the novel as the relationship and emotions become more real for the two men. It also brings the emotional release needed from this type of novel.
The Red, White & Royal Blue experience
The film and the novel are so similar in experience, with the only difference being the novel has the time and room to expand on many of the stories and characters scattered through the narrative. All the important parts of the story are there, but the wider world in the Red, White & Royal Blue novel is more fleshed out. This creates a larger story, besides the main event of Alex and Henry’s relationship.
Regardless if I’m reading the novel or watching the movie, I feel a deep connection to these two main characters. Being a member of the LGBTQ+ community, the relationship and journey Alex and Henry take feels completely relatable, even if it’s exaggerated by their status. I, and I’m sure others in my community, have been in both Alex’s and Henry’s shoes at different times. The realism that McQuiston bought to these two characters made me feel seen and accepted in ways I don’t always feel in other books.
I even thought out loud as I read the novel, “Do people tend to feel this way when they read romance novels?” Having spoken to others, that doesn’t always seem the case. I think that speaks to the power and relevance that McQuiston put into their story, taking the time to understand this formative experience for individuals like me. And for that, this novel will always be important to me.
Red, White & Royal Blue was one of those books I thought I would read and then pass on to someone else. However, I now own two copies, both the standard and the collector’s edition. I can’t stop thinking about the novel and the hopes I have for Alex and Henry. In them, I feel the hope and loss that life brings and the novel made me more excited for the life of possibilities. Nothing about life and love is easy, as we learn through these two, but the ending is probably worth it. History, huh?
While this novel might not have as much resonance with others, it struck me in ways I was not expecting and not prepared for. If you’re looking for a silly romance with compelling characters, I implore you to check out Red, White & Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston.
My Rating: 9/10

Taking to Twitter, Snyder wrote: ""Looking forward to taking my kids to see Blue Beetle. #RepresentationMatters #BlueBeetle"" Accompanying the tweet was a picture of Blue Beetle himself, set to be played by Cobra Kai's Xolo Maridueña in the DC film.

Suicide Squad director David Ayer then retweeted Snyder with the hands up emoji, and DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn also shared Snyder's post.
While Blue Beetle isn't strictly a DCU film, Gunn has indicated before that the titular hero Jaime Reyes will be the first DCU character. DCU Chapter One: Gods and Monsters is set to kick off with animated TV show Creature Commandos, with Superman: Legacy following in 2025.
Snyder, meanwhile, is busy at Netflix with Rebel Moon, an upcoming sci-fi epic based on his scrapped Star Wars pitch. That film is arriving this December 2023.
""I just remember James Gunn has this really excited energy to him all the time,"" Maridueña told us in the new issue of Total Film magazine, which is out on newsstands now. ""But them coming into this position of the movie already being made, and then being like, 'All right [mimes rifling through a filing cabinet as if rummaging through the movie], let's see what we have here' – it was very rewarding for them to actually respond well to it and enjoy it. They had their notes here and there story-wise, but I think, in capturing the essence of Jaime and the Reyes family, [they] think we did a really great job.""

What does the Blue Beetle review say?
“Blue Beetle is fantastic fun,” said Clayton Davis of Variety. “Funny, surprisingly heartfelt with a star-making turn by Xolo Maridueña. The kid has IT. Director Angel Manuel Soto makes Latinos’ supposed “invisibility” into a full-on superpower. Truly inspiring. I also want the Abuela origin story now!”
“Blue Beetle is my favorite post-Nolan DC film”, they say straight from POC Culture. “It’s an action packed, highly entertaining superhero story about family…& there’s nothing more important than family. The film is unique in that it lovingly & unabashedly shares the Reyes family’s Mexican culture.”

“Blue Beetle stands out from previous DC entries & its mostly due to the Latin flavor,” said Genesis O’Neill “It’s funny, emotional & the action scenes w BB are amazing! The cast is beautiful, but Maridueña & López SHINE. Can’t wait to see more!”
“Recent college grad Jaime Reyes returns home full of aspirations for his future, only to find that home is not quite as he left it,” reads the official synopsis of the film. “As he searches to find his purpose in the world, fate intervenes when Jaime unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab. When the Scarab suddenly chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, he is bestowed with an incredible suit of armor capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the Super Hero Blue Beetle.”

“Stories are more than entertainment. They are a powerful tool for social change that fuels our collective movement to build a more equitable, just world for those who have been historically underrepresented and marginalized,” reads the letter, signed by 27 groups.
It continues, “Actors, writers, and directors are essential to this work. As we watch them do what they do best, we are reminded that their art influences how people think and feel about our communities – both at home and abroad. While we’re encouraged by some of the changes we have seen in recent years, we continue to deal with the repercussions from years of being actively erased and invisible on screen.”
While the signatories say they were optimistic about the summer, many projects will not be promoted in the usual big ways as actors and writers are limited as to what they can and cannot say based on the rules of their respective guilds. One major accomplishment for the Latino community in the mix is the Warner Bros film Blue Beetle, directed by Angel Manuel Soto, written by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer and featuring a largely Latino cast led by Cobra Kai star Xolo Maridueña. It hits theaters August 18.

It’s clear that we still have a long way to go, but we’re proud of our Latino creatives who are elevating our humanity and moving culture forward through their work.
We were particularly optimistic about this summer. We were approaching a critical turning point for Latino representation as we saw the return of some of our favorite shows and characters, the launch of exciting new series, and prepared for a groundbreaking moment on the big screen – the first superhero movie directed, written, and starring Latinos. We were hopeful that our long overdue cultural moment had finally arrived.
And now we are confronted with this pivotal moment across the media industry; a double strike that will have a significantly disproportionate impact on artists from underrepresented communities.
Actors and writers deserve a deal that protects their work and livelihoods, so we will continue to support them as they fight for better treatment and fair compensation. And since we represent a rapidly growing demographic with tremendous influence over the global cultural landscape, we also remain dedicated to recognizing and celebrating their artistic excellence and its invaluable role in reflecting our community and culture on screen.
For the sake of current and future generations of Latinos, we will not delay our progress any longer. We invite you to join us in our effort to amplify the work that countless Latino artists have worked so hard to create. It’s important that we show up for them at a time when they are not able to promote their projects.
Our stories are universal and need to be told. Together, we must continue to advocate for a more equitable and inclusive industry, one that respects and honors our storytellers and stories.

,Xolo Maridueña jokes about getting cropped out of photos with Selena Gomez,Xolo Maridueña jokes he keeps getting cropped out of photos with Selena Gomez: 'She has to come out with a statement.',"Xolo Maridueña is a star on the rise. Unless there's a bigger star like Selena Gomez directly next to him, in which case he's sitting right where he is and will then likely be cropped out of any and all paparazzi photos.
On his podcast with Jacob Bertrand, Lone Lobos, the Blue Beetle star opens up about the emotional scars of getting ""Mike Wazowski'd"" at the LAFC game last Sunday.

Maridueña points to an article about Gomez's wide-eyed fascination at the soccer game and how in the photo that runs with the article, Maridueña, who was sitting next to the Only Murders in the Building star and retired audience reaction queen, is conveniently cropped out, save for his shoulder.

""Dude, why did I get cut out right there. Wait, I'm pissed!"" Maridueña exclaims, pointing to the photo.

""Yeah, I got f---ing Mike Wazowski'd, but not Tyga! But Tyga got to keep there?"" he notes, referring to the rapper, who, in all fairness, also has Kardashian klout.
The uncropped picture shows Maridueña ""scared"" that Inter Miami's newest recruit Lionel Messi was going to score on LAFC, until he was denied by goalie John McCarthy.

""She's standing next to a superhero, bruh,"" Maridueña jokes. ""Bro, the first brown superhero! She's gotta give some love. She has to come out with a statement.""
In another article, he's also left out in favor of Gomez, Prince Harry, and ""F---ing Mario Lopez.""
The game turned out to be disappointing for many involved. LAFC ended up losing, 3-1. Gomez became a meme, no doubt influencing her post-VMA pledge of stillness at all future audience gigs. And Xolo Maridueña learned what some of us have always known, that you don't sit next to someone with nearly half a billion Instagram followers and expect not to be cropped out of a photo with them.
There was, however, one winner of the night: Tyga.

,'Blue Beetle' star Xolo Maridueña releases debut single 'On My Way',"Watch the music video for 'Blue Beetle' star Xolo Maridueña's debut single, 'On My Way.'","Xolo Maridueña is on his way.
The Blue Beetle and Cobra Kai actor just dropped his debut single, ""On My Way,"" a nostalgic love letter to '90s hip-hop and pop culture featuring Adriana Padilla. EW has an exclusive first look at its wistful Los Angeles–set music video, which Maridueña calls an homage to the aforementioned not-so-bygone era and Spike Lee's cult classic Do the Right Thing.
""There definitely is a '90s feel to the track,"" Maridueña tells EW over the phone the afternoon before its big debut. ""It's heavily inspired by the rap groups that I listened to growing up: A Tribe Called Quest, Wu-Tang [Clan], Public Enemy. Once I heard the beat, it totally brought me back."" Of the accompanying video that sees him traversing the City of Angels via one sweet ride, ""It definitely has that Fresh Prince kind of feel.""
Though best known for his turns as Miguel Diaz on Cobra Kai, Victor Graham on Parenthood, and the titular hero in the just released Blue Beetle (the first Latino superhero to lead a DC film), it's music that first helped shape Maridueña's love for the arts, nurtured in large part by his parents — including his former radio show host mother. ""Music has been a part of my life since as far as I can remember,"" he says. ""Both my parents have been heavily involved in not only the hip-hop world, but just the greater music world.""
""I have such a great appreciation for the music world; especially the hip-hop world, it really helped raise me,"" he adds. With the new single, ""I just want to show my respect and admiration for a culture and group that operates me.""
""On My Way"" is a meeting of both of Maridueña's worlds, with the actor rapping lyricisms about his rising star status in Hollywood such as, ""Representation matters, you dealin' with a monster"" and ""I'm 'bout to be a star like Al Pacino / and Leo DiCaprio / I'm stackin' C-notes, so add a zero.""

As for the musical artists that can be found on Maridueña's playlist, ""I'm an equal opportunist when it comes to the ears,"" he says, citing Remi Wolf, Denzel Curry, and Adele as some of his favorites.

Blue Beetle #1
Written by Josh Trujillo
Illustrated by Adrián Gutiérrez
Colored by Wil Quintana
Lettered by Lucas Gattoni
Reviewed by Quinn Tassin
It’s rare to come by a first issue that feels so much like the start of an arc in the middle of a series. “Blue Beetle” #1 is certainly a fun, well-written comic book. It’s written with care for its characters and their histories and for the most part, it’s illustrated very well. The plotting, too, is solid, balancing nice character beats, an engaging story, and touching on themes about xenophobia seamlessly. But this also feels distinctly like the middle of a story. To be fair, this is an extension of the “Blue Beetle: Graduation Day” miniseries. But it’s fair to say that the first issue of an ongoing series bears a certain level of responsibility for orienting its readers. That’s especially true when no moment in the issue lets you know that there was a miniseries preceding this. To the average reader (or maybe even more importantly, a new reader) a first issue is meant to be the start of something. And for all of this issue’s strengths, its accessibility, or lack thereof, is a massive liability.
The issue opens in the middle of the action (after a one page history of the three men who have called themselves Blue Beetle), throwing Jaime into a fight against a group called the Madmen. This sequence does strong work illustrating a lot about Jaime as a hero; he cares about leading the other Scarab-holders well and saving the day without causing collateral damage. But there are also some clear questions that arise reading these first few pages, most notably: there are other Scarab holders?! The sense that you’re missing things persists as we see a Palmera City divided over the presence of aliens. This is all interesting but nearly zero work is done to give context here, which may be excusable for a more established character, or for the sequel to a more widely-read series, but here, the status quo is more jarring than it is engaging.
None of that is to say that “Blue Beetle” #1 isn’t good. It’s a very fun read with great action and visuals and it’s easy to root for both Jaime and for the creative team behind this story. The Blood Scarab makes for an intimidating, intriguing antagonist and seeing him stab Ted Kord through the chest certainly makes for a great first issue cliffhanger. This series is worth reading, it would just benefit from something that most stories need less of: exposition.
The art team does excellent work in “Blue Beetle’ #1, establishing a style that somehow captures youthful energy in action sequences, portrays character-driven moments in an engaging way, and pivots from fun to grounded to actively dark with ease. The opening fight scene with the Madmen is an absolute blast the pages are teeming with energy, giving each character a cartoonish physicality that makes it impossible not to find them engaging. Scenes like Jaime going to a meal with aliens as Blue Beetle or going to the beach land well, too. A lot of credit there goes to the coloring, which is vibrant and exciting. It’s reflective of both the exaggerated art style and the youthfulness of Jaime as a character. It also makes a move as simple as making the Red Scarab a silhouette land incredibly well. When a space is filled with vibrant, cool coloring and that’s pierced by shadow and then bursts of red, it’s bound to leave a visual impression. The artwork isn’t perfect, though. There’s a tendency to leave quite a bit of negative space in panels and all too often those aren’t even filled with texts blocks. That lack of detail can be notable and while it doesn’t diminish the reading experience, more background work would certainly enhance “Blue Beetle” #1. There are also moments where the layouts don’t quite make sense. For instance, when the Madmen are introduced, the text fills the top right corner of the panel and leads to Ted’s ship, which is even further in the top right corner. 75% of the panel, though, is dedicated to these villains with lots of energy and very fun designs, who just so happen to be leaping in from the right side of the page. The result: is text that keeps your eyes firmly in the top left corner while it’s clear that the centerpiece image is meant to be looked at from the top right corner and take you down to the panels below. That’s not a flub bad enough to take you out of the issue but it’s exactly the kind of thing you’re not supposed to notice as a reader. While the visuals are strong, sometimes they make you work harder than you have to, a quality that they share with the writing.

Final Verdict: 7.0- “Blue Bettle” #1 is competently plotted and full of heart but its lack of accessibility holds it back.
Project: Cryptid #1
Written by Mark Russell, Paul Cornell, and Grant Morrison
Illustrated by Jordi Perez, PJ Holden, and Jon Proctor
Colored by Madeline Seely and Mike Spicer
Lettered by Rob Steen
Reviewed by Gregory Ellner
“Project: Cryptid” #1 is an unusual approach for a series premiere: an anthology. The different stories have very different tones, each from a different writer. Mark Russell starts off the story with a more serious take on a classic monster tale, which seems to be a way to lure in readers expecting more of the same. The unlikeable protagonist, the horrifying fate, the inhospitable environment… all of it seems fairly standard. With Paul Cornell, things are stranger and thereby more interesting, giving a more rounded, intriguing look at cryptozoology, albeit one that may be fairly standard of more recent work in fiction. Both have their charms, but together leave one wondering where this series is meant to go in the first place. Grant Morrison’s piece, on the other hand, feels really odd, a segment of a primarily prose-based serial for all of Ahoy Comics, and is difficult to really see as part of the rest.
The art styles are good fits for the three tales. Jordi Perez takes a mostly down-to-earth approach with the opening story, with four expressions and wider shots to give an oppressive sense of foreboding that only really lets up in the final moments. Meanwhile, the relatively cartoonish, a bit more exaggerated approach by Paul Cornell makes the second part much more humorous, uplifting, and relatable, despite being about a very deadly being (at least officially). Jon Proctor’s one image fits well into the noir-esque aesthetic of the serial style, highly detailed while only using grayscale snd no colors.
Color choice is what finally brings it all together. The colors provided by Madeline Seely are dark, subdued, and oppressive, much like the story they illuminate. They give a look at a world without much hope for cryptids except that they leave other people alone. Meanwhile, Mike Spicer takes a far brighter, more lively approach, using bizarre purples, greens, and more to really revel in how utterly bizarre cryptids really can be, letting him have fun with it and invite others into a strange new world.
Final Verdict: 7.0– An unusual approach makes this series one worth at least giving a chance.
Tear Us Apart #1
Written by Jay Baruchel & Van Jensen
Illustrated & Colored by Alessandro Micelli
Lettered by Taylor Esposito
Reviewed by Alexander Manzo
“Tear Us Apart” is a reimagined version of Romeo & Juliet inside of a dystopian cult sprinkled with a bit of X-Men, and this is all just simply in the introduction. The authors Jay Baruchel and Van Jensen do a great job of jumping right into the story with exposition to set the mood inside of this cult temple world led by a huge Viking-like bearded leader but slowly lead into the heart of the true story. The protagonists, Twenty-Five and Eighty-Two, break the standard conventions they’ve been training their entire lives for; instead of battling with their fellow students and proving their worth to the leader, they attempt to escape because of their love for one another. Baruchel and Jensen created this forbidden love story inside of a cult and added this coming-of-age layer to entice most readers. Overall, it’s a story that feels like a well-done mashup of multiple genres (thus far) so that it can’t be boiled down to a one-sentence recommendation that gives a reader a lot to chew on for the first issue and a reason to check out what’s next to come.
The artwork by Alessandro Micelli sets the mood with his choice of having a limited color palette but mainly sticks with various shades of blues, white for the black space, and red for the blood. His overall art style is simple but has the strength to build this tense and menacing world that Twenty-Five and Eighty-Two live in. Micelli has this anime-like influence on the characters’ emotions as they are fitting but slightly exaggerated to sell it marginally more. His choice of angles also brings this extra layer of intimidation for the Paternoster to emphasize his size over the children. However, when the reader is presented with another angle in comparison, he’s not giant-size; it’s more of being surrounded by teenagers. This choice is perfect for our young protagonist’s point of view when everyone, even slightly older, seems like someone ancient or massive (in size). Another interesting aspect of Micelli’s artwork is the opposite depiction of the two powers; Twenty-Five’s powers are more based around weaponry and speed, shown in multiple panels with weapons already cutting or arrows hitting various students. In comparison, Eighty-Two’s powers are more fantasy-based through a beam of energy through her hands that can take out an enemy. Her true strength was briefly mentioned, and it feels like a slight nod to the X-Men’s Jean Grey and the power and cost that comes with it.
Final Verdict:8.0 – The exposition did a great job in this opening issue of setting up this new world, but the romantic aspect of it has yet to be fully unraveled.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHA6Ly93d3cubXVsdGl2ZXJzaXR5Y29taWNzLmNvbS9yZXZpZXdzL3dyYXBwaW5nLXdlZG5lc2RheS0wOTA2MjMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

domestically in its opening weekend, with a total domestic gross of just 
$27-$55M. Ouch.","Superhero movies seem to be at an influx point, bombing left and right these days, and it’s a wonderful sight to see. The catastrophe that is the Warner Bros/DC collaboration may take yet another bad turn next month.
What is “Blue Beetle”? Not sure. I’m not well-versed when it comes to comic book characters, but Warners had enough confidence to greenlight this bad boy with a $120 million budget.
Here comes the bad news. Early tracking, via BoxOffcePro.com, has the film earning $12-$17M domestically in its opening weekend, with a total domestic gross of just $27-$55M. Ouch.
The movie will need to to overperform internationally to avoid the gloomy fate of the last three DC superhero flicks (Shazam 2, The Flash, Black Adam). It probably won’t. Does Warners want to delay this one to 2024 and use the strike as an excuse? All reports are indicating that they would rather just dump it and get it over with.
The film, like many of the recent DCEU movies, has had reshoots, but, here’s the kicker, THR reports that the filmmakers requested two additional days of filming this past February but were turned down by the studio.
“Blue Beetle” has to do with a college graduate who returns to his hometown and is chosen to become a symbiotic host to an ancient alien relic that grants him a powerful exoskeleton armor. I’m not kidding. That’s the plot.
“Blue Beetle” is scheduled for theatrical release in the United States on August 18, 2023",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndvcmxkb2ZyZWVsLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjMvNy8yZTN1aWtuY2d5bHdlY2RveWp6N2ducnZ1MTRkMWHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

'Barbie' expected to see $17.1M due to National Cinema Day.","Monday AM: In one of the dullest weekends of the year, there was a lot of melodrama. However, Sony’s Gran Turismo won the weekend with $17.4M — and rival studios, except for Warners Bros, see it that way too.
Barbie came in with $15.1M, not $17.1M, to no one’s shock. “It was never going to do that kind of business,” said one rival distribution cappo this AM. Warners was throwing furniture all weekend long because Sony included nine days of previews in its Friday total, propelling Gran Turismo to No. 1, stopping Barbie‘s collection of No. 1 weekends. It will be interesting to see how the dust settles next weekend: Will Sony have the No. 1 and 2 movie in Equalizer 3 (which is expected to do $30M+ business over four days) and Gran Turismo?
Barbie‘s Sunday came in at $5.7M, +6% over Saturday’s $5.4M, while Gran Turismo‘s Sunday was $4.7M, +15% over Saturday’s $4.1M — both juiced by National Cinema Day $4 tickets. We’ll have more stats on that day soon. Barbie did 1.42M admissions yesterday to Gran Turismo‘s 1.17M, which if you scroll down, you’ll see that’s where the industry saw the former in terms of ticket stubs — not 1.937M.
Again, rival studios are acting like cats with birds in their mouth over this whole Gran Turismo and Barbie war because everyone has stuffed previews into their opening days before — just not to the degree that Sony has. Why not call B.S.? Because, you too Warners, will one day get to put nine days of previews into your opening day number.
Sunday AM: With National Cinema Day today and all tickets for all movies $4 –a celebration which brings mixed emotions to those in the industry–many are seeing Sony’s Gran Turismo waving the checkered flag with around $17.3M after a $4.1M Saturday that plummeted due to the fact that it was up against an $8.5M Friday chock full of nine days of previews.
C’mon ‘Gran Turismo’ c’mon! Bring it on! ‘Barbie’ believes it has a shot at No. 1 due to National Cinema Day $4 ticket sales. Warner Bros
Warner Bros. is calling Barbie‘s sixth weekend at $17.1M while rivals show it at a $15.1M take after a $5.3M Saturday that was +33% over its Friday. As we mentioned Warners are irate over Sony’s handling of preview box office accounting on Gran Turismo. Warners believes that Sony should back out all the non-Thursday previews out of Gran Turismo‘s Friday ($3.9M) so that Barbie can be No. 1 for a fifth time in a row. No rival studio’s internal box office chart sees it that way. Where is Warner getting the logic that Barbie gets to $17.1M this weekend? Read on, as it’s all about National Cinema Day.
Meanwhile, Oppenheimer is expected to hit $300M by EOD today.
Now the Cinema Day of it all…
While we won’t have hard admission stats until tomorrow, box office analytics firm EntTelligence is currently seeing committed 3.1M ticket purchases (not box office, that’s admissions people) for today in presales. Will walk-up business get us to a level of last year’s National Cinema Day, which fell on a Saturday during Labor Day weekend, and clocked 8 million? One studio is betting that we do 8.75M in admissions today.
Barbie, as expected, is leading Sunday in admissions with over 504K. Now Warner Bros is projecting that they’ll do $7.75M worth of business today for Barbie. That means Barbie will have to do 1.937M in admissions off of $4 ticket sales. Some don’t see how that’s possible as they believe Barbie will do around $5.8M in National Cinema Day admissions which means 1.45M admissions.
Other top presellers in terms of admission so far today are Blue Beetle (501K+), Gran Turismo (391K), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (322K+) and Oppenheimer (302K).
Gran Turismo is projected to do $4.45M today (and rivals agree) which would mean 1.1M admissions.
As of this weekend during her entire domestic run, Barbie will have over 50M tickets sold or $594.8M per EntTelligence.
EntTelligence says that 40% of National Cinema Day sales so far are for movies playing between 1PM and 5PM while 27% are between 5PM-9PM.
While exhibition is happy about National Cinema Day as more bodies bring concessions dollars, studios aren’t yippy skippy as it means less box office, especially this year when there’s premium product on the marquee. This wasn’t a big deal last year as there weren’t any new studio wide releases due to the Covid post-production logjam, just re-releases like Spider-Man: No Way Home and Jaws. The thinking by some is that we needed National Cinema Day more last year than this year in regards to encouraging people to return to cinemas, particularly at a time when there was no product and people still hesitant from Covid. The whole day boils down to a fight between admissions and dollars: Do you generate enough in admissions that still yields big box office? At the end of the day, didn’t you just crater business on Friday and Saturday in favor of Sunday? One rival studio projection is that National Cinema Day will ring up $35M for all titles (or 8.75M admissions), which is 13% above Saturday’s $31M, and 22% ahead of Friday’s $28.6M for all titles in what’s looking like a $94.6M weekend, +79% over the same frame a year ago.

MGM’s Bottoms looks to hit a theater average of $51,6K for $516,2K, which could beat Everything Everywhere All at Once‘s $50,1K opening theater average. Next weekend, the film will expand to approximately 700 additional theaters across North America. The Emma Seligman directed and written title, and produced by Elizabeth Banks and Max Handelman is 93% positive. Women under 25 rated it 98% with a 96% definite recommend on PostTrak. The opening night audience was young (86% between 18-34), LGBTQ+ (59%). Diversity demos were 67% Caucasian, 20% Latino and Hispanic, 7% Black and 14% Asian. The studio reports “that attendees were avid, smarthouse moviegoers who came to see the film because of its fresh/original take on the high school, coming of age genre.”
Really?! These Liam Neeson movies profit?
A note about the Liam Neeson movie Retribution. This is the nth recent Neeson action film that’s coming in with an opening in the lower single digits after last year’s Marlowe ($1.8M), Memory ($3.1M), Blacklight ($3.5M) and 2021’s The Marksman ($3.1M). But get this, these movies are profitable or else they wouldn’t get made. “I wish I had a Liam Neeson action film,” drooled one foreign sales boss to me. It remains to be seen at the fall film festival troika who’ll actually snap up acquisition titles with the Byzantine legalese of SAG-AFTRA agreements. There could be booby traps. We won’t know until an acquisition is made; and what the aftermath of that is for the buyer in regards to downstreams. However, a Liam Neeson movie (if one was in the marketplace) is well worth whatever SAG-AFTRA termed deal is. Retribution, made by StudioCanal and the Picture Company, was made for a price around $20M. Neeson gets a payday in the upper single digits. Lionsgate bought U.S. for $6M, (Memory finaled domestic at $7.3M) and they keep the P&A low in the high single digit range. PVOD is where this movie overindexes. Between foreign sales and Lionsgate, that’s covering about $18M of the production cost. StudioCanal already has its own territories that they’re reaping box office and ancillaries off of with France, Germany, Australia, UK and Poland. Everyone comes out of the wash OK, I’m told by sources. For foreign sales folks and distributors, is being in business on a Neeson pic similar to that of a Nicolas Cage movie? “It’s better,” says another foreign sales exec.

Saturday AM: Sony’s Gran Turismo counted a Friday that included $5.3M in previews, plus another $3.2M yesterday in pure dollars, for what’s being called an $8.5M day. This will translate to a $16.5M opening weekend. However, National Cinema Day could see a big rally for Barbie, despite figures showing a $4M Friday and $15.7M sixth weekend. We’ll have a better idea of presales for Sunday tomorrow.
‘Barbie’ Warner Bros.
Warner Bros is still having a really big problem with Sony stuffing their weekend with an extra $3.9M of previews (when you back out Thursday’s $1.4M) on Gran Turismo. For, in their eyes, no studio has ever done that before with an extensive string of previews. Why is Warners so upset? Because then that would mean Barbie is No. 1, and she’d be able to count five weekends at No. 1. Warners should wait until Monday AM, when the dust settles from National Cinema Day, because it could greatly work in Barbie’s favor.
Many have stuffed their opening weekends with advance previews, and rivals perceive this as common practice because they’ve done it before (and they don’t want to upset or reverse what’s been a calculation in their favor.) That’s why some aren’t calling B.S. on Sony. More to the point, Sony isn’t making these ticket sales up: Gran Turismo‘s cash is right there in Comscore, with the preview box office included in Friday. They were also upfront in the press that they were holding advance previews for Gran Turismo.
This isn’t a scenario of Angels Studios and Sound of Freedom — which many perceive has $10M-$20M bloated in their $180.5M running domestic cume due to double-counting off the distributor’s own side ticket sales web portal.
Read: many distribs’, off Comscore numbers, saw Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny beating Sound of Freedom on its July 4th opening day, $11.6M to $11.1M, despite Angels calling the Jim Caviezel pic’s first day at $14.2M.
At the end of the day, did this advance preview stunt for Gran Turismo work? Not really. But Sony believed in the movie, just like Paramount believed in Dungeons & Dragons and sought to create buzz. Especially at a time when the actors can’t promote the film because of the SAG-AFTRA strike. You can’t fault Sony for trying. No filmmaker, producer, or agent connected to the film can. The exits on Gran Turismo are spectacular at a 90% grade and an A CinemaScore.
Despite this, there’s no great rush to see Gran Turismo. Part of the problem is that there aren’t any big stars in the film, outside of David Harbour from Stranger Things and Lord of the Rings‘ Orlando Bloom. It’s also a race car movie, and those have spotty records (remember Ron Howard’s Chris Hemsworth-starring Rush? That was a platform release, but only $26.9M in its domestic run).
Gran Turismo isn’t Ford v. Ferrari, which opened to $31.4M with big stars like Matt Damon and Christian Bale and the brand names of the automakers in the title. Plus, that movie further won audiences over with its jaw-dropping race car scenes. Maybe Gran Turismo finds an audience in a fall that will dry up come late September. Through Friday, Gran Turismo counts $30M at the foreign box office.
The overall penultimate weekend of summer is heading toward an estimated $85.2M. While not a $100M weekend, it’s still +61% over the same period last year, when there was a lack of big studio product.

Amid this weekend’s box office accounting fuss between Gran Turismo and Barbie, it looks like there’s a phenomenon happening at the arthouse, and that’s with the MGM teen LGBTQ+ comedy, Bottoms. The movie, which was championed by Orion Boss Alana Mayo, is heading toward a great theater average of $48K from ten bookings in four markets, including NYC, L.A., San Francisco, and Austin. That per theater isn’t far from the $50K posted by Everything Everywhere All at Once in its ten theater first weekend opening, and it’s also close to the theater average of Searchlight’s Theater Camp, which did the same, but in six theaters. The Alamo Brooklyn, Angelika NY & AMC Grove grossed $30K+ apiece on Friday, which is translating to $225K Friday, $481K opening weekend. The movie is currently 95% fresh with Rotten Tomatoes critics and a platinum 100% with RT audiences. Bravo, Bottoms.

Indie wide releases are filling any gaps in the marketplace, but with droplets of bucks. Roadside Attractions/StudioCanal/Picture Company’s Liam Neeson movie Retribution is seeing $3.3M after a $1.29M Friday at 1,750 theaters. Critics and audience are excited by it, with a respective 29% on Rotten Tomatoes and a C CinemaScore and 54% on PostTrak. Guys bought tickets at 61%, with 36% of the audience between 18-34 and the largest quad being 25-34 years old at 24%, with another 59% of the audience coming in at 35+ years. Diversity demos are 56% Caucasian, 16% Latino and Hispanic, 11% Black, and 18% Asian/other. Retribution played the best in the South and the West. The Regal Manchester in Fresno currently counts the best gross in the country with $5K.

Friday Midday: Realize that National Cinema Day on Sunday is a wild card for all movies at the weekend box office, so consider these estimates carefully. It’s already clear that business on National Cinema Day Sunday will be significantly up over Saturday with EntTelligence reporting Sunday ticket presales +700%-plus over Saturday. It’s possible that Warner Bros’ Barbie and family features will see significant spikes.
Gran Turismo at 3,856 theaters is seeing $8M for Friday which includes in total $5.3M in previews from not just Thursday, but ten days of previews. The outlook for the weekend is $15M-$16M. Clarification here: on Shazam, Warners rolled that advance screening money into the pic’s total so the 3-day came out to be $53.5M with a total of $56.8M (meaning they didn’t roll that cash into the pic’s first Friday). In regards to some distributors’ pearl-clutching over Sony rolling the advance previews into Friday, others aren’t balking because this is the ‘Code Red’ (to use a term from A Few Good Men) that many studios have adopted in the millennium preview era of gross reporting: They typically load advance monies into Friday. There’s nothing unusual here. C’mon, studios, you’re starting movies on Thursdays at 12noon and calling it Friday.

Now even though Barbie per industry estimates is seeing $4M today and around $15.8M (-25%) at 3,736 for the weekend, she could very well go nuts on National Cinema Day Sunday and wind up winning the weekend, even with Gran Turismo‘s advance monies built into its Friday-Sunday. By Sunday, Barbie is looking to stand at $593M at the end of her sixth weekend, $7M shy of the six century domestic mark.
Warners has third place bragging rights with Blue Beetle at 3,871 theaters with an estimated $3M in his second Friday, -70%, for an estimated second weekend of $10.5M, -58% for a running total of $44M. By the way, that second weekend take is better than that of Shazam: Fury of the Gods which did $9.3M.
Universal’s Oppenheimer at 2,872 theaters is seeing a sixth Friday of $2.2M, and a 3-day of $7.8M (-27%) putting the Christopher Nolan’s running total by Sunday at $298.8M, becoming his third highest grossing movie at the domestic B.O., ahead of Inception ($293M) and behind The Dark Knight ($530M) and The Dark Knight Rises ($448M).
Fifth goes to Paramount’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem with a $5.9M fourth weekend at 3,145 theaters, -31%, after a $1.5M Friday. Running total looks to be near $98M.
Liam Neeson in ‘Retribution’ Lionsgate/Everett Collection
Roadside Attractions’ Liam Neeson movie, Retribution, is seeing $1M today for a $3M weekend in industry projections at 1,750 theaters. Critics loathe it at 30% Rotten, but audiences on the RT meter like it better at 72%.
Friday AM: “You’re not actually going to allow them to do that, are you?”
Such are the gripes across the City of Angels from rival distributors about Sony’s public-facing acknowledgment that they’ve previewed Gran Turismo over the last two weekends, lagniappe box office which will be included in Friday’s total.
Yesterday starting from 2PM showtimes, the feature take of the Sony Playstation game earned $1.4M at 3,156 theaters, including PLF and Imax monies. The Neill Blomkamp-directed movie has a shot at No. 1 this weekend making $12M-$15M at 3,800 theaters.
Sony at the end of July decided at the last minute to move Gran Turismo‘s wide opening from Aug. 11 to Aug. 25. This was for several reasons: one, to get away from the heat of Barbenheimer and also to create word of mouth on a movie that doesn’t have its stars to promote due to the SAG-AFTRA strike. Sony was transparent with the town that they were holding previews. It’s not always public knowledge when a studio is holding advance screenings for a movie.
In major markets such as LA, cinemas have been playing Gran Turismo on Friday, Saturday and Sunday; two weekends back-to-back. We’ve heard that preview cash has amounted to $3M+, but Sony hasn’t verified that yet.
As far as those rivals whining about Sony including the cash in this weekend’s gross — let he without sin cast the first stone. Y’all have juiced your weekends and Fridays with preview money going back to forever. Hello! New Line’s Shazam back in 2019 boasted a preview figure of $9.2M which included a robust advance Fandango-sponsored screening. Paramount and eOne’s Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves made $5.6M in previews which included Thursday showtimes (starting at 3PM), as well as Amazon sneaks among other pre-screenings. That studio was holding advance screenings for Dungeons and Dragons because they believed in the film and also wanted to get the word out. The Batman preview figure included $4M Tuesday previews in its overall preview figure of $17.6M back in March 2022. I can keep listing and boring you.
The Rotten Tomatoes critics score is now 60% fresh on Gran Turismo, however, audiences love it: Comscore/Screen Engine Postrak exits show 5 stars for general audiences, five stars from parents and 4 1/2 from kids under 12. Thursday audience saw 87% general audience, 6% parent and 7% kids. Guy leaning at 68% yesterday with the 18-34 set at 50%. Guys over 25 (46%) and women over 25 (22%) were the leading demos and respectively gave the pic its best scores of 90% and 96%. Gran Turismo before P&A cost $60M.
How much does the second annual National Cinema Day on Sunday dilute the box office? That’s the question and while we will have some indicators soon, the overall verdict will be known on Monday morning. All showtimes for all movies and formats are $4. Who’s going?
Briarcliff Entertianment’s faith-based Dennis Quaid movie The Hill did $110K last night in previews. That pic, along with other wide entries Roadside Attractions/StudioCanal/Picture Company’s Retribution and Bleecker Street’s Golda are all expected to do in the single digits.

Blue Beetle director Ángel Manuel Soto would love to cast Ted Lasso star Jason Sudeikis as a popular DC Comics character in a potential future sequel to his film.
In an interview with The Digital Fix, Soto revealed his dream casting choice for the character of Ted Kord, who assumed the role of Blue Beetle before Jaime Reyes. He explained that what matters most is finding the most suitable actor for the role, but he personally thinks Sudeikis would be a good fit for the character.

""My dream cast for Ted Kord has always been Jason Sudeikis,"" Soto told the outlet. ""But at the end of the day, it's about who's best for the character, who loves what we're trying to do. And who's willing to see Jaime Reyes' story continue.""
The post-credits scene for Blue Beetle sets up a potential sequel with Ted after he returns to deliver an important message to his daughter: He is, in fact, still alive. The former Blue Beetle does not appear on screen, but a painting in the background of the scene led some to believe that the role would end up going to Sudeikis.

It would be so dope to see him in the DCU. — BrutalVengeance (@BVengeance267) August 22, 2023
The Ted Kord teaser is a huge moment for fans of the legendary Charlton Comics turned DC hero, as it confirms the character's existence in the DC Universe. Whether we actually ever get to meet Jenny's mysterious father on screen is another matter, as a sequel will hinge on the box-office success of the first film.
Blue Beetle soared into theaters on August 18, but it had one of the weakest openings for a DCEU film. The film grossed nearly $25 million in the U.S. and Canada and $18.6 million overseas for a global total of $43.4 million across 64 markets, which means it has still got a way to go to recoup the costs of its $104 million budget.
Despite its sluggish start at the box office, Blue Beetle has received generally positive reviews from fans and critics, with IGN's own review praising Soto for managing to craft ""a superhero movie that sets itself apart within the bloated genre through the deeply connected bonds of Jaime and the Reyes family.""

2023-08-25 14:12:10+00:00,A pack of Oreos in Blue Beetle is actually a reference to a Justice League member,Martian Manhunter and Green Lantern Easter eggs are in Blue Beetle,"Blue Beetle may namecheck both Batman and Superman during its runtime, but it’s also hiding references to other Justice League members – ones that don’t immediately jump out upon a first, second, or even third rewatch.
At a recent Q&A event hosted by Collider, director Angel Manuel Soto revealed that the Blue Beetle post-credits scene is hiding an incredible Easter egg, via a pack of Oreos.
""You see it at the end, there’s a stack of Oreos. And who likes to eat Oreos?"" Soto asked during the Q&A. The audience responded in kind: Martian Manhunter.
Martian Manhunter, AKA J’onn J’onzz, is a prominent member of the Justice League who has telepathic abilities and can shapeshift. What you may not know, however, is J’onn has a craving for Oreos (otherwise known as the non-copyright-breaking Chocos in DC’s comics).
That, then, hints at Martian Manhunter being on the trail of the second Blue Beetle, Ted Kord. That’s not the only Justice League reference here, however.
During the sequence charting the Scarab’s arrival on Earth at the beginning of the movie, a green light is briefly shown flashing across the cosmos. That’s not a coincidence.
""For those of you guys that follow the Blue Beetle comics, there's a green light that hits this character, and that's a Green Lantern,” Soto explains. “If you didn’t catch it, watch it again.""

2023-07-18 18:53:00+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’ New Clip Teases Surprise DC Comics Villain,"Blue Beetle will introduce fans to a new DC Universe as Jaime Reyes faces off against Conrad Carapax, a new clip teases another DC comics villain may appear.","Blue Beetle is set to introduce fans to a brand new DC Universe as Jaime Reyes faces off against Conrad Carapax. However, a new clip teases another DC comics villain may be present in the film.
Jaime Reyes has his hands full in his first feature film. Not only does he have to learn how to control the Scarab on his back, but he needs to face both the evil business woman Victoria Kord and the dangerous contract killer Conrad Carapax. A new clip adds more to Jaime’s plate, teasing the appearance of the classic DC comics villain OMAC:
It’s time to power up, Jaime Reyes. ???? #BlueBeetle – Only in theaters August 18. pic.twitter.com/XL7wkJeNN5 — Blue Beetle (@bluebeetle) July 15, 2023
There are two versions of OMAC in the comics that could appear in Blue Beetle. The first is Buddy Blank, an office worker who uses Brother Eye’s satellite to turn into a member of the One-Man Army Corps. Given Conrad Carapax is already fills the role of a powerhouse to fight Jaime Reyes, the more likely option is a variation of the O.M.A.C. virus, which turns people into sentient drones. These drones would likely be fully artificial in the movie and controlled by Victoria Kord instead of Brother Eye. Though all of that is speculation, and fans could see a brand new form of OMAC in the DC Universe.
Who is DC’s Blue Beetle?
Blue Beetle is one of DC’s lesser-known heroes, but he has a dedicated fanbase nonetheless. Created in 1939 by Charles Wojtkowski, Blue Beetle has gone through several iterations over the years. The Jaime Reyes version of the character was introduced during the events of 2006’s Infinite Crisis and quickly became a fan-favorite.
In the pages of DC Comics, Jaime Reyes is a teenager from El Paso, Texas. Jaime discovers a scarab beetle-shaped device that bonds with his body, giving him access to an advanced suit of armor and various powers. He becomes the latest in a long line of Blue Beetles and must learn to balance his newfound abilities with his everyday life.

,Breaking Down the Final Fight Scene of Blue Beetle,The final epic fight in Blue Beetle finds the hero Jamie fully teaming up with the Scarab,"Spoiler Warning: This post contains spoilers for Blue Beetle.
If there’s a universal truth about superhero movies, it’s that they will end with an epic fight scene. The final fight of DC’s latest movie, Blue Beetle—in which an ancient relic of alien biotechnology generates a suit of extraordinary armor and bestows protagonist Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) with superpowers—finds the titular hero facing off against Lieutenant Carapax (Raoul Max Trujillo), the bionically enhanced right-hand man of villain, Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon), who owns the tech and weapons giant Kord Industries.
By the time of the standoff, Victoria has captured Jaime, flown him to an island lair called el Morro, and downloaded the code from the Scarab—the piece of alien biotech that becomes the bulletproof Blue Beetle suit—nearly killing him in the process. That code is then transferred into Carapax, the living prototype of Kord Industries’ OMAC, or One Man Army Corps cyborg system.
Carapax scoops up Jaime from inside a tunnel system, flies him through a fortress wall, and battles him, both in the air and on land.
“We didn't want action just to be action for the sake of action,” director Ángel Manuel Soto says of the showdown. “We wanted action to inform character.”

What happens in Blue Beetle’s final fight scene?
Jaime is also a cyborg of sorts: The Blue Beetle Scarab—named Khaji-Da and voiced by singer Becky G—that chooses him as its host tries to sync its artificial intelligence with his mind and body. At first, Jaime resists. He and his family are initially horrified by the Scarab’s Aliens-inspired arrival—and the realization that Khaji-Da will be inside of Jaime until death do they part.
Over time, Khaji-Da and Jaime become symbiotic, literally growing on each other. Khaji-Da learns Jaime’s first language (Spanish) and about the protective love he has for his family. Jaime teaches her about his pacifist beliefs. In the movie’s first fight scene (also Jaime vs. Carapax), Jaime specifically instructs Khaji-Da not to engage the attacker, a command that she blithely ignores, pointing to the arsenal at her disposal. “No! No weapons,” Jaime says. “Let me talk to him.” “Verbal communication is ill-advised in a combat scenario,” Khaji-Da responds. She’s hellbent on “eliminating the threat,” but Jaime insists that he’s not a killer, and she finally acquiesces.

“Now they're teaming up,” Soto says. “Yes, the Scarab still wants to kill, but now they're actually feeling each other a little bit more.”
At the movie’s climax, Jaime is on the brink of death (in a candlelit scene that pays homage to the 1960 Mexican film Macario), and makes the conscious decision to connect with Khaji-Da in order to save his life. His brain waves sync with the Scarab’s frequency, and they become one being.
Shortly thereafter, in the final fight scene, the Blue Beetle prevails, pinning Carapax to the ground, but Jaime is enraged. He thinks Carapax just killed his uncle, and he can’t seem to stop throwing punches, beating Carapax to a pulp. “Jaime, threat disarmed,” Khaji-Da warns. “You’re losing control. OMAC neutralized. Recommend to disengage.” He ignores her, tries to stab Carapax, and Khaji-Da physically stops him, freezing his arm in motion. “We’re not killers, Jaime,” she says. “Let him go.” Eventually, he complies.
“We always saw the yin-yang: Within the darkness of the Scarab, there is an element of humanity, there's a hint of light,” Soto says. “But also inside this light that is Jaime, there's also a hint of darkness. And them together, combined, create a perfect balance.”
How Blue Beetle’s filmmaker put the final battle scene together
Blue Beetle tells that story of character growth and development through its action. During the final fight scene, Jaime relies mostly on hand-to-hand combat, throwing punches and brandishing swords (even though the Blue Beetle suit can create anything he can imagine). In what could be the intro to a Blue Beetle saga, the creative team wanted Jaime to have to earn his origin story. The fighting at close quarters feels like training wheels: It takes Jaime a while to understand how Khaji-Da operates, but once he does, the wheels fall away.
Soto worked closely with stunt coordinator Jon Valera, leaning into the physicality of the fights, rather than using guns or other long-range weapons. “Perpetuating pain, it is a very personal act of violence,” Soto says. “Beating somebody to the pulp requires a specific darkness. It's easy for the villain to go there, but it is jarring to see a wholesome hero tap into that darkness, to the point that you fear that he might cross the line.”
Blue Beetle is, at its center, about a hero who is defined by his wholesome and peaceful nature, buoyed by family. Soto infused the film with the Japanese Tokusatsu style that he grew up watching, which uses practical special effects rather than relying on VFX, to make it feel lived-in, simultaneously realistic and nostalgic.

Much of Blue Beetle's final fight was shot on location at el Castillo San Felipe del Morro, a 16th century citadel in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico that Soto grew up visiting. The first movie Soto saw in theaters was Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which was famously filmed in the archeological site of Petra, Jordan. How cool would it be, he thought—as a fan, a filmmaker, and a Puerto Rican—to show his community’s historical sites to the world?
“Latin cinema is visceral, Latin cinema can be very bleak,” he says. “Oftentimes when it's a story about Latinos, it has to do with struggle and suffering. And yes, those are true. They should exist. But we can also have fun, too.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNjMwNjg5NS9ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1maWdodC1zY2VuZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

I spent many hours playing racing games as a teenager — hurtling along narrow European roads in “Need for Speed,” finding just the right angles for optimal performance. Despite the danger, I yearned to find out what it would be like “IRL” — in the real world. Would any of that gaming knowledge translate or would I be laughed off the course?
That question was answered for Jann Mardenborough, played by Archie Madekwe in the new folk “Gran Turismo.” After spending most of his life sitting in a chair playing the “Gran Turismo” racing simulator game, he is chosen to be part of a unique experiment, sponsored by Nissan and PlayStation.
In an almost fairy godmother moment, Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom) appears, offering him the opportunity to train and compete in an actual car, mentored by gruff heart-of-gold racing veteran Jack Salter (David Harbour).
This film is a combination adrenaline rush — that had me practically sweating in my seat — and beautifully tender drama as we watch a fledgling romance, and the captivating story of how Jann is able to see past the rough exterior of his trainer, building their relationship.
There are laugh-out-loud moments, like Salter using Enya’s “Orinoco Flow” to snap Jann out of a panic attack when he is thrown into a high stakes race, but overall “Gran Turismo” is almost non-stop action, after the initial character-driven ramp up.
The entire cast knocks it out of the park, and if you love cars, bring a bucket to drool into because are there some beauties on screen.
Director Neill Blomkamp is outstanding. He captures the tension, excitement and vibrant intensity of racing while giving us quietly moving scenes like the embrace between Jann and his estranged father.
You will want to see this movie in the cinemas because it needs to be seen on the largest screen possible for full effect.
Whether you enjoy racing or not, this is worth a trip to the theater.
‘Blue Beetle’

“Maybe it's time we get our own hero,” says George Lopez in the new DC comic-inspired movie “Blue Beetle,” the first of its kind to star a Mexican-American superhero.
This isn't a case of just casting one actor of color then claiming diversity and inclusion. Directed by Puerto Rican Ángel Manuel Soto, written by Mexican-American Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, and starring a Latino-dominated cast, the “Blue Beetle” proudly reflects the Latino voice by focusing on young Jaime Reyes' experiences trying to find a job as a newly graduate son of Mexican immigrants.
While navigating a white-dominated socioeconomic system, consistently fighting against discrimination, he accidentally becomes a superhuman. The brilliant part is that while shining light on some serious themes, Dunnet-Alcocer has created a playful, optimistic script that celebrates the Latino-American experience, and is a blast to watch.
When Jaime (Xolo Maridueñaolo) goes in for what he thinks is a job interview, he finds himself stuck with an ancient alien artifact. Literally. “The scarab,” as it is called, is a dangerous and highly-sought-after, sentient relic from another planet which chooses Jaime to be its host, implanting itself into his back, and sharing a multitude of its special abilities. Unlike every single superhero plot where a person gets unwanted powers and then tries to hide it from their family to protect them, the entire Reyes family has Jaime’s back from the moment of his, well, his beetle possession.
While the plot-point of figuring out how to become symbiotic with an alien lodged into your body sounds much like the dark and disturbing Venom movies, Jaime's journey in the “Blue Beetle” feels more like a witty lighthearted Mexican-American Spiderman from the Florida Keys.
While I am obviously a white dude, I deeply recognize the importance of how many Latino kids are going to see themselves in Jaime, and not only get themselves some cool action figures that look like them (when Jamie is not in full Blue Beetle mode), but who can truly feel recognized though this film.
Overall a solid superhero movie with dynamic action sequences, but still utilizing the common trope of an evil one-dimensional billionaire played by Susan Sarandon, “Blue Beetle’s” strength lies in the refreshing dynamics of the Reyes family as they all team up to support one of their own as he becomes the hero he was born to be.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBldGFsdW1hMzYwLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvcml2ZXJ0b3duLXJldmlld3MtMzAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-23 17:24:32+00:00,"Box Office Preview: ‘Gran Turismo’ Targets $10 Million Debut, Liam Neeson’s ‘Retribution’ Aims for Single Digits","Sony's racing drama ""Gran Turismo"" is driving to a soft $10 million to $12 million in its first weekend of release.","Sony’s racing drama “Gran Turismo” is driving to a sluggish $10 million to $12 million in its first weekend of release.
The film lands in 3,800 North American theaters on Friday and will compete with last weekend’s champion “Blue Beetle” for second place on domestic charts behind “Barbie.” Greta Gerwig’s box office behemoth is expected to return to the No. 1 spot in its sixth weekend of release, with projections of $12 million to $14 million between Friday and Sunday. So far, “Barbie” has grossed $572 million and is days away from overtaking “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” ($572 million) as the highest-grossing domestic release of the year.
National Cinema Day, which takes place on Aug. 27, could throw off estimates across the board. That’s because movie tickets on Sunday will cost under $4 — much less than the average ticket price — at participating theaters. More than 3,000 locations, including approximately 30,000 available screens, are expected to take part in the one-day event.
Neill Blomkamp (“District 9”) directed “Gran Turismo,” which is adapted from the video game of the same name. Critics have been mixed on the $60 million-budgeted movie, which tells the true story of a teenage video gamer who takes on the world of professional race car driving. Variety’s Owen Gleiberman positively reviewed the film and praised the “spontaneous humanistic grace, and the racing sequences.”
It may be a close battle between “Gran Turismo” and “Blue Beetle” — unless the latter manages to hold on better than its DC predecessors, “The Flash” and “Shazam: Fury of the Gods,” at the box office. After debuting to just $25 million, the latest superhero spectacle looks to drop by 60% or more in its sophomore outing with ticket sales around $8.5 million to $10 million.
Elsewhere, Liam Neeson’s action-thriller “Retribution” is targeting a single digit debut of $2 million to $3 million from 1,800 theaters. Those lackluster ticket sales are similar to the various Neeson vehicles, such as “The Marksman” ($3 million debut), “Blacklight” ($3.5 million debut) and “Memory” ($3.1 million debut), which are far more popular on premium video-on-demand than they are in theaters.
In the film, Neeson plays a dad who is driving with his two kids when he receives a phone call from an anonymous assailant, who claims there’s a bomb in the car. Unable to leave the vehicle, he has to figure out a way to keep his children and himself alive. “Retribution” currently has a 27% on Rotten Tomatoes.
In limited release, Emma Seligman’s “Bottoms” is landing in 10 theaters in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Austin. The film, which stars “Shiva Baby’s” Rachel Sennot and “The Bear’s” Ayo Edebiri, debuted at SXSW and cost under $15 million. The well-reviewed “Bottoms” follows two high schoolers who starts a fight club to meet girls and lose their virginity. MGM and Orion are releasing the film.
In Variety’s review, Gleiberman says “Bottoms” is “unlike any high-school comedy you’ve ever seen.” The Gen Z comedy, he wrote, “walks a tightrope between sensitivity and insanity (with a knowing bit of inanity)” and plays as “a satire of victimization, a satire of violence, and a satire of itself.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvYm94LW9mZmljZS1ncmFuLXR1cmlzbW8tcmV0cmlidXRpb24tMTIzNTcwMjk2NC_SAVZodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9uZXdzL2JveC1vZmZpY2UtZ3Jhbi10dXJpc21vLXJldHJpYnV0aW9uLTEyMzU3MDI5NjQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

James Gunn Denies Rumor Ben Affleck Had A Voice Cameo In ‘Blue Beetle’
Source: Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), Warner Bros.
Ben Affleck’s last appearance in the DCEU was in The Flash or at least that is what we were led to believe. A few sources confirmed he would get the opportunity to return and continue on as one of the Multiverse’s Batmen, but the chances of that were dead in the water by the time James Gunn took over DC Studios.

So The Flash, in its final form, was the end officially until a rumor popped up claiming he had one last appearance on deck. It simply was cut. Scooper Syl Abdul reported this, saying Affleck recorded a line that would have been used in Blue Beetle. This small cameo was to be voice-only and not physical.
It also was meant to get a laugh according to the scooper, but it still would have planted Blue Beetle in the DCEU. “Ben Affleck had a VOICE-ONLY CAMEO for #BlueBeetleMovie that was cut by Gunn,” Abdul posted on X. “Was purely comedic BUT it placed blue Beetle film in batfleck continuity.”

This claim wouldn’t go unchallenged.
Since his name was mentioned, James Gunn took notice and decided to respond to it. The studio head denied the rumor, replying to Abdul he did not hear about any voice or Affleck cameo from Blue Beetle’s producers. “I never heard of one because one never existed (just asked the producers),” Gunn wrote, putting to rest more speculation for now.
RELATED: ‘Blue Beetle’ Review: A Bit Iron Man, A Lot Ant-Man, But All DC
At one point, Gunn embraced Blue Beetle as the first hero of his DCU. A little later, he seemed to walk back from that to (one would think) let the film stand on its own. It didn’t do a good job of that, despite a few rave reviews and a high score on Rotten Tomatoes.
If there was an Affleck cameo, no one would have seen it or cared. Moreover, he has moved on as Affleck rejected the opportunity to direct The Brave and The Bold. He expressed renewed excitement for playing Batman again after The Flash wrapped, but that comes naught with Gunn’s universe relaunch, which is its own can of worms.

2023-08-20 15:53:22+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’ director Ángel Manuel Soto says the DC film is a ‘love letter to our ancestors’,The director has taken on a worldwide press tour alone as the rest of his cast and crew cannot promote the film due to the current Hollywood strikes.,"By LESLIE AMBRIZ (Asssociated Press)
WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif.. (AP) — Director Ángel Manuel Soto didn’t think too much about the “Latino side of things” when visually crafting DC’s “Blue Beetle” alongside Mexican screenwriter Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer.
The film — starring “Cobra Kai’s” Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes, aka Blue Beetle and DC’s first Latino superhero — oozes with Mexican references and elements of other Latin American cultures through almost every scene. Still, the Puerto Rican director says that all of this came naturally due to his and Dunnet-Alcocer’s backgrounds.
“We never were like, ‘Okay, so how are we going to make this Latino?’ We cannot hide who we are. If we have the opportunity to tell our collective experiences because we are Latino, they’re going to come out Latino.”
In “Blue Beetle,” Reyes finds himself in possession of an ancient scarab named Khaji Da made of alien biotechnology that chooses Reyes as its symbiotic host. In a hilarious scene, the scarab attaches itself to Reyes, transforming the hesitant young adult into a superhero.
Soto is promoting the film by himself due to the ongoing Hollywood strikes, which prohibit actors and screenwriters from promoting work under television and theatrical contracts. Still, he made sure to bring his cast along for the ride via a culturally relevant white shirt with illustrations of his lead cast as Mexican Loteria characters during the Los Angeles leg of the press tour. The game is similar to bingo and is popular in Mexican and Mexican-American households.
“I know they’re sad that they cannot be here, but they understand that what they’re doing is important for the future generations, and they have my full support, so the least I could do was bring them with me,” said Soto. “I know they’re here in spirit.”
Soto hopes that audiences will still show up to support the film when it opens Friday.
“Hopefully, people will watch the movie because it is a good movie, and our cast killed it and they’re going to fall in love with them,” said Soto.
The Associated Press sat down with Soto to chat more about the film’s seamless Mexican and Latino cultural references and why he was initially hesitant to take on the project.
Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.
SOTO: I love talking about what I love. I think as exhausting as it might be, because it’s a lot for one person to do, connecting with fans and having experiences with people from other cultures, from other countries definitely fuels the energy cause I’m learning a lot. I learn a lot when I talk to people. I get reassurance, I get empowered. So any depletion of energy caused to forced nights of sleep and constant travel are immediately replenished when interacting with beautiful people.
SOTO: I had no idea they were working on something like “Blue Beetle.” Coming out of the success of a film like “The Joker” and understanding there’s other characters that might have so many things to explore, I wanted to pitch that Bane idea. So they came in and was like, ‘Yeah, that’s a great idea. But we got this product here, and it’s “Blue Beetle.” I knew a little bit about Blue Beetle. I knew that Jaime Reyes was in it. My first reaction was that I didn’t want to brownwash something, you know, that already existed. It’s okay if there’s familiarity with certain things, but I didn’t want to be that person that my Latinidad had to conform to somebody else’s expectations of Latinidad. I wanted to be able to be free, and I wanted the actors that I hired that are Latino to be authentically themselves.
So when I said that, they were like, ‘Oh, no, no, don’t worry. Our writer is Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer. He is a Mexican from Querétaro and just read the script. Let me know what you think.’ And when I read the script, I could see that the person who wrote it not only is Latino, but he wrote characters that he knows and they were so relatable because we’ve realized that even though we’re both from different countries, we’re so similar. Our families are so similar. The music, the TV shows, we grew up exactly the same, just in different countries. And we’re like, ’Oh my gosh, this is special because not only Mexicans are going to connect. I think all Latinos are going to connect. And consequently, all the people that are not Latino also are going to connect if they’re open and curious.
SOTO: We know the tropes, right? We know the hero’s journey, and we all know the superhero genre, how it works. We didn’t want to miss the opportunity (to) tell the story through a different lens. For us, it’s hard to keep a secret from your mother or family because they’re always in your face, always up your nose. And we wanted to like, ‘Okay, that’s going to happen, then let’s just keep them in from the beginning.’ They were in the transformation. They’re still going to be their family, and they’re going to bully him because he is a reluctant hero. Not reluctant for a moment, the whole film, he just wants this (scarab) out and then he ends up understanding that that’s his destiny and that could not have happened without his family.
And we wanted to create this love letter to the people that came before us, to our ancestors, especially to the women in our life. None of my family are damsels in distress. They’re tougher than I can ever be. And we wanted to honor that. They paved the way and they are heroes in their own right. So we wanted to give them heroic arcs because it is important to see the women in our lives differently than society has pushed them to be.
SOTO: You know, the movies that you have seen, every time they go to a Latin country, if they go to Mexico, its always the same music. If they go to the Caribbean, it’s always the same music. And the truth is that, yeah, we listen to that, but we also listen to other stuff. Not only do we consume stuff from the U.S., but we also have great rock bands in our countries. Just because other people have not heard it doesn’t mean that they’re not great. So the same way that I’ve been introduced to other music from the U.S. without any complaints, I wanted to introduce to the world, to the music that I grew up with, hoping they don’t complain about it either.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJhbnQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMjAvYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtZGlyZWN0b3ItbmdlbC1tYW51ZWwtc290by1zYXlzLXRoZS1kYy1maWxtLWlzLWEtbG92ZS1sZXR0ZXItdG8tb3VyLWFuY2VzdG9ycy0yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

The union representing the Hollywood writers strike said on Friday it had received a counterproposal from the studios that it would consider, an apparent sign of progress in the more than 100-day-old strike. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) said it would respond next week “after deliberation” on the offer from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which negotiates on behalf of companies including Walt Disney and Netflix.

2023-08-21 16:51:00+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’: James Gunn Responds To Ben Affleck Batman Cameo Rumors,"Addressing a claim about the rumored voice cameo of Ben Affleck’s Batman in Blue Beetle, DC Studios co-head James Gunn was quick to set the record straight.","In a recent Twitter interaction, the spotlight was once again on James Gunn, co-CEO of DC Studios alongside Peter Safran. Addressing a claim about the rumored voice cameo of Ben Affleck’s Batman in Blue Beetle, Gunn was quick to set the record straight.
A Twitter user voiced certainty that James Gunn and his fellow co-CEO, Peter Safran, had cut a Ben Affleck Batman voice cameo from the Blue Beetle movie. But Gunn, never one to shy away from addressing speculations head-on, swiftly debunked the claim. His response was clear: “I’ve never heard of a Ben Affleck voice cameo in [Blue] Beetle, nor has Peter [Safran], much less cut one.”
I've never heard of a Ben Affleck voice cameo in Beetle, nor has Peter, much less cut one. — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) August 18, 2023
Looking ahead in the DC film lineup, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is currently slated to hit theaters on December 20, 2023. If Ben Affleck doesn’t make an appearance in the Jason Momoa sequel, it seems The Flash would mark his final portrayal of the Dark Knight.
Over the weekend, Blue Beetle debuted with a tally of $25.4 million in North America. When combined with its international earnings, an additional $18 million from 63 different markets, the global opening stands at a somewhat underwhelming $43 million.
DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn has confirmed that Xolo Maridueña’s Jaime Reyes and a handful of other characters from Blue Beetle will continue within the canon of the DCU. Although this film was made under the previous regime, Gunn’s confirmation regarding the future of these characters bodes well for future stories. After all, a Booster Gold series was announced as part of DCU’s Chapter One: Gods and Monsters, and given that character’s ties to both Ted Kord and Jaime Reyes, it looks possible that we will see those three interact together sometime in the future.
Who is DC’s Blue Beetle?
Blue Beetle is one of DC’s lesser-known heroes, but he has a dedicated fanbase nonetheless. Created in 1939 by Charles Wojtkowski, Blue Beetle has gone through several iterations over the years. The Jaime Reyes version of the character was introduced during the events of 2006’s Infinite Crisis and quickly became a fan-favorite.
In the pages of DC Comics, Jaime Reyes is a teenager from El Paso, Texas. Jaime discovers a scarab beetle-shaped device that bonds with his body, giving him access to an advanced suit of armor and various powers. He becomes the latest in a long line of Blue Beetles and must learn to balance his newfound abilities with his everyday life.
The full cast of Blue Beetle also includes Bruna Marquezine, Belissa Escobedo, George Lopez, Adriana Barraza, Elpidia Carrillo, Damián Alcázar, Raoul Trujillo, Susan Sarandon and Harvey Guillén.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vaGVyb2ljaG9sbHl3b29kLmNvbS9qYW1lcy1ndW5uLWJlbi1hZmZsZWNrLWJhdG1hbi1ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,Comic Book Reviews for This Week: 9/6/2023,"Dozens of comic book reviews covering this week's hottest new releases from Marvel, DC, Image, and more...","Welcome to this week in comic book reviews! The staff have come together to read and review nearly everything that released today. It isn't totally comprehensive, but it includes just about everything from DC and Marvel with the important books from the likes of Image, Boom, IDW, Dark Horse, Dynamite, and more. The review blurbs you'll find contained herein are typically supplemented in part by longform individual reviews for significant issues. This week that includes Blue Beetle #1, Ghost Rider/Wolverine: Weapons of Vengeance – Omega #1, and Hunt for the Skinwalker #1. Also, in case you were curious, our ratings are simple: we give a whole or half number out of five; that's it! If you'd like to check out our previous reviews, they are all available here.
DC #1 BATMAN #137 If the opening of ""The Gotham War"" was bad, Batman #137 just doubles down on it to be just as terrible. The conflict makes no sense and Zdarsky is failing Batman as a character hard, so hard that Batman isn't even recognizable as DC's iconic hero. Instead, he's the problem at the center of this and while there would be value in telling a story in which Batman realized that he is as much a contributor to Gotham's problems as he is a solution, that's very clearly not what is at play here. The only thing of any value here is that the fight sequences look interesting, but they narratively are garbage so what actual value they have is almost entirely negated. This issue feels very much like they've just taken literal years of Batman development and thrown them in the garbage to push through a half-baked idea of pure, rushed, nonsensical ridiculousness. -- Nicole Drum Rating: 1 out of 5 BIRDS OF PREY #1 There are a lot of reasons why Birds of Prey #1 can be dubbed excellent: Kelly Thompson's snappy and heartfelt script, Leonardo Romero and Jordie Bellarie's impossibly-classic and Alex Toth-esque aesthetic, and plot twists that are so genius, you'll find yourself shocked DC hasn't already done them yet. On top of all of that, this first issue gives the mere concept of Birds of Prey the weight it deserves – perfectly bouncing back to the book's impossibly-cool globe-trotting roots while still carrying the history of recent runs for the team. Birds of Prey #1 is a shining example of what makes the ""Dawn of DC"" initiative work so well, and I am incredibly excited to see where it goes next. -- Jenna Anderson Rating: 5 out of 5 BLUE BEETLE #1 [READ THE FULL REVIEW HERE] With Graduation Day in the rearview mirror, Jaime Reyes is off to bigger and better things in DC's newest ongoing series Blue Beetle. Jaime has proven himself time and again as worthy of not just the Scarab but also the trust of those he is sworn to protect, and that carries into this new story. Writer Josh Trujillo shifts the focus from Jaime's growth as a hero to his growth as a leader, mentor, and peacekeeper. It's an effective shift, especially when paired with the arrival of the Horizon and the greater presence of the former foes turned allies Dynastes and Nitida. Artist Adrián Gutiérrez and colorist Wil Quintana are phenomenal throughout the issue as well, infusing every page with unreal energy and personality. It's a wonderful time to be a Blue Beetle fan, and this newest era is off to one hell of a start. -- Matthew Aguilar Rating: 5 out of 5 CITY BOY #4 City Boy finds a way to continue its core concept without ever getting close to stale — something that feels like a marvel, especially given how new its titular protagonist is. A personal journey to Bludhaven puts Cameron's powers, and the fate of the world, at risk once again, and the resulting story leaves room for some compelling conversation about the city's role in the larger DCU. Greg Pak and Minkyu Jung continue to craft a story that's not only well-executed and scrappy, it's a fascinating proof of concept for why its titular hero is worth following. -- Jenna Anderson Rating: 4.5 out of 5 FIRE & ICE: WELCOME TO SMALLVILLE #1 It's been a long time coming for Fire & Ice to get their due, but Fire & Ice: Welcome to Smallville more than pulls it off. in the hands of Joanne Starer and artist Natacha Bustos, the issue delivers what might be comics' most iconic friendship with both deep and obvious respect for their character histories while also leaning into more modern complexity. The result is a comic that has the feel of the Justice League of the late 1980s but with a bit more awareness, with both Bea and Tora treated as real characters with flaws, frustrations, and legitimate complaints about how they're seen and treated by the rest of the superhero community. It's also just fun, which brings it all together in a fun read that is both serious but doesn't take itself too serious. It is pitch perfect in every way. -- Nicole Drum Rating: 5 out of 5 THE JOKER: THE MAN WHO STOPPED LAUGHING #10 This latest issue finally reveals the mystery behind why there are two Jokers running around, and while the ultimate answer isn't as mind-blowing as I would have hoped, the story is solid enough to look past it. Rosenberg and Di Giandomenico are able to weave a compelling story following one of the Jokers in this Joker war, maintaining his menace while continuing to inject questions as to which Clown Prince of Crime is the real deal. As usual, The Man Who Stopped Laughing also had Francavilla returning to artistic duties for a humorous side story that pulls back more layers. The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing #10 is another worthy addition to the series, though it stumbles a tad with the heroes' side of the equation as it feels like there simply isn't much for them to do here. Ultimately though, this latest story focusing on the Harlequin of Hate is a compelling read and weaves a tale worthy of the Joker. -- Evan Valentine Rating: 4 out of 5 prevnext
DC #2 (Photo: DC) JUSTICE SOCIETY OF AMERICA #6 Justice Society of America #6 sets the stage for a new generation of heroes as it draws upon both Stargirl: The Lost Children and Per Degaton's recent time-travel rampage to (re-)introduce readers to a slew of new legacy heroes, primarily tied to Golden Age icons. Although earlier issues in the series could seem scattered, the abundance of new conflicts and characters present here all stem from a similar origin and provide what is essentially a series of vignettes with some cohesion. Nearly every introduction provides a compelling start, whether it's the curse afflicting Salem the Witch Girl, Cherry Bomb's lack of control, or Ladybug's sole attachment to her past. There's a tremendous amount of promise found amongst this eccentric collection of sidekicks and artist Marco Santucci does an excellent job of displaying their designs without losing track of the emotions present in each sequence. The energy present in the second arc of Justice Society of America recalls Johns' earliest work at DC Comics on the same title in a warm fashion that promises this series' best days still lie ahead of it. -- Chase Magnett Rating: 4 out of 5 PEACEMAKER TRIES HARD! #5 Peacemaker and Red Bee's raid on The Brain's hideout is a non-stop deluge of escalating action and humor resulting in one of the single most enjoyable issues of superhero comics released this year. The narrative is woven together by an ongoing dialogue between the two heroes that regularly plays against the actions on the page to enhance their characterizations and ideas. Small jokes, like Red Bee unscrewing a drain Peacemaker attempts to force open, and big ones, like being confronted by an army of Deathstroke babies, hit hard and deliver belly laughs throughout the issue. Shaded action beats with over-the-top onomatopoeia (avoiding the grawlix annoyances of other Black Label releases) maintain a frantic pace delivering three big action sequences. Throughout all of that violence, there's a sincere, almost innocent, heart to the comic that resonates with two weirdos caring deeply for their animal companions and striving to be ever-so-slightly better. Peacemaker Tries Hard! summons both R-rated action and laughs along with a surprisingly sweet story that could only exist in superhero comics; the only bad news is that only one issue remains. -- Chase Magnett Rating: 5 out of 5 POISON IVY #14 As Poison Ivy goes, this issue is just pretty okay—which is still high praise—but coming off of ""Knight Terrors,"" it has a little bit of table setting to do to reestablish what had been going on prior to the event and while that's not the most exciting, this issue does it serviceably. Pam's part of the story feels a little confusing and, to an extent, slightly forced, but Janet from HR gets a bit more time to shine and it's a delight. Wilson does such a good job of exploring the regular person's perspective and, by extension, the idea that no one is hero or villain as everyone switches sides at least once. It's an idea that we don't dig into nearly enough in stories, especially when it comes to Batman and the overall world of superheroes so approaching it here is an absolute gem. We may be doing a good bit of catch up with this issue, but it's still solid. -- Nicole Drum Rating: 3.5 out of 5 SHAZAM! #3 The stranger Shazam! grows, the better it gets. In the course of Shazam! #3, readers encounter a squabbling sextet of ancient gods, Gorilla City, an alien T-Rex accountant, and the family's talkative tiger babysitter; each of these images are rendered in fabulous fashion by Dan Mora who updates the Silver Age's greatest charms for a new era. All of these idiosyncratic elements are neatly woven together into a story that's clearly more than its individual components. Conspiracies in outer space and magical conflicts alike are slowly weaving themselves together and carving out space for robust themes to emerge as Billy questions his relationship with such immense power. While the source of the gods' angst with their champion and nebulous threats from the stars remain unclear, Shazam! #3 provides plenty of new details and spectacle as Billy learns about his new predicament and each new sequence offers an abundance of wondrous visuals. Shazam! Is a bona fide can't-miss comic for anyone who loves fun-filled superhero series. -- Chase Magnett Rating: 4.5 out of 5 STEELWORKS #4 Steelworks continues to shine the brightest when it focuses on John Henry Irons, his company, and the interesting mission that works for a world where Superman isn't needed. Where it continues to struggle is in its villains, while the Silver Mist continues to have powers that are an interesting foil to the man in a suit of ever-evolving armor, his benefactor needs more layers to prove effective. Still, Steelworks continue to be one of the better stories that focuses on Irons, separating him from Clark to help strengthen his identity and how he approaches protecting Metropolis. Steelworks can be rough around the edges at times, but makes for a worthy addition to John's superhero resume. -- Evan Valentine Rating: 4.5 out of 5 prevnext
Marvel #1 THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #33 Since its release nearly 40 years, ""Kraven's Last Hunt""—perhaps the most acclaimed Spider-Man comic published since Amazing Spider-Man #33 (vol. 1)—many subsequent writers have attempted to homage or recreate the story, often to very limited success. The Amazing Spider-Man #33 (vol. 6) promises to be the first outing to recapture that magic. Using Peter's infection with Norman's sins in the prior issue to invert many of the familiar dynamics, it places Peter Parker, now driven by rage and cruelty, into the role of the hunter. Even while Vermin, Kraven's son, and even a coffin all play familiar roles, the dynamics are entirely new and focused on questioning Peter's heroic identity as Spider-Man. This is framed in a number of ways, including an impressive bit of captioned lettering that contrasts characters' conscious and subconscious thoughts. Although the framing is excellent, it excels most under artist Patrick Gleason's response to the iconic work of Mike Zeck. Gleason never denies his own style, exaggerating forms and providing plenty of power, especially in an impressive splash of Peter screaming. He draws in a number of influences from the original work, including at least one specific sequence and an appreciation for using darkness to frame scenes. It is clear how Zeck's eye influences Gleason's own approach, but the work on the page delivers something new and compelling in its synthesis. Amazing Spider-Man #33 (already a notable number) lays out an enormous feat for the story ahead as it seeks to rival a piece of the Spider-Man canon but the tact and skill displayed in this set up makes that feat seem entirely achievable. This may be the best story yet in an already excellent run. -- Chase Magnett Rating: 4.5 out of 5 BLACK PANTHER #4 The first half of this new issue is a bit of a departure for the series, focusing entirely on the action-heavy battle with Deathlok. The action is clear, quick, and exciting, wrapping up before it wears out its welcome. In the back half, Black Panther gets back to the investigative storyline that has made the series so special. It gets a little denser than previous issues, but it's still leagues ahead of other current superhero sagas. -- Charlie Ridgely Rating: 4.5 out of 5 DOCTOR STRANGE #7 Doctor Strange and General Strange come toe-to-toe in a battle of the wits, a fight fought with words and strategy over spells and mystical castings. MacKay presents an exceptionally fresh conflict, one in which Stephen is left to grapple with his future self's murderous path despite his oath as a doctor to save lives no matter what the cost. The water that is the War of the Seven Spheres is beginning to simmer once again, and if MacKay and Ferry can make it boil, Strange fans may have a serious hit on their hands. -- Adam Barnhardt Rating: 4.5 out of 5 FANTASTIC FOUR #11 Fantastic Four #11 drives right to the heart of The Thing – a hard-nosed exterior concealing the biggest heart of Marvel Comics. The issue provides another well conceived, one-and-done adventure featuring a classic enemy posing a series of unique challenges for Ben Grimm to solve, all while he's nagged by a stray dog who simply won't leave him alone. While the dog is initially made out to be a hanger-on, the development and experiments performed slowly draw its relationship with Grimm to the issue's forefront and provides a rewarding (albeit inevitable from page one) bonding experience for the two. It is sweet without being saccharine and sincerely considers the perspective of a canine, rather than struggling to anthropomorphize its point of view. Both the grand challenges and Grimm's specific responses are well illustrated, drawing the scientific method into the issue, even if Coello still struggles to maintain a consistent (and firm) composition of The Thing's face. This issue is a heartwarming affair in the best sort of way, opting to succeed on reader's expectations rather than defy. I, for one, am very excited to see more of The Thing and his new best friend. -- Chase Magnett Rating: 4 out of 5 GHOST RIDER/WOLVERINE: WEAPONS OF VENGEANCE – OMEGA #1 [READ THE FULL REVIEW HERE] Weapons of Vengeance is a Marvel event done right. No world-ending plot is needed, just a demonic invasion that is at as small of a scale as that can be. Faithful to both of its eponymous heroes, Ghost Rider/Wolverine: Weapons of Vengeance – Omega #1 is a suitable ending for this event that also sets the stage for what's next in both Ghost Rider and Wolverine. And as it does all that, nothing is lost as a result of Percy's balancing act between the two series. At the end of this event, its story is wrapped up as tightly as can be and each of the characters Involved have an exciting new arc set for the future. It doesn't get much better than this in superhero comics. -- Adam Barnhardt Rating: 4.5 out of 5 IMMORTAL X-MEN #15 There's a scene in Immortal X-Men #15 where Sebastian Shaw and Selene take turns grandstanding. The scene establishes their motivations well enough – Shaw's greed and hunger for power, Selene's bloodlust. Despite that, it's hard not to think about how much more interesting these motivations were when these villainous characters had to work with their enemies. Now that they've reverted to their typical killing and plundering, a spark is lost, but Gillen and Medina make the most of it. With Curiel's help, the issue feels consistent with the artwork of preceding issues, with perhaps a bit more bite to the action, which fits the story as Orchis is taking the fight for the fallen paradise. Elsewhere, the faith-based story of Hope, Exodus, Destiny, and the wandering mutants in the desert begins to take on a new shape with the revelation of where they are and who is there with them. It's two fronts of the war for Eden, fought amongst the fallen, and if this is going to be Krakoa's last act, that's a hell of a note to go out on. -- Jamie Lovett Rating: 4 out of 5 MAGNETO #2 Magneto's throwback miniseries continues to be fascinating. While the rest of the X-Men world is dealing with the ""Fall of X,"" here we have a miniseries where Eric is internally combatting how the character has been written over the years, from cackling villain to complex mentor and back again. I don't take too much stock in the ""daughter"" reveal and the New Mutants cast can't quite shed that 90s cheesiness at times, but everything involving Eric's mental struggle is gripping. -- Connor Casey Rating: 3 out of 5 MOON KNIGHT #27 The introduction of Hunter's Moon has done wonders for Moon Knight, introducing a new layer of mythology to an already extensive lore while also providing a stark contrast to how Marc operates as a fist of Khonshu. Writer Jed MacKay continues to explore those differences in Moon Knight #27, but the expansion of Hunter's Moon's own abilities can't help but steal the show at times, especially in one gorgeous sequence by the talented team of artist Federico Sabbatini and color artist Rachelle Rosenberg. The art style fits the mind bending investigation to a tee, and at the center of this mind trip is an unexpected and emotional discovery that gives the story its heart. While some of the Black Spectre plans and plot aren't as strong, the relationship between Hunter's Moon and Moon Knight and their discoveries along the way are well worth your time. -- Matthew Aguilar Rating: 4 out of 5 prevnext
Marvel #2 (Photo: Marvel Comics) SCARLET WITCH #8 Scarlet Witch is easily the most consistent book in Marvel's arsenal managing to deliver a top-notch story that subverts expectations in all the right ways. In this latest issue, Wanda's newest mission puts her toe-to-toe with Loki, and Steve Orlando's script delivers a shining portrait of each of their unconventional comic histories. Lorenzo Tammetta and Sara Pichelli's art is absolutely seamless, and Frank William's colors are especially gorgeous. If you're somehow not reading Scarlet Witch yet, use this week's issue as an opportunity to fix that. -- Jenna Anderson Rating: 5 out of 5 SILK #5 The latest Silk series comes to a decent conclusion. The bulk of Emily Kim's volume has been about playing with dream logic and imagery as Cindy Moon has been navigating literal nightmares, Kim brings this all to a head with some fun ideas that are best seen in comics. Silk #5 once again has some great art by IG Guara and colors by Ian Herring which help sell the unique tones that are present. Silk fans will certainly find something fun here, but this series is more built on the dream pitch rather than telling a fun Silk story, whose presence often felt ancillary. -- Spencer Perry Rating: 3 out of 5 SILVER SURFER REBIRTH: LEGACY #1 Silver Surfer Rebirth: Legacy goes live this week with its first issue, and it puts our favorite chrome hero in a tight spot. We unite with the Silver Surfer as he completes a mission with Captain Marvel's son, but things go awry with a secret identity is revealed. The twist ends with a cliffhanger that puts Silver Surface's life in danger, and it seems the hero is not at fault for the crime he has been accused of. -- Megan Peters Rating: 3 out of 5 SPIDER-GWEN ANNUAL #1 Spider-Gwen Annual #1 is one of those annuals that relies on the reader being current on the stories preceding it to fully understand what is happening—it's technically the next chapter in the Contest of Chaos rather than a true annual—but even at that, it's a fun little read. Gwen and Ami find themselves in a medieval setting that ends up being not exactly what it seems so you get quips, action, and some interesting pop culture references that are a lot of fun. The art is enjoyable as well in that it offers sort of a unique take on the different styles within the setting and it makes the reading of things just a bit more fun. Overall, other than it being a part of a larger whole, it's not a bad issue. -- Nicole Drum Rating: 3 out of 5 STAR WARS #38 This proper Star Wars series leans into the silliness of a sentient Scourge attempting to infiltrate as many droids as possible, as one droid specifically is seen barely escaping infection in Jabba's Palace and going to great lengths to avoid acquisition. Meanwhile, Lando and Lobot enact their scheme to break into the Palace to unite with this droid, and while they ultimately cross paths, it's possible they are in an even more dangerous situation than where they started. Given that this issue features a flashback in which Lobot is seen wearing a big, purple wig, it's clear that this series is leaning into the absurdity of the Dark Droids crossover event, even if other titles are taking things a bit more seriously. In addition to be entertaining in its own right, the book also explains how Lando got into Jabba's Palace in the first place, a point which was glazed over in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. This trio of characters will hopefully continue to serve as the focal point of Star Wars during the Dark Droids event, as they all play well off of each other in the face of a convoluted threat. -- Patrick Cavanaugh Rating: 4 out of 5 STAR WARS: DARK DROIDS #2 The Scourge first comes for the metal, but now it's coming for the meat, as the droid operating system that has been resurrected sets its sights on somehow jumping into a human body in hopes of controlling the Force. Potentially the sacrifice of this being the second installment in the storyline is that the story has to deliver plenty of exposition in favor of narrative momentum, which is made especially convoluted with the incorporation of a droid's syntax. Despite the last issue teasing that the Scourge has entered C-3PO, that's still not interesting enough to make this issue feel particularly lively. Still, even if the book largely felt like it was just spinning its wheels, it does tease that the next chapter could be a bit more engaging. Baked into the concept is something relatively campy, so even though we know the book likely won't come with any major payoffs, it could serve as an entertaining ancillary adventure. -- Patrick Cavanaugh Rating: 3 out of 5 X-MEN #26 On a fundamental level, X-Men #26 delivers familiar mutant-based storytelling beats. The humans are oppressing the mutants. The mutants are not taking it well, and they're fighting back. Things are a bit more desperate than usual, and this time, the X-Men are out for blood instead of respect. However, there are cringeworthy elements, including the repeated use of ""resist"" as a catchphrase long after overuse of the word online sapped all strength from it. Then there's the use of a person with alopecia to make a point, using the nameless character like a prop. While those optics are, at best, grating, the fundamentals are still there, even if seeing characters hanging out in the hold Hellfire Club feels retrograde after the inventiveness of the Krakoan age. With its slow pace, X-Men makes Fall of X feel less like it has anything to say and more like another awkward holding pattern for Marvel's mutants. -- Jamie Lovett Rating: 2.5 out of 5 prevnext
Other Publishers #1 BUFFY: THE LAST VAMPIRE SLAYER #2 Buffy the Last Vampire Slayer #2 establishes a familiar status quo for our new slayer, Thessaly. The story of why Santa Carmen is such a hotbed of supernatural activity is similar to how the Mayor established Sunnydale. The issue keeps to familiar tropes but adds some twists. Where Buffy and Giles often dealt with a distant, unsupportive Watchers' Council, Anya's inability to adapt to the new regime's tech-heavy, hands-on approach causes similar tension. However, in another inversion, the slayer seems much more comfortable with the council than the watcher. Elsewhere, Buffy still struggles to accept her new role as a watcher rather than a slayer and seems determined to sabotage her relationship with Spike. Despite the wrinkles, it all rings a little too familiar to be genuinely exciting, and the busy artwork makes it hard to connect with the characters. However, it at least feels like a story built on firmer ground than some of the Buffy comics that preceded it. -- Jamie Lovett Rating: 3 out of 5 DARK SPACES: GOOD DEEDS #4 Dark Spaces: Good Deeds fully reveals what has been pretty plain from the start: European settlers didn't build St. Augustine on uninhabited land. They wiped out the indigenous population of Turtle Island and built the town atop their graves and the ruins of their community. It's a version of the old ""built on a native burial ground"" trope, but Good Deeds treats the idea with more respect, nuance, and detail than usually afforded by shlocky horror stories. The visual juxtaposition of the conquerors and their successors, the present-day Founders' Council, might be a little on the nose but is a worthwhile punctuation mark on generations of damage done. If the series could pick this or any of its various subplots and side mysteries to focus on, then it could move at a more captivating pace. As is, there's still too much going on for readers to keep up with, but as it approaches the end, it's easier to appreciate the tale in its fuller form. -- Jamie Lovett Rating: 3.5 out of 5 FIREFLY: THE FALL GUYS #1 Firefly: The Fall Guys brings the Serenity crew back to comics after some time away, and the approach leans into the Western aspects of the property after a long string of stories that upped the sci-fi elements. It's a newcomer-friendly issue as it goes out of its way to present a full crew roll call over multiple pages. While the sci-fi elements may be toned down, the story still operates on a larger-than-usual scale, involving a political assassination that could affect the whole galaxy. Still, there's something comforting about seeing the Serenity gang getting double-crossed and having their heist go sideways. The artwork is too flat and clean to convey the run-down quality of the Firefly universe, but otherwise, it's a solid enough start to the series. -- Jamie Lovett Rating: 3 out of 5 GODZILLA: HERE THERE BE DRAGONS #3 The third installment of Here There Be Dragons shifts the story's premise once again as the devastated Spanish armada from issue #1 is revealed to have a single survivor with an extensive backstory. That origin along with a global kaiju-conspiracy are both narrated with exceptional clarity by an imprisoned pirate with, supposedly, only the luck of a survivor. It's possible this figure will be revealed to possess his own secrets in time, but for now the expository captions he delivers seem too convenient by far. There's still plenty of fun to be had amidst the chaos on Monster Island and depictions of grand kaiju battles from the past. A spread featuring ancient civilizations from around the world confronting different monsters sets Here There Be Dragons as a gateway to a secret history of antiquity, but it would be much more intriguing if the series had a way to show readers this discovery instead of simply telling them about it. -- Chase Magnett Rating: 2.5 out of 5 HUNT FOR THE SKINWALKER #1 [READ THE FULL REVIEW HERE] Hunt for the Skinwalker doesn't deliver a perfect debut, but does it really have to? The good far outweighs the not-so-good in this first issue, and it's easy to see the potential of what the series might become in the months ahead. -- Charlie Ridgely Rating: 3.5 out of 5 KILL YOUR DARLINGS #1 Kill Your Darlings #1 is an absolute trip. What starts off as capturing the imagination of young child quickly devolves into something dark and ethereal, yet somehow familiar. Plenty of comics have dealt with trauma and how a child's imagination can carry them through the darkest chapters of their life, but the book takes things a step further by having the horrors carry over into our protagonist's world of imagination. The twist is jaw-dropping and gruesome, but never fails to be captivating. Consider this a must-read. -- Connor Casey Rating: 5 out of 5 MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE: FORGE OF DESTINY #1 This prequel series to Netflix's Masters of the Universe: Revelation is about what fans might expect, plenty of set-up and exposition that you may already know but which total newcomers might need. Even for those unfamiliar with MOTU though, this may become tedious. Writer Tim Seeley's work on the MOTU ""What If""-style series Masterverse was a little more interesting than what we get here. Artist Eddie Nunez does a good job of channeling the animation style of the series here however, with colors by Brad Simpson really popping in some instances. -- Spencer Perry Rating: 3 out of 5 prevnext
Other Publishers #2 ONCE UPON A TIME AT THE END OF THE WORLD #9 Once Upon a Time at the End of the World has always possessed a fable-like quality; it's in the title. Nearing the end of ""The Rise and Fall of Golgonooza,"" it becomes more evident as both Maceo and Mezzy pursue their goals and ignore every reason to consider an alternative. The issue functions better as a metaphor for a struggling relationship than the post-apocalyptic odyssey it presents. The mounting deaths possess plenty of creativity, especially one involving roses and thorns, and Leila Del Duca's visual metaphors for the distance and lack of connection between the pair work well on the page. Yet the plot itself is stretched so thin with issue #9 seeming only to repeat what was already known as events grow worse that it all becomes wearisome. That's made especially true when the final pages arrive and it's unclear exactly what readers should understand from a revelation that's likely pure hallucination. -- Chase Magnett Rating: 3 out of 5 PROJECT: CRYPTID #1 I was amazed to discover when I picked up Project: Cryptid #1 for this review that the likes of Grant Morrison, Paul Cornell, and Mark Russell were involved. Ultimately, the anthology series focusing on an electric death worms, yetis, and various other horrific creatures. The shining star of the issue is Cornell's bonkers story about ""Wormy And Me,"" and while Morrison's prose story is worth a read, the issue's story focusing on a Sasquatch feels like the weakest of the bunch by a fairly wide margin. The initial story feels something like a ""Tales From The Crypt"" segment but doesn't add in anything we haven't seen quite a bit before, with some questionable art as well. Ultimately, Project: Cryptid justifies a buy for only $3.99 but the flaws are a little tough to ignore. -- Evan Valentine Rating: 3 out of 5 PURR EVIL #2 Purr Evil #2 continues its wicked journey this week with a first date. As our protagonist finds themselves spending the day with a crush, things go awry fast when their feline demons make themselves known. Though filled with action, this fast-paced issue brings little to the table, so Purr Evil will need to toss a treat to readers soon to keep them sticking around. -- Megan Peters Rating: 2 out of 5 QUEST #2 While the artwork still lacks a certain energy, Quest takes a noticeable step forward with issue #2 The story clearly wants to take its time with its rescue mission, so outside of a new member joining the party and reaching a riverside town there isn't much in the way of plot progression. That time is instead used on world-building, making the journey feel massive and setting more realistic with accounts from common folk completely unrelated from all the royalty we spent time with last issue. -- Connor Casey Rating: 3 out of 5 THE SACRIFICERS #2 The Sacrificers #2 focuses its narrative on the world below, specifically the children led in chains toward some nebulous sacrifice. Those around Pigeon are given their own perspectives, ranging from Noom who sees this ritual as a life-giving celebration to a pair of human children who rely upon self-interest and violence to persist. It serves",,,,,,,,,,,,
as a tour of a land with varied inhabitants and cultures while simultaneously building a sense of intrigue about what exactly is to be sacrificed – a mystery only deepened in the issue's final pages. Throughout this journey Max Fiumara's work provides each new climate and civilization with its own personality. Noom's Orca-like people and their grand halls are instantly memorable, even when appearing in only a few pages, and the montage of difficult treks provides a sprawling sense of scope. Wherever The Sacrificers is building toward, its purposeful pacing and gorgeous realization promises readers this is a story worth their patience. -- Chase Magnett Rating: 4 out of 5 SHEENA: QUEEN OF THE JUNGLE – FATAL EXAMS #1 As someone who isn't as well versed in the world of Sheena, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect from Sheena: Queen of the Jungle – Fatal Exams. Luckily Fatal Exams' first issue had things covered, providing a quick but relatively thorough onboarding of the character and what immediately sets her apart, and the issue was quite the pleasant surprise. Writers Wes Clark Jr. and Steven E. De Souza showcase Sheena's charisma throughout the issue, which sets up some shockingly lethal fight sequences about midway through. It's a surprising but compelling contrast, especially when Sheena's animal allies get involved, and all credit goes to artist Ediano Silva and colorist Renato Spiller for bringing those sequences to life. Sheena's school life can bring the pace down a bit too much at times, but there's still fun moments in these sequences as well. Some moments don't quite land, like in one particular tear-filled panel later in the issue, and there are some clunky moments of dialogue or artwork that pop up randomly. That said, I greatly enjoyed Sheena: Queen of the Jungle – Fatal Exams #1," and I'm looking forward to seeing where this wild ride goes. -- Matthew Aguilar Rating: 3.5 out of 5 prevnext""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vY29taWNib29rLmNvbS9jb21pY3MvbmV3cy9uZXctY29taWMtcmV2aWV3cy1kYy1tYXJ2ZWwtaW1hZ2Utc2VwdGVtYmVyLTYtMjAyMy_SAVlodHRwczovL2NvbWljYm9vay5jb20vY29taWNzL2FtcC9uZXdzL25ldy1jb21pYy1yZXZpZXdzLWRjLW1hcnZlbC1pbWFnZS1zZXB0ZW1iZXItNi0yMDIzLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

However, before Jaime Reyes gets his big break, he must prove himself against the most worthy adversary of them all: a Toyota Tacoma.
Blue Beetle is set to test Jaime Reyes mentally, spiritually, and physically. In his quest to control the titular scarab and protect his family, Jaime must face off against some truly tough foes, including Carapax the Indestructible Man and Victoria Kord. However, the DC Universe’s toughest threat comes in the form of the 2024 Toyota Tacoma, a truck that can do everything the scarab can do, and then some. Check out the full comparison between the two below:
While the Blue Beetle has never met the Toyota Tacoma in the comics, it’s possible the truck serves as a reference to the villain Black Beetle who, much like the Toyota Tacoma, is just as strong and as fast as Jaime Reyes. The Toyota Tacoma could also be a reference to Chronos, a villain who can control time, much like the timeless nature of the 2024 Toyota Tacoma. It’s unclear what role the Toyota Tacoma will play in the film alongside Victoria Kord and Carapax the Indestructible Man, but it may be bigger than any fan may think.
Who is DC’s Blue Beetle?
Blue Beetle is one of DC’s lesser-known heroes, but he has a dedicated fanbase nonetheless. Created in 1939 by Charles Wojtkowski, Blue Beetle has gone through several iterations over the years. The Jaime Reyes version of the character was introduced during the events of 2006’s Infinite Crisis and quickly became a fan-favorite.
In the pages of DC Comics, Jaime Reyes is a teenager from El Paso, Texas. Jaime discovers a scarab beetle-shaped device that bonds with his body, giving him access to an advanced suit of armor and various powers. He becomes the latest in a long line of Blue Beetles and must learn to balance his newfound abilities with his everyday life.
Angel Manuel Soto is directing Blue Beetle from a screenplay by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer. The full cast of the movie also includes Bruna Marquezine, Belissa Escobedo, George Lopez, Adriana Barraza, Elpidia Carrillo, Damián Alcázar, Raoul Max Trujillo, Susan Sarandon and Harvey Guillén.

Director Angel Manuel Soto's modern live-action adaptation of “Blue Beetle” quickly became a fan-favorite after its August 18 release. The movie delivers messages of socioeconomic disparities and the power of identity. Fans ride a rollercoaster of emotions with Jaime and the Reyes family, ultimately falling in love with the movie and its protagonists. Soto’s “Blue Beetle” has the potential to create more than just a ripple in the entertainment industry.
“Elemental” - Peter Sohn; June 16, 2023
Pixar’s “Elemental” displays a masterfully animated story that leaves moviegoers thinking about the tearful reality of immigrant families. Although marketed as a romance between opposites, the heart of the project lies in the integration of Asian immigrant experiences into its overarching narrative.
“Yellowface” - R.F. Kuang; May 16, 2023
Although the topic of this satirical thriller is controversial, Kuang’s newest novel tackles racism in the publishing industry in a fast-paced and riveting narration of an irredeemable protagonist. As an outside look into the realities of being an author, the too-true commentary makes for a worthwhile read.

2023-09-06 00:21:36+00:00,Blue Beetle #1 Teases a Shocking DC Comics Death,The first issue of DC Comic's new Blue Beetle series ended with a seemingly shocking death that called back to another famous story.,"The final scene of DC‘s latest Blue Beetle series ends with an apparent gruesome death. What makes the scene all the more shocking is how it calls back to another infamous comic death.
The final scene of Blue Beetle #1 by Josh Trujillo, Adrián Gutiérrez, and Will Quintana introduces a mysterious new villain. Clad in red armor similar to that worn by Jaime Reyes, the villain attacks Ted Kord in his lab. The villain shrugs off the best Ted’s technology can throw at him. To add insult to injury, the villain calls Ted an imposter and “a fool playing with fire,” before crafting a sword and impaling him.
Ted Kord Has Died Before
While death in comics is hardly unusual, the circumstances of Ted Kord’s apparent death hold a particularly harsh resonance for Blue Beetle fans. In 2005, the death of Ted Kord at the hands of Maxwell Lord kicked off the Countdown to Infinite Crisis event. The story was poorly received for many reasons, but one of the chief reasons was how Blue Beetle was treated like a joke. The fact that all Ted Kord’s death accomplished was getting Batman to investigate a major conspiracy did not help matters.
While Ted Kord was shot in the head in Countdown, his apparent death in Blue Beetle #1 seems to reference the earlier story. Both stories feature prominent blood splatter and a silhouette that obscures the action. The same colors are also utilized, though the original featured Ted Kord as a black silhouette. The newer story utilizes red silhouettes.
Despite this, it remains to be seen if Ted Kord will truly die again. While it is not uncommon for a hero to die to inspire a younger hero, the Blue Beetle comics are committed to the student/mentor relationship between the two Blue Beetles. It seems unlikely that work will be undone purely for the sake of a shocking death.
Blue Beetle #1 is now available from DC Comics.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cGVyaGVyb2h5cGUuY29tL2NvbWljcy81NDYzNzQtYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtMS10ZWFzZXMtYS1zaG9ja2luZy1kYy1jb21pY3MtZGVhdGjSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5zdXBlcmhlcm9oeXBlLmNvbS9jb21pY3MvNTQ2Mzc0LWJsdWUtYmVldGxlLTEtdGVhc2VzLWEtc2hvY2tpbmctZGMtY29taWNzLWRlYXRoL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

2023-07-22 15:21:49-04:00,Josh Trujillo on ‘Blue Beetle: Graduation Day’ and his personal connection to Jaime Reyes,"Josh Trujillo talks about 'Blue Beetle,' writing superheroes, and more.","Jaime Reyes, aka Blue Beetle, is one of my favorite DC characters. So it wasn’t a surprise that one of the first-ever reviews I did for this site was the premiere issue of Blue Beetle: Graduation Day. Written by Josh Trujillo & illustrated by Adrian Gutierrez, the series more than lived up to its premise as it featured Jaime graduating from school while also struggling to figure out what to do with his life – on top of the return of the alien conquerors known as the Reach.
Typical teenage superhero problems. At the DC Booth this morning, I spoke with Trujillo about the inception of the book, as well as how he related to Jaime and the surprising DC character he’d love to write.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
AIPT: What drew you to Blue Beetle as a character?
Josh Trujillo: I was around Jaime’s age when the character debuted, and we both had a lot of similarities. We’re Mexican-American, we’re teenagers, our mothers worked in health care & we were both kind of curious kids about the DC Universe. So I’ve always been kind of drawn to him. And even his Blue Beetle series…the first one, it’s the first comic I ever had from like issue one to the last issue. So it was my entry point into like monthly DC comics, and I haven’t left since.
AIPT: The book comes in two editions – English and Spanish. Was that always part of your initial pitch?
JT: Yeah. You know that a big thing I wanted to do was to include some Spanish language dialogue in the English edition because it felt more authentic to Jaime’s life, Jaime’s story, and the environment he grew up in. DC didn’t bat an eye…they were like “That’s a great idea! Let’s publish an entire Spanish version as well!” I’m really excited to get this book into the hands of people who might not read a superhero comic.
This book introduces a lot of new characters; what’s the fun of introducing new characters to the vast tapestry of the DC Universe?
JT: It’s a big thrill honestly to get to create characters that other writers and artists might pick up later. It’s like, I just want to fill out Jaime’s cast with new characters, new villains, new allies, and just kind of make it feel a little fresh.
AIPT: What stuck out to me when I reviewed Blue Beetle: Graduation Day #1 was the conversation between Jaime and Superman about how Jaime is taking on too much. What’s it like writing a superhero who has to actively step back from superhero’ing?
JT: It’s a little tough, right? We want our heroes to succeed and be awesome all the time, but Jaime is at a kind of a crossroads in his life. And I thought Superman would be a great character to have that conversation with. They have a lot of similarities. Jaime is more of a Batman fan but doesn’t realize that he is Superman in a lot of ways. I just love seeing those characters bounce off of each other.
AIPT: Who other than Jaime is your favorite character to write?
JT: She isn’t in the book that much, but I love Jaime’s little sister Milagro. And beyond that, we introduce Ted Kord’s sister Victoria Kord. She’s new to the comics universe, she’s been a lot of fun to write. She’s got some schemes going on.
AIPT: Is there any other DC character other than Blue Beetle that you can see yourself writing?
JT: I say this a lot…his name is Bunker, he was a Teen Titan. Big fan of Bunker, and hopefully, I’ll get a chance to tackle him sooner rather than later.�
Blue Beetle: Graduation Day is available wherever comics are sold.

2023-08-04 13:30:00+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’ Director Teases Ted Kord & Dan Garrett’s Impact On Jaime’s Story,"Blue Beetle’s director Angel Manuel Soto teases the impact of previous Blue Beetles, along with the possibility of their return in the new DC Universe.","Blue Beetle is set to follow the story of Jaime Reyes learning to become a hero using the scarab Khaji Da. In a new interview, director Angel Manuel Soto teases the impact of previous Blue Beetles Ted Kord and Dan Garrett, along with the possibility of their return to the new DC Universe.
While Jaime Reyes may be the most well-known Blue Beetle, he’s far from the only one. Dan Garrett was the original Blue Beetle who wielded the scarab Khaji Da before passing it down to Ted Kord. While Ted couldn’t get the scarab to work, he was the hero to bring the mantle to the mainstream and eventually pass it down to Jaime. Angel Manuel Soto speaks on how this comic legacy is represented in the film, along with a potential future for the characters in the DC Universe:
“[Victoria Kord’s] relationship with Ted and the fact Ted has a daughter is very present in the movie,” Soto told Den of Geek. “A lot of Ted’s gadgets are also important to the film. So being able to keep the idea of Ted and Dan Garrett in the movie and how that came to be, does help Jaime understand what he’s going through. Some of the people around him are fans of Blue Beetle. It’s Jaime’s story, but the context still exists, and a lot of it was thought out and executed and done with the intention of bringing someone back in the future.”
While the obvious place for Ted Kord and Dan Garrett to appear would be a Blue Beetle sequel, Jaime Reyes isn’t the only hero they’re connected to. Ted Kord shares strong ties with the hero Booster Gold, who’s set to get his own series in the new DC Universe. It’s possible the hero shows up there, especially as the character’s time travel may allow for the hero to be resurrected. However, it’s likely only Angel Manuel Soto knows the true plans for the characters.

8/18/2023 13:07,We're about to find out if DC's Blue Beetle taking a grass-roots approach for promotion will make a difference at the box office,,"Dear Gossips,
Blue Beetle is the first major film of summer 2023 that didn’t have a press tour banked before the SAG-AFTRA strike kicked off on July 14 (this is implied Meg 2: The Trench shade and I won’t stand for it). Star Xolo Maridueña has been unable to promote the film, there was no appearance at Comic Con, no hype-machine world tour and red—blue?—carpet appearances.
So, how does a studio promote a film without stars or junkets or public appearances? Well, for one thing, you lean on the director, in this case Ángel Manuel Soto, who is notably not on strike and can appear at “fan screenings” around the country. In the case of The Haunted Mansion, which had its world premiere the day after the actors’ strike was called, director Justin Simien stepped out for his film, too (alongside producers, Disney employees, and influencers).
But Blue Beetle is taking a more grass-roots approach, tapping into community organizations to support the film (full review coming later), which stars the first live-action Latine superhero. And it’s working—a month ago, the film was tracking for a rather poor $20 million opening, but as the grass roots effort has taken hold, that figure has moved north to a less disappointing $30 million. (That’s still not great, but this is a film without a name star, and centered on a character unknown to general audiences. Plus, it’s DC and their track record is terrible lately.)
Key to raising awareness for the film, in lieu of more traditional media efforts, is an open letter to support Latine creatives signed by 27 Latine advocacy groups. There has also been support from Gold House, a non-profit supporting AAPI creatives. They’ve previously raised awareness for films like Crazy Rich Asians and Shang-Chi, but have been showing intersectional support for Blue Beetle online, re-posting social media hits for the film.
The fear for Blue Beetle is that if it doesn’t do well, its failure will be held against the Latine community and representation in film, in general, regardless of mitigating factors like the strike. It’s not an unfounded fear, despite continued statistical evidence that the Latine community, which makes up 19% of the US population, consistently over-indexes for films to the tune of 29% of movie tickets sold in 2020 (weird year for statistics, but okay). Like any underserved community, when they are represented on screen, they show up. Whether or not that will make a big enough difference for Blue Beetle, we’re about to find out.

,"Red, White and Royal Blue Movie Review: A royal romance that is brought down by the predictability",,"When British Prince Henry (Nicholas Galitzine) and the US President's (Uma Thurman) son Alexander (Taylor Zakhar Perez) first meet in Red, White and Royal Blue (RWRB), they describe each other as the world’s most “irritating” and “rudest”, respectively. Twenty minutes into the two-hour film, the hateful duo get attracted to each other. The film, based on Casey McQuiston’s eponymous novel, is rather interesting up until here. It doesn’t become particularly bad either, but a sense of predictability washes over the proceedings, causing this saccharine romance to stop well short of becoming a great queer love story.
Director: Matthew Lopez
Cast: Taylor Zakha Perez, Nicholas Galitzine, Uma Thurman, Sarah Shahi, Rachel Hilson
Streaming on: Amazon Prime Video
Although RWRB is very much about Henry and Alex falling in love with each other, the backdrop of re-election in America and the customs of the British throne are part of the film as well. While Alex wants to cause positive change in the world, Henry’s aim is to run away from the Royal burden (like most princes in history, it seems.) The ideas are regal and lofty, but they just don't surprise you enough.
I did enjoy some little touches. For one, Uma Thurman’s Ellen Claremont is a utopian woman POTUS. While Alex is more physically imposing than Henry, it is the former who is more sentimental among the two. It is a nice touch to see Henry being forced to boldly face his familial evils. Extra brownie points to the makers for creating such subversions that are catching up with the times and nudging the spectrum of representation.
I also enjoyed the witty banter between the couple during the initial stages of their relationship. All of this ensures that their relationship transitions neatly, even if quickly, from bodily attraction into an emotional bond. The aristocracy-related conflict doesn't exactly add too much to this film—and if we are rooting for these two to get together, it’s on account of the dialogues and their differing lives and accents.
The film ultimately suffers on account of conventional tropes. Be it the dramatic walkaways or the ‘face your fear to get your love back’ idea, it’s what you expect to see in this genre. However, the unique setting and a rather far-fetched premise do their bit to ensure there’s enough novelty to keep things afloat. If the success of romance often depends on a leap of faith, this film too expects such a leap from us to truly enjoy it.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaW5lbWFleHByZXNzLmNvbS9lbmdsaXNoL3Jldmlldy8yMDIzL2F1Zy8yMS9yZWQtd2hpdGUtYW5kLXJveWFsLWJsdWUtbW92aWUtcmV2aWV3LWEtcm95YWwtcm9tYW5jZS10aGF0LWlzLWJyb3VnaHQtZG93bi1ieS10aGUtcHJlZGljdGFiaWxpdHktNDY4MDQuaHRtbNIBoQFodHRwczovL20uY2luZW1hZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vZW5nbGlzaC9yZXZpZXcvMjAyMy9hdWcvMjEvcmVkLXdoaXRlLWFuZC1yb3lhbC1ibHVlLW1vdmllLXJldmlldy1hLXJveWFsLXJvbWFuY2UtdGhhdC1pcy1icm91Z2h0LWRvd24tYnktdGhlLXByZWRpY3RhYmlsaXR5LTQ2ODA0LmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

'It’s been one of my big dreams to be a canon part of a superhero world,' says Inka

MANILA, Philippines – Content creator Inka Magnaye has been tapped as a voice talent for the upcoming superhero movie Blue Beetle for its Philippine release.

Warner Bros. Philippines announced in a press release on Wednesday, August 2, that Magnaye will be voicing the scarab Khaji-da, which is described as an “ancient relic.”

In the trailer, the scarab is a beetle-like artifact that latches onto protagonist Jaime Reyes (portrayed by Xolo Maridueña) and guides him in discovering and controlling his powers as Blue Beetle.

Singer-actress Becky G voices the scarab in the film’s original version.

Blue Beetle follows recent college graduate Jaime, who gets chosen by the ancient relic scarab to be its symbiotic host. As a result, he is granted armor with unpredictable capabilities and becomes the superhero Blue Beetle.

Magnaye also took to social media to share her excitement and happiness over the news.

“I’m in a DC movie,” she wrote, alongside behind-the-scenes photos of her recording.

She continued, “It’s been one of my big dreams to be a canon part of a superhero world.”

Magnaye shared that she was “wildly honored” to have gotten the opportunity and teased that some of her lines were also in Filipino.

Magnaye is known for being an events host and voice talent for different brands, including Philippine Airlines, Smart, and Nissin, among others. She also has a podcast called Sleeping Pill with Inka.

According to the press release, she is the first Philippine-based Filipino talent to do voice-over work in a DC film.

‘Blue Beetle’ Actor Raoul Max Trujillo Says It “Is Pretty Exciting” That Susan Sarandon Is “Only ‘White Person’ In The Film,” Accuses United States Of Exploiting Puerto Rico

Raoul Max Trujillo as Conrad Carapax in Blue Beetle (2023), DC Studios

Blue Beetle actor Raoul Max Trujillo, who plays Conrad Carapax in the movie, recently detailed how exciting it is for the film to only have one white person in the movie.

Raoul Max Trujillo, who previously starred in Apocalypto back in 2006, spoke about the movie with Heroic Hollywood where he informed the outlet, “Being part of a project where the focus is on a culture that’s outside of the Hollywood Anglo-Saxon culture that we’ve seen our whole lives in everything… it’s just so touching and warming.”

He added, “You see a whole level that, had it been just sort of a regular American family, it wouldn’t have had the heart that it had. So I think that’s what made me super excited about being a part of this film.”

The actor then shared, “Susan Sarandon’s character, Victoria Kord, is the only ‘white person’ in the film. The rest of the characters are all brown people. And that is pretty exciting, and I think it’s pretty brave of Warner Bros. to have supported the project and Angel’s dream to tell this particular story.”

“As a DC movie, this has darkness in it, but it’s also got this incredible heart and it’s incredible light,” Trujillo relayed.

Trujillo also praised the film’s portrayal of Kord’s character andher “ravishing of indigenous people.”

He said, “When I saw the movie, there were a lot of teary eyes in that audience. They were moved. There are some images that will make you go ‘Holy f–k, that s–t’s real.’ In relation to the military-industrial complex, and the sort of ravishing of indigenous people. There are some brilliant references that Angel has thrown in there, and you just there’s no way you can miss them. They have to do with the times that they’re living in in America.”

RELATED: ‘Blue Beetle’ Actress Susan Sarandon Reveals Her Character Is The “White Military Industrial Complex” Bad Guy

Sarandon previously described her character as the white military industrial complex in an interview with Jimmy Fallon.

She said, “What’s fabulous about [Blue Beetle] is it’s the first Latinx hero that has his own movie. Even better all of the Mexican — because his family is Mexican and all the actors were Mexican and it’s in Spanish so it’s subtitled.”

“I’m, of course, the bad guy. I’m the white military industrial complex. So I had a fabulous time because there’s nothing better than being bad,” she added.

Later in the interview, Trujillo accused the United States of exploiting Puerto Rico, while discussing filming on the island, “First of all, Puerto Rico, being the place that it is with such a rich history of slavery, colonization, and exploitation to this day by the United States — that sort of vibe is felt underneath, you feel a sort of revolutionary vibe in these people.”

“So to shoot this film there, which has a lot of those elements, you’re surrounded by it. And it’s real. It’s not make-believe. It’s not pretend. Some of the locations, especially the old fort, are 500 years old. The blood spilled there, and the tortures that must have happened there — that s– is real. I’m Native. Shooting it in that specific location, with that vibration of persecuted people and murder and genocide and all of that… it comes through,” he said.

RELATED: ‘Blue Beetle’ Director Deletes Tweet Wishing Assassination On President Donald Trump, Claims Puerto Rico Is A “Slave Colony”

Trujillo is not alone in this view. The film’s director Angel Manuel Soto also shared to Twitter that he believes Puerto Rico is a slave colony.

He wrote, “Puerto Rico is a slave colony of the USA. Your passport was impossed on us, so there is nowhere else to after your country s***s on my land and blame us for the stink.”

The actor concluded the interview stating, “I just hope that everyone walks away realizing that we’re not bastardizing an idea or a character or anything else. We’re just evolving it further. Hopefully, they can walk away with a really deep, powerful message with this film.”

“I don’t think it knocks you over the head with a hammer. I think it’s subtle, nuanced. There’s definitely a message to be seen and heard here and I hope fans can walk around and just realize that this isn’t just another superhero movie that is fluff. It’s not,” he continued.

“With the small experience I have with comic books and heroes from DC, Marvel, or whatever else, it’s like, there are usually messages for us to take away, with the whole ‘good vs evil’ archetypes and all that. I just hope people can walk away from this and just see the deeper meaning and message with this film and keep supporting it,” Trujillo finished.

RELATED: Report: ‘Blue Beetle’ To Feature Illegal Immigration Allegory

As for what the messaging the film contains, Soto confirmed it featured an illegal immigration allegory to MovieMaker. The outlet explained the allegory, “Before the movie begins, the family has immigrated to America from Mexico, but [Jamie Reyes’ father] Alberto doesn’t have documentation, so he’s under the constant threat of deportation.”

They go on to note, “Though the film doesn’t depict an ICE raid, it does include a scene that echoes one. Kord Industries invades the family’s home in a scene that can play as just another dramatic moment in a superhero movie – or be taken as symbolic of events that tear apart real families.”

Soto confirmed this description telling them, “There is a history that exists before an ICE raid. A history that includes traveling miles, and danger, working hard, becoming a family, creating memories, and thinking that everything is going to be okay.”

“But all of a sudden, everything that you have fought for, everything that you have worked for, everything that you have built, is now burning. I needed the depiction to be triggering, because it’s the experience of many,” he added.

RELATED: ‘Blue Beetle’ Director Confirms Film Includes Themes Of Displacement, Colonialism, And Gentrification

In an interview with Collider, Soto further detailed the film features themes of displacement, colonialism, and gentrification.

He said, “For example, in my case, from Puerto Rico, displacement, colonialism, gentrification. Those are things that are real threats. Home insecurity, not putting food on the table, proper healthcare. All those things that are villains, but at the same time what are all those things that are are heroic things like community, like standing up against a tyrant, or standing up against the things that weaken us, but doing it through the power of family and community.”

“So being able to hone in to those experiences that I know firsthand, that the writer also knows firsthand because Gareth [Dunnet-Alcocer] is from Queretaro, Mexico. We were able to find where our different journeys intersect in a similarity of experiences that not only affect our individual countries, but also affects countries in Latin American and abroad,” Soto concluded.

2023-09-01 15:01:00+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’ Concept Art Reveals Early Concepts For OMAC & Carapax Fight,"New concept art for Blue Beetle shows off early concepts for the OMAC, the scarab armor, and the Conrad Carapax fight in the film’s second act.","Blue Beetle has quickly earned the status of a fan-favorite film to come out of DC Studios. New concept art for the film has been released showcasing early designs for Jaime Reyes’ Scarab armor, the OMAC device worn by Conrad Carapax, and an alternate fight scene during the second act.

Blue Beetle is a film where fans can feel the love across every inch of the project. Everything from Jaime Reyes’ suit to the framing of fight scenes was carefully crafted by the cast and crew. However, new concept art shows that fans were close to getting a very different-looking movie from DC Studios. Even the Scarab itself, which one would assume would be nailed down fairly early, went through a number of different iterations as seen below:

That set of concept art also includes a new look at the fight scene between Jaime Reyes and Conrad Carapax at the start of the film’s second act. However, it seems as though the fight was meant to take place in a much more industrial construction site rather than across from the Kord Industries building like in the film. Other concepts for the fight seem to include a junkyard and a bridge leading to Palmera City, as seen below:

Jaime Reyes wasn’t the only one rocking a new suit in the original concept art. Conrad Carapax’s OMAC armor went through a number of variations, including one that mirrored the Blue Beetle Scarab. While the design the film ended up with was certainly a treat, the concept art is certainly a sight to behold:

While Blue Beetle was far from a perfect movie, it certainly showed the potential of DC Studios projects when artists are allowed to bring their vision to fruition. It’s unlikely we’ll be seeing more of Conrad Carapax or the OMAC system in the future to see these alternate designs come to life, so it’s certainly a fun look behind the curtain to see what could have been.

Who is DC’s Blue Beetle?

Blue Beetle is one of DC’s lesser-known heroes, but he has a dedicated fanbase nonetheless. Created in 1939 by Charles Wojtkowski, Blue Beetle has gone through several iterations over the years. The Jaime Reyes version of the character was introduced during the events of 2006’s Infinite Crisis and quickly became a fan-favorite.

In the pages of DC Comics, Jaime Reyes is a teenager from El Paso, Texas. Jaime discovers a scarab beetle-shaped device that bonds with his body, giving him access to an advanced suit of armor and various powers. He becomes the latest in a long line of Blue Beetles and must learn to balance his newfound abilities with his everyday life.

The full cast of Blue Beetle also includes Bruna Marquezine, Belissa Escobedo, George Lopez, Adriana Barraza, Elpidia Carrillo, Damián Alcázar, Raoul Trujillo, Susan Sarandon and Harvey Guillén.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vaGVyb2ljaG9sbHl3b29kLmNvbS9ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1jb25jZXB0LWFydC1yZXZlYWxzLWVhcmx5LWNvbmNlcHRzLWZvci1vbWFjLWNhcmFwYXgtZmlnaHQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,Susan Sarandon says on ex Chris Sarandon's podcast that her mom told her they 'can't get married',"Susan Sarandon told her ex Chris Sarandon about her mother's 'last minute' disapproval of their plans to wed in 1967 during a recent stop on his podcast 'Cooking by Heart,'","Susan Sarandon is humorously lifting the veil on her wedding to ex-husband Chris Sarandon.

During a recent stop on Chris' podcast Cooking by Heart, the exes reminisced about everything from tuna casseroles, to weird cats, to their own wedding in 1967 — including Susan's mother's ""last minute"" disapproval.

Susan Sarandon and Chris Sarandon. youtube

Susan, who was 20 at the time of their marriage, told the audience what happened when she told her parents of her and Chris' intention to marry. ""What happened was, we said, 'Look, I wanna move out, and we're gonna live together.' And you definitely couldn't do that unless you were married at that time, back in the Middle Ages at a Catholic college.""

She clarified that up until then, her parents ""loved Chris,"" but ""suddenly something happened between my parents."" According to Susan, her mother being pregnant at the time caused some strife between her mother and father. ""I think she was embarrassed,"" Susan explained. ""She was 44. She didn't say that, she just said, 'No, now you can't get married.'""

Susan recalled asking her mother if it was all right as long as the wedding was ""a little, tiny thing"" but her response was, ""'No, if I say you can't get married, you can't get married.'""

According to the Blue Beetle star, though, her father disagreed with her mother's reaction, which caused a rift with the couple. In the end, both parents attended the wedding, but Susan said her mother ""was in a black raincoat, sitting at the back of the church for like 10 minutes.""

""And none of my siblings could come except my brother that was right under me, who insisted upon coming,"" she added. ""And luckily he hooked up with one of the bridesmaids, so it was a very successful trip.""

This all seemed like news to her former groom, who said with a laugh, ""That's the first I've heard of that one.""

Elsewhere in the podcast, the two discussed chaos at meals with younger siblings, their early cooking disasters, their attempt at being vegetarians, and more.

Birth/Rebirth

Credit: Shudder

Frankenstein meets body horror meets pregnancy in this bone-chilling directorial feature debut from Laura Moss . Birth/Rebirth is a psychological horror film that follows two medical practitioners, Celie (Judy Reyes) and Rose ( Marin Ireland ), who find themselves bound together under the utmost terrifying circumstances . It turns out, Rose has been working on an experiment that can bring the deceased back to life. But things get twisted when she uses her knowledge on Celie's young daughter, Lila (A.J. Lister) after she abruptly passes away. As Celie finds her daughter reborn, she realizes there's a horrifying task that needs to be completed in order to keep her alive.

What we thought : ""Birth/Rebirth will grab you by the guts with its mercilessly scary opening sequence. It's not just that Laura Moss's directorial feature debut delves into a terrifying Frankenstein-inspired tale. It's not just that her Sundance stunner boasts body horror with a matter-of-factness that is starkly unnerving. It's how the opening deftly illustrates an all-too-common fear that has arisen in this age of an overturned Roe v. Wade ."" — Kristy Puchko, Film Editor

Blue Beetle

Credit: Warner Bros.

While the DC Extended Universe is polarizing , there's one thing a lot of people can agree on — Blue Beetle is a hit. Based on the DC comics character, Blue Beetle follows Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña), a young Mexican American who stumbles upon an ancient scarab relic that can turn him into an ass-kicking superhero . The relic is made up of alien biotechnology that chooses a symbiotic host to unleash its full powers. When it chooses Jaime , he finds himself bestowed with an airtight exoskeleton armor that can do just about anything, including turning a random twenty-something into the fully-fledged superhero he was always meant to be.

What we thought : ""Blue Beetle is a breath of fresh air in a stagnant superhero landscape of gray cities, cheap fan service, and drudgery masquerading as depth…It's superhero entertainment without a chip on its shoulder, and it's about time."" — K.P.

Bones and All

Based on Camille DeAngelis' novel of the same name , Luca Guadagnino's Bones and All delves into a fervent love story loaded with romance, angst, and above all else, cannibalism. Helmed by Timothée Chalamet and Taylor Russell, Bones and All is a literal slice-of-life that follows two young cannibals, Maren (Russell) and Lee ( Chalamet ), as they flee together on a road trip across the U.S. and fall in love. While the flesh-eating tangent of it all might seem off-putting (and it is), Bones and All finds its true triumph in its poignant allegory and a dizzying ending that'll rest on your heart long after the credits finish rolling.

What we thought : ""In the end, Bones and All is as radiantly romantic as it is unapologetically horrific. In this, it's not just a gem of queer horror but one of the best films of 2022."" — K.P.

How to watch: Bones and All is now available to stream on demand .

Elemental

Ember (voiced by Leah Lewis) meet Wade, Wade (voiced by Mamoudou Athie) meet Ember. Pixar's latest flick isn't an epic about toys with feelings , an adventure across the oceans, or about a family of superheroes, instead, it's a rom-com. In Elemental , fire, water, earth, and air all live together as residents in Element City. While long-standing prejudices exist across each of the elements, a strange twist of fate happens when two polar opposite elements find themselves falling in love . What happens when fire and water clash together? You get the feet-kicking, heart-fluttering ship that is Ember and Wade.

What we thought : ""Lewis and Athie bring Ember and Wade's initially clashing personalities to life with striking vocal chemistry, to the point that I was basically kicking my feet and giggling during their every scene together."" — Belen Edwards, Entertainment Reporter

Landscape with Invisible Hand

According to Landscape with Invisible Hand, when the aliens invade Earth , we can expect them to really be into TikTok live streams . Based on M.T. Anderson's novel of the same name , Landscape with Invisible Hand is set in a near-future where an alien species called the Vuvv have occupied Earth and have severely limited humanity's career prospects and livelihood. But when two teenagers, Adam (Asante Blackk) and Chloe (Kylie Rogers), start falling in love, they realize that the Vuvv are kind of obsessed with reality TV and are willing to pay an absurd amount of money to watch the two livestream their relationship. What do Chloe and Adam do? Well, they secure that coin and livestream everything, even going so far as to feign their relationship — after they've broken up — to keep the Vuvv happy. Whatever will happen next?

What we thought : ""Landscape With Invisible Hand paints a coming-of-age story that is uniquely entrancing and thrillingly unpredictable."" — K.P.

No Hard Feelings

Jennifer Lawrence is here to save the raunchy comedy from extinction. In No Hard Feelings , Lawrence plays Maddie, a thirty-something Uber driver who's trying to save her family home and is desperate for some serious cash ASAP. So when she finds a job listing on Craigslist from two parents looking for someone to date their 19-year-old son, Percy (Andrew Barth Feldman), she willingly accepts. What ensues is a series of hilarious hijinks, elevated by Lawrence and Feldman's killer comedic chemistry, and a watch so hilarious you won't even feel the time running.

What we thought : ""This summer comedy is an old-school raunch-fest with plenty of laughs that, nevertheless, might've made its way to the party one round of Beer Pong too late. Mid-budget star-centric comedies like this have now become a rarity on the big screen, and this one, sweet and totally agreeable as it is, probably isn't revolutionary enough to alter that downward trajectory."" — Jason Adams, Freelance Contributor

Strays

You might not have asked for an R-rated version of Beverly Hills Chihuahua , but alas, it's here. Helmed by a star-studded cast including Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Isla Fisher, Josh Gad, Sofia Vergara, and Dennis Quaid, Strays follows an abandoned puppy who meets other lost doggos and is determined to get revenge on his former owner…by biting off his penis. Will our flimsy crew of foul-mouthed, four-legged friends see the task through? I really hope so.

What we thought: ""Beyond the broad demographic of adults, it's difficult to know the intended audience of Josh Greenbaum's Strays, a noxious narrative pushing the boundaries of low taste and garbage humor."" — Robert Daniels, Freelance Contributor",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV3LXN0cmVhbWluZy1yZWxlYXNlcy10aGlzLXdlZWstYXVndXN0LTE4LTIwMjPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-18 08:44:00-04:00,Movie reviews: 'Strays' is a deeply silly movie that fully embraces its extreme side,"This week, pop culture critic Richard Crouse reviews new movies: 'Strays,' 'Blue Beetle,' 'The Monkey King' and 'Back on the Strip.'","STRAYS: 3 ½ STARS

If you have seen the trailer for “Strays,” a new comedy starring a pack of very cute dogs and the voices of Will Ferrell and Jamie Foxx, you know what you are in for.

If you haven’t seen the trailer, think of it as an animal road trip movie like “The Incredible Journey” minus the family-friendly bits. Or maybe as a riff on “The Adventures of Milo and Otis” with raunchy dialogue that would make Snoop Dogg blush.

Ferrell is trusting Border Terrier Reggie. He lives with Doug (Will Forte), a cruel owner who only puts up with the dog because his girlfriend adopted him from a local general store. The goodhearted Reggie calls Doug, “the best owner in the world,” despite the fact that their game of fetch involves stranding Reggie far away from home to see if he can find his way back.

When the girlfriend leaves, Doug wants Reggie gone. He leaves the gullible dog to fend for himself on the street three hours away from home, alone and unloved. But Reggie doesn’t understand that he’s being abandoned. He thinks they’re playing another long-distance game of fetch, and is determined to return to Doug and win the game.

Trouble is, he’s hopelessly lost. Dog-gone it.

On his journey Reggie meets Bug, a street-wise Boston Terrier, who runs with a pack of stray dogs that includes an Australian Shepherd named Maggie (Isla Fisher), and a therapy Great Dane named Hunter (Randall Park). Bug doesn’t trust humans. He was abandoned, and believes humans harvest dog poop to make chocolate.

Reggie’s new friends convince him that Doug has abandoned him. “Take it from me, kid,” Bug says, “he left your ass.” In disbelief, Reggie mumbles, “That would mean Doug doesn’t love me.”

His world turned upside down, Reggie vows to get revenge on his former owner.

“You’re a stray,” Bug says. “You can do whatever you want.”

I think it is a safe bet to crown “Strays” the most adorable, yet rudest movie of the year. Reggie and his pals are a cute canine quartet but the film’s “beyond the chain” jokes and situations, mostly involving poop, vomit and doggie sex, are anything but sweet. It is a raunchy coming-of-age story as Reggie learns from his new friends that everyone has worth. It’s a great message, laced with laughs, for those with a high tolerance for poop-and-scoop humor.

As Reggie, Ferrell revisits the naiveté of the “Elf” era. The unsophisticated Border Terrier is a wide-eyed innocent, unaware of the ways of the world. He sees the good in everyone, including his hateful owner Doug. He’s a lovable waif, so the movie’s revenge fantasy angle plays well, but the real appeal here is his open-hearted way of viewing the world.

Ferrell is ably supported by Reggie’s new friends. Fisher and Park, are a flirty and often filthy duo, but it is Foxx’s finely tuned comic delivery that brings the funny. Add to that a truly strange cameo from Dennis Quaid and a ton of shock value, and you have a doggie style movie like no other.

“Strays” is not “Marley and Me.” It’s a deeply silly movie that fully embraces its extreme side. There is something inherently funny about watching these adorable dogs saying terrible things and while the humor may not be family friendly, the message that we should be nice to animals or they may do terrible things to us, is a good one.

BLUE BEETLE: 3 STARS

It seems to be an unwritten rule that the best superheroes are birthed from troubled family backstories. Bruce Wayne witnessed the brutal killing of his parents, Spider-Man was orphaned at an early age and Superman was exiled from his home planet of Krypton and never met his parents. The big screen adaptation of “Blue Beetle,” a DC superhero movie now playing in theatres, breaks with tradition.

“My family? That’s what makes me strong,” says Jaime Reyes a.k.a. Blue Beetle.

When we first meet Reyes, played by “Cobra Kai” star Xolo Maridueña, he is an ambitious recent college grad on the hunt for a job. Back home in Palmera City his family is in financial trouble and Jaime wants to help out.

His job search puts him in contact with a sentient ancient alien relic known as the Scarab, which kind of looks like a fancy broach my mother may have worn in 1978. The powerful, parasitical piece of biotechnology chooses Jaime as its symbiotic host, transforming the young man into the superhero Blue Beetle. Grafted together, Jaime and the Scarab now possess a glowing armor-clad blue suit and powerhouse abilities like flying through space, the manifestation of weapons and more.

“The universe has sent you a gift,” says Uncle Rudy Reyes (George Lopez), “and you have to figure out what to do with it. Maybe this time we get our own superhero.”

Trouble is, Jaime doesn’t want to be a superhero, despite being chosen by the Scarab. “How do we get it to un-choose me?” he asks.

Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon), the super villainous CEO of Kord Industries, understands the power of the Scarab and Jaime’s Blue Beetle, and knows how to take control of it.

“Target the [Reyes] family!” she says.

“Blue Beetle” makes history as the first Latino DC superhero to lead a film, but the freshness that comes along with that is overwhelmed by the usual superhero dross. The emphasis on family gives the movie a nice vibe that sets it apart from other DC movies, but the strength Jaime garners from his family and culture does not strengthen the plot as a whole. It still a superhero origin story. That means it comes weighted down with details, exposition and the usual getting to know you, getting to know all about you, tropes.

It does attempt to go deep with subplots about marginalization, resistance and even a little body horror woven into the story, but again, those elements are overshadowed by the accompanying bombast.

Maridueña cuts a swathe through the CGI noise and fight scenes with considerable charm and kind of an “aw-shucks” sensibility that grounds his high-flying character. As the comic relief, Lopez gets a few laughs and Sarandon is deliciously amoral as the billionaire villain, but this is Maridueña’s show.

Culturally “Blue Beetle” breaks ground in its depiction of Latino culture but as a superhero movie, it is the same old.

THE MONKEY KING: 3 STARS

A fable that pits ego against ambition, acceptance against insecurity, “The Monkey King” is a new animated Netflix film starring the voices of comedian Jimmy O. Yang and Bowen Yang.

Based on a Chinese novel published in the 16th century during the Ming Dynasty attributed to Wu Cheng'en, the film centers around The Monkey King (Jimmy O. Yang), a rebellious monkey born from a magical rock. Filled with an exaggerated sense of self-worth, his ego has alienated him from friends and family.

“An old geezer once told me, ‘You don’t belong here,’” he says. “And he was right. I belong with the Immortal ones. I’ll become legendary and then they’ll have to accept me.”

Trouble is, to get the attention of the Immortals, led by the Jade Emperor (Hoon Lee), he’ll have to defeat at least 100 demons.

“One hundred demons,” he says, “coming up!”

Despite being told by his elder (James Sie) to, “know your place, young one,” the braggadocious warrior sets off with a rallying call of “Anyone need a hero?”

On his journey to find immortality he looks to the duplicitous Dragon King (Bowen Yang) for help, does battle with Red Girl (Sophie Wu), gets his mighty fighting stick and meets his trusty (but underappreciated) sidekick Lin (Jolie Hoang-Rappaport).

“Whatever the Monkey King does,” he says, “I do big!”

“The Monkey King” is a big action-adventure, one that moves at the speed of light, filled with wild battle scenes and slapstick humour. But at its heart, it is the story of a search for family, approval and a sense of belonging. The titular character is driven to fighting demons—literal and personal—as a way to assuage his feelings of seclusion from his peers who wouldn’t accept him for who he is. It provides the film’s emotional core, even if the movie’s unrelentingly frenetic pace threatens to overwhelm the message. A film that is all peaks and very few valleys, needs a moment or two of introspection. A few more heartfelt scenes between the Monkey King and Lin could have slowed the action, but upped the emotional impact.

The story feels episodic and, despite featuring characters that have endured since the Ming Dynasty, a tad generic in its animated form. Director Anthony Stacchi pumps it up with vibrant animation and production design that mixes familiar CGI art with flavorings of traditional Chinese brushwork, a couple fun Broadway style musical numbers and a collection of voice actors that bring the characters to life, but it reverberates with echoes of similar movies like “Emperor's New Groove.”

“The Monkey King” has laughs and gags, mostly for young viewers, and diverting well-choreographed martial arts scenes, but offers very little new stuff in its retelling of an old tale.

BACK ON THE STRIP: 2 ½ STARS

The humour in “Back on the Strip,” a new comedy starring Wesley Snipes, Faizon Love and J.B. Smoove as Las Vegas male strippers who return to the stage after a long hiatus, is about as subtle as the title’s insinuation is hard to understand.

Which is to say, not at all.

In this “Full Monty” riff, Tiffany Haddish plays Verna, free-spirited mother to Merlin (Spencer Moore II), a wannabe magician whose life is turned upside down when his high school crush Robin (Raigan Harris) announces she is engaged to “the Michael Jordan of comedy,” on-line prankster Blaze (Ryan Alexander Holmes).

Brokenhearted, he heads to Las Vegas looking to land a gig as a magician. At an impromptu magic gig at a strip club instead of pulling a rabbit out of a hat, by accident, Merlin pulls, well, something else out of his pants. The revealing moment catches the eye of Luther a.k.a. ""Mr. Big"" (Snipes), the former leader of a famous Black male stripper crew called The Chocolate Chips, just as he’s thinking of putting the old band back together.

Desperate for a gig, Merlin reluctantly joins the dance crew, keeping it a secret from Verna and Robin, who, despite being engaged, is still in contact.

“Now with a man with something big in front of him,” says Luther as he intros Merlin. “I’m not talking about that. I’m talking about his future… Mr. Black Magic.”

Merlin’s life becomes complicated when Blaze decides to publicly embarrass Merlin and keep Robin all to himself. Will Merlin finally learn how to do things his way? Will he go big or will he go home?

“Back on the Strip” is not a subtle movie. From Haddish’s raunchy narration to the predictable plot points, it’s clear writer-director Chris Spence (and co-writer is Eric Daniel) aren’t looking to reinvent the raunchy comedy wheel. It’s a mix of sweet and sour, romance for the heart and the raunchy stuff—it’s like Spencer consulted the Double Entendre Dictionary when writing Haddish’s dialogue—for the other extremities. The only really surprising thing about the movie is how far the script pushes the innuendo.

The willing cast go along for the ride with considerable collective charm. Smoove is a standout, bringing some much-needed unpredictability to every scene he is in.

Unfortunately, the emotional scenes between Merlin and Robin, meant to be heartwarming, are rendered tedious by the predictability of the script. We know what’s going to happen in this movie long before any of it actually happens and we don’t need Haddish’s expository, non-stop narration to let us know what’s going on.

Simply put, “Back on the Strip” does not have any of Mike’s magic.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jdHZuZXdzLmNhL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbW92aWUtcmV2aWV3cy1zdHJheXMtaXMtYS1kZWVwbHktc2lsbHktbW92aWUtdGhhdC1mdWxseS1lbWJyYWNlcy1pdHMtZXh0cmVtZS1zaWRlLTEuNjUyNDE2MtIBS2h0dHBzOi8vYmV0YS5jdHZuZXdzLmNhL25hdGlvbmFsL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjAyMy84LzE4LzFfNjUyNDE2Mi5hbXAuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The 50 best superhero movies ever, ranked (from 'Blue Beetle' to 'Superman')","The new DC superhero movie ""Blue Beetle"" has us thinking: Which is the best of all? So we're ranking the top 50, from ""The Avengers"" to ""Superman.""","Who needs a crown and scepter when you've got capes, cowls and the occasional magic hammer?

For most of this century – and a couple pockets of the past one – Hollywood has been ruled by the kings and queens of superhero movies. From the sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe where Captain America and Spider-Man hang out to the world of Superman, Batman and the rest of the DC contingent, guys and gals with cool powers and righteous attitudes – as well as their resident villains – have won over movie fans' hearts and minds. They've also made made ridiculous amounts of money: Of the 10 highest-grossing films worldwide, four feature beloved comic-book heroes (""Avengers: Endgame,"" ""Spider-Man: No Way Home,"" ""The Avengers"" and ""Avengers: Infinity War"").

And with the MCU trucking along with movies scheduled until 2026 and DC plotting a reset, they're probably not going anywhere anytime soon. With ""Blue Beetle"" the latest to arrive in theaters – featuring the first Latino superhero in DC movie history – we're ranking the 50 best superhero movies of all time.

50. 'Chronicle' (2012)

While director Josh Trank's ""Fantastic Four"" was a fiasco, this standout coming-of-age/found-footage thriller delved into why teenagers with superpowers is realistically not a great idea, with Michael B. Jordan, Dane DeHaan and Alex Russell as the immature youngsters given the gifts of gods and not treating them with care.

49. 'The Last Dragon' (1985)

A kitschy '80s cult kung-fu movie with ninjas, martial artists who glow and DeBarge on the soundtrack is going to make the list, period. Taimak stars as the Bruce Lee fan who rescues a New York VJ (Vanity), takes on a bad dude named Sho'Nuff (Julius Carry), plus can dance and karate kick to the rhythm of the night.

48. 'Blue Beetle' (2023)

Karate kid Xolo Maridueña kicks fools in the face regularly on Netflix's ""Cobra Kai,"" and his star heads to the next phase of the stratosphere as Jaime Reyes, a recent college grad (Gotham Law, baby!) who gets taken over by an alien scarab, gains superpowers but more importantly takes on baddies with his loving Mexican American family.

47. 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' (2004)

It's a crime this innovative steampunk throwback adventure was never a thing, but it just was before its time. Alongside A-listers Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, Jude Law plays the heroic title pilot who has to save the world in a narrative with giant robots, flying zeppelins, a ""Wizard of Oz"" jones and digitized Laurence Olivier.

46. 'Ant-Man' (2015)

Marvel deserves a lot of credit for its big swings, like director Peyton Reed's superhero heist film with a guy who can shrink and ride ants. The immortal Paul Rudd is the secret sauce, as the ex-con cat burglar given these crazy abilities − though instead of doing it for the attaboys and kudos, he just wants to be a good dad.

45. 'Watchmen' (2009)

Say what you will about Zack Snyder's DC movies but this faithful adaptation of the seminal ""Watchmen"" source material is the best thing he's done outside of ""300."" His signature visual style – with slo-mos and hero shots aplenty – lend themselves well to the alt-history epic and the deconstruction of the caped do-gooder.

44. 'Fast Color' (2018)

Gugu Mbatha-Raw headlines the emotional and grounded take on the superhero genre as a former drug addict on the run from those trying to study her telekinetic abilities. The post-apocalyptic scenario adds some flavor, as does the narrative of generations of women mending what’s been shattered between them.

43. 'X-Men: First Class' (2011)

So many X-movies are just X-tremely bad. Not so this groovy 1960s-set adventure that doubles as an origin story for the team of superpowered mutants, putting them at the center of the Cuban Missile Crisis and going deep on the relationship between frenemies Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender).

42. 'Joker' (2019)

What's this doing here? Well, Batman's a kid in it! And, yeah, Joaquin Phoenix is pretty good, too. He won a best actor Oscar for what's essentially a supervillain origin story that is brutal and cynical and even toxic, though it takes some real chutzpah to ask an audience to have empathy for the devil.

41. 'Shazam'! (2019)

Zachary Levi is a natural to inhabit the body of a teen boy in a souped-up body. Like ""Big"" meets ""Superman,"" the family-tinged fantasy tracks the wish-fulfillment high jinks of a kid trying (and often failing) to be a hero, leans into the importance of family and is the rare mainstream film that touches on the foster-care system in a tangible way.

40. 'Dick Tracy' (1990)

Al Pacino chewing scenery like a buffet. Madonna slinking around. Dustin Hoffman mumbling a lot. There's so much to adore about the colorful gangland comic-book movie, and at the center of it is Warren Beatty as the hard-nosed detective with the radio watch, bright yellow overcoat and unshakable righteousness.

39. 'Spider-Man' (2002)

OK, so Tobey Maguire didn't look like a teenager. The sight of the OG Spidey swinging around New York City in Sam Raimi's origin story still holds up, as does J.K. Simmons' newsman J. Jonah Jameson chomping cigars and an unhinged Willem Dafoe tearing up Manhattan as the superhero's most dangerous enemy, the Green Goblin.

38. 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army' (2008)

There is only one Hellboy, Ron Perlman, and the big horned guy with the Right Hand of Doom is a joy to behold in director Guillermo del Toro's fantasy sequel. Del Toro loves his monsters and he unleashes all sorts, from nasty tooth fairies to goblin blacksmiths, as Hellboy is tasked with stopping an army of clockwork mechanical soldiers.

37. 'Blade' (1998)

Neither Spider-Man nor X-Men were Marvel's first big success at the cinema. That honor goes to Wesley Snipes' fanged vampire hunter, who took out gore-covered bloodsuckers and had all the swagger in a cult flick that boasted B-movie antics, '90s style and set the stage for the heroes who came after.

36. 'Robocop' (1987)

In a futuristic and extremely crime-ridden Detroit, cop Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is killed in the line of duty and brought back as a cyborg warrior by a shady corporation. Director Paul Verhoeven's violent '80s action film is also a well-crafted social satire that tackles themes of capitalism and identity and only gets better with age.

35. 'Iron Man' (2008)

Robert Downey Jr. snagged a heck of a career revival playing Tony Stark, an arms manufacturer who gets a high-tech heart and a conscience – plus one really sweet suit of armor. Jon Favreau's action-packed character study turned out to be a game-changer, kicking off what would become the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

34. 'Sky High' (2005)

The Disney high school comedy still works as a superhero gateway for kids. Michael Angarano is the teen son of hero parents wondering if he'll ever gets his powers in this clever take on young adolescence and family legacy, and Kurt Russell's square jaw was born to play a dude named Steve Stronghold.

33. 'Flash Gordon' (1980)

New York Jets star quarterback rockets to a strange planet, tussles with a guy named Ming the Merciless, gets in a love triangle, and teams up with a bunch of hawkmen. (Follow that, Aaron Rodgers!) The campy space opera is lustier than you might expect from a comic-strip do-gooder, and that Queen soundtrack rocks as hard as it ever did.

32. 'Deadpool 2' (2018)

Ryan Reynolds' masked ""Merc with a Mouth"" broke the fourth wall ""Looney Tunes"" style and blew up the genre with a bunch of Acme dynamite in the 2016 original. The zanier time-traveling meta sequel ups his hallmark lampooning game, while also methodically redefining how funny and completely messed up these flicks could be.

31. 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' (2017)

Tom Holland proved that having a young dude play teenage Peter Parker is definitely for the best. Instead of an origin story, Peter is thrown into the stressful situation of navigating high school life, being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man and crushing on the daughter of Michael Keaton's villainous Vulture.

30. 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' (2022)

In the wake of Chadwick Boseman's death, Ryan Coogler's sequel became a soulful and profound look at life, legacy and dealing with grief. It gave Wakanda a female-centered story to tell – with Letitia Wright's Princess Shuri taking on the Panther mantle – and a standout Marvel antagonist in Tenoch Huerta Mejía's charming Namor.

29. 'The Lego Batman Movie' (2017)

The joyously bonkers animated comedy tackled Batman (voiced by Will Arnett) in a fun new way, showing him as a complicated mess who can’t get out of his own way long enough for the greater good. The brick-built bro-dude Dark Knight shreds a mean guitar and also learns the importance of friendship.

28. 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' (2010)

Mixing video-game boss battles with coming-of-age tropes, Edgar Wright's electrifying musical action comedy cast Michael Cera as the Canadian title slacker, who falls for enigmatic Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). To date her, he has to literally fight her seven evil exes and along the way earn the power of self-respect.

27. 'Wonder Woman' (2017)

Gal Gadot had already appeared as the Amazon warrior but she came into her own in this World War I adventure. Her relationship with a pilot (Chris Pine) opens her heart to humanity, and the sight of her bravely walking across the battlefield of ""No Man's Land"" has become an emotional touchstone in the annals of comic-book movies.

26. 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' (2023)

How many Spider-people is too many? Trick question: There's never enough. The snazzy animated sequel sends the Brooklyn teen (voiced by Shameik Moore) into the multiverse to grow up some more: He learns he's part of a huge connected web of folks, yet puts all that in jeopardy to save a loved one.

25. 'The Suicide Squad' (2021)

James Gunn is now in charge of DC's movie future, and this violently subversive retooling of the supergroup was a successful job interview. The director's love for quirky characters and a dark sense of humor blended well with stars like Idris Elba, John Cena and Margot Robbie (whose Harley Quinn has never been more gloriously wacky.)

24. 'Captain America: The First Avenger' (2011)

Cap was punching Nazis in comic books way before Indiana Jones, and Chris Evans captured that appealing righteousness onscreen in the stirring World War II origin tale. When the super soldier puts up his dukes and says, ""I can do this all day,"" you believe him – and Evans did, for several more Marvel movies afterward.

23. 'Superman II' (1980)

The one where Supes gets beat up by a trucker. In order to be with his beloved Lois (Margot Kidder), Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel has his powers removed and that's of course when General Zod (Terence Stamp) and his crew show up wanting to take over Earth and Gene Hackman's top-notch Lex Luthor reappears as a pest.

22. 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' (2023)

James Gunn's swan song with his motley crew of cosmic misfits couldn't have been better, with Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) and Co. scrambling to save their raccoon buddy Rocket (Bradley Cooper) in a sprawling heartfelt adventure that, in its own profound way, tackled issues of animal cruelty and abuse.

21. 'Batman Returns' (1992)

If ""Die Hard"" is a Christmas movie, then so is the art deco Tim Burton sequel that pitted his Caped Crusader (Michael Keaton) against the ghoulish and freaky Penguin (a never-scarier Danny DeVito). The real gift in this holiday-tinged Bat-bonanza: Michelle Pfeiffer's purr-fect Catwoman, a fierce and alluring vision in black leather.

20. 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' (2021)

""Spider-Verse"" doesn't have a monopoly on multiple web-slingers, and Tom Holland's third Marvel solo film – and alternate-reality smorgasbord – teamed him with past screen Spideys Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. (The welcome return of Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin and Jamie Foxx's improved Electro were awesome, too.)

19. 'Avengers: Infinity War' (2018)

Be honest, who's still catching their breath from half the Marvel heroes horrifically turning to ash? The Avengers and other good guys rally to try and keep Thanos (Josh Brolin) from collecting the all-powerful Infinity Stones. They fail, miserably, and the consequences lead to a cliffhanger not soon forgotten.

18. 'Batman Begins' (2005)

The British came to Gotham City and redefined the Dark Knight for a new generation of Bat-fans. Christian Bale nailed the delineations between rich guy Bruce Wayne and his vigilante alter ego, and director Christopher Nolan's outstanding redo of the Caped Crusader's origins was a twisty masterstroke.

17. 'X-Men' (2000)

Marvel's mutant squad made an auspicious big-screen debut that paid tribute to the deep comic themes of them not being accepted by humanity and saving the world anyway. It was also a straight-up blast, especially with Halle Berry's weather-manipulating Storm and Hugh Jackman's mutton-chopped, clawed wonder Wolverine.

16. 'The Batman' (2022)

Robert Pattinson's younger riff on the Dark Knight leans into the ""World's Greatest Detective"" angle from the comics. Director Matt Reeves also populated a neo-noir Gotham with reinvented, realistic Bat-villains: serial-killing Riddler (Paul Dano), vengeful Catwoman (Zoe Kravitz) and power-hungry gangster Penguin (Colin Farrell).

15. 'The Rocketeer' (1991)

In the thrilling ode to the days of pulp serials, Billy Campbell threw on a jetpack and aerodynamic helmet as the 1930s title character, a stunt pilot whose airborne exploits put him on the radar of the FBI, Howard Hughes (!) and Nazi spies. And none of that's helpful in mending fences with his beloved squeeze Jenny (Jennifer Connelly).

14. 'Unbreakable' (2000)

Yeah, it's a bit of a somber affair, but woo boy, M. Night Shyamalan's love letter to comics works exceedingly well with a pair of origin stories and a couple of Hollywood icons. Bruce Willis is the train-wreck survivor turned reluctant, quasi-immortal hero, while Samuel L. Jackson stuns as the totally breakable bad-guy mastermind.

13. 'Logan' (2017)

James Mangold's Western-tinged adventure strips away the superhero trappings to get down and dirty with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine in his twilight years. Even an old man Logan is still a brutal warrior, though rather than dustups, the drama focuses more on a surly X-Man realizing he needs loved ones in a thoughtful exploration of age and mortality.

12. 'Spider-Man 2' (2004)

Not that Sam Raimi's first Spidey outing was shabby by any stretch, but the sequel set a high bar for superhero movies for a good while. Tobey Maguire's hero wrestles with personal problems in a more emotional story line and Alfred Molina shined as an entertaining Doctor Octopus with plenty of metal tentacles and gravitas.

11. 'The Incredibles' (2004)

The best Fantastic Four movie – even considering there were three actual ""Fantastic Four"" movies. Director Brad Bird's animated Pixar gem took the family of superheroes theme to new heights, with strong main characters appealing to a wide base of filmgoers. (The MVP: Craig T. Nelson's relatable and embattled dad Mr. Incredible.)

10. 'Black Panther' (2018)

Ryan Coogler's first journey to Wakanda became a phenomenon for Black culture, with kids doing ""Wakanda Forever"" salutes and Chadwick Boseman turning in a performance befitting a king. His death has given new weight to all his roles, none more than the dignity, grace and quiet power he brought to T'Challa.

9. 'The Avengers' (2012)

Let's face it, we've been spoiled by all the superteam blockbusters during the past decade. But even after ""Justice League"" and its ilk, the OG ""Avengers"" still holds up as a banger. Marvel's shawarma-chomping A-listers have to put differences aside to stave off an alien attack on Manhattan. Until it all falls apart again in ...

8. 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016)

Cap vs. Iron Man is the main event, of course, and the heroes-batting-each-other airport showdown is an all-timer. What makes this one special is how it deals with the real-world ramifications of superpowered beings among us, and the watchable messiness of good guys divided down political and personal lines.

7. 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' (2018)

Spidey is often the superhero that little kids connect with first. And wielding eye-popping animation and a coming-of-age narrative, the daring first ""Spider-Verse"" embraced that universality with Shameik Moore's Miles Morales, a multicultural Brooklyn kid navigating self-confidence and identity issues with entertaining moxie.

6. 'Batman' (1989)

Do we want to get nuts? Yes, Michael Keaton, we would like to get nuts. In Tim Burton's striking and gonzo Bat-flick, Keaton was a slightly crazy Bruce Wayne who you'd believe was a nighttime vigilante – and the right guy to be taking on a Joker that oozes Jack Nicholson's signature kooky charisma.

5. 'Avengers: Endgame' (2019)

After the events of ""Infinity War,"" Earth's mightiest survivors go on a spiffy time-travel heist in order to bring back their friends and the rest of the galaxy that got whisked away. That, and the numerous MCU movies prior, was merely prelude to a monumental brawl against Thanos for all the marbles that may never be surpassed in sheer epicness.

4. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' (2014)

Always remember, James Gunn made the world fall in love with an alien tree and a talking raccoon. As much as the first ""Guardians"" is full of big stakes and save-the-universe derring-do, it's the themes of family and friendship, and little oddities like a convo about how ""Footloose"" is the most heroic movie in the cosmos, that make it sparkle.

3. 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' (2014)

It's not just a great superhero movie, it's just a great movie. An ace political thriller, the flick taps into timely themes of privacy concerns, an enemy growing from within, and military might used in ethically questionable ways. And if that timeliness doesn't impress you, maybe Cap wrecking a bunch of heavies in an elevator will.

2. 'The Dark Knight' (2008)

The late Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance as a chaotic, unpredictable Joker completely hijacks Christopher Nolan's breathtaking Bat-sequel, and will likely never be matched. Dealing with this colorful psychopath, Christian Bale's hero wrestles with personal choices and his gig as Gotham's resident protector in a white-knuckle affair about the fine line between good and evil.

1. 'Superman: The Movie' (1978)

Richard Donner's masterpiece covers the action-packed bases, from an exploding Krypton to disastrous quakes on Earth – you know, a job for Superman. What sets it apart from all the rest of the superhero pack is Christopher Reeve's magnificent showing as the ultimate Man of Steel. This alien is nurtured to be the best of us, embracing humanity and falling in love (see: Supes and Margot Kidder's Lois going on a stellar first-date flight). Reeve brings so much heart to a role where, with just little shifts in posture and mannerisms, he effortlessly switches from bespectacled Clark Kent to the legendary boy scout. Simply put, Reeve was super, man.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L21vdmllcy8yMDIzLzA4LzIwL2Jlc3Qtc3VwZXJoZXJvLW1vdmllcy1hbGwtdGltZS83MDU3NjE4MDAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

Blue Beetle

There’s a potent piece of psychological horror swirling around somewhere in the story concocted by director/co-writer Laura Moss and co-writer Brendan J. O’Brien, but a fundamental chilliness in the filmmaking turns into an obstacle to that potential. In a Bronx hospital, nurse Celie (Judy Reyes) faces the ultimate tragedy when her 6-year-old daughter Lila (A.J. Lister) dies from an acute case of meningitis. But in that same hospital works a pathologist Rose (Marin Ireland), whose clandestine experiments could offer an impossible hope for bringing back the dead. The notion of applying anarrative to parental grief is hardly groundbreaking—Stephen King’sbeing just one devastating example—but Moss and O’Brien do find some interesting territory in the clashing personalities of the clinician Rose and the caregiver Celie, and how their shared circumstance results in a kind of crossover in their behavior. It often feels, though, that the filmmakers aren’t quite sure what to do with the reanimated Lila as a creepy threat, or how to mine their premise for all its body-horror possibilities. Most frustrating, despite the solid performances by the two leads, the emotions behind their behavior don’t end up driving the narrative as much as the idea of a ticking clock for the materials needed to keep Lila alive. The result is slick and occasionally satisfying, but one that misses the mark on finding the real terror in what grief can inspire someone to do.(R)Over the past 15 years, some of the most satisfying filmed narratives involving DC Comics characters have been the early seasons of the “Arrowverse” TV seriesandand this feature follows a similar playbook of earnest emotion and playful storytelling. Xolo Maridueña plays Jaime Reyes, a recent college graduate whose return home to his family gets complicated when he comes into the possession of a scarab housing a sentient, symbiotic alien technology—or, more to the point as Jaime's reluctant superhero-dom is concerned, the scarab comes into possession of him. Along the way, Jaime comes into conflict with a high-tech CEO (Susan Sarandon) who wants to exploit the technology for military purposes, and the resulting dynamics do makefeel a little like an experiment in fusingwith. But the screenplay Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer emphasizes the relationship between Jaime and his family members in a way that feels authentic, rather than someone just mouthing the word “family” every 10 minutes like aentry. And director Angel Manuel Soto has plenty of fun with both the character interactions and this action beats, even as the story starts packing a little welcome attitude about the exploitation of brown people, and a willingness to have Jaime’s Uncle Rudy (George Lopez) assert “Batman is a fascist.” In a way, it feels like a pilot for a DC TV show—and in this case, that’s a compliment.(PG-13)With a title including the phrase “invisible hand” and a main character named Adam (though not Smith), it’s fairly clear that writer/director Cory Finley’s adaptation of M.T. Anderson’s novel is an allegory about economics—but at least in its cinematic form, it bounces to too many different variations on that theme. The story is set in 2036 America, five years after an alien race called the “vuvv” appeared, providing technology that made many jobs obsolete and radically shifted the economic realities for families like that of high-schooler Adam (Asante Blackk), who take in as boarders the family of his classmate/eventual girlfriend Chloe (Kylie Rogers). Finley uses many of the book’s more intriguing concepts, like Adam and Chloe turning their courtship into entertainment for the vuvvs’ anthropological curiosity, a notion that wrestles with the inherent falseness of people who monetize their online personas. But he also shifts several subplots to add more layers to the question of how people are affected by economic inequity, folding gender and race into a story that’s already dealing with matters including an unfair justice system, the stresses on family cohesiveness and the role of artists in pushing for change. The performances always feel subservient to the needs of the plot, and the plot keeps trying out new ideas, as though always trying to stay ahead of every anticipated “but what about …” for any story trying to tackle broken late-stage capitalism.(R)Narrative efficiency is one thing; it’s another when a story barely has enough time to build a viewer’s investment. Co-screenwriters Shea Serrano and Jason Concepcion (creator and staff writer, respectively, for the Freevee series Primo) introduce Miguel Perez (Tyler Dean Flores), a Syracuse, N.Y. high-school senior devoted to action movies and hanging out with his best friends David (Christian Vunipola), Cass (Imani Lewis) and Srini (Suraj Partha). But when he learns that his parents are planning to move, Miguel becomes determined to do one thing he’s never done before: get in an actual fight. Director Oz Rodriguez plays around visually with the genres Miguel fantasizes about for his own theoretical battle—ranging from Bruce Lee kung-fu flicks to anime—and the appealing young cast members give a snap to dialogue that is refreshingly not PG-13’d down. The problem is that the character stuff the writers want to include—like Miguel’s sense that his boxer father (Raúl Castillo) doesn’t respect him, or David’s feelings about his own deceased ex-fighter dad—have to jockey for time with all the goofier stuff in a movie that runs just 71 minutes before the credits start to roll. It’s a pleasant enough diversion at times, but ends up too thin to be more than a low-budget spin on(R)Remember the “DreamWorks face”—that ubiquitous expression of eyebrow-cocked insouciance that once filled posters and other marketing materials for CGI animated features? In adapting an ancient Chinese legend, it feels like the filmmakers behindhad as a primary goal the creation of a walking, trash-talking manifestation of ""DreamWorks face"" energy. It’s the tale of the titular monkey (Jimmy O. Yang), fallen to earth in a rock, whose sense of rejection and isolation leads him to ever-more-extreme actions for proving his worth, including capturing a magical stick from the underwater Dragon King (Bowen Yang). His only potential companion: a young girl named Lin (Jolie Hoang-Rappaport), who offers to become his assistant. Director Anthony Stacchi (The Boxtrolls) oversees an energetic production that almost never stops moving, full of whirling-dervish action, fantastical settings and even the occasional musical production number, and finds some fun in Bowen Yang’s voice performance of purring, preening villainy. But while the narrative tries to wrestle some genuine emotion from the idea of how individuals can behave badly out of a desperate need for acceptance, the relationship between Monkey and Lin just never hits a sweet spot, in part because the writers don’t seem to know how to take Monkey from center of an allegorical myth to full-fledged character. As we await the arrival of a literal deus ex machina, our protagonist remains a mere representation of arrogance in need of humbling—or, in other words, needing to have that DreamWorks wiped off of his face.(PG)See feature review (NC-17)If you’re going to season your raunchy, R-rated comedy liberally with emotional sincerity—as soooo many raunchy, R-rated comedies seem determined to do in the 21st century—it would help if that emotional sincerity didn’t feel cribbed from a much better version of the same idea. Here we find the tale of Reggie (voiced by Will Ferrell), a scroungy mutt who’s abandoned by his horrible owner Doug (Will Forte) miles from home, then teams up with a trio of other dogs—Bug (Jamie Foxx), Maggie (Isla Fisher) and Hunter (Randall Park)—to find his way back to Doug for a little revenge. As a comedy, Dan Perrault’s script too rarely finds actual creative humor beyond references to dogs humping things, pee-pee/poo-poo humor and assuming it’s inherently funny to hear a string of f-bombs digitally mouthed by a dog (which, sue me, it kind of is). It’s actually a bit more successful once it’s clear that this is a story about recognizing when you’re in an abusive relationship, except that it gets sidetracked a bit by Bug’s backstory of heartbreak, which might as well have been scored to’s “When She Loved Me.” It’s a goofy enough time-killer with a handful of guffaws, but this is a high concept convinced it can get you in your feelings, when maybe you’re just there to laugh at a Boston terrier saying “fuck.”(R)",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHl3ZWVrbHkubmV0L0J1enpCbG9nL2FyY2hpdmVzLzIwMjMvMDgvMTcvZmlsbS1yZXZpZXdzLW5ldy1yZWxlYXNlcy1mb3ItYXVnLTE40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,UK-Ireland box office preview: Warner Bros’ ‘Blue Beetle’ chased by Universal’s ‘Strays’,Curzon is re-releasing Lars von Trier’s ‘The Idiots’.,"Warner Bros’ superhero sci-fi Blue Beetle and Universal’s canine comedy Strays head the new titles at the UK-Ireland box office, in a post-Barbenheimer test of how the market can handle two wide studio releases.

Opening in 556 cinemas, Blue Beetle is the third feature from Puerto Rican filmmaker Angel Manuel Soto. In the film, after an alien scarab chooses a teenager to be its symbiotic host, the youngster becomes the eponymous superhero with an unpredictable suit of armour.

Xolo Mariduena leads the cast, which also includes Bruna Marquezine, Damian Alcazar, George Lopez and Adriana Barraza.

It is the 14th title in the DC Extended Universe of films based upon DC Comics characters. The franchise started strongly, with the first three films all grossing at least £30m – 2013’s Man Of Steel (£30m), 2016’s Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn Of Justice (£36.6m) and 2016’s Suicide Squad (£33.6m).

However, subsequent titles have struggled. Most recent entry The Flash topped the chart on its release in June this year, but slipped out of most cinemas within a month, with an £8.8m total. Prior to that, Shazam! Fury Of The Gods made £6m in spring this year; while Black Adam did better with £19.9m, albeit still down on the level of the first three titles.

It is a first studio outing for Soto, who previously made 2015 drama The Farm, which played at Austin Fantastic Fest and the UK’s Raindance; and 2020 dirt-bike rider drama Charm City Kings, which debuted at Sundance.

Universal is letting Strays off the leash in 492 venues. Directed by Josh Greenbaum, the 15-rated comedy follows an abandoned dog who teams up with other strays to get revenge on its former owner. Will Ferrell and Jamie Fox lead the voice cast, which also includes Isla Fisher, Randall Park, Will Forte, Josh Gad, Sofia Vergara, Greta Lee, Jamie Demetriou and Brett Gelman

US filmmaker Greenbaum made his name in documentaries, with titles including 2013’s The Short Game, 2017’s Becoming Bond and 2017 TV film Too Funny To Fail: The Life And Death Of The Dana Carvey Show. He made his fiction debut with 2021 comedy Barb And Star Go To Vista Del Mar, which debuted online during the pandemic.

Films about dogs can be a profitable territory at the box office, from 2001 spy comedy Cats & Dogs (£24.1m total box office) and 2009 romance Marley And Me (£5.4m), to 2021 family comedy Clifford The Big Red Dog (£10m) and Wes Anderson’s 2018 animation Isle Of Dogs (£6m). The majority are PG-rated to serve families; the challenge for Strays will be to win over a more adult audience.

Lie With Me, Lars

In 15 sites, Peccadillo Pictures has Olivier Peyon’s Lie With Me, which played at a succession of French festivals including Angouleme, and international events including BFI Flare: London LGBTQIA+ Film Festival. Based on Philippe Besson’s novel, the film tells the story of an author who returns to his hometown of Cognac, where he faces the memories of his first love.

Curzon is conducting a 25th anniversary re-release of Lars von Trier’s comedy The Idiots, in 14 sites across its first week. The first film made under von Trier’s Dogme 95 manifesto promoting traditional storytelling, it debuted to strong, mixed reactions at Cannes in 1998. Danish director von Trier revealed he has Parkinson’s disease last year; he made the headlines earlier this week though by posting a video advertisement for a “girlfriend and muse” to inspire his next film.

Further new titles include Park Circus’ 50th anniversary re-release of Sidney Lumet’s crime drama Serpico starring Al Pacino, in 49 cinemas across its first week; and Pranay Meshram’s Indian thriller Akelli through Reliance Entertainment.

In event cinema, Trafalgar Releasing is playing concert film Metallica: M72 World Tour Live From TX #1 in 380 cinemas on Saturday, August 19.

Warner Bros’ Barbie has crossed the £80m mark, and will look to hold top spot for a fifth successive weekend. Earlier this week it had grossed over £1m on 24 consecutive days – the joint-second longest run with Skyfall, behind the 32 days of No Time To Die. Universal’s Oppenheimer is also holding well, and will look to cross the £50m mark this weekend.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY3JlZW5kYWlseS5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1pcmVsYW5kLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtcHJldmlldy13YXJuZXItYnJvcy1ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1jaGFzZWQtYnktdW5pdmVyc2Fscy1zdHJheXMvNTE4NTAyMy5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-08 14:39:00+00:00,The 5 most anticipated movies of August 2023,These are the movies that Rotten Tomatoes users can't wait to see in theaters this month.,"Now that August is here, the late-summer “dump” season is fully underway — that time of the year when local cinemas generally release forgettable new movies that come with low expectations (alongside, of course, the still-lingering blockbusters like Barbie and Oppenheimer that are continuing to draw crowds). At the same time, just because August is a somewhat fallow period on the movie release calendar, that doesn’t mean the well is completely dry this month.

On the contrary — in this post, we’re going to take a closer look at the five most anticipated movies out this month, as ranked by Rotten Tomatoes users. It’s a list that includes everything from a new DC Comics title to a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles reboot — as well as some titles that, honestly, have me scratching my head over their inclusion.

At any rate, maybe at least one or two of these will give you an idea of what to see next at the theater. And when you’re done perusing this list, don’t forget to also check out our related coverage of the most-anticipated TV shows for the month of August (again, courtesy of Rotten Tomatoes).

Blue Beetle

One of the most anticipated movies of the August release slate is Blue Beetle — the second-to-last movie set in the DC Extended Universe, in which Xolo Maridueña will portray Jaime Reyes.

Reyes is a recent college graduate who must come to terms with his new powers after acquiring an ancient alien relic known as the Scarab. With Jaime as the symbiotic host of the Scarab, he’s then encased in a suit of armor that puts him on a path to becoming the Blue Beetle.

Set for an Aug. 18 theatrical release, Blue Beetle will be the third of four DC movies launching this year, following Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash and preceding Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem

Rogen’s new Ninja Turtles movie, meanwhile, has already been in theaters for five days now and pulled in a little over $43 million over that period — quite a solid start for this reboot of the beloved franchise.

In terms of the response generated, the film is also crushing it on that front as well. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem as of this writing has near-perfect critics’ and fan scores on Rotten Tomatoes (96% and 92%, respectively), and everything from the fidelity to its source material to the playful vibe and aesthetic is note-perfect.

“With its unique visual style and a story that captures the essence of the franchise’s appeal, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is an animated treat for the whole family,” reads the Rotten Tomatoes critics’ consensus about the movie.

Meg 2: The Trench

As for the next film on this list of August’s most anticipated movies (which actually hit theaters over the weekend), what can I say: The presence of Jason Statham alone should give you some indication of what you’re in for. So should the fact that Meg 2: The Trench is a remake of a bonkers original in which Statham (portraying a deep-sea rescue diver) encounters a 75-foot-long megalodon shark while attempting to save a crew of scientists in the ocean.

If B-movie action is what you’re looking for, and you don’t care what critics think (Meg 2 has a 28% critics’ score on Rotten Tomatoes, versus a much stronger 72% from fans), then maybe this is the next big dumb-fun thriller for you to catch on the big screen.

Gran Turismo: The Movie

From director Neill Blomkamp, this next highly anticipated movie — Gran Turismo, coming on Aug. 25 — from Columbia Pictures, PlayStation Productions, and 2.0 Entertainment is based on two things. One is the video game of the same name, a racing simulation, while the other is the real-life story of teenage Gran Turismo player Jann Mardenborough, who went on to actually become a pro race car driver.

From the movie’s official synopsis:

“Gran Turismo is based on the unbelievable true story of a team of unlikely underdogs — a struggling working-class gamer (Archie Madekwe), a failed former racecar driver (David Harbour), and an idealistic motorsport executive (Orlando Bloom). Together, they risk it all to take on the most elite sport in the world. Gran Turismo is an inspiring, thrilling, and action-packed story that proves that nothing is impossible when you’re fueled from within.”

The Last Voyage of the Demeter

Finally, who’s up for a horror movie? Set for theatrical release on Aug. 11, The Last Voyage of the Demeter is adapted from Bram Stoker’s iconic novel Dracula (specifically, from the seventh chapter). The “Demeter” of the title refers to the merchant ship Demeter, which was chartered to carry fifty unmarked wooden crates from Carpathia to London.

As the voyage unfolds, the crew tries to survive while strange events keep happening. An ominous presence stalks everyone onboard. Eventually, the ship makes it to England — but it’s a charred mess at that point, with no more crew.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYmdyLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3RoZS01LW1vc3QtYW50aWNpcGF0ZWQtbW92aWVzLW9mLWF1Z3VzdC0yMDIzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

Taylor Swift Sells More Tickets In Presales For ‘The Eras Tour’ At Just AMC Theaters Than ‘Blue Beetle’s’ Entire Domestic Opening Weekend

Taylor Swift in Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour via Taylor Swift YouTube

Taylor Swift and the recently announced The Eras Tour has already grossed more in pre-sales at just AMC Theaters than Blue Beetle’s entire domestic opening weekend.

Swift announced The Eras Tour would be getting a theatrical release yesterday on her social media channels.

On X she wrote, “The Eras Tour has been the most meaningful, electric experience of my life so far and I’m overjoyed to tell you that it’ll be coming to the big screen soon.”

From there she added, “Starting Oct 13th you’ll be able to experience the concert film in theaters in North America!”

Swift’s Eras Tour was her sixth tour and her second all-stadium tour. The tour kicked off in Glendale, Arizona on March 17th and is expected to conclude in November 2024 in Toronto, Ontario.

Each tour date sees Swift sing 44 of her songs with 10 acts and is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length.

Box office analyst Valliant Renegade predicts this film could be the highest grossing film of the fall box office season. He noted, “I think this could be a $100 million surprise weekend for theaters with this thing.”

He goes on to point out that Swift’s film is taking the place of Dune Part II, which was recently delayed to March 2024, “Dune 2 certainly would have been in contention for one of the biggest if not the biggest box office draw this fall season. That is no longer. Taylor Swift is moving into claim the mantle.”

RELATED: The Walt Disney Company’s 2022 Domestic Box Office Grosses The Worst In Over Two Decades

Valliant Renegade might have actually been underestimating Swift’s command at the box office. AMC reports the film sold over $26 million in pre-sales in just one day. For those keeping count that’s more than Blue Beetle’s entire opening weekend. The most recent DC release only brought in $25 million domestically.

Oh, and that $26 million number is just for AMC Theaters, it does not include sales at Regal and Cinemark.

Exhibitor Relations reports, “$26M in one day of pre-sales. And that’s just from AMC. Yes, a $100M debut is definitely in the cards for TAYLOR SWIFT: THE ERAS TOUR, which rolls out Oct. 13. Swift saves cinemas.”

RELATED: AMC CEO Responds To Reports That AMC Theaters Are Suppressing ‘Sound Of Freedom’

AMC also revealed the pre-sale total of $26 million far surpassed the previous record for a single title at AMC. Spider-Man: No Way Home held the previous record at $16.9 million. AMC also noted it shattered Spider-Man: No Way Home’s previous claim to the top spot for 24-hour ticket sales revenue, but it didn’t take 24 hours to do it. It took less than three hours.

Senior VP at Fandango Ticketing Jerramy Hainline also told Variety, “Not only is Taylor Swift’s concert film the best first-day ticket seller of the year on Fandango, but the concert film is performing like the superhero she is and ranking among the best first-day ticket sellers of all time from franchises like Marvel, Star Wars, DC Comics and more.”

The movie is forcing a shakeup from competitors as well. Jason Blum and Universal chose to move The Exorcist: Believer up a week so as not to compete with Swift.

He announced on X, “Look what you made me do. The Exorcist: Believer moves to 10/6/23. #TaylorWins.”

Given Valliant Renegade and Exhibitor Relations are predicting a $100 million opening weekend, it’s quite possible if Swift and company decide to add more showings that it could easily become one of the top grossing films for 2023. Sound of Freedom currently holds the 10th spot with a domestic gross of $181 million.

In fact, AMC noted in their press release they plan to add showtimes stating, “Recognizing this unprecedented demand, AMC is adding additional showtimes to increase capacity where necessary and available. During its run at AMC, TAYLOR SWIFT | THE ERAS TOUR concert film will play at least four showtimes per day on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, at every AMC theatre location in the United States.”

It’s not of the realm of possibility that they expand it to a second weekend or even third weekend.

What do you make of Taylor Swift outgrossing Blue Beetle in presales at just AMC Theaters?

2023-08-02 15:14:33+00:00,Blue Beetle Popcorn Bucket: Where To Buy the Limited Edition Vessel,"Here's how to buy the Blue Beetle popcorn bucket, as well as the tin, plush, cup, and vessel at Cinemark theaters.","The Blue Beetle popcorn bucket is the latest themed popcorn vessel to pop up on social media. With fans going wild for the Barbie bucket, a push is clearly being made to highlight any limited-edition vessels, cups, plushies, and other cinema-related items. Here’s a breakdown of where you can buy the limited-edition popcorn bucket and how much it is.

Where to buy the Blue Beetle popcorn bucket

Cinemark has the Blue Beetle popcorn bucket available to buy at select US theaters.

Eager fans can expect the Blue Beetle popcorn bucket items to become available on, or shortly before, August 18. This is when the Blue Beetle movie launches, so it makes sense for the accompanying popcorn bucket to launch alongside it.

The wording of “while supplies last” confirm that there is a limited quantity of the popcorn bucket items available. If you’re a big fan of Blue Beetle who is desperate to get their hands on one or more of the items, I recommend getting there early on release day.

How much is the Blue Beetle popcorn bucket?

The Blue Beetle popcorn bucket container is $25 without popcorn or $30 with popcorn.

There are other Blue Beetle items available at Cinemark. The full catalog is as follows:

Cup $7

Popcorn Tin $16

Popcorn Container $25

Popcorn Container with Medium Popcorn $30

Tin & Cup Combo $22

Plush $12

Buddy Cup $15

As mentioned above, these items are available in limited quantities, meaning stock might not last until the end of launch day. If you’ve got your eye on a specific Blue Beetle item, you’ll want to head to the nearest Cinemark theater early on launch day.

,The Equalizer 3 movie review & film summary (2023),The Equalizer 3 is hot garbage.,"You won’t guess what mundane package McCall has just murdered an army of killers to get. But it doesn’t really matter. While the ham-fisted McGuffin doesn’t serve the rest of the film, this opening scene—from its stomach-churning violence to the reliance on impractical effects—indicates where this once enjoyable nuts-and-bolts action franchise has gone wrong.

Antoine Fuqua’s “The Equalizer 3” is not just what many assume will be the last film in the franchise; it’s the fifth overall collaboration between the director and Washington. Their partnership, on its face, is puzzling. Sure, their first teaming, “Training Day,” netted Washington his lone Best Actor win. But their successive films have only gotten harsher and dumber since that triumph. What exactly does Washington get out of these films? It’s a relationship that often recalls the run Anthony Mann and Jimmy Stewart experienced in their eight pictures together (though, to be sure, Fuqua-Washington has mined far poorer thematic treasures) when Stewart left his prestige perch, his good-guy image, and aw-shucks mannerisms to explore darker stories in Mann’s freeing Westerns. You can tell Washington gets the same pleasure here, not caring if the audience experiences the same adventurous sensations he does.

Because, make no mistake, “The Equalizer 3” is hot garbage. It’s also a fascinating but failed attempt by Fuqua and Washington to make their own Mann-Stewart film. Consider how the Western genre stains this picture. During McCall’s raid on the villa, he is critically wounded and eventually discovered by a local cop, Gio (Eugenio Mastrandrea), who takes him to a quaint seaside Italian village, where a local doctor named Enzo (Remo Girone) treats the hitman’s wounds. While recuperating in the restful town, McCall learns to love the people and the peace they provide him. Though a local young gang leader, Marco (Andrea Dodero), looms over them, McCall, who says he’s merely passing through, would rather avoid intervening. Like any Western, when push comes to shove, McCall will defend them while teaching these acquiescing people how to stand up to their oppressors.

Fuqua and cinematographer Robert Richardson (“Platoon” and “A Few Good Man”) provide further Western details through chiaroscuro lighting. Washington’s silhouette spells danger, while his weary frame expresses a close relationship to death. Richardson also captures the actor from extreme low angles, a la John Ford, painting heroic compositions. The problem, however, is they’ve made McCall so vicious we’re not quite sure if we should be rooting for him to kill. While it makes sense for the character to show greater brutality—after all, in the first “Equalizer,” he was once a calm man idling in retirement—now he’s a man fully bathed in blood and guts again. Even Washington can’t fully pull across that throughline, especially when the script is so weak.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvZ2VyZWJlcnQuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvdGhlLWVxdWFsaXplci0zLW1vdmllLXJldmlldy0yMDIz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

On Threads, in response to a fan, Gunn wrote: ""I was never making a 'young Superman' movie, just a Superman movie!""

The confirmation comes after Cavill's exit from the role. Following his post-credits appearance in Black Adam, Cavill announced he was back as Superman, then soon after shared he was back out. Gunn revealed that his Superman movie would focus on a younger version of the character, hence the recast.

""In the initial stages, our story will be focusing on an earlier part of Superman's life, so the character will not be played by Henry Cavill,"" Gunn wrote on Twitter after Cavill announced he would no longer be the Man of Steel.

Later, David Corenswet was cast as the new incarnation of Clark Kent, with Rachel Brosnahan co-starring as Lois Lane. The film will also include Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern Guy Gardner, Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific, and Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl.

2023-08-18 12:00:44+02:00,Review VF – Blue Beetle Infinite,"Ce mois-ci, le film Blue Beetle se pose au cinéma tel le scarabée Chrysochus cobaltinus, et Urban Comics profite de coup de projecteur pour nous proposer un","Ce mois-ci, le film Blue Beetle se pose au cinéma tel le scarabée Chrysochus cobaltinus, et Urban Comics profite de coup de projecteur pour nous proposer un nouveau titre de la gamme DC Infinite: Blue Beetle Infinite. C'est une mini-série de 6 chapitres, mais une ongoing a été commandée suite au bon retour positif de ce récit. Elle devrait sortir plus tard dans l'année aux US. Qui sait en France? Ce récit Blue Beetle Infinite n'est pas une origin-story, mais plutôt une relance sur le personnage. De mémoire, il semble que c'est le premier volume paru chez l'éditeur français, qui se concentre exclusivement sur le personnage. Alors, qu'est ce que cela raconte? Est-ce un bon point d'entrée sur Blue Beetle? Que peut-on espérer pour la suite?

Après le diplôme, vers quel avenir se tourner?

Jaime Reyes est un jeune lycéen en fin d'année de classe de terminale. Il partage son temps entre ses devoirs d'études et ceux de super héros. En effet, on apprend rapidement que Jaime a fait la rencontre d'un appareil alien sous la forme d'un scarabée bleu qui s'est attaché à lui pour ne plus le quitter. Muni d'une volonté propre, le scarabée nommé Khaji Da permet à son porteur de lui conférer une armure polymorphe ainsi que d'autres pouvoirs très sympathiques, qui font de lui le troisième héros à porter le nom de Blue Beetle. On apprend par la suite qu'il a côtoyé les Teen Titans et croisé la route de Superman ou Batman dans le passé. Mais le tome n'est pas une origin-story car il fait l'impasse sur ces évènements. Le scénariste Josh Trujillo souhaite relancer le personnage vers d'autres perspectives, et son récit débute au moment de la remise de son diplôme. Un choix pas si anodin tant les thématiques parleront à beaucoup de personnes ayant traversé cette période avec des interrogations sur son avenir.

Ainsi, Blue Beetle Infinite constitue un bon point d'entrée. L'histoire brille surtout par ses thèmes que par son fil principal. Il conviendra surtout à un lectorat dans la tranche d'âge des 15-25 ans, mais l'écriture est tellement fraîche et accessible que tout le monde peut rentrer dans l'histoire. En effet Jaime a une image qui traverse différents spectres selon qu'il s'agisse de ses parents (paresseux pour les études), de ses amis (copain cool avec des pouvoirs), de son statut de jeune héros (plus une complication qu'un réel atout) ou encore de celui de Beetle (une arme de destruction massive dont il perdra le contrôle un jour). Et tout ce mélange offre un cocktail très sympathique à suivre. De plus, Blue Beetle Infinite est un récit clairement inscrit dans son époque actuel. A titre d'information, certains dialogues sont énoncés pour être parlés en espagnol, l'orientation de genre et sexuelle de quelques personnages est abordée, ou encore la place des réseaux sociaux. Tout ceci développe le milieu culturel du héros, et donc le regard qu'il pourrait porter, lors de futurs arcs narratifs, sur la société.

Buen muchacho, Jaime

Blue Beetle a le potentiel pour être une série intéressante à suivre. Il faut dire que son scénariste, Josh Trujillo, n'est pas nouveau dans le milieu. Ayant collaboré sur de nombreux projets dans le jeu vidéo ou le comic book, il a été désigné en 2022 par DC Comics comme la personne en charge de la prochaine série on-going Blue Beetle. Prévue pour septembre prochain, Josh Trujillo pourra ainsi développer ce qu'il souhaite, et si c'est dans la continuité de ce récit, cela peut s'avérer intéressant. D'autant plus qu'il y a matière à faire avec les différents scarabées, la collaboration avec le deuxième Blue Beetle historique Ted Korn, ou la gestion de sa vie civile.

Concernant la partie dessin, il fallait une personne qui sache correspondre aux idées du scénariste. On ne pouvait pas mettre des dessinateurs calibrés pour des gros events à la Justice League ou au récit trop intimistes. Le choix s'est porté sur Andrián Gutierrez, dessinateur espagnol, pour donner un aspect très expressif aux personnages. Car oui, niveau émotion, c'est mission accompli. Si on choisit Jaime Reyes, son visage change complètement quand il ressent de la tristesse, de la joie, de la déception ou de l'agacement. Et cela s'applique également lorsqu'il revêt l'armure de Blue Beetle, ce qui est drôlement étrange.

Pour conclure, Blue Beetle est un personnage haut en couleurs, dans tous les sens du terme, et c'est sans détour que je vous recommande la lecture de Blue Beetle Infinite. Alors oui, le scénario est assez classique, l'objectif n'est pas de (re)créer le personnage dans ce volume, mais de le repenser par une approche plus contemporaine. Derrière l'armure alien au potentiel de destruction massif se cache un petit jeune dont les préoccupations s'entrecroisent entre son avenir professionnel, personnel et super-héroïque. Très accessible à suivre et plus riche qu'il ne parait, le scénariste Josh Trujillo aborde des thématiques qui méritent d'être développées davantage dans la suite à venir.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRjcGxhbmV0LmZyLzMwMzYyOS1yZXZpZXctdmYtYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtaW5maW5pdGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-23 16:29:00+00:00,The Flash star's new movie gets brutal first reviews,"The Flash star Grant Gustin's new movie Puppy Love, in which he features opposite Lucy Hale, gets brutal first reviews.","Despite the adorable premise, Grant Gustin and Lucy Hale's romantic comedy Puppy Love has opened to scathing reviews.

Directed by Nick Fabiano and Richard Alan Reid, the comedy currently sits at a meagre 33% score on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, though the rating is likely to change as more reviews come in.

Puppy Love sees The Flash and Pretty Little Liars stars as perpetually single dog owners Max and Nicole. After going on a disastrous first date, the two vow to never cross paths again, but have to reconsider when they realise that, unlike them, their dogs really dug one another.

Nicole's dog has got Max's pup pregnant, forcing them to try and co-parent before the adorable fur babies arrive. Of course, the proximity leads the humans to appreciate one another and perhaps give love another chance.

Alongside Hale and Gustin, Puppy Love also stars Nore Davis, Christine Lee, Jane Seymour and Michael Hitchcock.

A few days after its US debut on Freevee (the film currently doesn't have a UK release date), Puppy Love has failed to wow critics. Many have branding it a predictable, harmless rom-com riddled with clichés, though praise was reserved for the leads.

Let's have a look at what reviewers are saying about Puppy Love below.

""The best part of Puppy Love may be its double entendre marketing tagline: 'One bone can change everything'.""

""It's admittedly difficult to dislike Hale and Gustin, who do their damnedest to minimize the film's cringeworthiness, but their work here is thankless go-nowhere wheel-spinning.""

""While there are certainly flaws to be found in some of the choices the film makes, it was a pretty decent way to spend 80 minutes of my Friday night.""

""Overflowing with quirks and cuteness, this breezy and innocuous romantic comedy is too predictable to have much bark or bite.""

Amazon Freevee

""The movie has all the clichés at its disposal but can't make much of it. With its leads being the only thing going for it, it's hard to recommend it.""

""The film features two very cute dogs, and is well-natured, funny in places, and well-acted by its two stars.""

""Brings hard bad sitcom energy to a feature-length exercise in pure tedium.""

Puppy Love is streaming on Freevee in the US. A UK release date is yet to be announced.

Tác phẩm ra rạp Việt từ ngày 18/8, là dự án mới nhất của vũ trụ DC. Xoay quanh siêu anh hùng gốc Latin đầu tiên, Blue Beetle được kỳ vọng thổi luồng gió mới sau khi một số phim cùng hãng sản xuất - như The Flash, Shazam! Fury of the Gods - thất bại trên phòng vé gần đây.

Đạo diễn Ángel Manuel Soto chọn công thức quen thuộc với dòng phim siêu anh hùng để giới thiệu xuất thân của Blue Beetle. Chàng trai 22 tuổi Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña đóng) trở về quê nhà Mexico sau khi tốt nghiệp đại học, loay hoay tìm việc làm. Dù mang nhiều hoài bão, Jaime buộc đối diện thực tế với nhiều gánh nặng tài chính: bố mất việc, gia đình sắp mất chỗ ở vì tiền thuê nhà tăng.

Một lần, khi làm thuê tại biệt thự của Victoria Kord - chủ tịch tập đoàn chuyên sản xuất vũ khí Kord Industries, Jaime tình cờ được giao giữ một chiếc hộp chứa Scarab - bộ giáp công nghệ sinh học ngoài vũ trụ mang hình dạng con bọ hung xanh. Sau khi được Scarab chọn làm vật chủ để ký sinh, Jaime vật lộn làm quen với sức mạnh mới. Bị bà chủ tập đoàn Kord săn lùng để lấy lại công nghệ tối tân, Jaime nhận ra trở thành siêu anh hùng chưa bao giờ là điều dễ dàng.

Một nhân vật vô danh được trao siêu năng lực vốn là môtíp không mới trong các phim Marvel lẫn DC. Dù vậy, Blue Beetle vẫn tạo sức hút nhờ lối kể chuyện gần gũi, hài hước theo phong cách của dòng phim tuổi mới lớn (coming-of-age). Jaime Reyes vốn không mơ mộng trở thành anh hùng cứu thế giới. Anh đơn giản chỉ muốn tìm công ăn việc làm phụ giúp gia đình, gầy dựng sự nghiệp để không phụ lòng bà và mẹ.

Trái tim hướng thiện của Jaime là điều khiến Scarab quyết định chọn anh để ban sức mạnh. Đầu phim, trong một tình huống đối đầu với kẻ ác, Scarab muốn tiêu diệt kẻ thù song Jaime ngăn cản. Quá trình Jaime đấu tranh tâm lý trước lựa chọn trở thành anh hùng được xây dựng hợp lý. Anh nhận ra đó là cách duy nhất để bảo vệ người thân trước cái ác, dù con đường chông gai và đầy trách nhiệm.

Khác nhiều phim cùng đề tài, Blue Beetle ghi điểm với câu chuyện giàu màu sắc tình cảm gia đình. Lấy bối cảnh chính ở Mexico, phim mang nhiều chi tiết đặc trưng của cuộc sống, văn hóa Mỹ Latin. Ba thế hệ gia đình Reyes sống chen chúc trong một ngôi nhà song vẫn luôn nở nụ cười lạc quan, động viên nhau vượt khó. Họ cùng dùng điểm tâm với những chiếc bánh taco, ca hát theo một nhạc phẩm quen thuộc. Khi Jaime lần đầu đi làm, đại gia đình kéo nhau đến tận công ty để ủng hộ.

Nửa sau của tác phẩm, khi một biến cố xảy ra, sức mạnh của tình thân hiện diện rõ hơn. Lúc này, Jaime không còn đơn độc chiến đấu khi bên cạnh anh còn có sự chung sức của nhiều người thân. Nhận thức trách nhiệm với gia đình giúp Jaime khai phá sức mạnh của Scarab, từ đó hoàn toàn làm chủ bộ giáp tối tân.

Khâu kỹ xảo được sử dụng hợp lý ở những cảnh Blue Beetle giới thiệu sức mạnh. Đầu phim, phân đoạn Jaime làm quen bộ giáp mang lại hiệu ứng thị giác với những pha bay lượn ngoài quỹ đạo Trái đất, xuyên qua thành phố, xẻ đôi xe buýt bằng tia năng lượng. Các cảnh hành động được dàn dựng mãn nhãn khi Jaime một mình chống chọi tay sai của Victoria Kord - người nắm giữ công nghệ với sức mạnh tương đương Scarab.

Điểm yếu của phim nằm ở tuyến phản diện. Nhân vật ""bà trùm"" được miêu tả là người mưu mô, tham vọng song không tạo cảm giác khó đối phó. Cảnh giao chiến cuối phim chưa đẩy được kịch tính lên cao trào vì Jaime chế ngự ác nhân khá dễ dàng. Trên chuyên trang điện ảnh Rotten Tomatoes, phim được giới phê bình đánh giá 76% - mức điểm khả quan. Blue Beetle được dự đoán đạt doanh thu mở màn cuối tuần này là 30 triệu USD, đứng đầu thị trường Bắc Mỹ.

2023-08-07 19:27:12+00:00,"14 Movies To See In August: ‘Passages,’ ‘Blue Beetle,’ ‘Bottoms’ & More","You wouldn't know it from the strike, but August is chock-full of highly-anticipated movies, ""Bottoms,' 'Blue Beetle,' 'Fremont' and more.","18 SHARES Facebook Twitter

With the state of the film and television industry in disarray, as the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes continue to ensure better pay and treatment for writers and actors, the future theatrical release schedule continues to shift. While certain fall releases have already been pushed, August has remained largely untouched. With plenty of festival favorites making their way to the big screen along with heavy-hitting tent poles such as “Blue Beetle,” the month ahead offers an eclectic bunch of releases. With such an array of titles and genres, it will be interesting to see if sequels and spinoffs continue to face lessened interest as original titles such as July’s “Barbie” continue to triumph.

“TMNT: Mutant Mayhem”

Directed by Jeff Rowe and co-director Kyler Spears and written by Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Rowe, Dan Hernandez, and Benji Samit, “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” keeps the pop culture fixture alive. The film follows the four turtle brothers as they venture out into the world after having been kept hidden while growing up in an effort to be accepted by society. Our critic wrote, “In this movie’s wise deconstruction of its characters, “Mutant Mayhem” does the seemingly impossible and makes the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cool again.”

Release Date: In theaters August 2 via Paramount Pictures.

“Meg 2: The Trench”

Jason Stratham takes on a giant shark again in “Meg 2: The Trench.” “Free Fire” and “High Rise” director Ben Wheatley steps in for the sequel as Stratham’s Jonas Taylor leads a research team into the ocean’s depths. The result is a mission that forces them into a survival game against prehistoric sharks. The film stars Wu Jing, Sophia Cai, Page Kennedy, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, Skyler Samuels, and Cliff Curtis (read our review).v

Release Date: In theaters August 4 via Warner Bros. Pictures.

“Shortcomings”

Actor Randall Park makes the jump to director in his debut feature film “Shortcomings” starring Justin H. Min (“After Yang”), Ally Maki (“Hacks”), and Sherry Cola (“Joy Ride.”) The film based on the graphic novel by Adrian Tomine, follows three individuals as they navigate their relationships, their own egos, and the ability to find connections in the modern day. The film premiered at this year’s Sundance, where our critic wrote, “‘Shortcomings’ is an accomplished debut, a profoundly perceptive movie that challenges the status-quo in small, rewarding ways.

Release Date: In theaters August 4 via Sony Pictures Classics.

“Passages”

The recently rated NC-17 “Passages” made a splash at its Sundance debut earlier this year. Directed by Ira Sachs (“Little Men,” “Love is Strange”) and starring the formidable acting trio of Franz Rogowski, Ben Whishaw, and Adèle Exarchopoulos, the film follows what happens when one half of a long-term couple — played by Rogowski and Whishaw — has an affair with a woman, played by Exarchopoulos. Our critic praised the film, writing, “Adroit casting, writing, editing, performing and costuming shade the outline of an affair to a finely sharpened emotional realism, the cycles of fighting and reconciling we’ve all seen before regaining in rawness as if we’re now the ones living through it.”

2023-09-09 19:36:52+00:00,‘Finestkind’ Review: Family Tensions Come To The Surface In Brian Helgeland’s Multi-Purpose Boston Drama – Toronto Film Festival,‘Finestkind’ Review: Family Tensions Come To The Surface In Brian Helgeland’s Multi-Purpose Boston Drama,"For an hour, Finestkind is the kind of movie they don’t make any more, and just when you’re starting to adapt to its gentle, circadian rhythms (which is about halfway through), it becomes the kind of movie they make all the time. Though it just about works, it’s a curious hybrid of emotional felladrama and gangster realism, something writer Brian Helgeland has essayed before, notably with his script for Clint Eastwood’s Mystic River. A few years back, this could have been a Malpaso production too, and it’s not hard to imagine Eastwood in the role played here by Tommy Lee Jones, an awards-friendly supporting role that gives the veteran actor his very own mini-Gran Torino.

It opens in Buzzards Bay, the port in Boston’s New Bedford area, where middle-aged sea captain Tom (Ben Foster) is making plans for a fishing trip on his company’s boat, the Harmony, which has seen better days. He is interrupted by a surprise visit from his much younger half-brother Charlie (Toby Wallace), who recently graduated from high-school. The two men share a mother, and that’s about all. Tom is a serious fisherman, while Charlie is simply looking for some adventure, in his last summer of freedom before he takes his place at a prestigious local law school on the first stop to adulthood. This wish is granted, before the film has even really started, when the Harmony catches fire and its crew members have to be rescued by helicopter in a dramatic air-sea rescue.

RELATED: ‘Finestkind’: First Look At Brian Helgeland’s Crime Thriller Starring Jenna Ortega, Tommy Lee Jones & Ben Foster

Tom and Charlie are chalk and cheese, and they’ve been cast accordingly: Foster’s tough but vulnerable, God’s-lonely-man persona is very much a given, while Wallace, who seemed much too nice to be a punk legend in Danny Boyle’s mini-series Pistol, offsets Foster’s brooding with a naïve freshman charm (“He kinda looks like Justin Bieber,” say the crew, before shaving his boyish locks off with a pair of clippers). After making it back to dry land, the sailors head to Rasputin’s dive bar, where Charlie is confronted by his father, who couldn’t be more out of place in his suit and tie. It seems that Tom’s mother traded up when she divorced his father, the Texas seadog Ray (Jones), and Charlie’s old man, a lawyer, wants the boy to finish his education and join his law firm as a clerk.

For a while, this looks to be the crux of the movie, a story of fathers and sons that takes place within a rather broad study of class in modern-day America. This blue-collar/white-collar divide is heightened when Charlie falls for Mabel (Jenna Ortega), the sparky daughter of a local drug dealer. Mabel exists largely as a counterpoint to the Rich Man, Poor Man saga that is playing out, and the film is all the better for it. She also sets up the scenario for the second half of the movie: having lost ownership of his father’s boat — called Finestkind, as per the title — after an illegal foray into Canadian waters, Tom gets involved with a gang of heroin smugglers for a one-time-only deal that will raise the $100k fine to get the boat out of police custody. This Tom must do because Ray has terminal stomach cancer, and he’s running out of time (“The boat’s my hospice”).

It’s a welcome change of pace and comes just at a time when the film’s totally straight and unironic storytelling seems to be headed down a cul-de-sac of fraternal bickering (“This isn’t your life, it’s my life,” Tom tells Charlie. “You’re a fucking tourist.”) Jones, whose imposing presence is used sparingly to begin with, now becomes more of a central figure, and his father-son spats with Tom adds a new level of tension. The introduction of drug dealer Pete Weeks (Clayne Crawford), whose sarcastic, no-f*cks-given demeanor is, likewise, a respite from the already well established yin and yang of Tom and Charlie.

The two halves don’t fit entirely snugly, and Helgeland tries to fix that with a coda that undoes a lot of the subtlety employed in the freewheeling first section and leaves some serious loose ends hanging from the second. The title, by the way, is Boston slang, a word that Charlie soon finds out can mean anything.

“It’s the Swiss Army knife of words,” shrugs Tom, and the same metaphor can be invoked for Helgeland’s film, an ambitious attempt to combine serious adult issues with satisfying thriller conventions: the parts work by themselves, but you don’t need them all once, just as you don’t need a corkscrew, a bottle opener and a horse’s hoof cleaner when all you really want is a sharp, clean blade.

2023-08-18 10:00:00+00:00,'The Monkey King' review: Fantasy with a frustrating hero,"Netflix's ""The Monkey King"" adapts a portion of the epic Chinese novel ""Journey to the West,"" with mixed results.","Spanning the deepest depths of the ocean to the farthest reaches of the universe, Netflix's The Monkey King has scope and style to spare.

Director Anthony Stacchi's animated epic adapts a portion of the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, attributed to author Wu Cheng'en. Journey to the West is no stranger to adaptations — The Monkey King's own executive producer Stephen Chow directed 2013's Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons. However, The Monkey King's take on the story is aimed more at younger viewers — and with its Netflix release, it will likely introduce the legend of the Monkey King to worldwide audiences who may be less familiar with the character (myself included).

That introduction winds up being a double-edged sword, because while the film boasts impressive world-building and some standout characters, its protagonist's arrogance and unwillingness to change are tough pills to swallow.

What is The Monkey King about?

The Monkey King catapults us into a world where gods and demons reign supreme. However, one small monkey (voiced by Jimmy O. Yang) is about to upset the status quo in a big way. Hatched from a rock and boasting the ability to shoot lasers from his eyes, this monkey is immediately labeled an outsider by the rest of monkeykind. To prove himself to them — and more importantly, to the Immortal Ones — the self-titled Monkey King sets off on a quest to defeat 100 demons, all with the help of his trusty fighting Stick (voiced by Nan Li).

Monkey King's quest for greatness leads him from hell to heaven, with a few pit stops along the way. He'll make an ally in peasant girl Lin (voiced Jolie Hoang-Rappaport), who wants to do great things in the world and save her village. However, he'll also earn his fair share of enemies. Chief among them is the Dragon King (voiced by Bowen Yang), a slippery showman who doesn't take kindly to Monkey King stealing Stick from his undersea kingdom.

Bowen Yang's Dragon King steals the show.

The Monkey King may be a Netflix movie, but the Dragon King is reminiscent of the best Disney villains. Following in the steps of original underwater baddie Ursula, Dragon King takes center stage as soon as he swims into frame. Blessed with flashy character design and two Flotsam and Jetsam-esque henchmen, Dragon King possesses all the pizzazz needed to make a memorable first impression. Yet he still maintains an undercurrent of menace thanks to his desire to send all land-dwellers to a watery grave.

Much of the Dragon King's charm comes from Yang's vocal performance, which shifts from aggravated ruler doling out orders to gleeful villain singing about world domination. He crushes the Dragon King's showstopping musical number — an instant highlight of the movie — and still has time for an extended gag about the Dragon King's need to moisturize on dry land. Any villain who pairs evil flair with skin care is an instant delight in my book.

The Dragon King is just one of The Monkey King's many great joys, with others including the film's many intricately choreographed fight scenes. One early demon-slaying montage stands out, animated in a painterly style reminiscent of Chinese brushwork. Stick in particular adds an extra element of fun to these sequences. Not content with letting it just be a weapon, The Monkey King constantly finds new ways to incorporate Stick's formidable powers into the action, turning it into a flying device, a convenient doorstop, and more. It's a welcome touch of dynamism for the film, and a much-needed one given Monkey King's own frustrating refusal to change.

Monkey King threatens to bring down The Monkey King.

Shunned by the other monkeys he meets, Monkey King bases his sense of self on his fighting prowess, resulting in a majorly inflated ego. Arrogant, brash, and ignorant of others' feelings, he's the pinnacle of self-obsession. In theory, these character flaws make for a great jumping off point for a redemption arc and a lesson on the dangers of egotism. However, The Monkey King fails to engage with that kind of arc in a meaningful way.

Any time Monkey King faces a teachable moment, such as when Lin tells him about the troubles her village is facing, he takes it as an opportunity to double down on his own goals. At times, The Monkey King tries to tell us that he's changed, that he cares about people other than himself. But the evidence for this is flimsy, culminating in a climax that (purposefully) sees all of Monkey King's worst qualities come to life.

Granted, this is in keeping with the original content of Journey to the West, as is the film's too-hasty resolution, which sees some truly crucial Monkey King development pushed offscreen. Notably, The Monkey King opens with Buddha (voiced by BD Wong) telling the Jade Emperor (Hoon Lee) that Monkey King has a great destiny. However, by the end of the film, that destiny is only just kicking off, leaving room for a sequel that would continue Monkey King's story, along with the rest of Journey to the West. Setting up a sequel is all fine and dandy, but given Buddha's assertion about the Monkey King's future right at the start of the film, ending on that note feels like much of The Monkey King's potential has been left unfulfilled. The film reads less like a self-contained story than it does a feature-length prologue.

Don't get me wrong, there is still so much to love about The Monkey King. But your mileage on the film may vary based on how willing you are to look past its frustrating lead.

2023-09-09 21:36:02+00:00,‘Holly’ Review: A Curious And Clever Film About A Mysterious Girl Who May Have Otherworldly Powers – Venice Film Festival,Fien Troch’s film shares an initial premise with any number of films about mysterious powers brewing inside adolescent girls - Carrie being only the most obvious.,"Holly rings her school to tell them she is staying at home. She isn’t sick. She just can’t bring herself to go. “Bad things are going to happen today,” she says just above a whisper, her voice cracking.

But bad things happen to Holly most days; she is bullied constantly, little jibes from girls who say she smells or classmates who go through elaborate efforts not to touch “the witch,” as they call her. It is hard to see why. The central character in Holly (newcomer Cathalina Geeraerts, who impresses even in her silence) is just the designated victim, as she will soon become a designated savior. Two ends of the same straw, each tormenting in their own way.

She is right about that bad day. A fire breaks out in the school. Ten people die. In the face of such heartbreak, there is not much discussion of the strange phone call from the school wallflower, but at least one teacher wonders about it.

Anna (Greet Verstraete) is a candles and essential oils kind of person. She has her own reasons for wanting to find a source of hope and help, but she doesn’t see herself as self-seeking. When she ropes Holly into helping host a picnic for the bereaved parents several months after the fire, she believes she is bringing this ostracized girl in from the cold.

She sees smiles spread across the drawn faces of these sad adults when she approaches with trays of sandwiches. She holds their hands. Many hug her. There is something special there, Anna tells her partner.

Belgian director Fien Troch’s film, screening in competition at the Venice Film Festival, shares an initial premise with any number of films about mysterious powers brewing inside adolescent girls – Carrie being only the most obvious – but it has none of their DNA. Shot with flat realism of a piece with the drab school interiors and shopping malls where it is set, Holly is just as downbeat about its subject.

When news spreads of Holly’s helping powers, the most she is asked to do is lay her hands on sick children. There are no magical movements of objects, no demonic possession. If she has some kind of second sight, as evidenced on the terrible fire day, she can’t call it up at will. When people who think she connects with the beyond ask her what happens when people die, she looks away vaguely. “They go to heaven, I think,” she says. Her one demonstrable power is empathy. Arguably, that could be true of anybody.

What is undoubtedly true is that Holly comes from nothing. In an early scene, she is shown in her family kitchen, looking in the fridge for something to eat. There is not much beyond a couple of blackened bananas. Her mother (Els Deceukelier) lies on the couch in a mess of blankets, numbed by television. As she tells the school counsellor, Holly’s only friends are her sister Dawn (Maya Louisa Sterkendries), whose no-nonsense toughness keeps the bullies at bay – at least when she is around – and Bart (Felix Heremans), a neuro-divergent boy whose literal interpretation of the world doesn’t include witchcraft.

In a sense, however, he is her first initiate. Bart is inclined to shouting and kicking walls, but he will spend quiet hours with Holly, lying on her bed with his head on her knee or picking over racks of trashy jewelery with her on their afternoon wanders through town. It’s cheap, but not cheap enough for them to buy.

Some people pay her for whatever help she brings. At first she refuses. When she starts to take the money – she can buy new shoes, a cool puffer jacket that she proceeds to wear in all weathers – the film moves into new territory, posing questions about what genuine help is. Can it only be pure, untouched by filthy lucre? How pure is the desire for a supernatural helping hand in the first place?

Holly is just a young girl. She clearly shares their beliefs, as all shamans must believe in their own spells. It gives her purpose, but those who want to depend on her also want to blame her. Troch lets these shades of experience rise to the surface slowly. Very slowly, in fact. Those colors are never allowed to form a defined picture of what exactly is going on; Holly’s gift, like the girl herself, remains elusively unreadable to the end.

A curious, clever film, Holly is Carrie seen from the other side of the mirror, those magic hands by her sides, looking at her own image and wondering who she is.

2023-08-16 12:30:00+00:00,"Blue Beetle's Xolo Maridueña on New DC Universe, Cobra Kai Season 6","'Blue Beetle' star Xolo Maridueña discusses playing Jaime Reyes in the new superhero film, the future of the DC Universe, and 'Cobra Kai' ending with Season 6.","This interview was conducted prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike.
XOLO MARIDUEÑA KNOWS the stakes. Leading a superhero movie comes with high expectations from fans and critics alike, and now that he’s getting ready to lead Blue Beetle—the latest big screen expansion of the DC Comics universe from Warner Bros.—he’s staring them straight in the eyes. He knows that everyone watching the movie wants the same thing: a smart adaptation of the stories told and worlds depicted in the comic book medium, capturing the colorful pages where these characters originated and, at their best, even transcending that and creating something greater. While decades have passed since the first superhero movies premiered, studios still struggle to reach the bar that their on-page counterparts and high-watermark films like The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 2 have set through the years. Add in the extra pressure that comes along with being the first major Latino superhero depicted on-screen—somehow it’s taken until 2023 for this to happen!— and it’s clear that Blue Beetle has a lot riding on its success.
“It’s not a lie that if this doesn't do well, this type of movie isn't going to happen again for a while,” Maridueña says. “It's important to open those doors. It's not just for Blue Beetle— it's for the tons of other superheroes, and cultures, and stories that we need to tell.”
Blue Beetle will be one of the first DC films to be released since James Gunn and Peter Safran came together as new co-CEOs under the Warner Bros. umbrella in 2022 to helm DC Studios, a move made with the hopes of potentially rivaling the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s interconnected movie and television franchise. While the film was announced before the change in DC Studios’ leadership, Gunn stated back in January that it “will directly lead” into the newly-curated slate of upcoming DC films. Blue Beetle, in turn, stands as a potential early building block to help DC Studios’ reinvention. The film’s success could mark a new cinematic tone for DC, standing to possibly deviate from the visually dark, serious tone established in the last regime’s DCEU, moving toward a style more focused on grounded storytelling and a generally light and truly comic book-y tone.

First introduced in 2006, Jaime Reyes—who Maridueña plays in the film—is the third iteration of the Blue Beetle, and the first non-white character to take on the mantle (a previous version of Blue Beetle, a businessman named Ted Kord, also figures into Blue Beetle’s story). Jaime gains his powers from a mysterious blue scarab, which is bound to his spine and acts somewhat autonomously of his wishes, determined to protect him at all costs. It’s the first time the character has gotten the silver screen treatment.
As the first major Latino superhero to be depicted on the big screen (the film also serves as his first major movie role), Maridueña recognizes the importance. He knows he stands on the shoulders of those who came before him, and says he feels “privileged” to represent Jaime and play a Latino superhero. But he makes it clear that the film isn’t trying to show every Latino experience. “It’s impossible to encapsulate a whole culture in one movie— that's not really the point,” he says. “Inherently, because of our writer, [Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer], the characters we're looking at, the director, [Angel Manuel Soto], and the actors involved, it'll be Latino.”
Growing up, Maridueña wasn’t actually a huge fan of comics. In fact, he’s always preferred to read graphic novels like , , and . His mother was into comics, though, and her interest eventually trickled into becoming his as well. He learned of the Jaime Reyes version of Blue Beetle in his preteens, before he even really wanted to be an actor. He later heard through the industry grapevine that a Blue Beetle movie was in talks to be made. Instantly, he felt the on-screen potential.

“At that point, I was maybe 12 or 13. I was way too young,” he says. “And I'm like, ‘No, this is never going to happen.’ But luckily, I had gotten around to watching Young Justice, which Blue Beetle makes an appearance in. That's when I finally ended up getting close to understanding ‘Oh, maybe this project is happening.’”
It took a few years—and proving his chops in major shows including Parenthood, Twin Peaks, and his most well-known project to date, Cobra Kai—but Maridueña eventually landed the role of Jaime. When he thinks back on the moment he learned he got the part, he says it felt like he was being “Ashton Kutcher Punk’d.” Maridueña thought the former head of DC Studios, Walter Hamada, had invited him to a one-on-one dinner. But there was a bit more company on the guest list.

“[It] ended up turning into a one-on-eight dinner with everyone from production on Blue Beetle. The director, Angel Manuel Soto, surprised me. He just popped the question right there,” he says with a smile.
The wildest part of the casting news for Maridueña? Knowing no one knew about it but him. “I just remember thinking, ‘Oh my gosh, my mom doesn't know about this, like nobody [knows].’ I'm like, ‘I know a secret. I know something that other people don't.’”
From there, it was only four months between his casting and the start of filming. And rather than sitting at home waiting to show up on set, Maridueña had no choice but to keep busy. He found out about Blue Beetle just a week before filming began for Season 5 of Cobra Kai, and right away began training for the [so far] role of a lifetime.
Blue Beetle was the first project that required Maridueña to gain weight. His training for Cobra Kai focused on stamina and stretching, performing kicks and various moves without appearing to exert too much energy. “With [Blue Beetle],” he says, “there was an added strength, and an added amount of weight that I needed to put on for the suit and to make sure that my body could handle what it would be like to be in a suit and move around.”

Welcoming in Jaime Reyes, however, also means saying goodbye to one of Maridueña’s formative roles: Miguel on Cobra Kai. On The Karate Kid spinoff series, he pays an asthmatic kid who becomes determined to be the best karate fighter he can be, yes, but also, as anyone who watches the show will tell you, just seems like a great kid. Over the show’s five seasons to date, viewers watched as Miguel gained confidence as a fighter and came into his own, essentially taking over the moniker of ‘The Karate Kid’ from Daniel LaRusso (played by Ralph Macchio).
As Miguel has grown in confidence and ability within the show, so too has Maridueña grown as an actor; he was only 16 when it began. Now, as Cobra Kai nears an end with its sixth season, he can’t help but feel nostalgic. “It's not often that you get to work with people for six years and don't want to bite their heads off,” he says. “It's been such a fun ride. I really grew up with this show, and grew up with this character, and it feels very fitting for it to come to a close here.”
Although Maridueña is one of Cobra Kai’s most impressive karate fighters, he still found the training for Blue Beetle to be far more of a challenge; the movie got him into the best shape he’s ever been in. He played sports growing up, but never had interest in weightlifting. In preparing for the movie, he was required to become more disciplined in his regimen, with the film’s crew teaching him how to eat right and exercise to have a fit physique, while still looking—realistically—like a recent college grad who suddenly gained otherworldly powers.
Post-Blue Beetle, Maridueña imagines Jaime’s future appearances in the new DC universe could mean potential team-ups with major superheroes.

Gunn and Safran’s DCU has already announced an initial slate of projects, led by the Gunn-written and directed Superman: Legacy, scheduled for release in 2025. But beyond that, anything could be on the table, including a future for Jaime Reyes and the Blue Beetle. Maridueña has imagined his character’s dynamic in this new world: “Blue Beetle in the comics has hung around Batman and Peacemaker,” he says. “Jaime feels like an adult to his world, but you put him next to a Batman or a Superman, and he's a kid for sure.” Could Maridueña’s Jaime share the screen with John Cena’s Peacemaker? The superhero sparks would certainly fly.
Blue Beetle is just the start of Maridueña’s adult acting career, a new chapter he hopes will be part of “a long book.” With Blue Beetle and Cobra Kai, he played hopeful, likable young adults. But in the future, Maridueña wants to challenge himself and potentially step outside of his comfort zone. His goal for now is to work with new people, and let himself be surprised by what comes next.
“I could have never imagined Cobra Kai. I could have never seen myself in that role. I've never seen myself in a superhero freaking role,” he says, still incredulous at the career he’s begun to embark upon. “I've been very blessed to have people around me that see things in me that maybe I don't. So I'll stay on the lookout.”

2023-08-18 09:00:00+00:00,'Blue Beetle' director Angel Manuel Soto celebrates Latine culture by putting it front and center,Interview with 'Blue Beetle' director Angel Manuel Soto on how the superhero movie puts Latine influences front and center.,"The new cinematic adaptation of DC's Blue Beetle is making history. After decades of superhero movies, Blue Beetle is the first live-action standalone film where both the lead character and the actor who plays him are Latine, as are the majority of the supporting cast and the creative talent behind the camera.
Puerto Rican director Angel Manuel Soto (Charm City Kings) and Mexican writer Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer (Miss Bala) have packed Blue Beetle with love and affection for Latine culture. It's felt in every old-school Spanish language TV reference and Mexican pop song, in untranslated terms of affection and a deeply familiar backstory. Simply put, there's no ignoring us in this film.
Almost immediately, Blue Beetle begins with a family reunion. Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) returns home from college to many excited hugs and kisses on cheeks from his family – his skeptical sister Milagro (Belissa Escobedo), his wise papa Alberto (Damián Alcázar), doting mama Rocio (Elpidia Carrillo), adoring Nana (Adriana Barraza), and eccentric Uncle Rudy (George Lopez), who maybe spends too much time online reading conspiracy theories and making his own inventions. Over the course of the movie, Blue Beetle becomes a family affair, with each member playing an important role in Jaime's heroic journey.
In an interview with Mashable, Soto shared how he incorporated beloved Latine cultural references from the entertainment grew up with and his own family.
Soto was thrilled at the chance to develop the Reyes family for the big screen, and he recognized the significance of making a Latine character the hero of his own story. ""We didn't want to miss the opportunity when we were doing this film – [not only are] the characters in the movie are Latino, these actors are playing versions of themselves,"" Soto said. ""I felt like a lot of our stories have never given us the opportunity to tell how we got to the place where we are. We're so used to being a stereotype without giving us the opportunity to defend ourselves.""

That approach extends to Blue Beetle's villain, Carapax (Raoul Max Trujillo), who gets his own backstory rooted in the United State's bloody interventions in Central America and the infamous School of the Americas , a place notorious for training military leaders and dictators in Latin America. ""I wanted to explore the reasons why some people might become villains, especially when they're not born that way,"" Soto said. ""It is easy to forget about the past and focus on the present, especially when it comes to Latinos.""
Another aspect of the film that was drawn from the creative team's lived experience is the Reyes' many references to other shows and movies Latine audiences may recognize. For example, when Jaime develops a crush on the heir to the multinational Kord Industries, Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine), his family teases him that he's like the poor lead character in the telenovela María la del Barrio , which his Nana watches in the movie.
Soto said that kind of inclusion came naturally to his team. ""'What did our grandmother watch?'"" he asked them. ""We just went through flipping channels in our heads, and of course, Sábado Gigante was always on, or María la del Barrio, or El Chapulín Colorado . I couldn't miss it."" Soto also references movies like Guillermo del Toro's Cronos and Roberto Gavaldón's Macario, the classic Mexican horror film that he said introduced him to magical realism. ""We really wanted to [pay tribute] to the people that came before us the same way that the movie celebrates our families and their journeys,"" he said.

In between dramatic super-powered fight scenes and tense chase sequences, the calmer moments of a shared family dinner feel realistic as Milagro relentlessly teases Jaime, Rocio worries about her son, and Uncle Rudy rants about one government conspiracy or another. They alternate smoothly between Spanish and English, with Jaime and Milagro more comfortable speaking in English while Nana mostly uses Spanish, echoing the dynamic of many multigenerational immigrant households.
Soto said he made the conscious choice not to translate every single word they speak but made sure the sentiment is felt every time someone in Jaime's family calls him ""flaco"" or ""mijo."" ""If you translate everything when you speak Spanish, then people start getting distracted,"" Soto said. ""Some stuff doesn't need translation, because they're more on the emotional side of things.""
""That's what happens when we are able to be our authentic selves.""
Soto worked on the film's bilingual soundtrack to reflect its characters, creating an eclectic playlist of '80s Mexican pop music, modern day reggaeton, and even some classic hair metal music by way of Mötley Crüe. ""Music is something that has connected Latinos, all around the world, no matter the boundaries, no matter the distance,"" said Soto. ""Everybody in Latin America has heard of Luis Miguel , or everybody has danced to a reggaeton. Or even if you weren't into any of those songs, you had to have heard of Violeta Parra and 'Gracias a la Vida' or dance to Soda Stereo .""
""You have Latinos playing Latinos in a film written by a Latino and directed by [a] Latino, you have the freedom to be yourself,"" said Soto. ""That's what happens when we are able to be our authentic selves.""

,'Blue Beetle' Director Angel Manuel Soto on the DCU's First Latino Superhero and his Political 'Bane' Movie Pitch,Angel Manuel Soto made a breakout superhero movie by breaking all the rules. Inverse goes deep on DC's 'Blue Beetle' with its iconoclastic director.,"There’s a fierce sociopolitical consciousness coursing through Blue Beetle, something most wouldn’t expect from the new superhero romp by DC Studios. Those revolutionary undertones come directly from the mind of its Puerto Rican director Ángel Manuel Soto.
“Superhero movies often are about the banality of who comes up with the most unrealistic thrill ride,” Soto tells Inverse. “But why do we have to sacrifice emotion and depth for fun? Why can't you have a lot of both?”
Ángel runs hot, his publicist says as he arrives for an interview and photo shoot, both politically and physically. Removing an oversized pinstripe jacket, he reveals a custom T-shirt with a photo of the entire Blue Beetle cast printed on the front, a loving tribute to the striking actors who can’t join him on what should be a victory tour. DC’s latest movie was at one time destined for a quiet streaming release. That it’s now playing in IMAX theaters is thanks to its director’s uncompromising vision.
But Soto’s path to Blue Beetle was more winding than straightforward, and it begins in the Santurce neighborhood of San Juan where he grew up.
Although he received formal education in architecture by way of a soccer scholarship, Soto, unable to afford film school, opted for shoplifting books on cinema to teach himself the basics of film as an art form. The son of a politically involved father who advocated for unions, Soto was never keen on abiding by the system’s rules.
Told in the tradition of social realist dramas from Latin America, Soto’s 2015 microbudget debut La Granja centers on a trio of struggling characters in his financially burdened homeland. Among them, there’s a teenage boxer who must win a match to pay his father’s debts. Following a stint working in virtual reality in Los Angeles, Soto landed the Baltimore-set coming-of-age indie Charm City Kings, a movie about a Black boy eager to join his complicated neighborhood’s lively dirt bike scene which premiered at Sundance Film Festival in 2020.
“At first I was hesitant because I didn’t want to Brown-wash Spiderman.”
Now, he’s crossed over into big-budget studio filmmaking to realize the story of Jaime Reyes (played by Xolo Maridueña, of Cobra Kai fame), a Mexican American young man-turned-superhuman overnight when an extraterrestrial device fuses with his body, from a screenplay by Mexican-born writer Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer (Miss Bala). Given Soto’s nontraditional path, stepping into this higher-stakes realm always seemed far-fetched.
“Never in my wildest dream did I think that I would ever be in this place,” Soto says. “I still find it difficult wrapping my head around it.”
Info 1 / 2 PREV NEXT
Before attaching himself to Blue Beetle, Soto had originally pitched DC a Bane origin story. That the burly and gasmask-wearing villain from the Batman universe was born inside a prison on a fictional Caribbean Island offered, in Soto’s mind, an opportunity to discuss the geopolitical conflicts that have afflicted the region for so long.
“I was inspired by what happened with the movie Joker, which taught you about what was happening in America, and how the system creates a villain like that,” Soto says. “That would be a great opportunity to talk about the conflicts of the Caribbean, which has been a pretty unstable region for the past 500 years and nobody really addresses the issue.”
Although he didn’t get as far as to create a casting wish list, Soto was aware that wrestler-turned-actor Dave Bautista had expressed interest in the character. However, since Batman and his foes were already in Matt Reeves’ hands, DC offered Soto Blue Beetle instead.
“If you get to decide how big the explosions are going to be for me, then you cannot tell me how Latino I’m going to be.”
The studio wanted a Latino director to helm its first movie with a Latino protagonist, but Soto didn’t immediately jump at the chance.
“At first I was hesitant because I didn't want to Brown-wash Spiderman,” he says. “I didn't want to fall into the stereotypes: a Latino family where the mom says ‘mija’ twice and they eat tacos, and that’s as Latino as it gets.”
It was the involvement of Dunnet-Alcocer (whose credits include the Oscar-shortlisted short film Contrapelo) that reassured Soto the production wouldn’t try to manufacture a Latino identity, but that it would emerge organically from the core Latino creators.
As far as superhero films go, Blue Beetle falls on the lower-budget end of the spectrum. That’s likely because when Soto joined the project, which had been in development for some time, Warner intended to skip theaters and release it exclusively on streaming.
Rather than clocking the lesser funds as a disadvantage, Soto accepted in exchange for creative freedom.
“If you get to decide how big the explosions are going to be for me, then you cannot tell me how Latino I'm going to be,” he says.
Nevertheless, Soto thought it was telling of how the industry treats Latinos in general that the one time a Latino family would lead a live-action superhero movie, the executives envisioned it solely for online platforms.
“Every superhero movie gets a chance to play on the biggest screen possible,” Soto says. “And the first time you allow a Latino to direct one, you're going to put it into the algorithm so that it gets lost with all your big movies?”
To push the studio to reconsider its release plans, Soto and his team focused on impressive world-building elements. Having a practical Blue Beetle suit in nearly every shot, akin to those in Tokusatsu action films and shows from Japan, was crucial to ground the character for Maridueña in a tangible manner while on set.

By the same token, the narrative played into the trope of the reluctant hero, giving Jaime enough time to initially reject his new reality, and eventually assimilate it. That, Soto believes, reflected a more realistic human reaction to such otherworldly situations than seeing someone immediately ready to take on the role of a valiant paladin.
“I always hated those movies where 15 minutes in the guy's already swinging like a pro,” Soto says. I'm like, There's no way. It would take forever to convince me.”
Despite the unique routes they took with the framework of the superhero movie, James Gunn, the new commander-in-chief for the revamped DC Universe, has enthusiastically stated that Blue Beetle will serve as the foundation of his new live-action universe.
“Why can’t a humble kid from a marginalized community be front and center in a hero movie?”
“It was beautiful being able to do that and see that for James Gunn, this prologue, this first act of our saga is worthy of being canon for his superheroes so that he can embark into new adventures,” says Soto. “I hope that means Blue Beetle is going to partner with other heroes, and I hope that means we get a Blue Beetle 2 and Blue Beetle 3.”
And since this is the introduction to the Blue Beetle saga, Soto and Dunnet-Alcocer weren’t interested in featuring cameos from the household names among heroes. They sought to ensure the Latino protagonist remained the main focus throughout.
“I didn't want the god or the billionaire to come in and take away from his spotlight,” Soto says. “Why can't a humble kid from a marginalized community be front and center in a hero movie?”
Another of Soto’s major contributions entailed shooting in Puerto Rico to both support the economy and work with the friends who helped him make La Granja a decade ago. It also didn’t hurt that the U.S. territory (often referred to as a present-day colony) has a competitive tax incentive to encourage productions to film there. ""I'm sure that if it didn't, we wouldn't have shot there,” Soto says.
Soto painted the landscape of Palmera City, the fictional town where Reyes lives, with the places where he spent his childhood. That included El Morro, a centuries-old citadel built by Spanish colonizers which serves as the backdrop for a pivotal fight.
“As a kid, I always thought, ‘This could be a good place to shoot an action movie or an adventure movie.’” Soto says. “And now 30 years later, I'm coming home to shoot an action set piece in an adventure movie in this 500-year-old fortress. Being able to satisfy that childhood dream was very special for me.”
And since gentrification and all the social ills it breeds for the most underprivileged represent a daily battle for locals in Puerto Rico, it’s also present in Blue Beetle. Soto and Dunnet-Alcocer didn’t want the Reyes family to be detached from the issues that threatened Latino communities in our reality, such as the displacement that the notion of “progress” in the eyes of corporations promotes and deportation. A sequence where Kord henchmen storm the Reyes home resembles a violent immigration raid.
“That whole idea of home insecurity is probably the biggest fear that I've always had growing up,” Soto says. “It wasn't an alien invasion, it was being displaced and removed from my home.”

Soto added further realism by making Conrad Carapax (one of the movie’s villains played by Raoul Max Trujillo) an alum of the School of the Americas, an actual center where, for decades, the U.S. military trained Latin American soldiers to carry out horrific acts on behalf in their home countries. The aim was to impose puppet dictatorships across the region, exploit resources, spread neoliberalism, and protect the interests of private companies.
“I kept hearing ignorant voices talking about Latin America as if we did everything to ourselves,” he says. “As if we are where we are because we are bad managers, and nobody wants to talk about the [U.S.] interventionism that took place.”
“I wanted everybody watching to get a smell of what it’s like to live in our state of mind of nostalgia.”
Most importantly, Soto hopes not to perpetuate Hollywood’s depiction of Latinos as simplistically evil criminals with no moral compass. Even if Carapax commits atrocious acts, he’s the product of the weaponization of trauma inflicted at an infamous institution. When we finally get to learn Carapax’s story, Soto tells it backward as if peeling the layers to get to the root of his sorrow and intercuts it with archival footage of the actual School of the Americas.
Executives at the studio were shocked by this “school” when Soto provided historical context. But the director claims it was those thoughtful references and emotional layers present in his and Dunnet-Alcocer’s take on Blue Beetle that convinced Warner to give it a theatrical release.
“They thought we made it up,” Soto recalls. “The studio had no idea that this was real. Until we school them and they were like, ‘Oh sh*t, this is f*cked up.’”
But not all the movie’s references are as serious. Soto also populated his largest canvas yet with Latino pop culture, such as a brief animated homage to El Chapulín Colorado, a clumsy superhero from a 1970s Mexican comedy series clad in a red and yellow costume; or a clip from Guillermo del Toro’s Cronos, whose ancient golden scarab doesn’t look too dissimilar to the device that transforms Jaime’s body.
“Giving nods to the films that we love and to the music we grew up with is a way of honoring the legacy that our parents left us, too,” Soto says. “I wanted everybody watching to get a smell of what it's like to live in our state of mind of nostalgia.”
As distinct in scope and setting as Soto’s three features to date are, they all center on young men from disadvantaged backgrounds seeking a way out of their circumstances and getting caught up in dangers beyond their grasp. Undoubtedly, the director recognizes himself in all of them, including Jaime Reyes. For Soto, taking on Blue Beetle and coming out on the other end not with corporate sludge as a result but a shiny popcorn flick with depth and above all a sense of authenticity, is a triumph he’ll cherish for years to come.
“It hasn't sunk in yet that a kid from the streets of Santurce, who stole books because he couldn't afford film school, made a superhero movie,” he said. “What a beautiful world we’d live in if the universality of the specificities that make us special become mainstream.”

2023-08-21 15:00:52+00:00,"Blue Beetle Director On The Film's Cultural Specificity, Real-World Allusions, And More [Exclusive Interview]",Blue Beetle director Ángel Manuel Soto tells us about real-world allusions in his DC superhero film and leaning into the specificity of cultural references.,"Speaking of Carapax, his story is fascinating in that it brings in the real history of the School of the Americas. Can you talk about the decision to bring in that part of the story?
To me, it was important to explore that in Hollywood, Latinos are always introduced in the middle of the paragraph. We enter a scene and we're gangsters and narcos, we are violent and dishonest people, and no one questions why that is. And when a movie or a show explains why, it just says that we are like that because that's our nature. So, we've never been given the chance to explore the history of blood behind the violent behaviors in Latin America. And, come on, you don't have to be a rocket scientist or an erudite to do a simple Google search and learn about Yankee interventionism, and why that interventionism started in 1954 to protect the American [United] Fruit Company in Guatemala.
It was important for me to be able to show this villain who is not just Latino, but indigenous, and show why he is the way he is to a certain point. Because even though he is responsible for much of his actions, the reason why he is a villain is because his trauma was weaponized. And when you see it, you understand he is a victim of the endless perpetuating of violence in Latin America by the CIA through the School of the Americas, but no one talks about that. No one talks about the start of neoliberalism in the School of the Americas in 1973 with the murder of Allende and the placement of Pinochet.
It was important that the film reflected that reality that is not taught at school. It is why Susan [Sarandon's character] represents the Military Industrial Complex, and the rampant imperialism that exists in Latin America. She is a person that has been perpetrating trauma, and then using that trauma like the School of the Americas, which trained the locals so they'd invade their own people. There is nothing more nefarious than that, so it was important to me to have that exist in this movie, if only for a minute. Using fantasy to raise curiosity could help us be better informed and more emphatic.
When I joined the project, I wanted the movie to be somewhat anchored in realism, in real traumas that Latin America has experienced historically. But I wanted it to be recent, not to just go all the way back to Columbus, though we do tumble a statue of Columbus in the movie. We talk about the more recent and relevant history, the one that is not talked about, but should be remembered so it is not repeated.
And the name is a bit ridiculous, and some people may not realize this is actual history, so we intercut Carapax's flashbacks with archival footage of the School of the Americas to make it clear this is real.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTM2OTg3Ni9ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1kaXJlY3Rvci1jdWx0dXJhbC1zcGVjaWZpY2l0eS1leGNsdXNpdmUtaW50ZXJ2aWV3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

Barbie
Warner Bros.’ comedy declines only -36% to $21.5M, finally notching the runner-up slot after spending four frames in first place.
All time, Barbie has now earned the:
With $567.2M total through 31 days, it now ranks as the #15 biggest movie of all time, between April’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie with $574.2M and 2019’s The Lion King with $543.6M.
Barbie also ranks #2 of the year so far, behind only Mario. However, it’s running +12% ahead of Mario through the equivalent 31-day point in release: $503.7M.
Oppenheimer
Universal’s historical war drama declines only -43% to $10.6M, falling from second to third place.
All time, Oppenheimer has earned:
Opening weekend outside the top 100: $82.4M
Fifth frame once again falling outside the top 100: $10.6M
With $285.2M total through 31 days, it now stands as the #117 biggest movie of all time domestically, ranking between 1990’s Home Alone with $285.7M and 2015’s The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 with $281.7M.
It also stands as the #7 biggest R-rated movie of all time domestically, between 2018’s Deadpool 2 with $324.5M and 2003’s The Matrix Reloaded with $281.5M.
Depending on how it holds, Oppenheimer stands a shot at finishing among the top five R-rated film, with a small shot at #1. Currently, that mark has been held for 19 years by 2004’s The Passion of the Christ: $370.7M.
Here’s how Oppenheimer compares to the top five R-rated films ever, through the equivalent 31-day point in wide release:
-6% behind 2004’s The Passion of the Christ : $305.6M -13% behind 2016’s Deadpool : $328.2M -13% behind 2014’s American Sniper : also $328.2M -3% behind 2019’s Joker : $299.1M -6% behind 2017’s It : $305.2M
Oppenheimer is also poised to become writer-director Christopher Nolan’s biggest (non-Batman) film. Here’s how Oppenheimer compares to his other biggest original titles:
+14% above 2010’s Inception , through the equivalent point in release: $248.4M / only -2% behind its final total: $292.5M
+51% and counting above the final total for 2014’s Interstellar : $188.0M
+50% and counting above the final total for 2017’s Dunkirk : $190.0M
Last Wednesday, Oppenheimer also set another unusual record: highest-grossing film to never top a weekend box office.
It beat the prior record holder, 2016’s Sing with $270.3M, which peaked at #2 behind Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.
Overseas / global
This weekend, Oppenheimer declined -38% overseas, milder than its -44% domestic drop.
Oppenheimer has earned $432.6M overseas and $717.8M globally.
That beats Dunkirk globally with $530M and Interstellar with $648M, and is right on the verge of surpassing Inception with $728M, likely later this week.
Globally, it’s now the #132 film of all time, ranking between 2021’s F9 with $726.2M and Nolan’s Interstellar with $715.7M.
Top overseas markets totals are:
U.K.: $63.8M Germany: $39.5M France: $31.2M Australia: $22.9M India: $18.4M Spain: $18.3M Mexico: $18.0M Netherlands: $16.1M South Korea: $12.6M Brazil: $12.5M
Later this month, the film will debut in key markets including China and Italy.
IMAX
Oppenheimer has earned $80.8M domestically and $146.4M globally from IMAX, the #4 domestic and #5 global IMAX total of all time.
Globally, it only trails 2009’s Avatar, 2022’s Avatar: The Way of Water, 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and 2019’s Avengers: Endgame.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem
In its third frame, Paramount’s animated action comedy reboot declines -45% to $8.4M, falling from third to fourth place.
After a midweek Wednesday debut, Mayhem has earned $88.1M after 19 days. It’s already outgrossed two of the last three films in the franchise:
+7% and counting above the final total for 2016’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows – $82.0M
+62% and counting above the final total for 2007’s TMNT : $54.1M
However, it’s running below both the franchise’s 2014 installment and another comparable title, through the equivalent 19-day point in release:
-40% below 2014’s hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : $148.4M
-23% below 2018’s similar animation style Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse – $114.3M
Overseas / global
This weekend, Mayhem declined -52% overseas in holdover markets, slightly steeper than its -45% domestic drop.
Mayhem has now earned $30.3M overseas and $118.4M globally.
It looks certain not to reach the $485M global total for 2014’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but could still match the $245M global total for 2016’s Out of the Shadows.
Top overseas markets are:
U.K.: $9.0M Mexico: $5.0M France: $3.2M Germany: $2.0M
Last weekend, the film opened with less than $1M in China, only eighth place in that market.
Later this month and next, the film will debut in key markets including Spain, Brazil, Australia, South Korea, and Japan.

It also opened below some of this year’s other R-rated comedies:
-44% below June’s No Hard Feelings : $15.0M
Even with February’s Magic Mike’s Last Dance : $8.3M
However, it did open +43% above July’s Joy Ride: $5.8M
Audience demographics
Strays earned a “B+” CinemaScore, from an audience estimated at 56% male, 67% ages 25+, and only 46% white.
Overseas / global
Strays opened in a limited 21 overseas markets to $1.9M, for a $10.2M global opening.
While it’s not an exact comparison because of the wider rollout, Feelings opened to $9.5M overseas in 48 markets, for a $24.5M global opening.

2023-08-11 17:23:27+00:00,'Blue Beetle' Director Angel Manuel Soto on Rolling Solo Without His Stars,"""Blue Beetle director Angel Manuel Soto is having his moment rolling solo during the film's promo tour, although he wishes he had his actors.","“Blue Beetle director Angel Manuel Soto is rolling solo during his film’s promotional tour and he wishes he was sharing the moment with his stars amid the double strikes. “It’s unfortunate that the strike happened right before we started promoting the movie,” Soto told TheWrap in an interview during the film’s promo stop in Dallas.
Of course, everybody would love for it to happen after the movie premieres, so that at least our actors have the time to shine and to be celebrated and see how most people are connecting with their stories,” Soto continued. “A lot of these young kids that are watching the movie see themselves represented in them [the characters] because it’s a beautiful experience I’ve been able to witness.”
The Boricua filmmaker from Santurce, Puerto Rico still has stops to make in Miami, Toronto, and New York before the film’s gala premiere in Los Angeles next week.
Soto is also aware how the strikes this month are having a profound effect on films made by filmmakers of color.
“We all can agree that [the strikes] affect disproportionately to minorities,” Soto said. “At the same time, I have nothing [but] respect and support for my actors who are fighting the good fight, and our writer too. They’re fighting the good fight for better pay, for better treatment, so that the money is better distributed between the people [who] are creating this content.”
“Blue Beetle” tells the story of Jaime Reyes (Xolo Mariduena), a young man who becomes a reluctant superhero when he acquires a mysterious object known as the Scarab.
When DC’s latest comic book movie hits theaters on Aug. 18, it will be the first superhero feature starring, written and directed by Latinos on the big screen. This event has the potential to be what “Black Panther” was for Black audiences and “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” was for AAPI viewers: a celebration of a film representing marginalized audiences in a Hollywood landscape that remains remarkably white.
Soto knows that for many of his actors they are are sacrificing this unique opportunity.
“They’re sacrificing it for the greater good at the end of the day,” Soto said. “So for me, they’re heroes in their own right.”
His actors would have wanted nothing more than to be alongside him promoting the movie, according to Soto. “So I hope their sacrifice is not in vain,” Soto said. “I hope everything concludes quickly because we want them to enjoy this moment. I also want them to help me out a little bit.”
Soto might be front facing for the promo tour, but he is also getting a lot of help from the film’s outdoor promotion, where the poster and imagery are plastered on billboards, bus stops and train stations, a first for a superhero film centered around a Latino.
“I’m very happy that finally we’re able to see how the whole promotion is being manifested,” Soto said. “Us seeing a Latino superhero of our own in Times Square is something that, if were think about it, is that even possible? Now it’s happening!”
“Being able to not only be promoted in the areas where our community transmits, but to also be up there with the other big posters and the big movies just shows you the power that we have and that we can also be the heroes that we know we can be,” he explained.
Soto also noticed the efforts of the #BlueBeetleBattalion online and loves what they’re doing.
“The reaction of the people and the awareness that is building up, starting with #BlueBeetleBattalion with the kids online making memes and having fun with this, and now moving forward with actually seeing it everywhere, the engagement has been beautiful.”

2023-07-20 17:00:00+00:00,Blue Beetle’s Long Journey to the Big Screen: Xolo Maridueña on Becoming a DC Legend,Exclusive: Blue Beetle star Xolo Maridueña and director Angel Manuel Soto share the secrets behind their journey to bring DC's newest big-screen superhero to life.,"For decades, Ted was the most well-known Blue Beetle, heightened when Charlton Comics was sold to DC in 1983. Ted soon had his own Blue Beetle solo series — written by legend Len Wein — launching him into the superhero stratosphere, followed by a starring role in the Justice League. But Ted wasn’t the last person to take on the mantle of Blue Beetle. In 2006, Keith Giffen, John Rogers, and Cully Hamner introduced Jaime Reyes, a teen who gained powers from a mysterious alien artifact known only as “the scarab.” That nearly 70-year-long journey, from 1939 to 2006, was only the beginning of Jaime’s story, as he soon became a fan-favorite character both on the page and on the small screen thanks to appearances in several DC animated projects.
This year, Jaime finally makes the jump to the big screen in Soto’s Blue Beetle. But, as Soto tells us, at first, he wasn’t sure it was the right project for him. “I didn’t want it to be another story where 15 minutes in, something happens, and 50 minutes later, he’s dominating the experience, and by the end, he’s saving the world. I get it, I enjoy it, I go watch those movies and eat the popcorn and it’s fun, but it was hard for me to relate to an experience like that,” Soto explained. “If someone gives me a lot of power, the first thing I’d do is say, ‘I don’t want it.’ I just wanna provide for my family; I don’t need it, more power, more problems!”
That mindset led him to pursue a more grounded take on Jaime, which Soto — along with writer Gareth Dunnet Alcocer — saw as a way to explore Jaime stepping up to the call of being a hero. As he explains, “He’s not going to save the world yet; he doesn’t deserve to yet. We wanted to find a way to really explore his growth, how it relates to how his family and community see him in this role, as well as how his relationship with Khaji grows as well.”
Khaji is the symbiotic alien who gives Jaime his powers and makes him the titular Blue Beetle. But while it’s the magical artifact that allows the teen to become a hero, Jaime is always at the heart of the story, which is why it was so important to get his casting right. Soto first met the young Cobra Kai star, Xolo Maridueña, at Sundance while showing his film Charm City Kings. Maridueña made an immediate impact. “He was just super real; that always stuck with me.”
It was during Covid that the director watched Cobra Kai and was blown away by Maridueña’s performance. “I saw how charming he is and how well people were receiving his authentic self.” It all began to come together. The fact Maridueña is bilingual was another immediate draw. And the cherry on top? The actor already had martial arts experience thanks to Cobra Kai.
“You might think that would have given me a leg up,” the actor tells Den of Geek in an interview conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike. “I definitely thought, ‘I’ve been doing martial arts for five years; what’s adding a couple of wings to it?'” The reality was much more intense, though, and Maridueña was full of praise for his collaborator in bringing Jaime to life. “I was really blessed with a wonderful stunt performer. He’s doing stuff that’s supposed to be fake, but he’s really doing it! He’s doing superhero stuff in real life!”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbm9mZ2Vlay5jb20vbW92aWVzL2JsdWUtYmVldGxlLXhvbG8tbWFyaWR1ZW5hLWFuZ2VsLW1hbnVlbC1zb3RvLWRjLWxlZ2VuZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-09-12 05:00:48+00:00,Interview: Blue Beetle director Ángel Manuel Soto on seeing his vision come to life on the big screen; “It’s very nice just to see a different flavour of superhero.”,"Discover the best new music, travel, film, gaming, arts, food, culture and book content on Australia's premier independent online publication. Since 2008.","An origin story 5 years in the making, Puerto Rican filmmaker Ángel Manuel Soto is finally seeing his vision of the Mexican-American superhero Blue Beetle brought to life in DC Studios’ Blue Beetle.
Starring Xolo Maridueña in the lead role, the film tells of recent college graduate Jaime Reyes and his return home full of aspirations for his future, only to find that home is not quite as he left it. As he searches to find his purpose in the world, fate intervenes when Jaime unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab. When the Scarab suddenly chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, he is bestowed with an incredible suit of armour capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the superhero BLUE BEETLE.
Ahead of the film’s release in Australia, Peter Gray spoke with Soto about the pride in representing Latino culture on screen, infusing the film with a strong female energy, and celebrating the nostalgic feeling of the movies he grew up with.
Congratulations on the film. I had the pleasure of speaking to Sasha Calle when The Flash came out, and she was saying how important it was for her to have that Latino representation (through her character). I imagine it was the same for you with this film and realising just how organic you could make these characters.
100%. Latinos is not a genre, you know? It’s just who we are. We cannot hide it. I cannot hide it in the way I do things. I’m Puerto Rican, I’m inherently Latino. That’s what is going to come out. And it’s very nice just to see a different flavour of superhero. And much like (Sasha) Calle, who I adore, our cast are all Latino, with the exception of Susan (Sarandon), (and) they felt the same way. They feel so excited to be able to see themselves in these characters. They’re not trying to be somebody else. And they also see themselves as heroes in a movie, because everybody in the family has a heroic moment.
Absolutely. As great as it is to see Jaime as Blue Beetle, the women in this family…like Nana brandishing a gun?!?! It was amazing. Did you have that from the get-go? You knew you needed these women to be just as much as a badass as Blue Beetle?
100%. Even in my family, if I wanted to do something my dad would say, “Ask your mom.” Our parents are like that. So we really wanted to give the women in our lives the celebration and the power they deserve. It’s because of them we have life. We are the people we are now. And thanks to them, I don’t think I’d be here today. And neither would Jaime. So it was very important for us to give each and every one of them a heroic moment that builds Jaime into the hero he becomes.
And the film itself…as a kid of the 80’s, it just has that feel to it. There’s this energy and charisma that I responded to immediately. We love seeing films that aren’t taking themselves seriously, but then this is also has quite a serious narrative underneath. It’s awesome to see these stories being told, and I hope everyone comes out for this one because (Blue Beetle) is just fun. And that’s what we want, right?
Oh man, I appreciate that. We really wanted to do that. There’s that nostalgia factor from the movies that we grew up watching. They have a message, they have a serious thing, but there’s a fun element to it. We really wanted to lean into that fun (but) also not lose perspective of the visceral reality of these relationships, and these things can happen in the real world. Rounding it that way just allowed us to give homage to all those movies that we grew up with. The score, the aesthetics, the lights, and the overall energy is something that I was like, “Okay, I want to do something for my younger self. I want one of those stories that my nieces can watch and understand why (their) uncle is the way he is.”
Blue Beetle is screening in Australian theatres from September 14th, 2023.

Blue Beetle 2
During a recent interview with Collider (via Coming Soon), Blue Beetle director Ángel Manuel Soto stated Jaime Reyes’ story is only just “beginning.”
We didn’t want to immediately have him team up with anything. Those team-ups can happen whenever they want to happen, but in Jaime’s story, this is just literally like the beginning, it just connected. Then comes the whole relationship aspect of it, which is like the next version that we wanted to explore. Now that this also is like a prologue of sorts that sets up the stage of who is Jaime, who is his family, his personality, his community, now you don’t have to spend time exploring that. We want to give this movie time to give this introduction properly so that we really know Jaime’s heart fully so that when the other movies come, we can start having explosions every five minutes if you want.

Star Trek: Strange New Worlds
During a recent interview with TV Line, Strange New Worlds executive producer Henry Alonso Myers promised we’d see more of Scotty and other original series characters in season three.
We’ve been talking about him for a while as a general idea. As we were going into the finale, it suddenly became a weird, rare opportunity to introduce him for a lot of different reasons. What we’d like to do with the characters [from the original Star Trek series]… We don’t meet our understanding of who they are in that series, we meet who they are before. They don’t know who they will be, and they aren’t that person yet. They have some stuff to go through.

‘Blue Beetle’ Actor Raoul Max Trujillo Says It “Is Pretty Exciting” That Susan Sarandon Is “Only ‘White Person’ In The Film,” Accuses United States Of Exploiting Puerto Rico
Raoul Max Trujillo as Conrad Carapax in Blue Beetle (2023), DC Studios
Blue Beetle actor Raoul Max Trujillo, who plays Conrad Carapax in the movie, recently detailed how exciting it is for the film to only have one white person in the movie.
Raoul Max Trujillo, who previously starred in Apocalypto back in 2006, spoke about the movie with Heroic Hollywood where he informed the outlet, “Being part of a project where the focus is on a culture that’s outside of the Hollywood Anglo-Saxon culture that we’ve seen our whole lives in everything… it’s just so touching and warming.”
He added, “You see a whole level that, had it been just sort of a regular American family, it wouldn’t have had the heart that it had. So I think that’s what made me super excited about being a part of this film.”

The actor then shared, “Susan Sarandon’s character, Victoria Kord, is the only ‘white person’ in the film. The rest of the characters are all brown people. And that is pretty exciting, and I think it’s pretty brave of Warner Bros. to have supported the project and Angel’s dream to tell this particular story.”
“As a DC movie, this has darkness in it, but it’s also got this incredible heart and it’s incredible light,” Trujillo relayed.
Trujillo also praised the film’s portrayal of Kord’s character andher “ravishing of indigenous people.”
He said, “When I saw the movie, there were a lot of teary eyes in that audience. They were moved. There are some images that will make you go ‘Holy f–k, that s–t’s real.’ In relation to the military-industrial complex, and the sort of ravishing of indigenous people. There are some brilliant references that Angel has thrown in there, and you just there’s no way you can miss them. They have to do with the times that they’re living in in America.”
RELATED: ‘Blue Beetle’ Actress Susan Sarandon Reveals Her Character Is The “White Military Industrial Complex” Bad Guy
Sarandon previously described her character as the white military industrial complex in an interview with Jimmy Fallon.
She said, “What’s fabulous about [Blue Beetle] is it’s the first Latinx hero that has his own movie. Even better all of the Mexican — because his family is Mexican and all the actors were Mexican and it’s in Spanish so it’s subtitled.”
“I’m, of course, the bad guy. I’m the white military industrial complex. So I had a fabulous time because there’s nothing better than being bad,” she added.
Later in the interview, Trujillo accused the United States of exploiting Puerto Rico, while discussing filming on the island, “First of all, Puerto Rico, being the place that it is with such a rich history of slavery, colonization, and exploitation to this day by the United States — that sort of vibe is felt underneath, you feel a sort of revolutionary vibe in these people.”
“So to shoot this film there, which has a lot of those elements, you’re surrounded by it. And it’s real. It’s not make-believe. It’s not pretend. Some of the locations, especially the old fort, are 500 years old. The blood spilled there, and the tortures that must have happened there — that s– is real. I’m Native. Shooting it in that specific location, with that vibration of persecuted people and murder and genocide and all of that… it comes through,” he said.
RELATED: ‘Blue Beetle’ Director Deletes Tweet Wishing Assassination On President Donald Trump, Claims Puerto Rico Is A “Slave Colony”
Trujillo is not alone in this view. The film’s director Angel Manuel Soto also shared to Twitter that he believes Puerto Rico is a slave colony.
He wrote, “Puerto Rico is a slave colony of the USA. Your passport was impossed on us, so there is nowhere else to after your country s***s on my land and blame us for the stink.”
The actor concluded the interview stating, “I just hope that everyone walks away realizing that we’re not bastardizing an idea or a character or anything else. We’re just evolving it further. Hopefully, they can walk away with a really deep, powerful message with this film.”
“I don’t think it knocks you over the head with a hammer. I think it’s subtle, nuanced. There’s definitely a message to be seen and heard here and I hope fans can walk around and just realize that this isn’t just another superhero movie that is fluff. It’s not,” he continued.
“With the small experience I have with comic books and heroes from DC, Marvel, or whatever else, it’s like, there are usually messages for us to take away, with the whole ‘good vs evil’ archetypes and all that. I just hope people can walk away from this and just see the deeper meaning and message with this film and keep supporting it,” Trujillo finished.
RELATED: Report: ‘Blue Beetle’ To Feature Illegal Immigration Allegory
As for what the messaging the film contains, Soto confirmed it featured an illegal immigration allegory to MovieMaker. The outlet explained the allegory, “Before the movie begins, the family has immigrated to America from Mexico, but [Jamie Reyes’ father] Alberto doesn’t have documentation, so he’s under the constant threat of deportation.”
They go on to note, “Though the film doesn’t depict an ICE raid, it does include a scene that echoes one. Kord Industries invades the family’s home in a scene that can play as just another dramatic moment in a superhero movie – or be taken as symbolic of events that tear apart real families.”
Soto confirmed this description telling them, “There is a history that exists before an ICE raid. A history that includes traveling miles, and danger, working hard, becoming a family, creating memories, and thinking that everything is going to be okay.”
“But all of a sudden, everything that you have fought for, everything that you have worked for, everything that you have built, is now burning. I needed the depiction to be triggering, because it’s the experience of many,” he added.
RELATED: ‘Blue Beetle’ Director Confirms Film Includes Themes Of Displacement, Colonialism, And Gentrification
In an interview with Collider, Soto further detailed the film features themes of displacement, colonialism, and gentrification.
He said, “For example, in my case, from Puerto Rico, displacement, colonialism, gentrification. Those are things that are real threats. Home insecurity, not putting food on the table, proper healthcare. All those things that are villains, but at the same time what are all those things that are are heroic things like community, like standing up against a tyrant, or standing up against the things that weaken us, but doing it through the power of family and community.”
“So being able to hone in to those experiences that I know firsthand, that the writer also knows firsthand because Gareth [Dunnet-Alcocer] is from Queretaro, Mexico. We were able to find where our different journeys intersect in a similarity of experiences that not only affect our individual countries, but also affects countries in Latin American and abroad,” Soto concluded.

National Cinema Day
With National Cinema Day on Sunday, the second such annual celebration of moviegoing in the U.S., all tickets at participating locations were $4. That includes premium formats like IMAX and 3D.
As a result, Sunday was the highest-grossing day at this weekend’s box office, earning an estimated $34.3M total, above Saturday with $28.6M and Friday with $27.5M.
Put another way, Sunday earned about 38% of the weekend box office. By comparison, last weekend, Sunday earned 28%.
Films which posted their mildest weekend declines to date this weekend include:
Film Decline Previous best Oppenheimer -16% -35% Barbie -19% -36% Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One -24% -30% Meg 2: The Trench -25% -47% Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem -29% -44% Haunted Mansion -30% -37% Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny -39% -41%
Monday Update: While Sunday’s studio weekend estimates were originally too close to call for the top spot, Sony Pictures’ Gran Turismo won out in the end.
Their updated estimate on Monday was $17.4M, slightly higher than their original $17.3M Sunday estimate.
Meanwhile, Warner Bros.’ updated estimate on Monday for Barbie was $15.1M, considerably lower than their original $17.1M Sunday estimate.
What follows is Boxoffice PRO‘s original article from Sunday.
Gran Turismo
Sony Pictures’ auto racing drama attempted to rev up at the weekend box office with an estimated $17.3M debut.
That’s only about +1% ahead of Barbie’s weekend estimates with $17.1M. Their Sunday estimates are so close that their rankings may reverse upon release of Monday afternoon actuals.
Stay tuned to this page for a Monday afternoon update.
Compared to the wide openings of some other auto racing films of the past decades, that’s:
-72% above 2013’s Rush : $10.0M
2.1x above 2019’s The Art of Racing in the Rain : $8.1M
2.2x above 2017’s Logan Lucky : $7.6M
Compared to some other action films based on video games in recent years, that’s also:
+68% above 2016’s Assassin’s Creed : $10.2M
+27% above 2017’s Resident Evil: The Final Chapter ($13.6M)
-25% below 2021’s Mortal Kombat : $23.3M [opened day-and-date in cinemas and streaming on Max]
-26% below 2018’s Tomb Raider : $23.6M
-28% below 2016’s Warcraft : $24.1M
-60% below 2022’s Uncharted : $44.0M
Overseas / global
After opening earlier this month in select overseas markets, Turismo has earned $36.5M overseas and $53.8M globally, or 67% from overseas.
In holdover markets, the film fell only -28% this weekend.
Barbie
In its sixth frame, Warner Bros.’ comedy declines only -19% to $17.1M, tentatively repeating in the runner-up slot after spending four frames in first place.
Again, that’s so close to Gran Turismo with $17.3M that their rankings may reverse upon release of Monday afternoon actuals.
Stay tuned to this page for a Monday afternoon update.
All time, Barbie has now earned the:
With $594.8M total through 38 days, it now ranks as the #14 biggest movie of all time, between 2018’s Incredibles 2 with $608.5M and April’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie with $574.3M.
Last Wednesday, Barbie surpassed Mario to become the highest-grossing film of 2023. It’s running +3% and counting ahead of Mario’s final total: $574.3M.
Overseas / global
This weekend, Barbie declined -32% overseas in holdover markets, steeper than its -19% domestic drop.
It’s now earned $745.5M overseas and $1.34B globally, or 55% from overseas.
Globally, that’s already the #18 film of all time, ranking between 2011’s Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 with $1.34B and 2017’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi with $1.33B.
It also ranks #2 of the year so far, behind only April’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie: $1.45B.
Blue Beetle
Last weekend, Warner Bros.’ superhero movie debuted in first place with $25.0M, a first place opening but lower than every other recent DC Extended Universe films.
Now in its sophomore frame, it falls -49% to $12.7M and third place.
Buoyed by National Cinema Day, that’s a milder drop than most other 2020s DC Extended Universe titles:
2022’s Black Adam : -59%
March’s Shazam!: Fury of the Gods – -69%
2021’s The Suicide Squad : -71% [released day-and-date simultaneously in cinemas and streaming on Max]
June’s The Flash : -72%
It even declined more mildly than the lone August release in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), 2014’s Guardians of the Galaxy: -55%.
However, it fell just slightly steeper than February 2020’s Birds of Prey: -48%.
Overseas / global
This weekend, Beetle declined -52% overseas, slightly steeper than its -49% domestic drop.
It’s earned $35.5M overseas and $81.8M globally, or 43% from overseas.
That’s potentially on track to become the lowest-grossing DC Extended Universe film globally, currently March’s Fury of the Gods: $132.1M.

Oppenheimer
In its sixth frame, Universal’s historical war drama declines only -16% to $9.0M, falling from third to fourth place.
While its second, third, and fourth weekends all ranked in the top 100 of all time, last frame it fell out of that tier for its fifth weekend. Now it reenters that territory once again, with the #88 sixth weekend of all time.
With $300.0M total through 38 days, it now ranks as the #103 biggest movie of all time domestically, between two Twilight films: 2010’s Eclipse with $300.5M and 2009’s New Moon with $297.8M.
On Friday, Oppenheimer also surpassed Inception to become writer-director Christopher Nolan’s biggest non-Batman film. Here’s how Oppenheimer compares to his other biggest original titles:
+2% and counting above the final total for 2010’s Inception : $292.5M
+57% and counting above the final total for 2017’s Dunkirk : $190.0M
+59% and counting above the final total for 2014’s Interstellar: $188.0M
Oppenheimer also stands as the #7 biggest R-rated movie of all time domestically, between 2018’s Deadpool 2 with $324.5M and 2003’s The Matrix Reloaded with $281.5M.
Oppenheimer stands a shot at finishing among the top five R-rated films, with a small shot at #1. Currently, that mark has been held for 19 years by 2004’s The Passion of the Christ: $370.7M.
However, it’s running slightly behind all the top five R-rated films ever, through the equivalent 38-day point in wide release.
Oppenheimer has also set another unusual record: highest-grossing film to never top a weekend box office.
It surpassed the prior record holder, 2016’s Sing with $270.3M, which peaked at #2 behind Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.
Overseas / global
This weekend, Oppenheimer declined -31% overseas, steeper than its -16% domestic drop.
Oppenheimer has earned $477.1M overseas and $777.1M globally, or 61% from overseas.
Globally, it’s now the #111 film of all time, ranking between 2016’s Deadpool with $782.8M and 1977’s Star Wars with $775.3M, when including subsequent theatrical re-releases.
Oppenheimer has also overtaken Nolan’s other non-Batman films:
+6% and counting above the final global total for Inception : $728M
+20% and counting above the final global total for Interstellar : $648M
+46% and counting above the final global total for Dunkirk : $530M
The film will debut in China later this month.
IMAX
Oppenheimer has earned $84.1M domestically and $154.5M globally from IMAX, the #4 domestic and #5 global IMAX total of all time.
Globally, it only trails 2009’s Avatar, 2022’s Avatar: The Way of Water, 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and 2019’s Avengers: Endgame.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem
In its fourth frame, Paramount’s animated action comedy reboot declines only -29% to $6.1M, falling from fourth to fifth place.
After a midweek Wednesday debut, Mayhem has earned $98.1M after 26 days, already outgrossing two of the last three films in the franchise:
+19% and counting above the final total for 2016’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows – $82.0M
+81% and counting above the final total for 2007’s TMNT : $54.1M
However, it’s running below both the franchise’s 2014 installment and another comparable title, through the equivalent point in release:
-41% below 2014’s hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : $167.1M
-28% below 2018’s similar animation style Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse – $136.8M
Overseas / global
This weekend, Mayhem declined -37% overseas in holdover markets, steeper than its -29% domestic drop.
Mayhem has now earned $37.0M overseas and $135.1M globally, or 27% from overseas.
It looks certain not to reach the $485M global total for 2014’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, or the $245M global total for 2016’s Out of the Shadows.
Later this month and next, the film will debut in key markets including Australia, South Korea, and Japan.

Strays
Last weekend, Universal’s R-rated talking dog comedy Strays played dead with an $8.2M debut in fifth place.
Now in its sophomore frame, it falls -43% to $4.6M and seventh place.
Compared to this year’s other R-rated comedies, that’s steeper than February’s Magic Mike’s Last Dance with -35%, but milder than June’s No Hard Feelings with -48% and July’s Joy Ride with -54%.
Compared to other August R-rated comedies of the past decade, it’s also milder than:
2019’s Good Boys : -46%
2018’s The Spy Who Dumped Me : -47%
2016’s War Dogs : -52%
2018’s The Happytime Murders : -54%
2016’s Sausage Party : -55%
However, it’s steeper than 2014’s Let’s Be Cops: -39%

Elsewhere at the box office
Warner Bros.’ shark-themed thriller Meg 2: The Trench takes sixth place with a -25% decline to $5.1M, in its fourth frame.
Trench has earned $74.4M after 24 days. That’s -38% below 2018’s original The Meg through the equivalent point in release: $120.5M.
Briarcliff’s sports drama The Hill climbed the hill in its opening with an eighth place debut of $2.5M on 1,570 screens, less than half of the widest releases in the market.

https://www.boxofficepro.com/mounting-the-hill-director-jeff-celentano-on-surmounting-the-odds-and-hitting-the-big-screen/
Disney’s family horror comedy Haunted Mansion takes ninth place with a -30% decline to $2.1M, in its fifth frame.
It’s earned $62.2M through 31 days. That’s -3% below 2003’s original Haunted Mansion through the equivalent point in release: $64.7M. (That’s without adjusting for ticket price inflation.)
While the new version had been running ahead through the equivalent point in release, it finally fell behind its predecessor last Thursday, on their respective 28th days of release.
Paramount’s action-adventure sequel Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One declines a mere -24% decline to $2.0M, in its seventh frame.
After a midweek Wednesday release, it’s earned $168.0M through 47 days. That trails both its two Mission: Impossible predecessors through the equivalent point in release: -21% below 2018’s Fallout with $213.1M, and -11% below 2015’s Rogue Nation with $188.9M.
Angel Studios’ faith-based action drama Sound of Freedom declines a mild -23% drop to $2.0M, in its eighth frame.
With $181.0M after 55 days, Sound is certainly the biggest box office surprise of 2023 so far. It’s earned more than such expected summer blockbusters as the new Fast and the Furious, Indiana Jones, Fast and the Furious, and Mission: Impossible installments, plus The Flash and Pixar’s Elemental.
It’s also the #10 film from calendar year 2023 so far (including 2022 holdovers), and ranks #15 all time among films which never topped a weekend box office.
Bleecker Street’s political war drama Golda opened to $1.7M on 883 screens, about one-fifth of the widest releases in the market.

Universal’s 30th anniversary re-release of 1993’s Jurassic Park resurrected to $1.7M on 1,224 screens, less than one-third of the widest releases in the market.
That’s -35% below the re-release of Steven Spielberg’s fellow thriller Jaws on last year’s National Cinema Day weekend: $2.6M.
In platform release, MGM’s R-rated high school comedy Bottoms opened with an estimated $516,254 on 10 screens, for a $51,625 per-screen average.
That ranks #4 among averages so far in 2023, behind only:
June’s Asteroid City : $142,230 April’s Beau is Afraid : $80,099 June’s Past Lives : $58,067
Bottoms expands to around 700 theaters next weekend.

2023-08-18 15:57:32+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’ Ad on the Steps of Philadelphia Museum Rankles Locals,The Philadelphia Museum of Art's steps are currently host to a giant 'Blue Beetle' advertisement that has upset locals.,"A view of the ""Blue Beetle"" advertisement on the iconic stairs at Philadelphia Museum of Art, 2023, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
A large advertisement for the superhero movie Blue Beetle is currently installed on the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where a famed sculpture of the fictional boxer Rocky Balboa is sited. Since going on view, many, including a Philadelphia Inquirer columnist, have decried the ad, claiming that it is an eyesore.
Though the ad is only slated to be there for seven days, the large vinyl stickers are plastered across all 72 of the famous steps climbed by Rocky Balboa in the 1976 film Rocky.
CBS News spoke to a range of locals who disliked the advertisment, with one visitor from Dallas saying, “I think it’s tacky to put an ad like this on such an old prestigious place.”
Others seemed more nonplussed. “It gives color, it gives emotions. It’s cool, it’s fine,” Italian tourist Diletta Dinalle told CBS News.
The ad was approved by the Philadelphia Parks & Recreation department, which maintains the museum and the stairs. A parks department spokesperson told CBS that the city will receive $28,000 for the seven-day installation.
“As the city of Philadelphia owns the East Terrance stairs (the Rocky Steps) and the Philadelphia Museum of Art, decisions about how to use these stairs are made by the city; not the Philadelphia Museum of Art,” the Philadelphia Museum of Art said in a statement. “As such a recognizable landmark, we love the idea of using the stairs for promotional purposes and we would welcome opportunities to use these stairs to promote Philadelphia’s emerging artists.”
This is not the first time a public area or landmark in the city has been used for corporate advertisements. “Can’t there be one place in this society where we’re not forced to engage with advertisements?” Philadelphia-based art blogger Conrad Benner wrote.
It remains unclear how the city will use the money. “If this is going to be the city’s answer to fundraising, I think it’s a pretty lazy and uninspired answer,” Benner added. “That’s not a lot of money, but it’s a huge return on the studio’s investment.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFydG5ld3MuY29tL2FydC1uZXdzL25ld3MvYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtYWR2ZXJ0aXNlbWVudC1waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEtbXVzZXVtLW9mLWFydC1zdGVwcy0xMjM0Njc3MzA2L9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFydG5ld3MuY29tL2FydC1uZXdzL25ld3MvYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtYWR2ZXJ0aXNlbWVudC1waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEtbXVzZXVtLW9mLWFydC1zdGVwcy0xMjM0Njc3MzA2L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

2023-08-29 21:56:21+00:00,Miley Cyrus Recalls Grueling Work Schedule At 13 Years Old During Disney’s ‘Hannah Montana’ Days,Miley Cyrus is looking back at her childhood and recalling the grueling work schedule she had during her early teens while she was starring in the Disney Channel series Hannah Montana.,"Miley Cyrus is looking back at her childhood and recalling the grueling work schedule she had during her early teens while she was starring in the Disney Channel series Hannah Montana.
The singer and actress has been sharing a series of videos promoting her newest single “Used To Be Young” where she is remembering her teenage years. In one of the videos she shared on TikTok, Cyrus pulled up a schedule from around when she was 12 or 13 years old.
“5:30 a.m.?!” Cyrus exclaims. “I’m probably 12 or 13. Friday, January 5, 5:30 a.m. — Hair and Makeup in my hotel. 7 a.m. — we get picked up. 7:15 a.m. — I’m on the news. 7:45 — I have another live interview. 8:15 — another interview. 8:45 — another interview. 9:30 to 11 a.m. — meeting with editors, back to the hotel.”
She continued, “OK, I have to do an interview but the reporters are all fifth-grade students. 1 to 2:30 — me and my dad have a lunch interview. 2:40 — we have to go to the Life magazine photoshoot. 3 to 5 — interview and photoshoot for the Father’s Day issue. Arrive at 6 p.m. for kids online interview then at 6:15 we have another interview. Then the next day starts at 7 a.m. and end at 7:30 p.m. when I fly home to probably go to Hannah [Montana] — that’s on a Saturday and then Monday be back at work in the morning.”
Cyrus reflected on her demanding work schedule at such a young age adding, “I’m a lot of things but lazy ain’t one of them. So, I do think this girl deserves a little endless summer vacation.”
In a previous video, Cyrus opened up about how hard it is to go on tour saying that “if you’re performing at a certain level of intensity and excellence, there should be an equal amount of recovery and rest. There’s a level of ego that has to play a part that I feel gets overused when I’m on tour. And once that switch is on, it’s hard to turn it off.”
The “Flowers” singer acknowledged that that lifestyle “isn’t healthy for me because it erases my humanity and my connection and without my humanity [and] my connection I can’t be a songwriter, which is my priority.”
Watch Cyrus read her schedule from her Hannah Montana days in the video posted below.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvbWlsZXktY3lydXMtcmVjYWxscy1ncnVlbGluZy13b3JrLXNjaGVkdWxlLWRpc25leS1oYW5uYWgtbW9udGFuYS1kYXlzLTEyMzU1MzA3NjMv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC9taWxleS1jeXJ1cy1yZWNhbGxzLWdydWVsaW5nLXdvcmstc2NoZWR1bGUtZGlzbmV5LWhhbm5haC1tb250YW5hLWRheXMtMTIzNTUzMDc2My9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-21 19:04:03+00:00,"Dave Bautista, Jason Momoa to Team for ‘Wrecking Crew’ From ‘Blue Beetle’ Director Ángel Manuel Soto","Dave Bautista and Jason Momoa will star in the MGM buddy comedy The Wrecking Crew, which has Blue Beetle director Angel Manuel Soto attached.","Blue Beetle director Ángel Manuel Soto has lined up another feature: He’s set to helm The Wrecking Crew, an MGM project that is expected to star Dave Bautista and Jason Momoa. Both stars were in talks for the film before the actors strike commenced last month, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.
Wrecking Crew has a script from Jonathan Tropper, the creator of the TV series Warrior. He penned the script and closed his deal before the writers strike began in June. Jeffrey Fierson, who worked with Momoa on the TV series Frontier, is producing the film.
Wrecking Crew is described as a buddy comedy, with other details kept under wraps.
Bautista was recently in theaters with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, while Momoa played the antagonist in this summer’s Fast X and has Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom due out in December.
Soto, meanwhile, just launched Blue Beetle into cinemas, with the DC feature breaking ground as the first live-action studio superhero movie starring and created by Latinos. “We wanted to see our history and our legacy on the big screen, in a way that is respectful, and that was an opportunity that we didn’t want to miss,” Soto recently told THR of his work on Blue Beetle. He broke out with his 2020 Sundance movie Charm City Kings.
Bautista is repped by CAA, Meisner Entertainment Group and Jackoway Austen. Momoa is repped by WME and Edelstein Laird. Soto is repped by Redefine Entertainment and Behr Abramson. Tropper is repped by CAA, Kaplan/Perrone Entertainment and Felker Toczek.

Gran Turismo
Sony Pictures
August 25, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $13M-$22M
PROS:
Gran Turismo has the IP and video game fan base to help boost interest in its debut. Sneak previews over the last few weeks have provided a unique promotional strategy to aid in pre-release awareness and audience word of mouth. A premium screen footprint that includes IMAX is another plus.
On the penultimate weekend of the summer season, holdovers will continue to drive a significant share of business. Barbie and Oppenheimer will remain significant players in their sixth frame, with the latter returning to share screen time at digital IMAX locations and enjoying its final planned weekend in 70mm IMAX runs.
National Cinema Day will be held at more than 3,000 domestic venues on Sunday with virtually all movies, formats, and showtimes priced at an economical $4 per ticket, alongside various concession deals from exhibitors. The inaugural National Cinema Day last year attracted more than 8 million moviegoers, driving the highest theatrical foot traffic of 2022.
This year, there’s a stronger lineup of widely appealing films already playing in theaters, with the likes of The Little Mermaid, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Jurassic Park, and others making a brief return to screens as part of the festivities.
CONS:
Gran Turismo, like other recent films, lacks the traditional marketing prowess that would have been in play without the ongoing SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes. Early critics’ reviews are also somewhat mixed, as the Rotten Tomatoes score sits at 59 percent as of Wednesday morning.
Lionsgate and Briarcliff Entertainment will release Retribution and The Hill, respectively, this weekend, though minimal marketing indicates limited box office potential. Of the two, The Hill has the most sleeper potential. Similarly, Golda will open courtesy of Fathom Events and Bleecker Street, but in semi-wide release. Due to the nature of these three releases and the debatable halo effect of National Cinema Day, forecasts are not currently offered.
While National Cinema Day could still prove to be successful by certain measures, there is increased volatility surrounding all forecasts this weekend due to the celebration’s positioning on Sunday—putting it immediately before a work day for most adults and a school day for more than 60 percent of K-12 students around the country. Last year’s National Cinema Day had the theoretically stronger advantage of landing on the Saturday during Labor Day (Monday) weekend.
Current projection ranges call for an 78% increase from the comparable weekend’s top ten aggregate of $41.4 million in 2022 and a 12% decrease from 2019’s $87.9 million.
For reference, the top ten earned $42.4 million over the three-day Labor Day weekend when National Cinema Day was celebrated on Sunday during the first frame of September last year.

2023-09-15 08:51:48+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’ – Review,"The superhero genre gets a boost of new energy with the pop and blast of Ángel Manuel Soto's Blue Beetle, and it's a damn fun watch!","In an era that’s been arguably oversaturated with capes, masks, and superpowers, Blue Beetle swoops in like a breath of fresh air, offering an origin story that’s as heartwarming as it is culturally significant. Directed by Ángel Manuel Soto, this film injects new life into the superhero genre, introducing Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) as our first live-action Latino superhero in a leading role. And boy, does he shine.
Jaime Reyes suddenly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology called the Scarab. When the Scarab chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, he’s bestowed with an incredible suit of armor that’s capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the superhero Blue Beetle.
Blue Beetle wastes no time in establishing its protagonist. Jaime Reyes, a recent college graduate, returns to his hometown of Palmera City, only to discover that it’s under siege by Kord Industries, a tech behemoth led by the ruthlessly ambitious Victoria Kord (a scene-chewing Susan Sarandon). It’s the classic David vs. Goliath setup, with Jaime’s family caught in the crossfire. They’ve lost their business, face eviction due to gentrification, and are struggling to make ends meet.
But what truly sets Blue Beetle apart is its rich, charismatic, and relatable ensemble cast. Jaime’s family is a source of unwavering support and a vibrant heartbeat throughout the film. Rocio (Elpidia Carrillo) and Alberto (Damián Alcázar) embody loving parents doing their best to shield their family from adversity. Milagro (Belissa Escobedo) adds humor and sass as the witty sister, while Nana (Adriana Barraza) and Uncle Rudy (George Lopez) bring their unique skills and personalities to the mix.
The film’s narrative, though firmly rooted in the superhero origin template, effortlessly weaves in cultural specificity. It’s a refreshing departure from the formulaic hero’s journey we’ve seen far too many times before. Palmera City’s struggles mirror those of real communities facing gentrification, corporate greed, and displacement. While the stakes may not involve saving the world, they are deeply relatable and relevant.
While the film doesn’t shy away from its political undertones, it’s not done in a heavy-handed manner and is handled in a way that’s more thought-provoking than preachy. Victoria Kord’s tech empire echoes the dystopian corporate villains of classics like RoboCop, offering a scathing commentary on unchecked corporate power and the absence of effective government oversight. In a world where ordinary people bear the brunt of political and economic decisions, Blue Beetle strikes a chord.
The transformation of Jaime into the titular hero is not for the faint of heart. Ángel Manuel Soto’s direction brings a touch of body horror, making it one of the most visually arresting aspects of the film. It’s a bold choice that pays off, adding depth to Jaime’s journey as he grapples with his newfound powers.
Over the last decade, DC films have often been tagged with being a little too serious and self-important, but the seeds of James Gunn and Peter Safran’s ‘new DC’ have started to take root as was evidenced by the effortless humour that was injected into Blue Beetle. Unlike some superhero flicks that overload on gags, this film knows when to let a moment breathe. The humour feels organic, arising from character interactions and situations, and it never undercuts the emotional weight of pivotal scenes. It’s a testament to the filmmakers’ understanding that genuine laughter can coexist with moments of gravitas.
And let’s not forget the cultural celebration that permeates every frame of Blue Beetle. From pop culture references to music cues that resonate with the Latino community, the film’s commitment to authentic representation is commendable. It’s a reminder that diverse stories enrich the cinematic landscape.
It’s also worth shouting out the film’s talented cast, and Xolo Maridueña’s portrayal of Jaime Reyes in particular, is a revelation. He embodies the character with charisma and vulnerability, making us root for him from the get-go. Maridueña’s chemistry with the supporting cast is palpable, especially with his on-screen family. Their interactions feel genuine, adding depth a real depth to the film.
Blue Beetle may not reinvent the superhero genre, but it doesn’t need to. Instead, it infuses new life into familiar tropes by embracing culture, community, and authenticity. It’s a film that reminds us that heroism can be found not just in extraordinary powers but in the bonds of family and the resilience of marginalized communities.
In a world where superhero fatigue looms large, Blue Beetle stands as a shining example of what the genre can achieve when it dares to be different. As the DC Universe undergoes transformations, this film is a testament to the power of representation and storytelling that resonates with underrepresented voices. Blue Beetle is more than a superhero movie; it’s a celebration of culture and a triumph of heart. Don’t miss the chance to experience it on the big screen.

2023-08-15 13:28:25+00:00,Blue Beetle Burger King Meme: Is the Blue Whopper Real or Fake?,"Here are the details about the Blue Beetle Burger King meme. For those wondering if the blue Whopper is real or fake, here's the info.","The Blue Beetle Burger King meme has been doing the rounds across social media and forums like Reddit. The blue Burger, which swaps the normal burger bun for a blue version, is gaining traction for its revolting appearance.
Is the Blue Beetle burger real?
No, the Blue Beetle burger is not real. Burger King is not selling a Blue Beetle burger.
While the image of the burger looks convincing, especially when you consider the trendy charcoal burger buns that are now available. Turning a burger bun blue doesn’t seem so outlandish in this day and age. But no, the Blue Beetle burger is not real and you can’t buy one from Burger King.
What is the Blue Beetle Burger King meme?
The Blue Beetle Burger King meme takes the image of a standard Whopper and turns the bun blue. This is the Blue Beetle burger: a blue Whopper.
The image of the blue burger was posted on Twitter by @NebsGoodTakes alongside the caption:
“Available nationwide starting July 17, Burger King guests can summon the power of the Scarab with the Blue Beetle Whopper.”
As convincing as the image might be, it’s simply a meme. Burger King is not selling a blue-colored burger in order to promote Blue Beetle. Despite this, the image has gained traction on TikTok, which has probably helped increase awareness of the movie.
Should fake burgers like this continue to blow up online, it’s very possible that we will see fast food chains embracing the hype and working to create more limited edition themed burgers, pizzas, and other food items to help promote movies and TV shows.
For more Blue Beetle content, here’s where to buy the limited edition popcorn bucket. Also, here are the latest box office predictions for whether Blue Beetle will succeed or flop.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbWluZ3Nvb24ubmV0L2d1aWRlcy9uZXdzLzEzMjAwMTUtYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtYnVyZ2VyLWtpbmctbWVtZS13aG9wcGVyLWlzLWl0LXJlYWwtZmFrZdIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbWluZ3Nvb24ubmV0L2d1aWRlcy9uZXdzLzEzMjAwMTUtYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtYnVyZ2VyLWtpbmctbWVtZS13aG9wcGVyLWlzLWl0LXJlYWwtZmFrZT9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-21 19:18:21+00:00,Blue Beetle is scuttling toward a $17M domestic opening according to early box office predictions,Analysts predict DC's Blue Beetle could have the worst opening at the box office for a DCEU film with a $17M debut.,"DC’s Blue Beetle is skittering toward an unfortunate opening at the box office if the latest predictions are accurate. According to Boxoffice Pro, the superhero film starring Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes is tracking for the lowest opening weekend in the DC Extended Universe’s history. The site predicts a $12M-$17M domestic take for Blue Beetle’s opening gambit. Analysts also expect a domestic total of $27M-$55M for the film’s domestic run, a number that places Blue Beetle on the low end of DC‘s rickety ladder. However, it’s possible that the numbers are wrong, and Blue Beetle will open stronger than anticipated. We’ve seen underdog films blow past predictions, and positive word of mouth could boost the film’s performance.
Blue Beetle stars Xolo Maridueña as Jamie Reyes, a recent college grad who returns home full of aspirations for his future, only to find that home is not quite as he left it. “As he searches to find his purpose in the world, fate intervenes when Jaime unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab,” reads the official Blue Beetle synopsis. “When the Scarab suddenly chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, he is bestowed with an incredible suit of armor capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the Super Hero Blue Beetle.”
In addition to Xolo Maridueña (Cobra Kai), Blue Beetle also stars Adriana Barraza (Rambo: Last Blood) as Jaime’s grandmother, Nana, Damían Alcázar (Narcos: Mexico) as his father, Elpidia Carrillo (Mayans M.C.) as his mother, Bruna Marquezine (God Save the King) as Jenny Kord, Raoul Max Trujillo (Sicario) as Carapax, with Oscar winner Susan Sarandon (Dead Man Walking) as Victoria Kord, and George Lopez (Rio) as Jaime’s Uncle Rudy. The film also stars Belissa Escobedo (American Horror Stories) as Jaime’s sister, Milagro, and Harvey Guillén (What We Do in the Shadows) as Dr. Sanchez. Angel Manuel Soto (Charm City Kings) directed Blue Beetle from a Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer (Miss Bala) screenplay.
Unfortunately for Blue Beetle, the SAG-AFTRA strike prevents a traditional promotion cycle leading up to the film’s release. Blue Beetle is disadvantaged without actors on hand to promote the film, and DC refuses to push the movie to 2024 (unlike Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom).
Speaking as someone excited to see Blue Beetle, I hope the movie is good and that if people dig it, they sing its praises online. Fans could be the film’s most significant ally when Hollywood is in unrest. We’ll see.
Blue Beetle comes to cinemas on August 18, 2023.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpvYmxvLmNvbS9ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLXByZWRpY3Rpb25zL9IBPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpvYmxvLmNvbS9ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLXByZWRpY3Rpb25zL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,Bruna Marquezine | Because We Gotta Know When It's Time To Grow And Go,"Featuring Tiffany & Co., Via Issue 188, The Eternal Flame Issue!","What does a superpower look like in 2023? To break new ground–success perpetuating success–to grow and develop. To be able to share and inspire with a global community. It is in this spellbinding moment and ability that Brazilian actor Bruna Marquezine now finds herself. At the top of the actor’s long list of achievements is a leading role as Jenny Kord in the summer superhero blockbuster, Blue Beetle. Produced by DC Studios and the Safran Company, Marquezine joins a star-studded, Latino-led cast, marking a new chapter in her dynamic 22-year acting career. All the more impressive as Marquezine turned 28 in August and has a prodigious fan base of over 60 million followers across her social media channels.
Although Marquezine believed that one day she would work outside of Brazil, she never dreamed a major American production would be the next step. “I always had a feeling that it could happen, but I grew up listening to people say that it was impossible, that especially if you are from Brazil, you are never going to break through and make it anywhere else,” she says. “It’s something you don’t allow yourself to fully dream because it’s too big–it’s too far from your reality. Now that I’ve signed with UTA and have agents and publicists here, it’s all so surreal.”
But beneath the pomp and circumstance of Hollywood, the actor is well aware of the stakes of translating her craft to a new audience and franchise. Blue Beetle marks Marquezine’s largest project outside of Brazil to date. Her jump from Rio de Janeiro to Los Angeles happened so quickly that Marquezine is only now beginning to be able to reflect on the changes she’s experienced. One of her first reality checks took place on set with Susan Sarandon while filming Blue Beetle.
“I learned so much just by observing Susan,” she recalls. “I remember feeling so insecure around her. On one occasion, when we were almost done filming one of my character’s most important scenes, I felt I needed just one more take and asked the director for one more shot. Right after finishing, Susan told me, ‘Wow, girl, that was great.’ She even came to me afterward to compliment me again. All I could say was ‘Really?’ and then started crying.” For Marquezine, it was a reminder that she is where she is supposed to be at this moment in her career–doing what she loves most. But this perfectly polished résumé hasn’t been without hard work and moments of uncertainty along the way.
Marquezine is dressed in a white t-shirt, black baggy pants, and matching black and white Air Jordan sneakers. She wears her hair loose with laid-back waves. Her smile flashes across the screen as her hands vividly reinforce each of her words. She speaks calmly and measures each word carefully, denoting confidence, but perhaps also because this is one of her first interviews in English. Marquezine has worked hard with two coaches to master an American speech, just as she has worked hard at every step of her career.
Marquezine grew up in Duque de Caxias, on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. Her mother supported her daughter’s early passion for acting, accompanying her to auditions. Marquezine’s first job was a TV commercial at the age of five. The actor’s dexterity led her to seamlessly transition from one project to another. On set, television directors would ask the camera to zoom in on the tears running down the young girl’s cheeks. Her talent led her to more than twenty television shows and films in Brazil, making her a household name in the country. As she grew older, Marquezine modeled and embarked on countless collaborations with beauty and luxury brands. Flooding her social media and turning her into a fashion icon. But that celebrity status came at a price.

“As a child, I had always enjoyed a great relationship with the press,” she says. “I would talk about my work and that would be enough.” And then at the age of 18, when the character she was playing in the telenovela Salve Jorge required her to wear short hemlines and crop tops, the country’s entertainment media took notice. The scrutiny and life in the public eye intensified during Marquezine’s on-and-off-again relationship with soccer superstar Neymar. “You’re already trying to know yourself at that age,” she says. “And suddenly you have all these people telling you who you are, what you’re doing, what you deserve, and what you are capable of.” The pressure became unbearable. If this was the price to pay to continue acting, then perhaps it just wasn’t worth it. She recalls telling her mother, “It will be fine if I just give up now.”
But Marquezine cares too deeply about acting to just give it all up. The moment she limited herself to speaking only about her art, the harsh voices disappeared. “I’ve learned to keep stuff to myself, to not have to prove myself or to feel bad about what people are saying.” Once she learned how to navigate the press, it was no longer her enemy. She was in control.
One of the most daunting moments in Marquezine’s career would come in 2019, at the age of 24, when she told her agents that she was considering leaving TV Globo, the largest television producer and network in Brazil, who she had signed with at the age of eight. The media giant provided the pinnacle of professional security in an otherwise perilous industry.
Marquezine is not one to make rash decisions, nor to draw them out. She acts on what she believes feels right. After over a decade and a half with Globo, she felt it was time to cut ties. Her agents strongly advised against it, too scared to sever a good relationship with the media giant. “Of course, I didn’t want to hurt my relationship with Globo either,” she says. “They’re family, but I needed to grow. I needed to be in charge and do more for myself, like being able to study or to go on vacation.”

When her agents wouldn’t follow her, Marquezine made the bold decision to end her contract. Her mother was terrified, but Marquezine felt it was the right choice. However, once the pandemic hit Brazil, and the show she was on was canceled, the actor began to have serious questions about her future. “I was really doubting myself,” she says. “The imposter syndrome was hitting hard and I was unhappy.”
It was around this time that DC began looking for a Latina actor for their action film, The Flash. It was Marquezine’s first audition with DC, which she describes as a life-changing experience, especially considering the difficult phase of her career she was facing. “After the audition, I immediately called my agent and cried,” she says. “It didn’t matter if I got the role or not, because I had really prepared and just gave it my all. I was proud of myself in a way I had never been before.” Marquezine ended up in the final two. While the role was ultimately given to Sasha Calle, the experience restored her confidence as an actor.
A few months later, Marquezine received a call from DC to audition for Blue Beetle. She knew that she was on the producer’s radar, and now that the role was within her grasp, she had to prove her talent. “This time, I really wanted to get the part. I had to bring my A game.” The process went fast. Within a few days, she sent her self-tape, had a meeting over Zoom with film director Angel Manuel Soto, and then auditioned via Zoom again. She then flew to Los Angeles to do a chemistry reading and a week later, Soto called to ask if she would take on the role of Jenny. Marquezine posted a tear-filled announcement that she got the part on Instagram, which today, has garnered more than one million views.
“I enjoyed every second of filming this movie,” she says. “It’s something that’s so new to me because we don’t do productions this big or superhero movies in Brazil. I was amazed by it all.” She recalls how much fun it was to film with the other characters inside The Bug, a legendary hovercraft that DC comic fans will appreciate. The production team simulated all the movements and crashes of the ship and even recreated actual explosions on set. “Angel let us have a lot of fun with it,” she laughs.
The original Blue Beetle comic was created by Charles Nicholas Wojtkoski and first appeared in Mystery Men Comics #1 in 1939 for Fox Comics. In this Warner Bros. Pictures film, a special scarab created by alien technology grants Jaime Reyes, a teenager from Texas, superhuman abilities, which he uses to protect his city. Jenny is a new character (created by the screenplay writer, Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer), who works in the philanthropic arm of Kord Industries, and is protective of her father, Ted Kord’s, legacy. Marquezine’s character, who is responsible for bringing Reyes together with the magical scarab, starts as his friend, but their bond eventually blossoms into a relationship.
Marquezine is thrilled to play Jenny because she personally identifies with her resilience and values. “Jenny is someone I’d love to be friends with,” she says. “She is a strong woman and knows what she wants. She is always thinking about others and trying to do everything she can to help. I definitely share this with her.”
Currently, Marquezine is busy working on a new project in Brazil, a rom-com titled O Amor da Minha Vida (Love of My Life). In addition to taking on the lead role, which was written for her, Marquezine is also a producer on the series, which will premiere on Star+ in Brazil next year. After completing the project, Marquezine plans to move to Los Angeles. “I wasn’t crazy about the city. I used to be more into New York,” she confesses. “But now I am beginning to fall in love with LA.” Just as she knew when it was her time to step away from Globo, Marquezine is confident as her next chapter in the City of Angels continues. All eyes are on Bruna.

Angel Manuel Soto Doubles Down On Promoting ‘Blue Beetle’ With Identity Politics, Questions If It Was Possible To Have A Latino Superhero On A Times Square Billboard

Angel Manuel Soto, the director of Blue Beetle, continued to market the film through identity politics by recently questioning if it was possible to have a Latino superhero on Times Square billboard.
Speaking with TheWrap, Soto stated, “I’m very happy that finally we’re able to see how the whole promotion is being manifested.”
He then specifically pointed to the film’s promotion in Times Square in New York City, “Us seeing a Latino superhero of our own in Times Square is something that, if were think about it, is that even possible? Now it’s happening!”
Soto continued, “Being able to not only be promoted in the areas where our community transmits, but to also be up there with the other big posters and the big movies just shows you the power that we have and that we can also be the heroes that we know we can be.”

To no one’s surprise, Soto’s comments are completely devoid from reality in an attempt to paint the Latino community as some kind of victims who are unable to get advertisements on Times Square billboards.
Just how devoid from reality are they? In 2022, Marvel Studios promoted Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and their race replaced Namor with huge billboards in Times Square. Actor Tenoch Huerta even shared the billboards to his Twitter account.
Outside of superheroes, The Walt Disney Company purchased Times Square billboards in 2021 to promote their West Side Story film, which features the Puerto Rican gang the Sharks who vie for dominance against the white gang, the Jets.
One Twitter user back in December 2021 shared an image of the West Side Story promotion on the New York Marriot Marquis, which is located in Times Square.
RELATED: Report: ‘Blue Beetle’ To Feature Illegal Immigration Allegory
This isn’t the first time Soto attempted to use identity politics to promote the film. The director confirmed the film features an illegal immigration allegory.
The outlet MovieMaker detailed, “Before the movie begins, the family has immigrated to America from Mexico, but [Jamie Reyes’ father] Alberto doesn’t have documentation, so he’s under the constant threat of deportation.”
“Though the film doesn’t depict an ICE raid, it does include a scene that echoes one,” MovieMaker added. “Kord Industries invades the family’s home in a scene that can play as just another dramatic moment in a superhero movie – or be taken as symbolic of events that tear apart real families.”
Soto confirmed this scene in the film does indeed exist and that it’s an allegory for illegal immigration. He told MovieMaker, “There is a history that exists before an ICE raid. A history that includes traveling miles, and danger, working hard, becoming a family, creating memories, and thinking that everything is going to be okay.”
“But all of a sudden, everything that you have fought for, everything that you have worked for, everything that you have built, is now burning. I needed the depiction to be triggering, because it’s the experience of many,” he continued.

The scene likely includes a racial context given Susan Sarandon previously described her Victoria Kord charcter as the “white military industrial complex” in an interview with Jimmy Fallon in September 2022.
Sarandon stated, “What’s fabulous about [Blue Beetle] is it’s the first Latinx hero that has his own movie. Even better all of the Mexican — because his family is Mexican and all the actors were Mexican and it’s in Spanish so it’s subtitled.””
Sarandon then shared, “I’m, of course, the bad guy. I’m the white military industrial complex.”
“So I had a fabulous time because there’s nothing better than being bad,” she added.
RELATED: ‘Blue Beetle’ Director Says DC Villain Bane Represents The “Unknown Or Forgotten Or Brushed Under The Rug History Of Interventionism In Latin America And The Caribbean”
Soto also detailed that the film’s supervillain Carapax is a representation of interventionism in Latin America and the Caribbean.
He told The Playlist, that he sees the character of Bane in this regard, but did not know on whether he would get to work on the character so he took his ideas for Bane and applied them to Blue Beetle’s Carapax.
First, Soto explained his ideas for Bane, “As far as Bane goes, the comics that are about Bane’s story, it felt like he’s very misunderstood much like Carapax in the movie. He is a product of his environment and that history has been buried. The history of the Caribbean, the Antilles. It’s a history that’s brushed off in history books.”
“So for me, it was very important to be seen,” he continued. “And with the character of Bane, the formation of this villain, I think in his own right, he’s also a hero in his story. So whether whatever happens at the end that might have gotten distorted because of what was done to him, I think that what he represents is a lot of the unknown, or forgotten, or brushed under the rug history of interventionism in Latin America and the Caribbean.”
He later revealed he took what he viewed as Bane’s backstory and grafted it on to Carapax in the Blue Beetle film, “But while working on the character of Carapax, I was like, ‘Well, I don’t know if I’ll ever make a Bane movie. Let me take what I loved about Bane, about the backstory that I wanted to explore and let’s give it to Carapax.’ Because part of the idea was that maybe Carapax and Bane came from the same place. Maybe!? I mean Pago Island, right?”
Soto then explained the importance of taking his perceived version of Bane’s backstory and applying it to Carapax, “Because we need it. When we’re introduced to the world in movies, right, where we are seen as villains, it’s just given that we are born that way.”
“And when we talk about the history of Latin America, nobody dares to question, well, what happened before. Okay, well what happened before? More times than none when you go back even before 1954, but if we want to go to 1954 in Guatemala it was U.S. interventionism that drove these places to the miseries that they’re in.”
RELATED: ‘Blue Beetle’ Actor Xolo Maridueña Says Goal Of Film Is To Tell People That Hispanics Can Be Superheroes
It’s quite likely that Soto’s constant promotion of the film through identity politics and victimhood status is turning moviegoers away from the film. According to Box Office Pro’s latest projections the film is only expected to have an opening weekend between $20 million and $27 million domestically. The outlet also believes the film will only gross between $45 million and $87 million in its entire domestic run.
These predictions are a significant increase from Box Office Pro’s original long-range predictions. The outlet originally predicted the movie would bring in between $12 million and $17 million in its domestic opening weekend and only $27 million and $55 million in its entire domestic run.
However, these new numbers are still very bad given the film has an estimated production budget of $120 million. That means the movie needs to make at least $300 million globally to break even.
What do you make of Soto questioning if it was possible to have a Latino superhero or character on a Times Square billboard in New York City? What do you make of his constant promotion of this film through identity politics and victimhood?

2023-08-06 19:14:57+00:00,DC promotes Batgirl on Blue Beetle standee,"Batgirl continues to loom over DC, with the scrapped movie's logo making its way onto a Blue Beetle standee among released titles.","The scrapping of Batgirl from the DC schedule last year was a major blow to comic book movie fans. Despite the studio’s track record, there was plenty of interest around that project: Leslie Grace in the title role, Brendan Fraser as the key villain and Michael Keaton as Batman. Instead, 2022 and 2023 had Black Adam, a Shazam! sequel and The Flash, which at least did give us Keaton. But we all wanted to see how DC would handle Batgirl – and now curiosity has piqued yet again, as the logo remains on a promotional standee for Blue Beetle. OK, now they’re just rubbing it in!
In an image posted to Twitter (uh, we mean X) this week, a user showed off a Blue Beetle standee while also pointing out that “if you enhance on the bottom of the stand there’s this cool little easter egg…” along with a skull emoji. That easter egg is the logo for the discarded Batgirl, featured alongside those for other DC movies like The Batman, Aquaman and more that were or will be released. You can see the logo and standee below:
So if you enhance on the bottom of the stand there’s this cool little easter egg… ? https://t.co/NrfQgT3TTi pic.twitter.com/FFL3H0Yyi4 — Croc | ? (@Croc_Block) August 2, 2023
DC obviously would have approved and created this promotion well in advance – especially noted with the accompanying “Check out all of the DC films coming soon!” claim, which is still odd since they knew Blue Beetle was coming out after the advertised movies – but that Batgirl lingers among those that the studio had actual faith in is both a bit amusing and infuriating. One can only imagine how Batgirl directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah will feel about this…
Ironically, Blue Beetle is far from generating positive buzz and is currently tracking to have a $17 million opening later this month, meaning it would have the worst opening of a DCEU movie to date. Blue Beetle comes to theaters on August 18th, with the next DCEU entry, Aquman and the Lost Kingdom arriving on December 20th.
Do you think DC really has anything to lose by releasing Batgirl on a streaming service? How do you think Blue Beetle will fare at the box office?",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpvYmxvLmNvbS9kYy1wcm9tb3Rlcy1iYXRnaXJsLW9uLWJsdWUtYmVldGxlLXN0YW5kZWUv0gFFaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuam9ibG8uY29tL2RjLXByb21vdGVzLWJhdGdpcmwtb24tYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtc3RhbmRlZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,VMEN: Xolo Mariduena,,"At just 22 years old, Xolo Maridueña is already a huge breakout star with high-profile television roles in series like Parenthood on NBC and now Cobra Kai on Netflix. But now he’s taking the film world by storm with his first role in a major motion picture playing the titular character in Blue Beetle, based on the DC comic. On the surface, a soapy network drama like Parenthood and a superhero blockbuster like Blue Beetle may seem to have little in common, but each of Maridueña’s projects share a unique ability to resonate with viewers on an emotional, familial level. “I’m 22 years old, and it feels like it’s taken 22 years of my life to really be able to handle something like this,” Maridueña says. “I think Cobra Kai came at a time that was really necessary. The character was 16, I was 16. I felt like I kind of grew up with it. And now I’ve grown up, I feel like I’ve moved into a new chapter. ”
Xolo wears all clothing and accessories COACH
When the young star made his acting debut on Parenthood, he was just 10 years old and, working with a phenomenal group of veterans like Lauren Graham and Dax Shephard—the kind of cast a young actor can only dream of working alongside. Maridueña muses that his role in the series was the “catalyst” for his acting career. At that point, he was only looking for acting jobs as a means to pay for college. Despite being born and raised in Los Angeles, the television industry felt “distant” to him. It wasn’t until he had a “formative” experience on the set of Parenthood that he decided to pursue acting as a full-time career.
Blue Beetle is a bold step forward in Maridueña’s career and a bold step forward for action movies in general. It will be the first stand-alone title to feature a Latino lead as a superhero. The impact of this representation is not lost on Maridueña—he hopes that the film will alter the course of Latino representation in not only the superhero genre but the industry as a whole, which also stars a predominately Latino cast. “We’re getting to explore Latinidad and Latino culture through the lens of all these different characters,” Maridueña says. “I can’t wait for everyone to see it, because it really is so indicative of the notion that we are not a monolith, there is no one story. ”
Maridueña had quite the year leading up to the production of Blue Beetle–he made the Forbes 30 Under 30 as well as Variety’s 2021 Young Hollywood Impact List. Through his massive success, Maridueña’s hope for the film is first and foremost “that people walk out of the theater and love their families a little bit more.”
VMAN: At just 22 years old, you’re already a huge breakout star in the television industry with your roles first on Parenthood now in Cobra Kai – but now you’re breaking into the film world with DC’s Blue Beetle this fall. What has that transition from television to film been like for you this early in your career?
XOLO MARIDUEÑA: Great question, first and foremost. To be honest, it feels like it’s taken 20 years of my life to really be able to handle something like this. I think Cobra Kai came at a time that was really necessary – the character was 16, I was 16, and I felt like I kind of grew up with it. And now I’ve grown up, and I don’t want to say out [of] per se, but I feel like I’ve moved into a new chapter. And with Blue Beetle, not only with the story, but also with my own personal life, it felt like it all happened at the right time. In terms of reading a film and the differences, I really feel like, on the acting side, the people from Cobra Kai were so welcoming and so empowering throughout the six seasons that it really helped me gain my confidence as an actor. Both Ralph Macchio and Billy Zabka, my two mentors on the show, really showed me what it meant to set the tone on set, and that just meant the world to me.
VMAN: Yeah, totally. I feel like there’s so much like evolution that happens there. And then going even further back – when you got your big break on Parenthood, you were just 10 years old working with a phenomenal cast full of huge names with extensive acting repertoires. So how did that experience when you were so young prepare you for taking the lead in such a major role like this one?
XM: I think Parenthood was really the catalyst for all of this. If that show didn’t happen, there’s no way. At that point in my life, acting was a means to pay for college – and I was a kid, I was so young. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, but, you know, it still seems so distant. But when I was able to step on to the Parenthood set, I realized like, ‘Oh, snap. Maybe there’s something more here.’ They were so, so nice – it really didn’t feel like I was just a kid playing a kid. The cast was so welcoming and made sure to include me. I think that was so formative and hit me as a youngster. And I think it helped, kind of the same as Cobra, to gain some sort of confidence.
VMAN: Yeah, definitely. That’s really great to hear. And Blue Beetle will be the first standalone title to feature a Latino lead as a superhero. So at this point in your career, what does that mean to you as a Latino actor, and how do you feel that this could change the course of Latino representation in film and television specifically in this genre?
XM: I think that when it comes to superhero movies, this genre isn’t necessarily Latino. So I’m excited for the movie to come out, because I think the story that we’re telling spreads so much wider than just Latinos. It’s also a made-up city, so we’re getting to explore Latinidad and the Latino culture through the lens of all of these different characters. I just can’t wait for it to come out and for everyone to see it, because it really is so indicative of the notion that we are not a monolith – there is no one story. That’s really what I hope for this movie – that it opens the doors for other stories to be told. Although this is the first on the big screen, I don’t want it to be the last. I want it to open the doors for different characters, different Blue Beetles, because there’s tons – there’s infinite characters to choose from. So, I just hope that this shows that we can start to diversify.
VMAN: Speaking of the Latino cast, which of course includes your character’s family – in the highly-anticipated trailer, viewers can catch a glimpse of your character actually transforming into Blue Beetle in front of his entire family in his home. That’s a pretty unconventional transformation for a superhero. So what was shooting that scene like, and how do you think that that plot impacts Blue Beetle’s character arc?
XM: It honestly is one of the most unique facets of the movie, in my opinion. The fact that this guy is transforming into this – it’s almost horrid. It’s horrific, when you watch it, and getting to film it was otherworldly. It was so fantastic. I got to get into the wires and get thrown into the ceiling and scream. We filmed it on my 21st birthday, which was kind of crazy as well. I can’t wait for everyone to see the rest of it. And being, Latino, I totally relate. I can’t keep any secrets from my family. So I understand that there’s no alter ego.
VMAN: Yeah, it’s such an interesting plot point for the character. And my mom’s Cuban, so I also kind of relate to that. You’re also still working on finishing up the sixth and final season of the smash hit Cobra Kai on Netflix, which has racked up eight Emmy nominations so far. Is ending that career chapter bittersweet?
XM: It is bittersweet. It definitely is. I mean, I really grew up with everyone on the show. Just as those high school years are important for kids – those same years, I was spending with these with these guys. So, I just hope that I get to work with them again. I can’t help but feel like the party is ending. Especially with filming this last season, there’s this final tone in the air. But it’s nice and helpful when constructing a story, that we get to end the show on our own accord. We were so blessed for that. I know that I speak for everyone when I say that. We’re so grateful to have done six seasons, that’s crazy. And I just hope that we get to reunite in 30 years and do, you know, Cobra, Kai v2 or whatever that looks like. I love those guys.
VMAN: I love that. So, you’ve had a big year – you made the Forbes 30 Under 30 list last year, as well as Variety’s 2021 Young Hollywood Impact list. Then you were also awarded the Rising Star Impact Award by the National Hispanic Media Coalition in Washington, D.C. So what has all of that success meant to you?
XM: I’m so appreciative of the recognition amongst peers – people that I respect, that I admire, and that I really stand on the shoulders of. It feels surreal. Honestly, all I can say is that I’ve had to make sure to have speeches prepared the past couple of times, because I’m not someone who can go off the cuff when it comes to speeches like that. But yeah, it is so tremendous.
VMAN: I’m sure it feels very surreal. And with Blue Beetle out this August, what direction do you envision the next steps of your career going in with the movie’s outcome?
XM: I hope that people walk out of the theater and love their families a little bit more. And I hope that I get to continue to work with such pleasant and wonderful people. It’s been interesting – the projects that I’ve gotten to be a part of so far, I didn’t necessarily think that I could do them when I booked them. So I haven’t been able to pinpoint exactly what the next steps are. All I can say is that right now, I’m hungry, I’m ready to get back to work. I’m so grateful to be alive right now and to be working at a time that it feels like more people are getting to tell their own stories, as the movie making world becomes a little bit more accessible to a wider variety of people. I’m just so excited for the future for everyone – for myself and for you and for all of us.

With the state of the film and television industry in disarray, as the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes continue to ensure better pay and treatment for writers and actors, the future theatrical release schedule continues to shift. While certain fall releases have already been pushed, August has remained largely untouched. With plenty of festival favorites making their way to the big screen along with heavy-hitting tent poles such as “Blue Beetle,” the month ahead offers an eclectic bunch of releases. With such an array of titles and genres, it will be interesting to see if sequels and spinoffs continue to face lessened interest as original titles such as July’s “Barbie” continue to triumph.

“TMNT: Mutant Mayhem”
Directed by Jeff Rowe and co-director Kyler Spears and written by Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Rowe, Dan Hernandez, and Benji Samit, “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” keeps the pop culture fixture alive. The film follows the four turtle brothers as they venture out into the world after having been kept hidden while growing up in an effort to be accepted by society. Our critic wrote, “In this movie’s wise deconstruction of its characters, “Mutant Mayhem” does the seemingly impossible and makes the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cool again.”
Release Date: In theaters August 2 via Paramount Pictures.
“Meg 2: The Trench”
Jason Stratham takes on a giant shark again in “Meg 2: The Trench.” “Free Fire” and “High Rise” director Ben Wheatley steps in for the sequel as Stratham’s Jonas Taylor leads a research team into the ocean’s depths. The result is a mission that forces them into a survival game against prehistoric sharks. The film stars Wu Jing, Sophia Cai, Page Kennedy, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, Skyler Samuels, and Cliff Curtis (read our review).v
Release Date: In theaters August 4 via Warner Bros. Pictures.
“Shortcomings”
Actor Randall Park makes the jump to director in his debut feature film “Shortcomings” starring Justin H. Min (“After Yang”), Ally Maki (“Hacks”), and Sherry Cola (“Joy Ride.”) The film based on the graphic novel by Adrian Tomine, follows three individuals as they navigate their relationships, their own egos, and the ability to find connections in the modern day. The film premiered at this year’s Sundance, where our critic wrote, “‘Shortcomings’ is an accomplished debut, a profoundly perceptive movie that challenges the status-quo in small, rewarding ways.
Release Date: In theaters August 4 via Sony Pictures Classics.
“Passages”
The recently rated NC-17 “Passages” made a splash at its Sundance debut earlier this year. Directed by Ira Sachs (“Little Men,” “Love is Strange”) and starring the formidable acting trio of Franz Rogowski, Ben Whishaw, and Adèle Exarchopoulos, the film follows what happens when one half of a long-term couple — played by Rogowski and Whishaw — has an affair with a woman, played by Exarchopoulos. Our critic praised the film, writing, “Adroit casting, writing, editing, performing and costuming shade the outline of an affair to a finely sharpened emotional realism, the cycles of fighting and reconciling we’ve all seen before regaining in rawness as if we’re now the ones living through it.”

,SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL - Review and Interview with Director Yuval Adler,McEric shares his thoughts on the new Nicolas Cage/Joel Kinnaman thriller SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL and chats with director Yuval Adler,"We’ve already expressed our excitement for the thriller SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL starring Nicolas Cage and Joel Kinnaman and now it’s finally here. Cage, known for his over-the-top and intense acting style, is right at home in the role of The Passenger - a violent, unhinged man out for revenge. His target is Kinnaman, known as The Driver, whom the Passenger believes to be a catalyst from his own past that irrevocably changed his life for the worse. The Passenger’s mission is to bring the Driver before his former associates to pay for his sins, but not before putting him through the ringer and ensuring his spirit and mind are thoroughly shattered.
Kinnaman’s Driver maintains his innocence, claiming ignorance of this past life, this strange man, or any of these nefarious deeds of which he's been accused. He’s a simple man, trying desperately to get to the delivery room where his wife is giving birth to their second child. She’s understandably nervous as they’d lost a child early in a previous pregnancy, and he complies with his captor as much as is necessary to be done with him and get to his family. The Passenger, however, is not forthcoming with his true intentions at the outset, and as their drive takes them further away from the glittering lights of Las Vegas, he peels away the layers of his subterfuge with a terrible temper and a streak of violence.
This film is a fun watch for Cage fans and another example of Kinnaman’s prowess as a man in unyielding circumstances. It’s the classic “I know you’re not who you say you are” thriller trope that’s existed as long as film itself, and was especially popular in the 90s with films like THURSDAY and EL MARIACHI. Though the film ends in the most predictable “twist” one can imagine (seriously, it’s happened so frequently now that the only original ending would be to undo the twist), it is worth watching at least once for the stellar performances of the two leads who carry the film and ratchet up the tension throughout.
I spoke with director Yuval Adler, who’d worked with Kinnaman a few years prior for the mistaken identity thriller THE SECRETS WE KEEP, and he said he’d had his eyes on this particular script for ten years. As the years crept on the film languished, he checked in frequently, until he was finally able to take on the project himself. The first question I had was about the setting of Las Vegas, a third character of sorts in the world of the film.
“It was set in New York in the winter, originally, and then we moved it to a state that had a tax credit, then we moved it to a state that had a Nicolas Cage in it.”
Cage really lets loose throughout the film, and I noted a few popular affectations of his vocal delivery, including a brief Pacino impersonation and a brief Walken delivery. I asked about Adler’s directing style when it comes to working with such a gifted and unpredictable talent.
“What we really bonded over was the dark sense of humor in the material. He would do stuff and I would laugh, and he would see me laugh behind the monitor and then he’d go even more. So we’d run it and I wouldn’t say ‘cut’ and just let him try things, and he has to trust me to protect him. Most of what he does is completely unusable but if he knows he can trust you to protect him and use the right stuff then he’s not afraid to try and go crazy, which is what happened here.”
As I said, the film is worth a view just for the performances, but the story has been told a hundred times and with more devastating revelation, resulting in a more memorable film overall. Though I was glad to watch SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL, it’s not a film I’d ever intend to watch again, only because I’ve already seen it long before the titles hit the screen.
SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL, released by RLJE Films, is streaming now wherever you rent or buy movies.
Until next time, take care.

2023-08-27 14:41:17-04:00,Box Office Report for the Week of August 27,"Gran Turismo narrowly finishes first on the box office, with Barbie finishing in second place at the last minute. Read more:","It’s National Cinema Day, and movie theaters are once again packed. This time, there are a few new movies to help counter-program the Barbenheimer craze, and it looks like Neill Blomkamp’s Gran Turismo has come out on top. The film was delayed at the last minute a few weeks ago from August 11 to August 25, but early screenings took place on the 11th and 18th to rev up (yes, pun intended) the word-of-mouth on the film.
The bet has paid off, with Gran Turismo making a decent $17.3 million in a dead weekend for new releases. Other films released this weekend, Retribution and The Hill, have made the top ten, with the Liam Neeson remake of 2015’s El desconocido grossing over $3.3 million on a $30 million budget. It’s not a great start for a once modestly bankable action star. As for The Hill, the film finished in ninth position with a $2.5 million cume. It’s a relatively decent start for what’s likely to be a low-budget drama, with Dennis Quaid headlining the picture.
Oscar-winner Guy Nattiv’s Golda was also released in 883 theatres and made a relatively decent $1.5 million. Time will tell if it will expand in more cinemas the following week, but it’s a relatively good start for a movie that has a mixed reception. As for other movies this weekend, Blue Beetle has dropped from first to third place (though many screenings in my area are now sold out thanks to National Cinema Day pricing tickets at $4) and grossed $12.7 million in its second weekend, while Barbie narrowly finished first with a $17.1 million cume this weekend.
Bottoms from Emma Seligman had a strong start in its limited debut. I’m only ten theaters, it grossed $516K, a per-theater average of $51,625. That’s the fourth highest per-theater average of 2023 so far.
IMAX has announced that Barbie will be released on their screens on September 22, with exclusive post-credits footage attached to the movie. I have a feeling that, while Barbie has been knocked out of the top spot for the past two weeks, it’ll make another splash when the IMAX version arrives in theatres soon, especially during a week when there’s not much going on. As more movies get delayed due to the ongoing strikes, expect an even slower fall at the box office than what’s happening.
Some box office pundits have argued that we’ve started to feel the effects of the strike on the box office, but they have been small compared to what’s coming. The end of August weekend is usually quiet at the box office (save for Cinema Day). However, as the fall movie season ramps up with plenty of festivals and Awards-worthy movies without their stars promoting them, expect a massive slowdown in the coming weeks.
Here’s the full list of the top ten films of the weekend:
Gran Turismo (Sony): $17.3M – 3,856 theatres Barbie (Warner Bros.): $17.1M (-18.7%) – 3,736 theatres Blue Beetle (Warner Bros/DC): $12.7M (-49%) – 3,781 theatres Oppenheimer (Universal): $9.0M (-16.1%) – 2,872 theatres Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (Paramount): $6.1M (-28.6%) – 3,145 theatres Meg 2: The Trench (Warner Bros): $5.1M (-24.6%) – 2,932 theatres Strays (Universal): $4.6M (-43.6%) – 3,232 theatres Retribution (Lionsgate): $3.3M – 1,750 theatres The Hill (Briarcliff Entertainment): $2.5M – 1,570 theatres Haunted Mansion (Disney): $2.1M (-30.6%) – 1,630 theatres

2023-07-28 20:10:14-07:00,The Cast of 'Good Omens' Talk the Show's Second Season,"*These interviews with the cast of Good Omens were conducted prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike. At GoC, we fully support the creatives who are part of","*These interviews with the cast of Good Omens were conducted prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike. At GoC, we fully support the creatives who are part of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.

Good Omens is about to return with a second season featuring the dynamic friendship audiences fell in love with during the first installment. Aziraphale (Michael Sheen) and Crowley (David Tennant) saved the world the last time they were seen on the small screen, but a new mystery is going to force them to investigate and find out why Gabriel (Jon Hamm) showed up to their door, completely naked and without any idea of how he ended up on Earth. Added to that, Aziraphale’s former superior doesn’t even remember who he is, setting the stage for a larger threat to arrive into the world of the series.

When asked how Crowley feels motivated while getting used to his new life, David Tennant had interesting things to say about his character: “I think he’s a little bit lost when we first discover him. And I think that the worst that could happen to him was Gabriel showing up at Aziraphale’s bookshop. But it does give him a sense of purpose because he’s fighting for survival again, and he would never claim to finding any joy in that. It sort of weakens him up a bit. There’s something about that, them working together. To solve this mystery, it gives him a prickle of energy, which he doesn’t entirely detest.”

Nina Sosanya and Maggie Service are back for another round of adventures connected to what Crowley and Aziraphale will be up to. However, they won’t be playing the same roles they portrayed during the debut season of the Prime Video comedy. As characters named after themselves, they’ll have to find their own place within the journey that the second season is about to establish, setting the stage for the biggest mystery Heaven and Hell have ever seen.

When asked how her character felt so grounded in a world surrounded by powerful creatures and contexts, Sosanya said, “I think you just stick to the script that Neil Gaiman and John Finnemore have written because they’ve written very relatable characters. I think the tone of Good Omens is very naturalistic, even though some people are playing huge characters. They sort of rub off against each other in quite a nice way. The more naturalistic you are, the more fantastic the others are.”

With the series expanding this season, new characters will be introduced to join the mystery surrounding Gabriel randomly showing up on Earth. Three new angels will become a part of the cast of Good Omens to spice things up a bit. The characters will be played by Quelin Sepulveda, Liz Carr and Shelley Conn, allowing audiences to fall in love yet again with more people that come from the same place Aziraphale used to work in before the finale of the last season.

The new cast members were asked if they had been fans of Good Omens before they were included in the series, and Conn added, “I was a fan, but I hadn’t seen the show. As soon as this came my way, I became a firm fan of the show, to the point where when stepping on set, I felt as if I was having a Good Omens moment.” On the other hand, Sepulveda indicated that she had heard about the show and watched it when she got the audition. Finally, Carr jokingly commented that she wasn’t a fan of the series, explaining that she said that because she hadn’t watched it before.

Good Omens returns to Prime Video on July 28.

,BLUE BEETLE Completes Two Days of Reshoots While AQUAMAN 2 Finalizes Its Third Round of Reshoot Days — GeekTyrant,,"Since James Gunn and Peter Safran took over at DC, they’ve had to do quite a bit of housekeeping in the form of post-production and getting the upcoming films in shape to be released. One of the movies they have put a few finished touches on was the upcoming Blue Beetle, starring Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes, the titular superhero. THR reports that production on the film asked for and received two days of additional shooting, and now it’s ready to go.

Meanwhile, Jason Momoa’s sequel Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is on its third round of reshoots. This is pretty unprecedented, but after two previous rounds of screenings and reshoots that didn’t go well, Gunn is said to have weighed in on the most recent cut, and the leadership approved a five-day shoot. Sources say the shoot went so well that Wan and company completed what they needed in only four.

And to some, the fact that Warners is willing to keep spending money to make the film better shows that the studio has faith in its success. I guess we will just have to wait and see how it all turns out.

Blue Beetle will be released in theatres on August 18, 2023, and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom hits theatres on December 20, 2023.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2dlZWt0eXJhbnQuY29tL25ld3MvYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtY29tcGxldGVzLXR3by1kYXlzLW9mLXJlc2hvb3RzLXdoaWxlLWFxdWFtYW4tMi1maW5hbGl6ZXMtaXRzLXRoaXJkLXJvdW5kLW9mLXJlc2hvb3QtZGF5c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

Departing the luxury venue at 3am, she shielded her eyes with a pair of black sunglasses.

The younger sister of Kate was joined by a pal who went for a casual look, wearing an oversized graphic T-shirt and tan trousers.

Last month love guru Anna Williamson has admitted that Kate Moss 'could learn some upsetting things' about her younger sister Lottie, should she tune in to Celeb's Go Dating.

The OnlyFans model is currently starring on the series alongside presenter Vanessa Feltz, 61, and Love Island's Chloe Burrows, 27, as they hunt for romance.

However, supermodel Kate, 49, is unlikely to watch the show with Lottie previously revealing she 'doesn't really know' her older half-sister and their relationship so distant 'she doesn't reply to my texts'.

Speaking in a new interview, dating agent Anna, 41, shared her hopes for the siblings to mend their broken relationship.

She told The Mirror: 'I would be so intrigued if Kate Moss was going to watch this series, I hope she does, I think she'll find out a lot of interesting and perhaps upsetting things about her sister.'

Anna added: 'I would love it to be able to be, perhaps an olive branch between the two sisters, who I believe, it's no secret that they're not that close.""

'I would love it if Kate would use this opportunity to reach out to her little sister and give her a much-needed hug but I think she needs.'

In a self-penned essay in March, Lottie said that while her sister provided her a useful stepping stone, she was determined to make her own money herself and used her earnings to pay for private schooling at St. Bede's School in Redhill.

The Chelsea socialite also responded to the backlash for a series of Tweets she posted in response to Lily Allen, the daughter of actor Keith Allen and film producer Alison Owen, who launched a defence of celebrity children raised within privileged families.

'I think a common misconception is that because Kate, who is 24 years older than me, is rich and famous, so were my family. But obviously, that was her money and her fame, not ours,' Lottie writes in Newsweek.

Lottie continued: 'I knew that my sister Kate was famous and growing up, I idolised her, thinking she was the coolest. I never got much love or attention from her though, which has always upset me, especially because people have brought her up to me for as long as I can remember.

'How do I say to people that I don't know her and that she doesn't reply to my texts? I honestly think the whole ""nepo baby"" concept is so weird; there are so many people in the world that have had obvious advantages in their career because of who they know or who someone in their family is, not just famous people.'

2023-08-20 22:00:40+00:00,James Gunn Doesn’t Want ‘Superman: Legacy’ Defined as a ‘Young Superman’ Movie,"James Gunn doesn't want his DC film ""Superman Legacy"" branded as a ""Young Superman"" movie.","James Gunn isn’t ready for his Superman movie to be pigeonholed before he shoots a frame of footage.

The filmmaker and DC Studios co-CEO is currently hard at work prepping “Superman: Legacy,” the first film in his reimagined DC Universe that will star David Corenswet as Superman and Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane. In addition to introducing a new actor in one of the most iconic superhero roles in film history, the movie is responsible for establishing the tone for Gunn and Peter Safran’s entire slate of DC movies and shows.

Despite Gunn’s famously transparent Twitter presence, little is known about the specifics of “Superman: Legacy.” Early reporting suggested that Gunn needed a younger actor than Henry Cavill to play Superman because his screenplay follows a young Clark Kent — news that was seemingly confirmed by the casting of Corenswet, who is ten years Cavill’s junior. But Gunn made it clear this week that he doesn’t want fans running with the narrative that he’s simply making a “Young Superman” movie.

A user on Threads recently asked Gunn whether his “Young Superman” movie takes place in the past, to which Gunn responded by writing “I was never making a ‘young Superman’ movie, just a Superman movie!”

Rather than disputing any existing reporting about the film — which Gunn also confirmed in December when he tweeted that “Superman: Legacy” focuses on “an earlier part of Superman’s life” — he appears to be calling for a more nuanced discussion of his film. In comic books, the “young” moniker often signifies a novelty story about a superhero that is removed from the main mythology — a description that Gunn almost certainly wants to avoid for a film that’s intended to launch a cinematic universe.

Throughout the process of developing the film, Gunn has made no secret of his affection for Superman as a character.

“I completely relate to Superman because he’s everything I am,” Gunn said in a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “He’s somebody who is an outsider who feels like an alien, but also the ultimate insider, because he’s fucking Superman. And that’s kind of like what I feel like.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9nZW5lcmFsLW5ld3MvamFtZXMtZ3Vubi1zdXBlcm1hbi1sZWdhY3ktbm90LXlvdW5nLXN1cGVybWFuLW1vdmllLTEyMzQ4OTgwNTgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

2023-08-16 17:13:29+00:00,Laura Moss on the Mothers and Monsters of 'Birth,Laura Moss discusses what Mary Shelley’s 'Frankenstein' means as the starting point for the film's thematic exploration.,"“Dignity and motherhood don’t always line up,” observes Judy Reyes’s Celie in Birth/Rebirth. She offers this pearl of wisdom, an encapsulation of the film’s thesis, with an air of encouragement to Emily, an expectant mother played by Breeda Wool. The rest of Laura Moss’s film, though, is seldom as sanguine when approaching the subject.

Birth/Rebirth restages Mary Shelley’s Romantic-era creation story Frankenstein within the trappings of modern motherhood. Dr. Rose Casper (Marin Ireland), informed by her struggles to conceive, throws herself to experimental research aided by her access to body parts as a morgue technician. This sets her on a collision course with Celie, a Bronx-based maternity nurse, following the unexpected death of her six-year-old daughter, Lila (A.J. Lister).

Rose’s reanimation of Lila brings them into an unconventional co-parenting situation as each alternates between appreciating and abhorring their shared project. The richest drama within Birth/Rebirth comes from watching these visions of motherhood and medicine clash. Moss, who uses they/them pronouns, casts a wary yet wondrous eye toward the inherent contradictions of womanhood exposed by the two characters’ desperate efforts to keep their creation alive.

I spoke with Moss prior to her debut feature’s theatrical opening. Our conversation covered why their backgrounds in production design and serving as an EMT prepared them to lead a set, where the film’s medical adviser aided in the storytelling, and what Frankenstein means as the starting point for Birth/Rebirth’s thematic exploration.

What keeps you interested in the modern mythology created by Mary Shelley?

They’re such elemental themes, specifically around creation and legacy. That was what grabbed me when I first read it, and that’s what keeps me interested in it. Of course, my take on it involves the question of what it means to create life when you can actually gestate life with your body. That’s a whole other element to the Frankenstein story that, it could be argued, might be in the subtext of the novel. I think we’re also entering a period where scientific advancement is at once incredible and happening exponentially in a way that we were having to develop new language around the ethics of gene experimentation and regenerative medicine. Science fiction is becoming science fact, and so I think Frankenstein keeps bubbling up in its relevance.

Is there at all some element of hopefulness, or at least possibility, that the film points to? There’s something around using science and innovation to expand who can bring life into the world beyond those born with a womb.

I mean, I wouldn’t call the film hopeful! I am, frankly, you know, always more interested in the psychology of relationships than I usually am in the technical or, in this case, the scientific. Something I did really want to explore in this film was how many different ways there are to be a parent and a mother, and also kind of the value of non-traditional parenting relationships. If that’s something that’s taken away from the film, I would be thrilled.

Were Celie’s and Rose’s journeys, almost swapping dispositions as it pertains to science and motherhood, always moving in such equal and opposite ways?

Yeah, they were. They weren’t always getting along as well as they do in the final version. I wanted to explore how they’re building their identity, their own sense of self, around very different things. For Rose, it’s her science and legacy. And for Celie, it’s motherhood. I do think that, oftentimes, that opposition is imposed on women by society. You can care about your career or you can care about being a parent, and that should define you. I did want to explore the story of two women who deliberately took what could be viewed as opposite paths, what makes them similar, and what makes them sort of necessarily bonds them to each other.

I loved how Emily’s decision to deliver at Lenox Hill on the Upper East Side becomes the breaking point for Celie. Were you always thinking about how race and class factor into these anxieties around reproduction?

Oh, boy, yeah. There are definitely issues of race and class that are undercurrents of Rose and Celie’s relationship. When you get into the story of birthing in America, you’re inherently wading into issues of racism, especially around Black and brown women who are egregiously underserved by our medical system. I’m a lifelong New Yorker, and it was important to me that this wasn’t set in a nebulously random place. The Bronx is actually a character in this film, and [it was important] that the social dynamics of our reality in New York City weren’t ignored.

You said in describing your short film Fry Day that the obsession with serial killers stems from people wanting “to control chaos and understand the psychology of someone who would do something like that so we can be safe.” That sounds a lot like what you’re exploring in Birth/Rebirth. Did you see these two projects as having connective tissue?

That’s so interesting. On a surface level, Fry Day isn’t related to Birth/Rebirth because it was an actual proof of concept for another feature that I had written. So I don’t think about them as the same, but I think of both of these films as horror-adjacent. They play on some horror tropes and maybe attract people who are fans of horror…or so I’d hope. What I’ve loved about horror since I was a child was its ability to explore things that grown-ups didn’t talk about, like social taboos and dark situations, so that you could confront them head-on in the safe environment of your home. In Fry Day, we have a character who’s photographing this Ted Bundy barbecue [a celebration outside the execution of the serial killer], and her gaze on the situation is definitely related to Rose’s unflinching gaze on bodies and viscera. I mean, the feature begins with her taking photographs of a body, so there’s definitely some connection.

What is the effect of co-writing with Brendan O’Brien, who you credit with helping add dramatic structure to the film? Is it helpful to have a different perspective to help illuminate elements of the project?

Brendan and I have worked together on everything that we’ve ever written and probably will write. I have no interest in writing without a co-writer. It’s a necessary part of my process. The idea will usually generate from one of us, and we brainstorm the idea together to come up with a rough outline. Brendan is the one that does the first vomit draft, which, frankly, I’m too self-critical to ever be able to do. If that was my job, it would never get written. And then I come with my structural and visual eye to do a lot of scalpel work. It’s a process that works really well for us. I’m in awe of people who do it by themselves.

You came up to make your feature debut through production design. Are you able to think tactically like a craftsperson and thematically in the big picture like a writer-director simultaneously?

One of the benefits of being a production designer before a director is that I just got to watch a lot of directors’ work. Being a director is quite lonely. When you’re the director on set, you’re never really in a community with other directors. So, as a designer, I got to see great practices—and maybe not-so-great practices—of other directors. Production design is also filmmaking. You’re trying to make aesthetic choices that support the journey and psychology of the characters. I really do think it’s a helpful step on the journey to directing. It’s also really helpful when you’re an independent filmmaker because, as a production designer, I know what things cost. I know how to make the most out of a dollar, really. I always valued the directors who had a sense of what direction they’d be shooting in so that we didn’t have to dress the set in 360 degrees. I put a lot of thought and care into that when I’m prepping as a director now.

What did you take in terms of set management from some of the productions that you’ve worked on to inform the way that you ran Birth/Rebirth?

It’s funny, before I was in film production, I was an EMT. I always say that was the best training for directing that I received—learning how to work under pressure and trust a team implicitly to get things done when people are literally screaming “emergency!” at you. But maybe the best experience that allows you to be confident is just learning that films are made one shot at a time. Working in production for so many years just demystified the process and made me less intimidated and more able to believe in myself. I’ve seen how it’s done and that it can be done.

How did your EMT background play into the scientific elements of the film? Where did you need a medical adviser to push the knowledge further beyond your own?

My certification lapsed a long time ago. Having that experience, I knew enough to know how little I knew. And it was after the first draft of this script that Brendon and I realized we had come as far as we could with basic research. We had read a couple of books and several articles about stem cell research and regenerative medicine, but we were in over our heads. I was able to connect with Emily Ryan, a pathologist who eventually became our on-set medical adviser. I told her to please redline this script. She pointed out every inconsistency and questionable detail but with the mind of a storyteller. She wouldn’t just poo-poo our ideas, she would say, “I see why you need this to happen in the script. Here’s a more accurate way that you could make this happen.” She was a real creative partner in the process, and I feel really lucky to have her.

Were those details of medical realism as much for you all in making the film as they were for the audience?

Balancing the jargon was hard because we didn’t want to overwhelm the audience. Frankly, [their] understanding the details of the science wasn’t our aim. It was to create this bed of realism that was strong enough that when we asked them to go to crazy places with us, the audience was able to go there. We just really didn’t want the average person questioning the science that was proposed. That’s my hope: that the audience isn’t overwhelmed by the medicine, but that they’re also not pulled out by something that they can sniff out as bullshit.

Do you have to tap into a different set of skills when it comes to directing actors?

It’s a little different because you can be miserable and still do your job as a crew member. Because their faces don’t lie, actors require a certain amount of comfort. You need to create an environment of play, which is a difficult thing to do on sets that are essentially construction sites. There are so many logistical things that need to happen and often so many time pressures. A huge part of the director’s job, I believe, is being expansive and creating space for actors so that they don’t necessarily feel the pressure and the pain that the rest of us are experiencing.

Marin Ireland’s performance as Rose is so perfectly dialed up. How do you find the right level for something that can be a little heightened in the trappings of genre but still needs to be believable in reality?

That character is based partially on me and partially on certain other people in my life. I shared my experiences with Marin, and she certainly shared her experiences with me of people in her life that this character reminded her of. But I think the most essential thing, and Marin does this naturally, was to make sure that Rose was only ever being helpful from her own perspective. This is a character that does very extreme things and has blinders on. It’s a pretty myopic view of the world. The integrity of Rose’s intentions, her real dedication and belief that what she was doing was really an incredibly important good thing, Marin never lost sight of that. She’s never betraying or making fun of that character. She’s playing her with a lot of love and honesty.

Was it a challenge to calibrate Ireland’s performance opposite Judy Reyes’s arguably more grounded, realistic turn?

They really found their characters when they started working together. The first scene that we shot with the two of them was a few days into production. It was the pathology lab, the first time those characters meet as well. I remember a grip remarking to an electrician after the first setup that their chemistry was just electric.

Jason Bourne series’ main titles, or perhaps The Italian Job. Experiencing euphoria? How to Train Your Dragon’s Oscar-nominated flight theme. Getting out of drama? Thanks to social media, this cadence from Drumline. You get the idea, and hopefully the hint that our English composer’s name should be on our minds more often, especially when his contributions to cinematic scoring have titles like those named.

In July, Powell was nominated for his first Primetime Emmy Award, Outstanding Music Composition for a Documentary Series or Special (Original Dramatic Score), for STILL: A Michael J. Fox Movie. Director Davis Guggenheim’s stirring and, at times, incredibly jovial AppleTV+ film about the Back to the Future star and activist’s interactions with fame and Parkinson’s is the first documentary project in Powell’s 30+ year career. It also guides him toward being an Emmy nominee for the first time.

I was fortunate enough to catch up with Powell to further explore his nomination for STILL, syncing up with Fox’s outlook, tips for scoring documentaries and a preview of his approach for Illumination’s Migration.

Nguyên Lê: I was wondering whether an Emmy is an item on your to-do or a welcoming surprise?

John Powell: Definitely the latter — it never sort of occurred to me that this would be eligible for the Emmys. And the Emmys are great because they have more than one score category [to award], so if I’d been up against some of the things in some of those other categories, I’m sure I wouldn’t have had a chance. But given that they’re so receptive to documentaries, I think it was a lucky, lucky moment for me.

NL: Your score for STILL seems to really adhere to the notion “Michael J. Fox’s film life is Michael J. Fox’s real life.” That has me wondering about two things. First, how close did you have to work with your music supervisor to sustain this effect?

JP: Well, Randy [Randall] Poster was the music supervisor, and he basically was the one who introduced me to Davis, who had been, I think, asking about me. And I was working on another film with Randy. But by the time I came on, a lot of the needle drops, all these other pieces of music, were set. Randy, Davis and [editor Michael Harte] had already sort of constructed the film with these moments, already knowing that they were gonna have them. I got to walk into something that was a little bit more solidified. And I knew, kind of, where my moments would be and where I wouldn’t need to worry — obviously the needle drops, but also, for instance, they’d already cut together very brilliantly the whole sequence with Back to the Future using Alan Silvestri’s music. That was already there! I was very glad not to have to do that!

But I had to worry about it in the sense that, you know, I couldn’t just ride roughshod over those moments. Since they were already set and they were working extremely well, you’re kind of backing yourself into some tight spaces at times.

NL: Now for the second: Your score here takes a gentler approach, but it still attempts to maximize a character many would minimize. Did you call upon your experience in animation scoring for STILL? At any point or at all?

JP: You know, I was asked to go and see Davis based on the fact that his daughter had suggested me. Seemed like a strange idea, but I think it came from a conversation where Davis was, “Who are the composers out there that write very joyful music?” And I think his daughter basically said, “There’s that score to How to Train Your Dragon” … I think he found that there was a lot of music I’d done where I would kind of dance through the movie. And that’s really what Michael does: He dances through life.

NL: Right.

JP: And the fact he can’t dance quite as fast anymore, it doesn’t, in any way, diminishes the character he really is — a fast-moving, enjoying-his-life guy. And the story is that he runs — smack! — into this giant problem. And we sit there and watch how he figures his life and how he stops himself from falling apart. It’s a very optimistic story. So most of the film, I felt should be treated that way, and it came naturally to me as it were. The tough bits were obviously how do you deal with such serious subjects? How do you not overplay them and not over-sentimentalize those things?

I also didn’t feel that the story that Davis was trying to sell was. “Here’s a man who’s had everything and had it all taken away.” And all he did was find more meaning in his life, more value in his life and has enjoyed it even more, despite everything. You know, rising that high and then falling that low — that normally suggests somebody crashes. It’s not that he didn’t fall, but he has decided to take an approach to life I think we can all value. So trying to find music that represented that part of him, rather than the expected one, about the crash, the fall, the depression and all that? That’s not what we needed to get from the film. We needed the other story. We needed the hero we would love to think we could be. It was great to see somebody who actually did that.

NL: I reckon that had this documentary been animated, your score would still work…

JP: [laughs] Yeah. I mean, in a way, he’s one of the most animated characters I’ve ever worked on.

NL: We actually crossed a bit into my next question. How do you make sure that your score won’t be regarded as “manipulative”?

JP: I apply a sort of rule, which is that the first time I see a film I’ll watch it without any temp. I literally do try and come on as late into the process as I can, as it’s safe to do, so that the first time I’d watch the film, the film has found itself already. And when I watch it with no music, I’d get as honest a reaction from it as the audience will. The only difference is that they’ll have music, and I don’t. But that’s OK, because any music I hear in there will just distract me because I’m watching as a composer. Then the trick is not to write music that distracts anybody else! And to be, always, just slightly behind where I am as an audience member … I’m trying to match where I’m authentically as an audience member feeling things. And then also let it support what I felt the first time through, not manipulate or overreach into emotions I wouldn’t want doing.

And that’s all I can be. All the music I write is based on my own tastes, and the way I put it in the film is based on my own tastes in the sense of, “That’s how I felt about the film.” If I watch a film and it doesn’t work for me, and I have had these situations, I either have to back out or I have to say to the filmmaker, “Well, what do you wish that I’d felt because I didn’t feel it?” Then we can talk about pushing it harder there.

NL: Right.

JP: And there are films where it feels OK to do that because it’s part of the language of that film. This film didn’t. It would just explode on me if I tried it, I could tell. It felt like if I put the wrong thing on it, it’d immediately cause a rash.

And I’m describing a film but I’m also describing a film that’s built around the character of Michael J. Fox. He’s not going to take anybody’s sympathies. He just wants to live life, and he wants you to know that he wants to live life. He doesn’t need your feelings of sorrow for him, he’s too busy getting on with his life. That continuum of optimism and hope is all the stuff that worked.

I also had all the help in the world from the director and the editor — from their reactions. I mean, that’s the truth of it: At a certain point, they became the audience members to what I was then working on. We all kind of take turns in being authentic listeners of the story and our reactions. I tried to hold onto, always, my reaction to the first time I saw the film. There’ve been a few films where I’ve been on so early I can’t tell what the story is.

NL: Oh?

JP: Happy Feet was very hard. When I started it, there was nothing. That was a difficult experience. But generally, I’m much more useful to filmmakers if they wait, and then we find that perfect moment when the film is coagulating correctly for them. And then they show it to me with no music, and I will basically get an honest reaction for them. You know, when it works, I don’t need music for it to tell me how wonderful a film is sometimes. STILL was one of the ones where when I watched it without music, it was profound already.

NL: Is there a little known fact or a misconception in need of correction about scoring documentaries that you would like to share?

JP: A little-known fact and misconception, in my mind, is that it’s going to be quite easy! It was very hard [laughs]. I mean it took me five months to do 39 minutes of music, which is not really tenable in my industry. I did a lot more tripping over than Michael J. Fox did on this one so…

NL: What can we expect from your next project, Migration?

JP: Well [laughs], let’s just say after having sort of controlled myself on STILL, I didn’t for this one. You’re going to hear me at my best and worst! I just let it rip.

The funny thing is, I’ll tell you, was that the filmmaker and I had a meeting. He wanted me to do the film, and everything went great, fine. Then while he was, I think, traveling from America back to France where he lives, he watched Don’t Worry Darling. He got to the end of the film, saw my name, immediately called the studio and said, “Have we… have we hired the wrong person for this?! Because, this guy— It’s never going to fit our film.” He had a point! [laughs]

I think what you’d see is definitely more me having fun. I went full on for the flying theme again, because I think it’s a wonderful thing that humans have always forever dreamed of. I enjoyed it immensely.

NL: Thank you so much for this chat, Mr. Powell. I hope one day to see you scoring a Vietnamese film.

JP: That would be another humbling experience!

John Powell is Emmy-nominated in the category of Outstanding Music Composition for a Documentary Series or Special (Original Dramatic Score) for STILL: A Michael J. Fox Movie, which currently streaming on AppleTV+

The latest DC superhero adventure claimed the No. 1 spot despite a softer-than-expected debut of $25.4 million.

At the international box office, “Blue Beetle,” starring Xolo Maridueña as the alien symbiote, added $18 million from 63 markets. With $43 million globally, it’s one of the softest starts in the history of the DC Cinematic Universe.

More from Variety

After four consecutive weekends in first place, “Barbie” landed on her feet at second place with $21.5 million from 4,003 theaters, a huge result at this point in its theatrical run. After five weeks of release, Greta Gerwig’s fantasy-comedy has generated $567 million and will soon overtake Universal’s animated “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” ($574 million) as the biggest domestic release of the year.

“Blue Beetle” cost more than $100 million to produce and many millions more to promote, so it’ll need to defy the box office odds to justify its price tag. Reviews and word of mouth may not do much to fill seats; the film has a “B+” CinemaScore and 77% on Rotten Tomatoes. In a note to press, Warner Bros. suggested the impact of Tropical Storm Hilary “is anticipated to be significant, particularly in Southern California where the film is over‐indexing.”

It’s the third DC film in 2023 to tumble out of the gate after “Shazam: Fury of the Gods” ($30.1 million in March) and “The Flash” ($55 million in June). Even 2021’s “The Suicide Squad,” which debuted simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max, enjoyed a bigger start with $26.2 million. But that film — as well as “Shazam 2” and “The Flash,” which flopped in their theatrical runs — were based on higher-profile characters compared to Blue Beetle.

Story continues

Directed by Ángel Manuel Soto, the film centers on college graduate Jaime Reyes, who gets chosen to become a symbiotic host to an ancient alien biotech relic that turns him into the superhero known as Blue Beetle. A fourth DC adaptation, “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” is slated to release in December before the studio’s new chiefs James Gunn and Peter Safran take the faltering comic book universe in an entirely new direction.

“After a dozen nearly flawless years, the [comic book] genre has performed unevenly during the last 3-and-a-half years,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “We’re going to know more about superheroes in November and December,” he adds in reference to “Aquaman 2” as well as Disney’s sequel “The Marvels” on Nov. 10. “Those two films will determine the state of superheroes in 2023 and going forward.”

Universal’s talking-dog comedy “Strays” also stumbled in its debut, digging up a paltry $8.3 million from 3,223 theaters for a fifth-place finish. The R-rated movie cost $46 million and could struggle overseas, where funny films tend to have limited appeal. It flopped at the international box office with $1.9 million from 21 territories for a global tally of $10 million.

“This is a soft opening,” says Gross. “Audience ratings are good, with lukewarm reviews from critics.”

Theatrical comedies are a rare breed in Hollywood these days, and even with a starry voice cast of Will Ferrell and Jamie Foxx, “Strays” fared far worse than Jennifer Lawrence’s raunchy “No Hard Feelings” ($15 million) and Universal’s drug-fueled “Cocaine Bear” ($23 million). It barely beat Bert Kreischer’s stand-up inspired “The Machine,” which crumbled with $5 million.

“Strays” landed behind two holdovers, Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” and Paramount’s “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.”

“Oppenheimer” took third place with $11 million in its fifth weekend of release, bringing ticket sales to $286 million. The R-rated historical drama crossed $700 million at the global box office over the weekend, surpassing 2014’s “Interstellar” ($714 million) to stand as Nolan’s fourth-highest grossing movie. It’s the fourth-biggest release of the year behind “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” ($1.35 billion), “Barbie” ($1.27 billion) and “Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3” ($845 million).

Paramount’s “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” landed at the No. 4 spot with $8.4 million from 3,477 venues. After three weekends on the big screen, the animated family comedy has grossed $88.1 million in North America and $30 million internationally. It cost $70 million and will end up as a modest box office performer.

At the specialty box office, Park Chan-Wook’s 2003 vengeance thriller “Oldboy” returned to 250 theaters in honor of its 20th anniversary. The film grossed $880,000 in five days and will cross $1 million in its first week of re-release, an impressive result for a re-release. The top-performing cities were San Francisco, New York City, and Los Angeles at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas, according to Neon.

Elsewhere, “Meg 2: The Trench” swam past the $300 million mark with worldwide ticket sales at $316.6 million. A majority of those returns are coming from international territories, where the shark sequel has grossed $250 million. The follow-up isn’t living up to its predecessor, 2018’s “The Meg,” which earned $145 million in North America and $529 million globally. At the domestic box office especially, “The Trench” has been shark bait in the wake of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.”

“We were sent the five-year compilation video of Saturday Night Live’s first five years a few years ago, and I gave one to my daughter,” she recalled in an interview with People. “We were out visiting her daughter one Christmas, and her husband said, ‘Have you ever watched any of these? And I said, ‘God, I haven’t seen them in a long time.'”

She continued, “He said, would you mind if we watch one? And I said, ‘No, great! Pick one!’ So we sat around the TV, and I had that sort of anticipatory, open-mouth grin that people have when they’re waiting for something to happen, that they know is going to be really great. And … it never happened. It wasn’t funny. Not one thing was funny. There was not one utterance of a laugh or a giggle.”

Curtin was one of the original Not Ready For Prime Time Players of the show’s inaugural season in 1975. The star would remain on the show through the 1979-1980 season of the NBC sketch show.

Curtin attributes the unfunniness of SNL now due to it being “dated” as it was a topical and live TV show adding, “Remember, this was almost 50 years ago. But after we rewatched, I was like, ‘That really wasn’t a very good show. It was terrible!'”

“All I ever wanted was consistency,” Steele told Megyn Kelly in an interview Thursday on SiriusXM’s The Megan Kelly Show.

Steele sued ESPN and corporate parent Disney in April 2022 for allegedly violating both her contract ad free speech rights. In the lawsuit, Steele alleged she had been “sidelined” by the network in 2021 after she made controversial remarks about ESPN’s Covid policy and former President Barack Obama’s ethnic identity, questioning the fact the Obama identifies as Black, given the circumstances of his upbringing.

Kelly pointed to several instances where several of Steele’s fellow ESPN colleagues spoke out on controversial political issues without repercussion. Steele reminded that she made her comments on a podcast, not on-the-air on ESPN, on her personal time.

“And if we are allowing my peers to go on social media, much less on our own airwaves, saying things … that have nothing to do with sports that are political, … then I should be allowed on my personal time to give my opinion on my experiences personally, without telling others what to do … I think that’s just what breaks my heart. That there were different rules for me than everyone else.”

Steele had been pulled from several assignments and told Kelly she was forced to apologize for her remarks before ESPN would allow her to return to the air. She told Kelly she felt that she had no choice.

“I did not want to apologize,” Steele said. “I fought. I fought and I begged and I screamed, and I was told that if I want to keep my job, I have to apologize. … I knew there was a line somewhere. I just didn’t know where it was until I crossed it.”

In a statement Tuesday on X/Twitter, Steele announced she was leaving the network so she could “exercise her First Amendment rights more freely.”

“I mean, there were people who used to look at us at that time and say, ‘Where is the band?’” recalls LL Cool J of hip-hop’s early years and the reaction audiences would have.

As the genre hits its 50th birthday on August 11, no one is asking where the band is anymore. The culture that has emerged out of what Kool Herc was doing that night in 1973 in the rec room of 1520 Sedgwick Ave. in the West Bronx is the most popular musical genre on the planet.

One of the first mainstream stars of hip-hop, LL Cool J himself has come a long way from dropping his “I Need a Beat” single back in 1984. A multi-Grammy winner, a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer and the first rapper to receive a Kennedy Center Honor, the multiplatinum-selling LL also has become a star of the big and small screen with Toys and NCIS: Los Angeles.

Tonight, Queens-raised LL will headline the Rock the Bells Festival at Forest Hills Stadium alongside the likes of The Roots, Run-D.M.C, fellow CBSer Queen Latifah, De La Soul and Rakim, to name a few. On August 11, LL will start up Round 2 of The F.O.R.C.E. (Frequencies of Real Creative Energy) Live tour with The Roots, DJ Jazzy Jeff, DJ Z-Trip and a mash-up of some of hip-hop’s finest. With a September stop in LA, the tour will culminate on November 19 in Boston.

A self-admitted fan as much as icon, LL has emerged as one of hip-hop’s foremost chroniclers with his Rock the Bells business and initiative. Coming off ringing the opening bell on the Nasdaq this week as a part of celebrating hip-hop’s golden anniversary, LL spoke with me about the history of the genre, the culture and how it all looks from his perspective.

DEADLINE: What was it, who was it, that drew you into hip-hop growing up?

LL COOL J: I know when I heard the Cold Crush Brothers and when I heard Flash or what I heard Run-D.M.C. or the Beastie Boys, I just was attracted to that magnetic confidence and energy in the musical dynamics. It just it just made me crazy, man. I just loved it. I fell in love with it instantly. It’s like what I was born for. How about you?

DEADLINE: When I was a kid, I saw Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five open for the Clash. and I was like, “This is where it’s at.“

LL COOL J: Yeah, and you think about the Clash having Flash open for them — there was a lot of backlash, I remember at that time. People were like, “Oh, who was this they bring it on tour?” and Grandmaster Flash and the Five ended up crushing it and being one of the most revolutionary groups

You know, it’s that magnetic confidence — you’re a kid and you love it. I think, as you grow older, evolve as an artist, maintaining that creative inspiration and maintaining that joy, and maintaining that energy, that jovial vibe. That feeling. It just works, man — that’s really how it was done. And that is about dreaming, right? Like if you want to accomplish anything, you got to dream. And then you got what you got to act. So you got to listen, you got to learn and you got to act. You got to take action.

DEADLINE: Certainly, hip-hop had established itself in New York by the early 1980s, but you went on some of the first tours taking it outside the five boroughs. What was that like back then?

LL COOL J: (Laughs) I mean, there were people who used to look at us at that time and say, “Where is the band?” Right? “What are you doing to those record players?” So those turntables, I used to call them record players. I remember going to Maine and having to explain to people that my DJ was cutting the record back and forth and, you know, like actually having to do a tutorial on what they were witnessing just so they could have some context, so that they can relate. But, you know, the flip side of that is they were curious and showed up.

DEADLINE: Now, you are heading back out on your first arena tour in decades with The Roots, plus the God MC himself Rakim, Queen Latifah, Big Boi, Method Man and Redman, many more. It’s all going to conclude on September 3 here in L.A. What brought you back on the road like that for the 50th anniversary?

LL COOL J: Well, we’re actually doing some really innovative because we’re combining the band and the DJs

DEADLINE: Oh.

LL COOL J: Yeah, so I got DJ Z-Trip, DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Roots. So this is a whole new take on live hip-hop performances. It won’t be like anything that anybody has seen because it’s not just acoustic, it’s a mash-up of all of these vibes and sounds. I think that that’s going to be take it to another level, you know?

DEADLINE: In a way that seems like the perfect celebration of the 50th anniversary of Hip-Hop, unto itself.

LL COOL J: I appreciate you saying that, I think it is.

It’s perfect for us because it’s what we love to do and what we want to do, right? You know, we had so much fun doing the Grammys — that’s where the idea was sparked. We performed on the Grammys together, and it was myself and The Roots obviously and then all the other acts were involved ..

DEADLINE: That tribute was amazing, everyone was there, and it was seamless …

LL COOL J: Well, that’s the goal for the tour. The F.O.R.C.E. Tour is like the Grammys tribute to hip-hop from February’s ceremony. It’s a celebration of all of this music, but it’s mashed up so this act, that act, this act, me coming out, them coming out, I come out — it’s not conventional. It’s not kinda like, “Oh, we stop and then there’s a set change.’ It’s like once that first downbeat starts, and once that first turntable scratch happens, you know, we’re off to the races for the rest of the night.

DEADLINE: I know you’ve heard this before, but as you get ready for the show at Forest Hills Stadium with the Rock the Bells Festival and then the F.O.R.C.E. Tour, there’s also that large swath of your fan base who know you as an actor, on NCIS: LA and more, not as a rapper. Does that negate some of your legacy for you, or do you see it as an opportunity of sorts?

LL COOL J: It’s funny you say that, because I been thinking about it a lot recently. It definitely doesn’t make me feel like anything negated. I mean, if anything, I’m just blessed to have more than one talent. So to me, it is absolutely an opportunity … remember that’s not everybody … a lot of our listeners on our Rock the Bells radio channel are under 25. But there are a lot many who see me as a host, some don’t even know I act. To me, I do think it’s an opportunity to put people up on something new. You come to the Rock the Bells festival. You come to the LL Cool J tour. For some people, it is going to be a new experience, and that’s OK.

DEADLINE: In a way, you are going back to your own roots with this tour, with The Roots …

LL COOL J: Kind of. Look, hip-hop has never had a Santana moment. Hip-hop has never had an artist that was able to go away for a decade and then reappear. To re-emerge and impact new generations in a major way. Partially that’s because the genre is so young.

Beyond me, that is what I want to do for hip-hop culture. I looked at the way Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan and Paul McCartney and those guys were treated in the rock genre. Then I looked at how the Rakims, the Method Mans and Ludacris and different acts were treated in this genre. And I say, “You know what, these artists deserve to be celebrated at a higher level. They deserve to play on the biggest stages and be seen in the biggest way.” This festival, the tour, is not about LL Cool J. It’s about my desire to see hip-hop culture celebrated and elevated at the highest level.

DEADLINE: With the 50th anniversary coming next week, your career has in many ways spanned most of the first five decades of the genre. Not a position a lot of artists in any genre, in any medium, find themselves in – as an artist and, with Rock the Bells, an archivist to some degree. What’s your perspective on that?

LL COOL J: It makes me feel amazing, because this is what I wanted to see. I wanted, I wanted the new generations of hip-hop and the earliest generations of hip-hop to be able to coexist and to be equally as popular with their cohorts, so to speak.

For everybody to be able to be respected and loved and be able to have fun and do music and do shows at a high level and be on top. I believe in hip-hop. I respect hip-hop artists as much as I respect to Miles Davis or Charlie Parker and various acts and other genres. I love the fact that people are celebrating it. I just want the celebrations to be done at the right level executed properly. And it’s all good.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvaGlwLWhvcC01MHRoLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LWxsLWNvb2wtai1pbnRlcnZpZXctMTIzNTQ1NTA5Mi_SAVlodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4L2hpcC1ob3AtNTB0aC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1sbC1jb29sLWotaW50ZXJ2aWV3LTEyMzU0NTUwOTIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-22 13:00:00+00:00,Why Strike Delays Might Be Good for DC and Marvel Superhero Movies,"With ""Kraven"" sent to 2024 and ""Deadpool 3"" on production hiatus, the ongoing labor stoppages give studios a chance to rethink their strategies","DC’s “Blue Beetle,” with its soft $25 million opening, is the latest superhero movie to prove that the genre isn’t the surefire box office hit it used to be. And whether or not the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes are taking their toll, studios could use this time to take another look at their superhero movie strategies.

“What’s affecting superhero movies or other big IP franchises isn’t a labor stoppage,” a top agent told TheWrap. “It’s that Gen Z is now the main theatre-going demographic and they don’t care about superheroes nearly as much as Millennials and Gen X. And that’s a massive problem for Marvel/DC.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL3N0cmlrZXMtaHVydC1zdXBlcmhlcm8tbWFydmVsLWRjLW1vdmllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-21 15:43:00+00:00,Christopher Nolan Reveals Why Josh Hartnett Passed On Playing Batman,"During a recent interview for Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan opened up about nearly casting Josh Hartnett as Batman in his trilogy instead of Christian Bale.","Christopher Nolan is once more set to take the box office by storm with his newest film Oppenheimer. During a recent interview for the project, he opened up about nearly casting Josh Hartnett as Batman in his trilogy instead of Christian Bale.

Many people consider Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy some of the greatest superhero films of all time, with Christian Bale’s performance as Bruce Wayne being no small part of that. However, it seems as though Bale wasn’t always a part of the filmmaker’s vision. During a recent interview for Oppenheimer, the auteur filmmaker revealed he had originally approached Josh Hartnett for the role before the offer was turned down:

“No, it never got that far,” Nolan told Variety. “I met with Josh and if I recall, he was a young actor whose work I was very interested in. I had an initial conversation with him but he had read my brother’s script for ‘The Prestige’ at the time and was more interested in getting involved with that. So it never went further than that.”

It seems impossible to imagine a world where Christian Bale wasn’t Batman in Christopher Nolan’s critically acclaimed trilogy. While Josh Hartnett would’ve certainly done a good job, Bale’s take on the character continues to have ripple effects in comics, animation, and movies to this day. While there have certainly been crazier near misses for casting in superhero films, such as Joaquin Phoenix being eyed to play Doctor Strange, it’s certain this will go down as one of the most fascinating.

The future of the Batman series

The first movie ended with Batman apprehending the Riddler, who has flooded Gotham City, though details about Part II are currently scarce. Matt Reeves is co-writing the script of the sequel with Mattson Tomlin.

The heads of DC Studios recently revealed that The Batman: Part II is set to hit theaters on October 2025. The first movie earned $770.8 million at the worldwide box office, a figure that makes it the seventh highest-grossing movie of 2022.

Section: Special Presentations

Director: David Yates

Screenwriter: Wells Tower

Logline: Pain Hustlers is the story of a woman named Liza Drake (Emily Blunt), a struggling divorcee who gets a job at a low-rent pharma company. She transforms it into a hugely successful company, but in doing so, she starts to cross a few red lines in terms of the moral journey she’s on.

U.S. Distributor: Netflix

Panelists: David Yates (director and producer), Lawrence Gray (producer)

First Screening: Sept. 11, 2023.

Key Quote: “It’s really an American parable about how ambition and greed and naivety can overrun you and take you to some pretty dark places. I’d been making lots of big fantasy movies, and I was having a fun time, but I wanted to go back to my roots and do something that was a bit more earthed.” – David Yates.

2023-08-10 01:22:43+00:00,‘Stranger Things’ Star David Harbour Looks Beyond The Upside Down Toward The Future,"""Stranger Things"" is ending with its fifth season, but star David Harbour already has his eyes on what's next.","David Harbour has the fifth and final season of “Stranger Things” in front of him, awaiting strike settlements before production begins.

But he’s already looking at what comes next.

“The first year of “Stranger Things,” I remember having a discussion with a publicist and her saying, ‘Maybe you don’t want to be associated with the show so much,’ and I was like, ‘Why? I love this show. I love the character,'” he told Insider in an interview. “And I do love the show. And I do love the character. But I don’t want to be just that character. I don’t want to be just that guy.”

Harbour has gotten a head start on his next phase. He plays Red Guardian in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a bloody Santa Claus in the film Violent Night, the title character in a Hellboy reboot, and a racing coach in the upcoming Gran Turismo.

Violent Night was the first box office hit Harbour carried. The 2022 action/comedy film followed Harbour playing Santa Claus. Jolly Old Saint Nick fights mercenaries who have taken a wealthy family hostage.

“I’ve been on Netflix … but this was a small original movie that’s going to a cinema. A whole new world opened up for me with that,” Harbour said. “I like this playing field. I want to make original movies that go to the movie theaters.”

Harbour drew a parallel with another TV tar who exited from a prominent series to achieve bigger things.

“I think about George Clooney leaving “ER,'” he said. “Now we just see him as George Clooney. But there was a time when it was, ‘The guy from “ER” is doing a movie with Nicole Kidman.'”

“I’m trying to navigate some of that,” he continued. “It’s tricky because you don’t want to s— on the people that love you for this thing that you did that you also love. But at the same time, you kind of want to leave the nest. I got more in me. I got different stuff in me, and I want you guys to see that. I don’t want people yelling ‘Hopper’ on the street every five minutes the rest of my life.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvc3RyYW5nZXItdGhpbmdzLXN0YXItZGF2aWQtaGFyYm91ci1sb29rcy1iZXlvbmQtdGhlLXVwc2lkZS1kb3duLTEyMzU0NTkyOTkv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC9zdHJhbmdlci10aGluZ3Mtc3Rhci1kYXZpZC1oYXJib3VyLWxvb2tzLWJleW9uZC10aGUtdXBzaWRlLWRvd24tMTIzNTQ1OTI5OS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-19 18:00:00+02:00,"""Blue Beetle"": Die zwei Post-Credit-Szenen erklärt – wer ist da zu sehen und was passiert am Ende?","Wie bei den meisten Superheldenfilmen gibt es auch in „Blue Beetle“ wieder zwei Abspannszenen. Während die Mid-Credit-Szene auf „Blue Beetle 2“ hindeutet, ist die Post-Credit-Szene mit El Chapulín Colorado ein Meta-Gag à la „Deadpool“.","Vom Arrowverse bis ""The Dark Knight"" und vom DCEU über ""Joker"" und ""The Batman"" bis hin zum neuen DCU behält Julius auch im DC-Multiversum den Überblick.

Wie bei den meisten Superheldenfilmen gibt es auch in „Blue Beetle“ wieder zwei Abspannszenen. Während die Mid-Credit-Szene auf „Blue Beetle 2“ hindeutet, ist die Post-Credit-Szene mit El Chapulín Colorado ein Meta-Gag à la „Deadpool“.

Kaum ein Superhelden-Blockbuster kommt ohne sie aus und auch in „Blue Beetle“ gibt es sie: Abspannszenen. Die Mid-Credit-Szene des neuen DC-Films deutet an, wie es in einer möglichen Fortsetzung weitergehen könnte, während die Post-Credit-Szene „nur“ ein kleiner Meta-Gag ist, hinter dem aber auch eine spannende Geschichte steckt. Doch fangen wir mit der Mid-Credit-Szene an:

Die Mid-Credit-Szene: Ted Kord lebt!

Bereits im Verlauf von „Blue Beetle“ war mehrmals von Ted Kord die Rede, der den Mantel des Blue Beetle vor Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) trug, bis er eines Tages spurlos verschwand. Sein Käfer-Equipment nutzt die Familie Reyes im Film, um Jaime tatkräftig im Kampf gegen die Bösewichte Victoria Kord und Carapax zu unterstützen, doch die erste Abspannszene zeigt nun: Ted Kord lebt tatsächlich noch und versucht das auch seiner Tochter Jenny (Bruna Marquezine) mitzuteilen.

Im Interview verriet uns „Blue Beetle“-Regisseur Angel Manuel Soto, dass diese Enthüllung schon ganz am Anfang so geplant war und er und Drehbuchautor Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer unbedingt Ted Kord unterbringen wollten: „Wir wollten, dass es für Jenny auch Hoffnung gibt, weil ihr Vater noch lebt.“ Gleichzeitig habe man aber bewusst nicht das Gesicht von Ted Kord gezeigt, und zwar aus zwei Gründen:

Jason Sudeikis als Ted Kord? Erstmal nicht!

Erstens sollte so sichergestellt werden, dass „Blue Beetle“ wirklich Jaimes Geschichte ist und er nicht durch einen Auftritt seines Vorgängers überschattet wird. Und zweitens wollte man sich für die Zukunft von „Blue Beetle“ und Jaime Reyes alle Optionen offenhalten. „James Gunn hat bereits gesagt, dass Jaime Teil des neuen DC-Universums (DCU) ist“, erklärte Soto dazu. „Wir wollten, dass offen bleibt, wo Ted ist und was passiert ist.“

„Es gibt so viele Möglichkeiten“, fuhr Soto fort. „Wenn dieser Film der erste Akt der Blue-Beetle-Saga ist und wenn er Teil des DCU werden soll, wer könnte dann sein Mentor werden? Da gibt es nicht nur Ted Kord, Jaime hat auch Verbindungen zu Peacemaker oder Green Lantern.“ Beide Figuren sind interessanterweise ebenfalls Teil des DCU, gespielt von John Cena und Nathan Fillion.

Außerdem haben wir Soto gefragt, ob wirklich „Ted Lasso“-Star Jason Sudeikis für die Rolle als Ted Kord angedacht ist, wie in der Gerüchteküche zu vernehmen war. Dazu erklärte uns der Regisseur: „[Jason] ist ein toller Schauspieler und ein toller Mensch, ich habe ihn schon mal getroffen und es war großartig. Im Moment wissen wir noch nicht, wer Ted Kord spielen wird, zwinker-zwinker.“

Es erscheint also gut möglich, dass in einem möglichen „Blue Beetle 2“ dann tatsächlich Jason Sudeikis als Ted Kord auftritt. Wann und ob dieser Film erscheint und welche Rolle Jaime Reyes überhaupt im DCU spielen wird, bleibt jedoch erstmal abzuwarten. Denn das neue DC-Universum beginnt im Kino erst 2025 mit „Superman: Legacy“ offiziell. Was uns Angel Manuel Soto sonst noch zum Thema „Blue Beetle 2“ verraten hat, könnt ihr hier nachlesen:

Blue Beetle

Die Post-Credit-Szene: Onkel Rudy hackt die Realität

In der Szene ganz am Ende des Abspanns greifen Angel Manuel Soto und Co. hingegen noch einmal die vorherige Szene auf, in der Onkel Rudy (George Lopez) das Überwachungssystem von Kord Industries hackt. Allerdings mit einem wichtigen Unterschied: Diesmal kapert der etwas schräge Onkel der Familie Reyes eure Kinovorstellung!

„Hier hört man, wie Rudy gegen den Filmprojektor tritt und dann sehen wir noch einmal El Chapulín“, erklärte uns Angel Manuel Soto dazu. „Rudy mischt sich also quasi in unserer echten Welt in die Vorführung ein. Deswegen hört man ihn dann am Schluss auch noch mal. Onkel Rudy hat für einen Moment den Projektor gehackt.“

El Chapulin oder genauer gesagt: El Chapulín Colorado ist der rotgekleidete „Superheld“ in der Stop-Motion-Serie, die Rudy auf die Überwachungsmonitore bei Kord Industries spielt. Ursprünglich stammt die Figur jedoch aus einer mexikanischen Comedy-Serie aus den 70ern. „El Chapulín Colorado ist eine sehr bekannte Figur im lateinamerikanischen Raum, vermutlich der erste Superheld, den ich je gesehen habe“, meinte der Regisseur im Interview dazu. „Und das wollten wir natürlich würdigen.“",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbG1zdGFydHMuZGUvbmFjaHJpY2h0ZW4vMTAwMDAzODI0MS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

2023-08-16 15:00:00-04:00,"Interview: ‘Ted Lasso’ Director Declan Lowney Says ‘So Long, Farewell’; Discusses Fan Theories and the Final Shot","Director Declan Lowney spoke with Awards Radar about the 'Ted Lasso' series finale, a debated fan theory, that musical number and the final shot.","When the time came to say “So Long, Farewell” to Ted Lasso it was crucial to have the right person to lead the charge. Director Declan Lowney, who had already directed seven other episodes including the penultimate episode,“ was the right person for the job. The finale was universally praised for never losing the show spirit as it tied up numerous character storylines, sent many on new adventures and gave viewers the memorable and heartfelt goodbye they deserved.

“It was very exciting to be able to finish the show off,” said Declan who sat down to speak with Awards Radar about his work on the beloved series (watch the full interview at the end of the article). “I’m hugely honored to have been let to direct the last two episodes of this show. People love this show so much and there has been such huge interest in and love for the final episode, particularly. It was an honor to be allowed to do it. It’s probably a career highlight, I would have to say.” Many fans would agree.

While he did not learn many new lessons from the experience, “Ted Lasso reinforced a lot of things I have already believed,” explained Declan. “I’ve been in the right place at the right time, a lot in my life. But I know you also make some of your own luck.” Some of this ‘luck’ extends beyond the director and includes having the right actors to which to work.

Lowney echoed Ted Lasso casting director Theo Park who previously spoke to Awards Radar about the importance of casting the best best people for even the smallest role. “I really believe that if you cast the right actors in your show,” said Lowney “if you put together the right people that once you put them all in front of the camera, and they start saying stuff, they’ll be doing it the right way, if you’ve cast correctly.” Of course this does not let the director off the hook, there’s still plenty of work to be done, he explained. “You can then just let them do their thing, you might need to pull them in a bit, you might need to shape it a bit, but for the most part, if you’ve cast, well, let them get on with it.”

“The other thing is I came up through the ranks, I know what everybody on the set does and I appreciate and respect everybody’s input, every department’s difficulties and their contributions,” said Lowney. “I think having an understanding of all that, and being able to play with all those things you’re given, to get the best out of everybody, is an absolutely fantastic way to shoot a film or TV show.”

The results are evident in his work as seen in his three Emmy nominations, including for directing fan favorites like “Make Rebecca Great Again.” Lowney continues, “If you can have that atmosphere of inclusivity and togetherness on the set. And you’ve got your actors doing the right thing up there on the camera; it speaks volumes, and it’s all on the screen.”

One of the most pleasant surprises during the finale was when the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical number “So Long, Farewell” from The Sound of Music was performed by the entire team. Lowney described the thought put into it before the squad could film their musical performance. “Well, we had this debate about, how good could it be? How good could the singing be? How good could the choreography be?”

A previous dance attempt in season two delivered fun though varied results, but expectations were much higher here explained Lowney. “This one was meant to be because they’ve worked really, really, really hard. The routine was quite simple, but they had worked very hard at doing it. So it was okay for them to do it very well.” Lowney continued about the cast’s dedication to making this something next level while still keeping an authentic feel. “The guys have gone into the studio and recorded the lyrics, the words, beforehand. On the day I got them all to sing live again. So each one of them was miked and each of them had an earpiece playing the backing track so they sang live again. I think in the final mix, it’s mainly the live vocals put in with some of the stuff they already recorded. It still has a kind of a roughness about it – so it wasn’t too perfect.”

What viewers did not know was the ending to the musical interlude was not always what they saw in the final version. Lowney revealed that show creator and star, Jason Sudeikis, made a decision, one that caught the true heart of the moment. “The other thing was at the very, very end I had brought in a drone. But the guys celebrated so beautifully at the end of it that we got rid of the drone shot, and Jason recut it. It’s brilliant,” explained Lowney. “The guys were just going batshit crazy pulling off the tops and going crazy. Ted loved what they had done for him so much saying, ‘Guys, that’s perfect,’ and they just went crazy.” Nothing could be more authentic than that.

“I love that celebratory moment. That celebration, that outpouring was real – they were so excited to do it for him, because he literally hadn’t seen it prior. We’d rehearsed it separately so he hadn’t seen it when they came to do it for them.”

While fans were enthusiastic about finale it also created plenty of online debate as to whether what they just watched was all Ted’s dream (many were reminded of the infamous game changing 1980s St. Elsewhere snow globe finale.) While Lowney believes those theories are all just “fan fiction,” he is open to the idea of more Ted Lasso in the future. “Jason always said it was three seasons, he’s wrapped everybody’s stories up very nicely. But there’s a whole bunch of things aren’t there that have been set up in the last montage in the last few minutes that are potential spin offs.”

“I think the most exciting one was Keeley’s (Juno Temple) pitch to Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham) to create a Richmond women’s football team,” he expounded. “We’ve seen captain Roy (Brett Goldstein) take over and we’ve seen Coach Beard (Brendan Hunt) get married and stay in England probably. So there’s potential there for spin offs. And then you’ve got Ted coaching a football league back in Kansas, so there is a potential spin off there. If they want to do more, I’d be well up for it. But I don’t think that’s gonna happen for a while.”



It seems Lowney, like many involved with the series, are proud of what they gave viewers over three seasons and are ready to say ‘so long, farewell’… for now. “There’s something about that look into camera Ted does at the end. He’s watching his son (Henry) run off and then he just brings his gaze, looks straight down the lens as if to say, ‘That’s it, folks. Thanks for coming on the journey with us.’

2023-07-28 15:00:00+00:00,‘Twisted Metal’ Star Anthony Mackie On Squaring Up With Samoa Joe & Adapting A Video Game He Grew Up Playing,Anthony Mackie told Deadline about developing his character John Doe and doing most of his own stunts for Peacock's Twisted Metal,"Note: This interview was conducted before the current SAG-AFTRA strike.

Anthony Mackie spent the better part of his childhood playing Twisted Metal on the Playstation. Now, he’s the face of Peacock‘s adaptation, which debuted Thursday — nearly two decades after the first version of the game.

Fans of Twisted Metal will know that the vehicular combat games don’t exactly tell a story. “It was just a bunch of people, a bunch of cars, who do you want to fight?” as the Marvel actor put it.

“So with the series, we were able to make that backstory and create that background to where now you’re invested in these characters. And when you go back and play the game, now you have a completely different relationship with those characters who are in the game,” he told Deadline during a recent interview.

Mackie plays John Doe, a motor-mouthed outsider living in a post-apocalyptic world where he’s tasked with delivering packages to and from the various new settlements that have popped up around the country. When the leader of one of these settlements offers him a chance at life on the inside, he jumps at the opportunity, though it will require him to make one last dangerous trek to deliver a mysterious item.

With the help of an ax-wielding car thief named Quiet (Stephanie Beatriz), John faces savage marauders driving vehicles of destruction and other dangers of the open road, including the infamous deranged clown Sweet Tooth (Samoa Joe).

“Samoa did not pull his punches. And I’m like, ‘Dude, you’re a professional wrestler. One thing you know how to do is not hit somebody.’ But it was great. I had a lot of fun. I can say I fought a wrestler,” Mackie joked of working with the wrestling champ.

Naturally, the series also involved quite a bit of stunt driving. Wherever possible, Mackie told Deadline that he preferred to do his own tricks.

“We had a great group of drivers, and because of that a lot of the stuff we were able to do practically. I really got to drive 50 miles an hour around a mall with somebody chasing me. We really got to jump out of the front window and do all this crazy stuff, because our drivers were so talented,” Mackie explained. “And some of the big stuff…when you see a car flying over a bridge, that wasn’t Anthony.”

John is an original character, as is Quiet. So, while the series has source material, the actors still had the opportunity to build their characters from scratch within the confines of the world that was already created. Throughout the 10 episodes, viewers get hints at both of their pasts, though Mackie says there’s plenty more where that came from.

“We had a great group of writers, and John’s backstory was very important. Just simply because you have to think of and create all that stuff now, to where when you go into hopefully the next season or the third season, you have all that stuff written for you to build upon,” he said. “You don’t want to play catch up, and then the first season makes no sense. So we dove into that and really made John a character that people would enjoy and want to hang out with. John’s the guy you want to have a beer with.”

After spending much of the past decade of his career as former United States Air Force pararescue airman Sam Wilson (aka Falcon) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Mackie said he jumped at the opportunity to not only dive into a world he grew up with, but also a character that “just enjoys his life.”

“[He’s a] glass half full kind of guy. And I love that. I love the idea of, ‘Nobody’s gonna fuck up my day. This is a great day.’ You give this dude’s lemons, he will make lemonade,” he said. “So I wanted to spend five months just in that happy go lucky place of, ‘What could go wrong? Who knows?'”

Without giving anything away (this is a spoiler-free story, after all), the Twisted Metal finale certainly tees up another season nicely. If Peacock does renew the series for another go-round, Mackie said he’d like to see John “grow up a little bit.”

“He’s going to have some challenges that’s gonna come his way that’s gonna force his hand to be more of an adult and make some really tough decisions because you can’t be a milkman all your life,” he teased. “We’ve seen what happens to milkmen. So you have to decide what’s most important — hold your milkman status, or grow up and be an adult.”

All 10 episodes of Twisted Metal are now streaming on Peacock.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvdHdpc3RlZC1tZXRhbC1hbnRob255LW1hY2tpZS1pbnRlcnZpZXctcGVhY29jay1zZXJpZXMtMTIzNTQ0OTYzMC_SAWJodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3L3R3aXN0ZWQtbWV0YWwtYW50aG9ueS1tYWNraWUtaW50ZXJ2aWV3LXBlYWNvY2stc2VyaWVzLTEyMzU0NDk2MzAvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

DC President And Publisher Jim Lee Thinks Addition Of James Gunn And Peter Safran As Heads Of DC Studios Will Renew Interest In Comic Brand

Superman (Henry Cavill) takes on Faora (Antje Traue) in Man of Steel (2013), Warner Bros. Pictures

DC showed up at San Diego Comic-Con for the first time in years last month, and Jim Lee, the President, Publisher, and Chief Creative Officer of the comics brand, was there to take in the proceedings. “Tucked away” in a second-floor nook of the Dawn of DC Booth, what he saw – people buying collectibles – gave him hope for the future of his company.

Lee granted access to The Hollywood Reporter and shared with them his optimism that comics will grow again, and the fans will return. “Comic-Con is the event of the year for us, and we wanted to basically show up for the fans,” he said, looking past and not even acknowledging the alienation of readers taking place over the past few years or more.

All the DC film releases in 2023 turning into duds is an illustrator of the fans’ presence and voice, but Lee predicts that will turn around thanks to the new slate being dreamed up by the DC Studios regime of James Gunn and Peter Safran. Moreover, Lee stated he already sees evidence of this changing tide, giving credit to Gunn specifically.

“It’s amazing to have partners in Peter and James, particularly James. He was a comics fan growing up and knows our mythology inside out. And having that kind of ally in the live-action space allows us to really leverage what he is doing and allow us to market and sell comic books to new readers,” Lee said.

He added, “These are people who are interested in his movies, his TV shows, and if they want to take a deep dive into these characters, he directs them to the comic books.” THR noted Lee didn’t give any numbers or name-drop any titles with one exception, but he said “certain titles have seen double- or triple-digit growth in sales since the duo took charge.”

The Authority was mentioned as one book Gunn has drummed up interest in with his announcement of a big-screen adaptation in development, though it’s added The Authority wasn’t in print when Gunn revealed his plans. THR didn’t mention or allude to the idea that the sales of back issues could be key to any potential uptick in Authority sales as they are with other comics.

Back issues have experienced greater movement than new comics in recent years, but that wasn’t on Lee’s mind at Comic-Con. “At the end of the day, there’s the business of DC and then there’s the content engine that creates all the DC content, from the comics to animation and movies and stuff like that,” he explained.

“But it’s that connection between comics and media that we’re celebrating here [at SDCC],” Lee continued. “The trend has been for exhibitors to have exclusive [products] as a way to [drive] fans to their booths and also underwriting the cost of being at a show like this. But it’s also a great way to stoke fandom.”

He went on to explain that “People go online, they go to Discord channels, they talk about what they scored at Comic-Con. They wait [in] long lines to go into Hall H or to meet creators and celebrities, and they also wait in long lines to buy exclusive merchandise.” DC is exploring new opportunities with these long, patient lines.

The company is bridging the gap between digital and physical media with new trading cards called ”Hro.” “Physical superhero trading cards have been around for decades, this is just a really elegant hybridization of that business into the digital space, not leaving behind the physical collectors,” Lee explained. “It gives you the option of trading one or the other or both.”

DC is also trying to drum up excitement with their new Dawn of DC initiative, which THR claims will be different from The New 52 and Rebirth. The occurrence of Future State and Dark Crisis ignored, they perceive Dawn as “a more measured approach” since the relaunch is being told over a year as opposed to a small number of weeks or months.

Still, Lee seems like he and DC are learning from their mistakes with previous relaunches and in the 90s. “First issues are highly collectible, as you know, but if you have too many in one month, you suck up all the dollars that are in the marketplace. Which is great if you get them all, but there are limits to people’s budgets,” he noted.

He is said to be happy with the sales of Superman books, titles going into second printings, and even Doom Patrol currently. “We’re super excited about the results, and we haven’t even gotten to the Batman piece of it yet,” Lee reportedly glowed. We also haven’t gotten to the releases of the DCU pieces yet, so we shall see where DC is in 2025.

2023-09-07 09:01:55+00:00,"Breaking Baz Exclusive: Filmmaker Jeff Nichols On The Sexual Tension At Heart Of ‘The Bikeriders’ Movie Involving A “Love Triangle” Played By Austin Butler, Jodie Comer & Tom Hardy","Jeff Nichols on 'The Bikeriders' love triangle featuring Austin Butler, Jodie Comer, and Tom Hardy.","EXCLUSIVE: Jeff Nichols spent two decades considering how to approach what would become his new film The Bikeriders because he did not want to glamorize motorcycle culture.

That’s a hard road to travel when the finished movie stars Austin Butler (Elvis), Jodie Comer (Killing Eve), and Tom Hardy (Mad Max: Fury Road), who aren’t exactly lacking in screen charisma.

Nichols has based his movie on the seminal work of photojournalist Danny Lyon, who rode with and snapped the Chicago Outlaws Motorcycle Club for two years beginning in 1963. His book chronicling his devilish association with the Outlaws was first published in 1968.

Front and center are Butler as devastatingly handsome biker Benny; Comer as down-to-earth Kathy, unvarnished and clear-eyed, she sees through the biker bullshit; and Hardy as Johnny, the leader who kinda wants to be Benny.

“Well, you don’t want to say they’re cliché, which is women are drawn to the bad boys and that stuff, because we all are, because I’m as attracted to Benny as she is, not in a sexual way, but in that way…and that was honestly kind of the purpose,” Nichols said.

“The thing I created more than anything was the love triangle and how interesting for it not to be these two guys fighting over a girl, but to be this woman and this leader of this club fighting over this young man.”

Nichols stressed that Hardy’s Johnny character is not attracted to Butler’s Benny in a sexual way, rather that Johnny sees Benny as being authentic, and that’s attractive to him. Whereas Johnny’s already playing a part, he’s quoting back Marlon Brando in The Wild One.

Benny’s an empty vessel, Nichols explained.

“It’s like a glass with no bottle. And Johnny’s pouring all of his stuff into Benny and Kathy’s pouring all of her stuff into Benny,” so that it’s almost Shakespearean.

“It’s what makes it star-crossed. The other star-crossed part is that as soon as you start to put rules around the beautiful thing you built, you’re starting to destroy it. So it’s undoing it as soon as you start to fashion it, you’re undoing what made it special in the first place. And it stands for the club they’re members of but it also stands for the relationships between these three people,” Nichols told me during a lengthy conversation at the tail end of the five-day 50th Telluride Film Festival.

The Bikeriders will also play a headline gala at the BFI London Film Festival on October 5, with subsequent showings October 6 and 9. The 20th Century Studios title opens in U.S. theaters on December 1.

“I’ve been thinking about this for 20 years,” Nichols told me, ever since he read a copy of Lyon’s book that his eldest brother, a rock musician, had purchased back in 2003 when it was republished to include more interview text from bikers and their gals.

“These are not people we want to idolize, but that doesn’t mean they’re not attractive,” he argued.

He noted that Lyon dealt with that dilemma in his celebrated book “because he saw them for what they were because he was around them, and he often talked about how beautiful they were . But also, he would call them idiots sometimes and I think there’s a tension between the allure of this subculture and the reality of it.”

Nichols said that you could simply dismiss bikers they are “grotesque” with their coifs, black leather jackets with polished buttons, and their big, status symbol two-wheeled machines. “It’s very attractive. And I think to deny it is to not be honest.”

And it would be easy, and a tad lazy, to label The Bikeriders as a picture-book movie (Adam Stone’s cinematography is undeniably sublime) about pretty boys on their fast, gleaming choppers.

But both the book and the film go deeper than that because the works are supported by the interviews Lyon conducted which were transcribed and those words contain harsh truths about America.

“The portraits may be kind of beautiful and captivating but those words on the page, that’s where the conflict comes,” he explained.

Nichols used those words to offer a glimpse of America’s dark underbelly.

“There’s a harshness, there’s a roughness. There’s also beauty in that. I’ve always been drawn to working-class stories and people and seeing how they look at the world and approach things and the honesty and the clarity, sometimes, that they have, but there’s also just a sharper edge to all of that,” said Nichols who was raised with two older brothers in the suburbs of Little Rock, Arkansas.

His parents grew up an hour outside of Little Rock in Altheimer. It’s delta land. ”My dad grew up very poor in cotton land. My mother’s father drove a propane truck, so probably had more in the middle-class territory, just simply because he had a job that wasn’t dependant on the rain and the sun and the crops.”

Nichols told me his dad was raised by a single mom. “And so they came out of a very working-class place. That’s where our grandparents lived. That’s where we grew up.”

Later on, his dad owned a piano store and then became a furniture salesman. Nichols found the land of his parents “beautiful and exotic” and he explained that his kin are “great storytellers and they’re great people.

“I didn’t grow up with that chip on my shoulder of, I hate small towns. I kind of love them, and I love the culture and the personalities,” he explained with a sense of pride in his voice.

I believe that’s why he’s fully able to grasp who the characters in The Bikeriders are. He approaches the story through character, not through narrative plot. They’re not chess pieces, he said.

“And I care about them because I see them. I see them moving around, it’s like I trust that they operate in a real way,” he said.

“Perhaps, it has something to do with the fact that I don’t come from here [America]. I am not an American, though I do have family in Nashville, Tennessee, and in Washington D.C. But more than any other American film I have seen in a long time, I felt that The Bikeriders took me to the heart of what’s going on in the United States. It’s a movie that has helped me try to fathom why,” as Nichols put it, “there’s darkness everywhere and there’s evil everywhere.”

Nichols told me that in deciding to make the film he was looking for patterns in society “and in humans, things we do, things we know we do. Sometimes we admit to them. Sometimes we don’t. I saw this pattern of people feeling like they don’t quite belong here in the mainstream, so they move to the outside. And that’s where the really interesting stuff starts to exist and starts to be created.”

The alienated, he observed “produce things. They produce music. They produce art. And in a way, there’s a lot of that in early biker culture, in the building of those bikes, but then also in the way they dress. It reminded me a lot of the punk rock scene in the ‘90s in Little Rock that I grew up around, the care that they take,” he said, sparking an interest in me to explore punk rock in Little Rock, for heaven’s sake.

“Because even if you’re looking at a biker who’s all greasy and crazy looking, it’s like, ‘Yeah, but they sewed those patches on. They’re actually thinking about who they are.’ And they’ve put love into those bikes and it’s all an outward expression of some identity for themselves. But they’re also on the fringe. But because then it starts to become a social thing, a group thing, people start to have to put rules to it and kind of this structure to it. And as soon as you start that, it starts to die.”

It becomes an affection of itself almost. Nichols gives a sense of that in a marvelous scene featuring the actor Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) as a biker called Funny Sonny sitting on a motorcycle getting paid five bucks to get people in to see Easy Rider.

It’s such a super touch.

“Yeah, it’s kind of like a joke, like I’m a biker. Come and watch this movie,” Nichols laughed.

When I got to read excerpts from Danny Lyon’s book, I was struck by how much of the actual interview transcripts have been used in the film, especially those uttered by Kathy, who, by the way, Nichols has tried to find, but thus far, has been unsuccessful.

Nor does Lyon know where she might be or what happened to her over the intervening years.

But I kinda know Kathy.

I understand her. I know women as the backbone of our culture. I know about strong women, I happen to be married to one, for starters, who hails from pioneering Australian stock.

Jodie Comer hails from Liverpool and there’s something in the Mersey river over there that gives people, women in particular, a certain strength. Comer channels that strength into her acting. Sure, she excelled in Killing Eve but you’d understand more about what I’m talking about if you’d seen her hold the stage in Suzie Miller’s one-woman play Prima Facie that played in London’s West End and on Broadway, winning her the Laurence Olivier Award and the Tony Award for best performance by an actress.

I sat on two awards panels that honored Comer’s performance. I mean, it was a no-brainer.

Jodie Comer, ‘Prima Facie’ Helen Murray

My point being that Comer was born to play Kathy in The Bikeriders. I heard a couple of people moan that she didn’t accurately capture the right American accent. I couldn’t give a fig about that.

Did she manage to capture the character?! That’s the point.

Nichols told me that he called Adam Driver, who starred with Comer in Ridley Scott’s The Last Duel, to ask what she was like to work with.

“Total professional, Adam does not suffer fools,” he said, much like Michael Shannon, who’s also in The Bikeriders. ”So I knew that box was checked. There’s no vanity there. Then I found out it’s that times a million. She’s a worker.”

With Comer set, Nichols pursued Hardy.

They met at his home in London. “He was super polite, and nice, and gracious, but also had a million questions, blah, blah. He’s hyper-intelligent. He vibrates with energy,” Nichols recalled.

Nichols left that meeting “kind of punch drunk,” to catch Comer in Prima Facie at the Harold Pinter Theatre in the West End.

“I go in and I’m kind of processing the Tom meeting. Then this play starts. I hadn’t really read anything about it. I knew it was a one-woman show. I walk out of that play and I’m like, ‘I’m the luckiest director in the world.’ Like this is it. I have an ace up my sleeve and just wait till we get there [on set] because she’s going to kill this,” said Nichols still in thrall of Comer’s talent.

Then he went after Butler.

“That guy’s a movie star,” he exclaimed.

He’s a f*cking movie star who can act, which isn’t always the case with movie stars, I add.

“He’s got the chops and then some,” Nichols agreed.

Butler had the sense to underplay Benny. “I have to give him credit for that because that’s what that character needed to do. There has to be a kind of emotional barrier for that guy, for the whole thing to work. He’s so charming,” Nichols said of Butler.

“I’d go up to him and I’d be like, ‘See, you’ve got to stop smiling so much.’ He’d be like, ‘Oh, okay, Jeff.’ I’d be like, ‘No, you’re doing it again. Stop being so charming.’ But he has an aura around him. When you have that aura combined with the work ethic and the talent that guy’s going to the moon,” he declared.

I quickly sensed that Nichols had something up his sleeve for Butler in the future but, boy oh boy, it was easier confronting a big brown bear in Telluride than getting an answer out of Nichols.

What is it, Jeff? I demanded, nicely.

“I can’t tell you.”

Come on, I said, “Tell Uncle Baz. You know you want to.”

He shook his head.

“I don’t know if he’ll do it or not, but yeah, I got something up my sleeve. It’s a real-life character. It’d blow people’s socks off. Yeah. We’ll see, we’ll see.”

Francine Maisler should win an Oscar for casting, if there was ever such a thing. The BAFTAs have a category for casting directors.

Mike Faist (West Side Story) portrays Danny Lyon the sort of narrator of the piece; Emory Cohen has a cool role that I won’t give away here and then there’s Toby Wallace, who I first spotted in the Aussie soap Neighbours when he was a kid.

I really started paying attention to Wallace when he appeared in Shannon Murphy’s Babyteeth opposite Eliza Scanlen (Little Women, Sharp Objects). He’s got that hint, that mark of something. I also saw him in Kitty Green (The Assistant)’s new film The Royal Hotel at Telluride, which will be playing TIFF as well.

But he needs to stop playing menacing characters otherwise he’ll be stuck. He’s got much more to give than that. Nichols agreed that Wallace “is going to be something special.”

He also saw him in Babyteeth “where he looks like a stray dog. That’s what we wanted. Even when we gave him this haircut, he took the clippers and just dug pieces, like he had mange or something on his head. I think you’re in young Sean Penn territory there. I think that guy has some serious gears.

“But honestly, in this cast, you can throw a rock and hit talent,” he boasted.

He stands in solidarity with the actors and writers on strike but implored that “everybody, just get back to the table.”

It’s devastating for so many people, he told me.

”I just want them to get back to the table and get down to business. Everybody’s got to get back to the table,” he said trying hard not to thump the table we were seated at.

“They need to do it now. Today, get back to the table,” he cried.

My Toronto Time

I felt somewhat discombobulated arriving in urban Toronto with its towering mirrored skyscrapers, from Telluride, high up in the San Juan mountain range of the Rockies. I like cities but Toronto’s a bit too extreme for me. I’ve been coming here for decades but I’ve never mastered it. Everything’s always “awesome,” which drives me nuts. And there are galas for this film and that film and there’s just too much faffing about.

Telluride, on the other hand, forswears red carpet palaver, which makes me very happy. It’s all about the movies minus the fuss.

That’s not to say that there won’t be great movies at TIFF. There will be. There are a few things in the program that are just ace.

I guess I just miss those glorious, wide-open spaces and forested peaks.

However, a recent report hints that won't happen.","Gal Gadot recently said in an interview that she was working on developing Wonder Woman 3. However, a recent report seems to suggest that is no longer happening.

Wonder Woman 3 might not be happening, after all

During the latest episode of the Hot Mic podcast, Above the Line’s Jeff Sneider responded to a recent interview Gadot did with ComicBook.com. In it, she teased a new Wonder Woman film, something that Sneider claims was “a nonsense story.”

“I don’t know why you bring in James Gunn and Peter Safran to reboot the DCU if they’re not going to reboot the DCU,” Sneider said. “I don’t know why they would hire someone who isn’t Patty Jenkins to come in and do Wonder Woman 3 and then not let that person cast their Wonder Woman.”

In Gadot’s interview with ComicBook.com, she said that as she understands it, she will be developing a third Wonder Woman film together with Gunn and Safran. “I love portraying Wonder Woman,” Gadot says. “It’s so close to and dear to my heart. From what I heard from James and from Peter is that we’re gonna develop a Wonder Woman 3 together.”

Prior to Gadot’s comments, plans for a Wonder Woman 3 were scrapped by Gunn and Safran late last year, with director Patty Jenkins — who directed the first two Wonder Woman films — stepping away from the project as a result. Currently, it’s unknown what the future holds for Gadot as Wonder Woman, who made her possible last cameo in 2023’s The Flash.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cGVyaGVyb2h5cGUuY29tL21vdmllcy81NDMxOTYtZGN1LXdvbmRlci13b21hbi0zLXdpdGgtZ2FsLWdhZG90LWlzLXJlcG9ydGVkbHktbm9uc2Vuc2XSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdXBlcmhlcm9oeXBlLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvNTQzMTk2LWRjdS13b25kZXItd29tYW4tMy13aXRoLWdhbC1nYWRvdC1pcy1yZXBvcnRlZGx5LW5vbnNlbnNlL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

Audio will be 2.0 DTS-HD MA. [Read on here...]

The package will also include the previous Blu-ray that offers 5.1 audio and 3 legacy featurettes ( Rudy: The Real Story , Production , and First Down with Sean Astin ). It comes in Steelbook packaging. You can see the cover artwork at left and also below the break.

The big one is that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has just set David Anspaugh’s Rudy (1993) for release on 4K Ultra HD on 11/11, complete with both the 114-minute Theatrical Cut and a new 127-minute Director’s Cut in 4K, with Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos audio. Both are fully restored from original camera negative and the process was approved by the director. The 4K disc also includes English 5.1 DTS-HD MA for both versions, plus 2.0 audio for the Theatrical Cut . You also get a new commentary with Anspaugh and screenwriter Angelo Pizzo on the Director’s Cut , 5 additional deleted scenes, and the film’s trailer.

We’ve got a couple quick updates for you over the long Labor Day weekend here at The Bits ...

Coming to Blu-ray only on 11/14 from Mondo Macabro and CAV are Xavier Seto’s Shadow of Death (1969) and Jess Franco’s The Sinister Dr. Orloff (1984).

Kino Lorber has announced that they’re launching a new Kino Cult label in October, starting with new Blu-ray special editions of Jess Franco’s Lorna the Exorcist (1974) and Phil Smoot’s Alien Outlaw (1985) and The Dark Power (1985). They’re also going to release some 4K UHD titles, including George Pavulou’s Underworld (1985), with Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS (1975), Ilsa: Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks (1976), Ilsa the Tigress of Siberia (1977), and Ilsa, the Wicked Woman (1977) already announced (and planned for next year).

And Paramount has announced that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is now available on Digital, and the physical Blu-ray, DVD, and 4K UHD street dates will be announced at a later date. (Note that our industry sources are suggesting a street date of 11/21.)

Also, we have more “unofficial” release dates for you today from our industry and retailer sources, including catalog 4K and new release Blu-ray, DVD, and 4K Ultra HD titles as well. But do keep in mind that all of these dates should be considered unofficially and subject to change until the studios in question make their actual announcements...

It appears that Paramount may be getting ready to release David Zucker’s The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! (1988) on 4K Ultra HD on 11/18. The pre-order page briefly appeared on Amazon but has since been pulled down. And it should be noted that all three Naked Guns films are already available in 4K Digital. So a physical release makes a lot of sense.

We also continue to hear that Paramount is looking at 10/31 as the street date for Christopher McQuarrie’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (2023).

You may recall that we revealed last week that Oliver Stone’s JFK (1991) and Alexander (2004) are coming to 4K Ultra HD. Multiple sources now have suggested that they’re likely coming from Shout! Factory, either in Q4 of this year or early Q1 of next year. No, we don’t know which versions, so be patient—all should be revealed in good time.

Meanwhile, we’re hearing that Warner Bros. Discovery Home Entertainment and DC Studios are tentatively planning a 10/17 street date for Angel Manuel Soto’s Blue Beetle (2023). Warner is also likely to release Michael Chaves’ The Nun II (2023) on physical media on 11/14.

We expect Sony Pictures Home Entertainment to drop Neill Blomkamp’s Gran Turismo (2023) on disc on 10/31, with Antoine Fuqua’s The Equalizer 3 (2023) likely to follow on 11/14. And look for Sony to re-issue their previous 4K editions of Stand by Me, The Guns of Navarone, Black Hawk Down, and A Few Good Men as 4K Steelbooks before the end of the year, this time with Dolby Vision HDR.

Also, Lucasfilm has posted a good interview with legendary sound mixer Walter Murch, in which he discusses his work and the new 5.1 mix for George Lucas’ American Graffiti (1973), which is coming to 4K UHD from Universal on 11/7.

Now then, we’ll leave you today with a look at the cover artwork for several recently-announced Blu-ray, DVD, and 4K titles, most of which are now available for pre-order on Amazon. Don’t forget that anytime you order literally anything from Amazon in the same session after clicking to them from one of our links, you’re helping to support our work here at The Bits which we greatly appreciate. And if you pre-order the title now, and Amazon’s sale price drops between now and street date (which is typically does), you’ll always get that lowest price...

Back tomorrow. Stay tuned...

With both films being promoted at the same time, some reporters got a little creative with their questioning. During an interview with Omelete, Murphy was asked if he would be open to starring as a Ken in a potential Barbie sequel.

“Would I play a Ken in Barbie 2? Sure, yeah,” Murphy replied. “Let’s read the script, let’s have a conversation.”

He continued, “I can’t wait to see [Barbie]. I can’t wait to see the movie. I think it’s great for cinema to get all these great movies happening this summer.”

Barbie casting directors Lucy Bevan and Allison Jones recently talked about getting the perfect ensemble for the Greta Gerwig-directed film.

“We needed actors who could get the fact that our Barbies only knew pleasant things,” Jones told Vanity Fair during a recent interview.

Ryan Gosling was cast as “Beach Ken” with other variants of Kens going to actors like Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Scott Evans, Ncuti Gatwa, and John Cena, just to name a few.

On the variety of Kens, Bevan added, “They were definitely really different, but they had to feel like a cohesive group. You wanted to cast people who were really going to get on and be great and enjoy it.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktb3Blbi10by1wbGF5aW5nLWtlbi1iYXJiaWUtc2VxdWVsLTEyMzU0NDgxMzQv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy9jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS1vcGVuLXRvLXBsYXlpbmcta2VuLWJhcmJpZS1zZXF1ZWwtMTIzNTQ0ODEzNC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-17 17:30:00+00:00,"York film preview: Blue Beetle, Strays and Bambi",,"Given that his screen persona could often accurately be described as ‘part man, part Labrador’, it’s no surprise to find Will Ferrell playing a talking pooch in his new comedy.

Don’t go expecting a family-friendly canine caper from Strays though, which looks set to do for dogs what Sausage Party did for hot dogs.

Elsewhere, there’s a new superhero on the block in Blue Beetle, and Disney get set to traumatise a whole new generation as Bambi returns to the big screen.

New releases

Blue Beetle

Xolo Maridueña (star of hit Karate Kid reboot Cobra Kai) suits up as the DCEU’s first Latino superhero in this new action-adventure.

Coming across as part Spider-Man and part Venom (albeit a much more family-friendly version of the latter), the story sees affable college graduate Jaime Reyes (Maridueña) come into possession of the Scarab, a bit of ancient alien biotech which chooses him as its symbiotic host – bestowing him with a nifty suit and all manner of superpowers, which prove tricky to keep under control.

As Jaime tries to harness his new gifts with the help of his family (no keeping Aunt May in the dark here), his antics bring him to the attention of Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon), an ambitious CEO who wants the Scarab for her own nefarious purposes.

Strays

Cocking its leg in the face of cinema’s wholesome history of cutesy talking canines is this foul-mouthed and extremely silly-looking comedy, which aims to put the ‘Rrrrr’ into ‘R-rated’.

Will Ferrell voices naive Border Terrier Reggie, who’s abandoned by the animal-hating drug addict owner whom he adores – but after streetwise Boston Terrier Bug (Jamie Foxx) and pals take him under their wing, the disillusioned Reggie vows a terrible revenge on his former best friend.

Directed by Josh Greenbaum, the man behind 2021’s cult hit Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar, this looks very much like the kind of film which thinks the only thing funnier than a dog humping your gran’s leg is a talking dog humping your gran’s leg while dropping a string of f-bombs…and I can’t deny, the trailer made me giggle. Don’t judge me, I’m very tired…

2023-08-03 06:45:30+00:00,Book Review: ‘Star Wars: Cataclysm’ by Lydia Kang,"Cameron Brook reviews Star Wars: Cataclysm by Lydia Kang, a new novel set in The High Republic Era, in stores now!","Share this:

The High Republic, in my opinion, is probably one of the best parts of Star Wars since Disney took over in 2012. The publishing franchise has since early 2021 grown tremendously. The initiative spans adult, young adult, and children’s books as well as an animated series in the form of Young Jedi Adventures. The High Republic will finally make its way into Live Action in The Acolyte a Disney+ show coming sometime in 2024.

The High Republic is set centuries before The Phantom Menace showcasing the Jedi at their peak, and the Republic as it first enters into the Outer Rim. Star Wars: Cataclysm by Lydia Kang is part of Phase 2 of the High Republic publishing initiative, set over a century before the novels of Phase 1. Cataclysm is the final adult book of Phase 2 as it follows on from both Convergence and The Battle Of Jedha. The book brings in characters from both previous books as well as giving us some new, unforgettable characters and treating us to some familiar faces from the movies.

The book follows several Jedi members as they aim to unravel the mystery of The Path of the Open Hand, an elusive cult that has aimed to disrupt peace by any means. All roads lead to Dalna, headquarters of The Path as the Jedi prepare to take on a foe like no other, in a battle for light and life. Cataclysm has ended up being one of my favorite books in the entire High Republic so far and it’s very easy to see why.

[Warning: Review may contain minor spoilers for Star Wars: Cataclysm but no major plot reveals!]

A fractured introduction in Star Wars: Cataclysm

Timeline-wise, Cataclysm begins around the same time as the battle itself in The Battle of Jedha. We are first introduced to the villains of the book, the Path of the Open Hand, a cult that believe the force should be free and that the Jedi should not have it. The Mother is the leader of the cult (who serves as a kind of ‘Palpatine’ of the book) with a new character, Binnot Ullo as her up front and in the action “Darth Vader” (complete with a glove with poison spike fingertips, very bond-villainesque). They both concoct an evil scheme to make the Jedi and Republic pay for their failures and to free the Force, which involves several characters from the previous books. This plot sets up the book and establishes where we find the characters at the beginning.

Cataclysm is very character heavy and Lydia Kang does a great job of managing to juggle several groups of characters without ever losing any of them within the story. The rest of the character introductions take us through their reactions to the failings of the Battle of Jedha along with the unveiling of The Path being behind everything and the mystery surrounding their plans for the galaxy.

Phan-Tu and Xiri both return as the newly married heirs to the warring Eiram and E’ronoh, their respective home planets. Both characters have a lot to work through in the book as being newlyweds and saving their planets comes with a whole host of problems, alongside dealing with their parents still not believing in a peaceful alliance between the planets. They were both first introduced in Convergence along with the other returning characters of Jedi Wayseeker Gella Nattai and scoundrel and chancellor’s son, Axel Greylark (a favorite character among High Republic fans). Both intertwine brilliantly as Kang writes a very beautiful but painful relationship between them as they grapple with Axel’s betrayal at the end of Convergence.

This core quad of characters are the most important ones in the book by far and we see through their eyes for a lot of it. Getting to know them all deeply in Convergence only strengthens your bond with them during Cataclysm as they all work on revealing the plot around them and the wider world of characters they interact with.

Other returning characters include the Jedi duo, Creighton Sun and Aida Forte from The Battle of Jedha. They deal with the losses suffered in Jedha and aim to get answers about The Path by sneaking into their compound. Jedi Master and Padawan, Char-Ryl-Roy and Enya Keen from Convergence, and Chancellors Kyong Greylark and Orlen Mollo, also return, each playing important roles in the political aspects of the story. Kang manages to give every single one of these characters their chance to shine despite there being a lot of them.

Their introductions in previous books definitely help with this, as we know their thoughts and feelings and how they act in different circumstances. There are a lot of dealings with failure and regret from a lot of these characters as the book progresses into a more tense and dark tale. Yet despite how dark it gets they always want what is best for everyone and this manages to shine through in Lydia Kang’s words.

Book Review: Star Wars: The Battle of Jedha by George Mann

The new bunch in The High Republic

Whilst Lydia Kang does amazing work bringing back the returning characters, I strongly believe her best work is with the new characters made for the book. The main villain, Binnot Ullo is a typical Star Wars bad guy in many ways. However, his sheer tenacity, his creepiness, and his poison glove hand make him a formidable adversary to be the face of The Path in this book. He is no match for some of the Jedi and his relationships with several of the characters in the book make him very interesting and not just a forgettable face with blue markings.

Kang’s best work, in my opinion, comes in the form of her comedy in Star Wars: Cataclysm and none more so than with the Jedi Orin Darhga. Orin teams up with Gella for most of the book as she deals with Axel Greylark and his connections to The Path, chasing him across the galaxy until they end up on Dalna. On top of being the very beacon of what the Jedi stand for, Orin is absolutely hilarious, and just like the characters in the book do, you will also be groaning at all of the best “dad jokes” he gives.

Another favorite of mine was that of Master Yaddle (yes, her!) and Padawan Cippa who Yaddle has been left in the care of for a short while (effectively babysitting duty). Hilarity ensues as Yaddle has to deal with a very large, impatient, powerful force-wielding child for the entire book. However, there are moments of tenderness between them both as we get closer to the end, with Cippa ending up in dangerous situations on Dalna. Yaddle gets many moments to shine in this book, living up to her name as a very powerful Jedi and Force user who could arguably be on the same level as Yoda. These new characters pair up very nicely with the already-introduced ones as Lydia Kang expertly crafts the book toward its very violent ending.

The Night of Sorrow

Teased throughout Phase 1 “The Night of Sorrow” is finally revealed in this book. With Cataclysm starting big and spread out, it slowly winds its way to becoming a much smaller atmosphere as more and more characters wind up on the planet of Dalna, headquarters of The Path.

The tension is palpable as the book reaches its third act in which Jedi and the Republic alike finally uncover the truth about The Path and must fight their way off of Dalna. As more and more Jedi end up on the planet throughout the book, tensions rise until it boils over into an all-out war.

Kang gives us the most visceral, violent, and visual battle that I have ever read for a long time. The action leaps off the page and the battle was incredibly easy to visualize, a testament to the astonishing planning and writing it took to get us here. There are plenty of surprises, reveals, sheer terror, and death all throughout the fight, a good quarter of the book is spent on the battle from start to finish and when it begins you will not want to put the book down until it ends.

Final thoughts on Star Wars: Cataclysm by Lydia Kang

Cataclysm is a testament to what makes The High Republic so great for me. Lydia Kang has brought us a very engaging, amazingly written book that will serve as some of the best Star Wars has to offer.

Despite the several books before it that are also recommended reading, once you get to Cataclysm you know reading the previous installments has been incredibly worth it for this amazing book alone. This is an excellently paced book that not only gives us phenomenal Jedi action, but beautifully tender and fist-pumping moments from even the most minor of characters. This is Star Wars firing on all cylinders.

My rating 9.5/10

Star Wars: Cataclysm by Lydia Kang is available now in hardback, digital, and as an audiobook, and will be released in paperback in January 2024!

Director-screenwriter: Kristoffer Borgli

Logline: Nicolas Cage plays Paul Matthews, an inconspicuous academic who is thrust into the limelight after he starts inexplicably appearing in people’s dreams in this satirical swipe at celebrity and groupthink from writer-director Kristoffer Borgli and co-producer Ari Aster. The film also stars Julianne Nicholson (Mare of Easttown) and Michael Cera (Barbie).

Distributor: A24

Premiere Date: September 9, 2023

Panelists: Kristoffer Borgli and Nicolas Cage

Key Quotes: “I felt like in the name of Thespis I had the life experience to play Paul Matthews. What happened to me as Nic Cage with the internet, nothing could have prepared me, there was no reference point to experience this minification that occurred with one person’s compiling of a montage of sequences, cherry-picking different episodes of meltdowns that I had in various movies — calling it ‘Nicolas Cage loses his sh*t’ and then it went viral around the world overnight. I think I might have been the first actor who experienced anything like that. It was confusing, it was irritating, it was stimulating, it was confounding. I didn’t what to do with it.” – Nicholas Cage

“I remember thinking about how my father would navigate viral and how he’d fumble it and not be able to understand the dynamics, and there was so much comedy coming from imagining my father trying to navigate this very modern way of getting famous.” – Kristoffer Borgli

“We never went for laughs for laughs’ sake — it was all situation-relevant, it was all organic to the scene. If there is laughter, it was designed very carefully to not be playing for laughs. It is a satire that emerges on its own.” – Nicholas Cage",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tL3ZpZGVvL2RyZWFtLXNjZW5hcmlvLW5pY2hvbGFzLWNhZ2Uta3Jpc3RvZmZlci1ib3JnbGktaW50ZXJ2aWV3LXRpZmYtc3R1ZGlvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-28 16:24:00+00:00,Nicolas Cage Breaks Silence On Suiting Up As Superman In The Flash,"Nicolas Cage spoke about his brief appearance as Superman in The Flash, which sees the Man of Steel taking on a giant spider during the Chronobowl sequence.","Nicolas Cage recently spoke about his brief appearance as Superman in The Flash. In an interview with USA Today, Cage broke his silence about his surprise cameo in the movie’s third act during the Chronobowl sequence.

Stepping into the iconic red and blue suit, Nicolas Cage was seen fighting a giant spider (a.k.a. a Thanagarian Snare Beast) in The Flash. The actor’s moment as the Man of Steel might have been fleeting, but it left a lasting impression on him. The chance to bring his vision for this character to life, even briefly, held a special significance for Cage, who almost headlined Tim Burton’s Superman Lives back in the ’90s.

“Well, I was glad I didn’t blink,” the actor told the site. “For me, it was the feeling of being actualized. Even that look for that particular character, finally seeing it on screen, was satisfying. But as I said, it’s quick. If you really wanted to know what I was going do with that character, look at my performance in City of Angels.”

According to Cage, his portrayal of the angel character in City of Angels was a precursor to the depiction he would have offered for Clark Kent and Superman’s alien alter-ego, Kal-El. He revealed: “Clark would’ve been a little more amusing but Kal-El (had) the sensitivity and the goodness and the vulnerability and all those feelings that were kind of angelic and also terrifying.”

The Flash’s DC Universe future

Warner Bros. Discovery already has a script for a potential sequel to The Flash, written by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, the man behind the two Aquaman movies starring Jason Momoa. However, James Gunn and Peter Safran did not discuss the Flash sequel during their DC Universe presentation.

Directed by Andy Muschietti from a script written by Birds of Prey scribe Christina Hodson, The Flash is inspired by the Flashpoint comic book storyline, which followed Barry Allen as he navigated an altered DC Universe. Written by Geoff Johns and penciled by Andy Kuber, Flashpoint radically altered the status of the DC Comics universe and led to the launch of the New 52 titles.

In addition to Ezra Miller, The Flash also features Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck as two separate versions of Batman, Ron Livingston as Henry Allen, Maribel Verdú as Nora Allen, Kiersey Clemons as Iris West, Michael Shannon as General Zod, Antje Traue as Faora-Ul and Sasha Calle as Supergirl.

2023-08-16 03:47:07+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’ Director Calls Cast ‘Heroes’ for Skipping Premiere Amid Strikes: ‘They’re Sacrificing This Big Opportunity’,"Warner Bros. & DC Studios launched a star-free ""Blue Beetle"" screening on Tuesday night in L.A., with director Ángel Manuel Soto in attendance.","Amid the ongoing Hollywood strikes, Warner Bros. and DC Studios launched “Blue Beetle” on Tuesday night in Los Angeles with a star-free “fan screening” in lieu of a splashy blue-carpet premiere.
Despite the fact that the film’s actors — including Xolo Maridueña, Bruna Marquezine, George Lopez, Adriana Barraza and Susan Sarandon — could not attend due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, there was still plenty of fanfare outside the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.
Director Ángel Manuel Soto rolled solo on the carpet (which was, in fact blue), as he’s done for a significant chunk of the movie’s promotional tour, due to both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA being on strike. The filmmaker, who carried and posed with a cutout of Maridueña’s face, was riding high off the positive early buzz for the DC movie and delivered a speech before the special L.A. screening began, in which he acknowledged the “Blue Beetle” cast for being on the picket lines.
“They cannot be here today. But you know what? They’re fighting the good fight,” Soto said. “It’s very important that we understand that they are heroes right now. They’re sacrificing this big opportunity to see themselves.”
“Blue Beetle” introduces Jaime Reyes, a recent graduate of Gotham Law who gains superpowers when an alien scarab latches onto him. Soto, best known for helming 2020’s “Charm City Kings,” directs from a screenplay by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer — it’s a historic endeavor for DC Studios, as Jaime is the first Latino superhero to lead a stand-alone film for the comic book banner.
The movie, which also stars Raoul Max Trujillo, Elpidia Carrillo, Damián Alcázar and Belissa Escobedo, hits theaters on Friday.
“We put our heart and soul into [‘Blue Beetle’] because we want you guys to feel welcome to our stories,” Soto added. “Don’t fear Spanish, don’t fear Mexican heritage, don’t fear Latino heritage. We want you guys to join the party with us.”
While reviews from critics have yet to be released, early audiences heaped praise on the film’s action sequences, as well as the story’s heart and specific touchstones to Latino culture.
“‘Blue Beetle’ is fantastic fun,” tweeted Variety senior awards editor Clayton Davis. “Funny, surprisingly heartfelt with a star making turn by Xolo Maridueña. The kid has IT. Director Angel Manuel Soto makes Latinos’ supposed ‘invisibility’ into a full-on superpower. Truly inspiring. I also want the Abuela origin story now!”
Originally slated to debut on streaming alongside the now-shelved “Batigrl,” Warner Bros. elected to shift “Blue Beetle” to a theatrical release in 2022, prior to James Gunn and Peter Safran becoming co-CEOs of DC Studios.
The film represents the penultimate release of the previous DC Studios regime, with the upcoming “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” representing the final installment before the comic book universe’s continuity reboots with Gunn’s “Superman: Legacy” in 2025.
“Blue Beetle” is also one of the first major tentpole releases with its promotional plans heavily impacted by the dual strike, as talent for Warner Bros.’ “Barbie,” Universal’s “Oppenheimer” and Paramount’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” were able to complete most of or all of their planned global press tours before actors joined writers on the picket lines on July 14. (Disney’s “The Haunted Mansion” was also significantly impacted, with the studio hosting the first red carpet premiere post-strike at Disneyland on July 15. Director Justin Simien attended the event.)
With actors and writers as non-factors in movie promotional plans, 27 Latino organizations united and signed an open letter calling on the community to “amplify the work that countless Latino artists have worked so hard to create” and support films like “Blue Beetle” at the box office.
“Stories are more than entertainment,” the letter — signed by Latino Hollywood orgs such as the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute (CHCI), LA Collab, Latino Film Institute, National Association of Latino Independent Producers (NALIP) and the National Hispanic Media Coalition (NHMC) — says. “They are a powerful tool for social change that fuels our collective movement to build a more equitable, just world for those who have been historically underrepresented and marginalized.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9zY2VuZS9uZXdzL2JsdWUtYmVldGxlLXByZW1pZXJlLWRpcmVjdG9yLWFuZ2VsLW1hbnVlbC1zb3RvLXNhZy1zdHJpa2UtMTIzNTY5NzMwOS_SAW5odHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvc2NlbmUvbmV3cy9ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1wcmVtaWVyZS1kaXJlY3Rvci1hbmdlbC1tYW51ZWwtc290by1zYWctc3RyaWtlLTEyMzU2OTczMDkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

Blue Beetle became the new No. 1 movie in theaters at the domestic box office, earning a total of $25.4 million as Barbie added another $21.5 million to its total — the Greta Gerwig-directed movie has now amassed a huge $567.3 million in domestic box office takings — according to both Variety and The Hollywood Reporter. Oppenheimer came in third with takings of $10.6 million.
This weekend marks the first since its July 21 release that Barbie has not come out on top, having continued to beat several major releases like Haunted Mansion and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.
Directed by Ángel Manuel Soto, Blue Beetle is a superhero origin story based on the DC Comics character of the same name, played in the film by Xolo Maridueña.
When a powerful, parasitic device latches onto recent college graduate Jaime Reyes, claiming him as its human host, he gains superpowers. Then, billionaire businesswoman Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) hunts him down to weaponize the alien tech.

Maridueña, 22, was originally cast in the Blue Beetle role in 2021; he makes for DC Studios' first-ever Latino superhero.
With Latinx audiences seeing an authentically represented family in the comic-book-movie genre for the first time, Maridueña recently told PEOPLE he “can start to practice all of these lessons” his own family taught him.
“And it's not lost on me that that is a rarity, especially when it comes to the arts,"" he added.
The actor also said he hopes movies like ""Blue Beetle, Across the Spider-Verse, Joy Ride"" and more will ""hopefully instill confidence” in young audiences not used to seeing themselves onscreen.
""[Representation] really goes a long way, and I'm so excited finally for Blue Beetle to come out to just fill in another piece of the puzzle,"" Maridueña said.

As a result of Barbie's financial success, Greta Gerwig became the highest-grossing female director of a live-action movie at the global box office, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The film's sales topped those of 2019's Captain Marvel, which was co-directed by Anna Boden.
Barbie's success has led Mattel, the toy company that owns the Barbie brand, to plan to adapt 14 additional Mattel properties — including a Polly Pocket movie, directed by Lena Dunham and starring Lily Collins — for the big screen.

2023-08-11 17:37:25+00:00,"‘Blue Beetle’ First Reactions: DC’s Latest Praised as ‘Funny,’ ‘Emotional’ and ‘A Love Letter to the Latino Culture’","The first reactions to DC Studios' “Blue Beetle,” starring Xolo Maridueña, are flying in.","The first reactions to DC Studios‘ “Blue Beetle,” starring Xolo Maridueña, are flying in, with early viewers calling the film a “huge surprise.” While some of the reactions quibble with parts feeling shaky or playing things a bit too silly, they mostly praise the film’s action, heart and specific touchstones to Latino culture.
The film, which hits theaters on Aug. 18, follows teenager Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) and his encounter with an alien relic that attaches to his body, bestowing the adolescent with extraordinary powers. Blue Beetle, notably, is one of the most preeminent Latino superheroes in comic book history. The rest of the “Blue Beetle” cast is predominantly Latino, including Bruna Marquezine, George Lopez, Raoul Max Trujillo, Adriana Barraza, Elpidia Carrillo, Damián Alcázar and Belissa Escobedo, along with Susan Sarandon.
“Charm City Kings” director Angel Manuel Soto helmed “Blue Beetle” from a screenplay by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer. The DC Comics film was originally slated as an HBO Max original, alongside the now-shelved “Batigrl.” Warner Bros. elected to shift to a theatrical release for the feature prior to James Gunn and Peter Safran becoming co-CEOs of DC Studios.
The film represents the penultimate release of the current DC Studios regime, with the upcoming “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” representing the final installment before the comic book universe’s continuity reboots with Gunn’s “Superman: Legacy” in 2025. However, Maridueña and Soto have spoken openly about hopes for the hero’s on-screen future under the new regime.
See the first reactions below.
Impressed by the pop culture details & historical references in BLUE BEETLE. From MACARIO, to CRONOS, and El CHAPULÍN COLORADO. But even more so that the infamous School of the Americas is integral to the story. This is the work of filmmakers who know & care about Latin America. pic.twitter.com/Li7ZTK629m — Carlos Aguilar (@Carlos_Film) August 10, 2023
It’s an action packed, highly entertaining superhero story about family…& there’s nothing more important than family.
The film is unique in that it lovingly & unabashedly shares the Reyes family’s Mexican culture. @bluebeetle 🧵 pic.twitter.com/o6Q9kUrbeC — POC Culture (@POCculture) August 11, 2023
The #BlueBeetle movie is mostly a blast.
Some is too silly or childish for me, a lot had me laughing loud (George Lopez!). Practical suit rocks. The Latino representation is awesome.
Enjoyed the family-centric stakes, solid action beats. Overall, it’s fun. pic.twitter.com/5qzWIkmDyE — BD (@BrandonDavisBD) August 11, 2023
DC should’ve marketed #BlueBeetle more. It's a fun, self-contained, emotional story about family. Xolo Maridueña is perfectly cast and SHINES as Jamie Reyes. George Lopez and Bruna Marquezine are also standouts. I'm so happy #BlueBeetle is the first DCU character. pic.twitter.com/ANyyx2gPXv — BSL 🔜 #TIFF23 (@bigscreenleaks) August 11, 2023
Happy to report that @angelmanuelsoto’s #BlueBeetle is definitely a great time at the movies! Not only is it a fantastic introduction to Jaime Reyes as a character/hero, but also a love letter to the Latino culture, that focuses on family as its foundation. @bluebeetle 1/3 pic.twitter.com/ieVw0DSR2Z — Fico (@FicoCangiano) August 11, 2023
2023-08-14 09:30:00+00:00,BLUE BEETLE Director Reveals Who He'd Cast As BANE If The Movie Ever Happens As Part Of DCU,It's no secret that Blue Beetle director Angel Manuel Soto hoped to make a Bane movie for DC"," and the filmmaker has now revealed who he would cast in the role if the project ever becomes a reality...""","Blue Beetle director Angel Manuel Soto has said on multiple occasions that he pitched a Bane movie to Warner Bros. before being offered the opportunity to tell Jaime Reyes' story in what was originally a Max movie set in the DCEU.
Plans changed when David Zaslav took charge of Warner Bros. Discovery, and Blue Beetle will now be released theatrically this weekend.
Should it prove to be a success, then there's a chance we'll see Jamie's story continue in a sequel, especially as DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn has already confirmed Blue Beetle is part of the DCU. However, that Bane project is one Soto remains keen to revisit.
""Well, look, when I had conceived that idea, I had no one in mind,"" he says of casting the iconic Batman villain. ""But suddenly Dave Bautista came out to say that he wants to do it and I went, 'This is an obvious choice, yes.'""
""And I had the chance to meet him. He saw Blue Beetle, and he loved it and so I said okay if they let me do Bane...you're my Bane.""
That's not a decision which will ultimately be Soto's to make, and even Bautista has acknowledged he might now be too old to play the character. Earlier this year, the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 star said, ""I just don't know if I could handle the physical part, and I don't think I would have the longevity to plan ahead for films.""
We'll see what happens, but there will be plenty of fans who are 100% on board with Soto's hopes to cast Bautista in the role. Previously, the filmmaker said he used many of his ideas for Bane in Blue Beetle as part of Carapax's story, so it's unclear how serious he is about making this villain-led project.
Do you think the Drax actor is the right choice to bring Bane to life in the DCU?",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL2NvbWljYm9va21vdmllLmNvbS9ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS9ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1kaXJlY3Rvci1yZXZlYWxzLXdoby1oZWQtY2FzdC1hcy1iYW5lLWlmLXRoZS1tb3ZpZS1ldmVyLWhhcHBlbnMtYXMtcGFydC1vZi1kY3UtYTIwNDk5NNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-26 14:43:09+00:00,Blue Beetle Director Explains Why Jaime Doesn’t Deserve to Save the World Yet,Blue Beetle Director Angel Manuel Soto explains why Xolo Maridueña's DC Universe hero can't save the world.,"Blue Beetle Director Angel Manuel Soto explains why Xolo Maridueña‘s DC Universe hero can’t save the world: He hasn’t earned it.
In an interview with Den of Geek, the filmmaker discussed how his movie approaches Jaime Reyes’ journey as a hero, noting that both he and writer Gareth Dunnet Alcocer agreed that the stakes needed to be much lower than a cataclysmic event. “He’s not going to save the world yet; he doesn’t deserve to yet,” Soto said. “We wanted to find a way to really explore his growth, how it relates to how his family and community see him in this role, as well as how his relationship with Khaji grows as well.”
Soto has spoken at length about what he wants to achieve with Blue Beetle, explaining that his goal was to create an authentic Latin American superhero that people can relate to easily. “I didn’t want it to be another story where 15 minutes in, something happens, and 50 minutes later, he’s dominating the experience, and by the end, he’s saving the world,” Soto said. The director elaborates that Jaime’s family and their bond needed to be the core of the movie and he hopes audiences will be able to identify with their struggles.
Who Is Blue Beetle?
Blue Beetle follows Jaime Reyes, an unassuming young adult who comes into contact with a strange alien device known only as The Scarab. The artifact ultimately forms a symbiotic relationship with the young hero, fusing with his body and granting him a high-tech suit that’s able to shapeshift into different weapons. While he may not have asked for these abilities, Jaime and his family are thrown into a battle with an evil corporation that wants to harness the powers of The Scarab for their own nefarious goals.

,Blue Beetle Breaks Out: Josh Trujillo Shares the Next Steps in Jaime’s Journey,"Like most young adults, DC’s most recent Blue Beetle is trying to navigate that nebulous period between adolescence and adulthood. That’s difficult enough on its own, and it’s even harder when you’re a superhero.","The future is looking bright for Jaime Reyes—he just has to figure out what that is.
Like most young adults, DC’s most recent Blue Beetle is trying to navigate that nebulous period between adolescence and adulthood. That’s difficult enough on its own, and it’s even harder when you’re a superhero.
As the Blue Beetle, Jaime is part of the DC Universe’s next generation of protectors. He’s also having quite a moment this year. His debut film is currently in theaters and today the debut issue of his first ongoing series in over five years hits stores. Written by Josh Trujillo and drawn by Adrián Gutiérrez, the team behind the critically acclaimed Blue Beetle: Graduation Day, Blue Beetle #1 picks off right where that previous miniseries left off, with Jaime in Palmera City and working alongside Ted Kord.
I recently had a chance to sit down with Trujillo (us Joshes have to stick together) about his plans for Jaime. From old friends to new enemies, here are some of the cool things we can expect as Trujillo takes Jaime into the Dawn of DC.
Before we get into the new Blue Beetle series, let's talk about Graduation Day. You had a very unique opportunity there because you got to set up some of the concepts that were used in the movie, like Palmera City and Victoria Kord. How did that work?
It was an incredible opportunity. We wanted to tell this story about Jaime's next phase in life. What does it mean to go from a teenager to a young adult? And what is the stress and the challenges and the opportunities there? And we also had this opportunity with the movie coming out. DC was asking itself, “Is there something here we can bring into the comics world?”
Fortunately, it really aligned with the story I wanted to tell. And quite selfishly, I just love Victoria Kord and I wanted to see her on the page.
Everyone loves a girlboss.
She's definitely that, and it's nice to go fill out Ted Kord's supporting cast in a way that we haven't really had in a while.
How much did you know about what was going to be in the movie?
It was more of a blank slate. They gave me the pillars to work with. I still haven't seen the movie. I don't know what happens in the movie. (Editor’s note: This was true when this interview took place, but he’s since changed that.) I hope what I did is similar to what happens in the Blue Beetle film, but it won't be a copy.
It makes Graduation Day a cool companion piece for the film.
I'm hoping to make the book as accessible as possible for both the fans of the movie and fans of Jaime in general. And even people like me who spent our younger years reading the Keith Giffen, Cully Hamner, Rafael Albuquerque and John Rogers run. We really draw from those iconic stories in Graduation Day.
And now you have your Dawn of DC Blue Beetle ongoing. Where do we find Jaime when this series begins?
Jaime has a lot on his plate. He's in a new city. He's working at his tia's diner. He has a bunch of superheroes he needs to take care of and kind of guide to their next step of their journey. We've got Dynastes, the Yellow Beetle. We've got the Nitida, the Green Beetle. We've got a whole cast of characters. We have Starfire, Ted Kord, and there is Victoria scheming in the background. But really going into this, Jaime is going to learn how to be a leader. He is going to find this new confidence and he's going to own his new powerset. At the end of Graduation Day, he got new armor, and so we're going to explore what that means. And we're also going to throw a bunch of villains at him to see what hurts him.
Will college be part of this experience?
Jaime is famously on a bit of a gap year. He is exploring his superhero identity. He is exploring his new surroundings. And eventually, I'm sure he'll go back to school. There's that famous issue where Jaime said his ultimate desire is to become a dentist, and I always feel like the dentistry is endgame. It's just going to be a long path to get there.
What inspired you to have Jaime take a gap year?
I think a lot of teenagers, when they're coming out of high school, they don't necessarily have a plan. I wanted to reflect that in Jaime. He's so busy saving the world, he doesn't necessarily think to take his AP exams, or to apply to any colleges. And so, just to put him in a situation that a lot of teen heroes don't face is kind of interesting to me.
Starfire is one of my favorite DC characters, so I was excited to learn that she would be mentoring Jaime. What made you come up with that pairing? What kind of relationship will the two of them have?
I love Princess Koriand'r. I think people kind of confuse her optimism with naivete. You know how some people are street smart? Starfire is space smart. She can tap into this cosmic DC Universe in a way a lot of other heroes can't. And she's also not of this Earth. So, in some ways, she can relate to Jaime's scarab, Khaji Da, and his journey as much as she can to Jaime. I wanted someone who could teach Jaime how to be a warrior, how to be a leader, and Starfire and Jaime have crossed paths before, so I really wanted to build up that relationship.
What will Yellow Beetle and Green Beetle bring to the supporting cast?
When last we saw them, they were sent by the Horizon, which is an offshoot of the villainous Reach, to wipe out any Reach technology they came into contact with. This means Jaime and his scarab. Fortunately, Jaime did not get destroyed and he was able to convince them to turn to the side of heroes.
Right now, they're figuring out their new lives. Dynastes has super strength and invulnerability. Nitida is a bit of a shapeshifter and size-changer. I am really excited to explore Jaime's cast of characters, add some new faces, add some new heroes, and kind of see how they play off of each other.
You deal with legacy in a lot of your books. We can't talk about Jaime without talking about Ted Kord and Dan Garrett. We know that Ted is going to be one of Jaime's mentors, but is the shadow of Dan Garrett anywhere in this series?
We're introducing a new villain called the Blood Scarab to the Blue Beetle mythos. He has ties to Dan Garrett. In many ways, he has ties to the original Blue Beetle villain. I challenge everyone to go dig up their long boxes and try to figure out who that is. Dan is always front of mind in this story, but obviously, we're here to talk about Jaime and his journey.
How do you feel Jaime has grown as a hero since he debuted during Infinite Crisis?
I think he's found his footing in a lot of ways. He was kind of a little wide-eyed. He's always a little overwhelmed. But I think he's found his strength and his place. I think by the end of Graduation Day, you see how his heroic journey is kind of set up for the next stage. And now, he doesn't just have to look after himself—he has this new family of heroes.
Jaime’s not an orphan. Unlike a lot of young DC heroes, his family wasn't brutally killed. Can you talk about Jaime's relationship with his family and if that's going to figure into your run at all?
When last we saw Jaime's parents, they kicked him out of the house for not having a plan and sent him to live with his tia. Family is really essential to Jaime's story. It's not just the legacy of his superhero identity, it's the legacy of his parents. He comes from such a proud heritage, and I want to explore that in the book. We're going to see a lot more of Gloria and Marisol, and hopefully before too long, we'll see a return to El Paso.
Another relationship that's very important to the title is the one between you and Adrián Gutiérrez. What’s your working relationship like with each other?
I get pages from Adrian almost every single day, and it's the highlight of waking up every morning. We've really become quite smitten with each other. He's an incredible talent. He has such an enthusiasm. The whole Blue Beetle team really has bonded in a big way. We have our colorist, Wil Quintana, who really makes every page shine. We have our letterer, Lucas Gattoni, who not just letters the English edition, but also the Spanish edition. I think he's the only letterer in comics doing that. And of course, our captain, our editor, Andrew Marino. Team Blue Beetle is a tight cohesive unit, and we're just excited to tell as many stories with Jaime as we can.
Blue Beetle #1 by Josh Trujillo, Adrián Gutiérrez and Wil Quintana is now available in print and as a digital comic book. Josh’s previous Blue Beetle miniseries, Blue Beetle: Graduation Day, is now available in a graphic novel collection and to read in full on DC UNIVERSE INFINITE.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRjLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjMvMDkvMDUvYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtYnJlYWtzLW91dC1qb3NoLXRydWppbGxvLXNoYXJlcy10aGUtbmV4dC1zdGVwcy1pbi1qYWltZS1zLWpvdXJuZXnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

How does the Blue Beetle movie address Ted Kord?
While speaking with Fandango, Bruna Marquezine — who plays Ted’s daughter Jenny — and George Lopez — who plays Jaime’s uncle Rudy — discuss the influence of Ted Kord on the story of the film.
“So Jenny’s Ted’s daughter, which is really exciting,” Marquezine stated. “Ted, before disappearing, was in charge of Kord Industries, and now Jenny’s trying her best to keep her dad’s legacy. He is really important for the movie, though, because we use all of his gadgets.”
“It’s really the first man cave, I believe,” Lopez said. “It’s a throwback. He’s got some Oreo cookies in there — pallets of Oreo cookies. He’s got some cool tools.”
“The Bugship,” Marquezine noted, “So thank you, dad.”

,'Blue Beetle' Director on Casting Xolo Maridueña and How the Strike Affects the DC Movie (Exclusive),"Ángel Manuel Soto opened up to ET about casting his lead, Xolo Maridueña, and why it's 'bittersweet' for the film to premiere now.","Blue Beetle is the newest hero in the DC universe, and he's got his work cut out for him!
Director Ángel Manuel Soto recently sat down with ET's Ash Crossan to talk about making the first major superhero movie with a Latino lead -- and the uphill battle that has been releasing it amid the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.
""The strike was not in my bingo card,"" Soto admitted. ""But at the same time, you know, actions like that are necessary and they have to happen when they have to happen. Unfortunately, it happened while we were on premiere, and it's no secret that it affects us disproportionately, people of color and marginalized communities, for that matter, and minorities.""
""But the truth is that our actors, our talent -- which is the main reason why we want to support them -- they really, really gave it all... They gave their heart and soul,"" he added.
The film's talented cast is anchored by its lead, Cobra Kai and Parenthood star Xolo Maridueña, who steps into the role of Jaime Reyes, a young college grad who becomes host to the Scarab, an ancient alien relic that gives him the powerful exoskeleton armor to become the superhero Blue Beetle.
Soto told ET that watching Maridueña play Miguel Diaz on Cobra Kai helped him realize that he was the perfect actor to take on the lead role in the Blue Beetle movie. As a bonus, the young actor already had plenty of martial arts training. But that wasn't ultimately what won Soto over.
""It really struck me, his personality,"" he recalled. ""A kid who was like, the star of this TV show, who happens to be his age, acting his age, but really wise. He had all this charisma and energy with him, and on top of that, his family was always with him... Those were qualities and values that I respected for a kid his age.""
Soto also joked that Maridueña's personality felt like a ""copy-paste"" of the comics' Jaime Reyes.
""Right off the bat, it was, 'It's him or him,' type of scenario,"" he admitted. ""It was really cool to see how the studio backed me up in that decision, and even better seeing him stepping up to the plate.""
Warner Bros. Pictures
The Blue Beetle has gone through three major iterations in the history of comics. The character was first introduced by Fox Comics in 1939, as Dan Garrett took on the mantle -- first as a police officer and then, in a later revamped version from Charlton Comics, as an archaeologist, tapping into the ancient Egyptian powers of the Scarab.
Ted Kord was the second Beetle, a student of Garrett's who took up the mantle himself in the Charlton Comics, and later, DC Comics runs. When Jaime Reyes was introduced in 2006 as a successor to Ted Kord, the Blue Beetle origins were retconned to be an alien being.
""Once I came to the project, it was always the story of Jaime Reyes,"" Soto explained. ""We wanted to focus this film solely on him and his family.""
However, Susan Sarandon's role in the film as Ted's sister, Victoria Kord, adds a new layer of canonical intrigue to the story.
""We didn't wanna keep away from the fact that the legacy of Ted Kord still looms and intersects with the story of Jaime Reyes,"" Soto explained. ""So in the film, we do mention and honor the Blue Beetles that came before Jaime Reyes... There's plenty of Easter eggs.""
While Soto was motivated to keep his Blue Beetle story ""self-contained"" within the newly-created ""Palmera City,"" there are also references to what might pop up for the character in the future of the DCU. Jaime studied at Gotham Law, and there's a background newscast mention of Bruce Wayne, but Soto said his goal was to keep references to other well-known DC characters to a minimum.
""This serves as an introduction card for Jaime Reyes,"" he said of his film. ""If anybody has any questions what his background is, anybody can go back to this movie and know where he came from.""
Where Jaime/Blue Beetle might show up in future adventures, however -- and who he might fight alongside -- remains to be seen.
""This project has survived through regimes, this project survived cancellations,"" Soto noted. ""To have James Gunn now communicate openly that Blue Beetle is the first hero of his new DCU is definitely a testament to the effort and the love and the passion that everybody has put into this project, especially our actors.""
""We always saw this movie as the first act of a bigger saga,"" he continued, explaining what it meant to him to introduce the first Latino superhero to lead a movie. ""We wanted to introduce this character into the world. We wanted to introduce our community, our values, our history, our relationship with our family front and center. Because we've never had that opportunity before. We wanted to show the world who we are before we start fighting cosmic battles and saving the universe. We wanted to keep it grounded. personal, intimate, so that then the next movies that come, we can dive into the whole action sequences. We can go crazy with all the explosions.""
That desire to keep things intimate and personal doesn't always translate when promoting a superhero blockbuster, however, and Soto lamented that his cast was missing out on the chance to ""receive their flowers"" amid the strike. But he reiterated that the Blue Beetle stars ""understand that there's a heroic moment right now, that they need to be part of the right side of history.""
""They know what this means, not just for the cultural side, but for every other kid out there who has never seen themselves represented, being able to do that for them,"" he marveled. ""For me, having them fight the good fight, knowing that all the sacrifices that they're doing are gonna pave the way for future generations to enjoy better pay and better treatment it only fills me with energy to keep promoting this film for them.""
""The best way to recognize, not only their sacrifice, but also support them for their future careers, and hopefully, the future of more diverse storytelling by people who come from those communities, is by showing up in theaters on Aug. 18 and letting the people know that we have their backs,"" he continued. ""It's taken us this long to be here, and it's sad that the strike is happening right now so that they cannot receive their flowers when they're supposed to receive it. I think the best way to show them that we love them is by showing up in the theaters.""
The film also stars George Lopez, Harvey Guillén, Bruna Marquezine, Belissa Escobedo, Adriana Barraza, Damián Alcázar, Raoul Max Trujillo, Elpidia Carrillo and Becky G as the voice of the Scarab, Khaji-Da.

,How Henry Cavill's Superman Plays a Role in Blue Beetle Movie,"'Blue Beetle' director Angel Manuel Soto is a big fan of Zack Snyder, and included some references to 'Man of Steel' in the next DC movie.","Man of Steel, the 2012 Superman origin story that kicked off DC's first stab at a shared universe of live-action movies, was apparently an inspiration to the filmmakers Blue Beetle, even if Jaime Reyes himself is being billed as the first character introduced for the DC Universe that formally launches in 2025. Angel Manuel Soto, the director of Blue Beetle buried a promise that fans will see some Man of Steel shout-outs in his response to Zack Snyder's excitement for the film. Snyder, who previously collaborated with DC Studios chief James Gunn on Dawn of the Dead, recently praised Blue Beetle for its inclusion of Latino culture on social media.
Snyder's comments came as DC fans have struggled to make sense of how much, if any, of the universe Snyder built will carry over to 2025's Superman: Legacy, which has recast the hero, swapping out Cavill for David Corenswett. Many of the same fans who successfully lobbied for the release of Snyder's director's cut of Justice League have been feeling antipathy toward the new regime for pushing Cavill out.
""Waking up in Mexico to the news that [Zack] Snyder wants to see it too, a director that I respect so much, that his films are an immense influence... Even in Blue Beetle, there are some references to Man of Steel that we made out of honor and respect for the work and art of Zack Snyder. Also, seeing David Ayer sharing it... It's like, 'WOW, brother!' How nice it feels to have that support from people that one respects and that the fans also respect.""
You can see that interview (it's in Spanish, so heads up. The Snyder comments were translated by Movieweb) below.
From Warner Bros. Pictures comes Blue Beetle, which arrives in theaters on August 18th, marking the DC superhero's first time on the big screen.

When the Scarab suddenly chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, he is bestowed with an incredible suit of armor capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the Super Hero BLUE BEETLE.

Amid the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes, the cast of the NBC sitcom was seen outside the Amazon Studios in Culver City.
The picketers on the scene included Aubrey Plaza, Adam Scott, Nick Offerman, Retta, Jim O’Heir, Ben Schwartz, Alison Becker, Kirk Fox, Joe Mande, Susan Yeagley, Allan McLeod and Colton Dunn.
Alongside the Parks and Recreation stars, Li’l Sebastian, Pawnee’s famous miniature horse, also made an appearance.
April Ludgate, the character that Plaza played in the comedy, famously had a feud with Rashida Jones’s Ann Perkins. Plaza made reference to that with her picket sign that read, “Ann Perkins works for the AMPTP.”
Yeagley took to social media to share a slideshow of photos from the picket lines and captioned the post, “Parks and Recreation Day on the picket lines. What a thrill to see the sweet family again.
One day longer. One day stronger.”
Parks and Recreation ran for seven seasons on NBC from 2009 through 2015 and it starred Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope, a deputy director of the Parks and Recreation Department in the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana. The sitcom created by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur had been originally conceived as a spinoff to The Office but was later redeveloped into the show it became to be.
The show kept the mockumentary style of The Office and became a ratings success for the network with multiple Primetime Emmy Award nominations throughout its run.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvcGFya3MtYW5kLXJlY3JlYXRpb24tY2FzdC1yZXVuaW9uLXBpY2tldC1saW5lLWF1YnJleS1wbGF6YS1hZGFtLXNjb3R0LWxpbC1zZWJhc3RpYW4tMTIzNTQ2MTQwOC_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC9wYXJrcy1hbmQtcmVjcmVhdGlvbi1jYXN0LXJldW5pb24tcGlja2V0LWxpbmUtYXVicmV5LXBsYXphLWFkYW0tc2NvdHQtbGlsLXNlYmFzdGlhbi0xMjM1NDYxNDA4L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

However, director Angel Manuel Soto teases that they will need multiple viewings to catch everything the latest DC Universe movie has to offer.
There’s an entire industry online of creators picking apart Easter eggs in comic book movies, so it’s no shock that Blue Beetle would also have its fair share. It seems as though references to Man of Steel won’t be the only element connecting the film to the broader DC Universe, with director Angel Manuel Soto confirming the presence of a Green Lantern.
“There are a lot of Easter Eggs. I always say, if you watch it a second time, or even three times, you’re gonna find different Easter Eggs every single time, because they’re very minimal,” the director told a Heroic Hollywood reporter before adding, “Do you notice the green beam in the title sequence? That’s the Green Lantern. See? You’ll have to see it again!”
A Green Lantern isn’t the only cosmic part of the DC Universe that Angel Manuel Soto teased for Blue Beetle. While speaking to one of our reporters, Angel Manuel Soto teased one of Jaime Reyes’ most iconic villains may show up in the future, stating “Get ready for Black Beetle.”
For those unaware, Black Beetle is a moniker held by several villains from Blue Beetle media. The first was an unnamed villain from the future using a scarab also made by The Reach, the alien species that created the Khaji Da scarab wielded by Jaime Reyes. The scarab was also used by Jaime’s friend Paco Testas in the comics and an unnamed Reach warrior in Young Justice. It’s unclear which approach Angel Manuel Soto will take in future films, but it’ll certainly be a delight for fans.
Who is DC’s Blue Beetle?
Blue Beetle is one of DC’s lesser-known heroes, but he has a dedicated fanbase nonetheless. Created in 1939 by Charles Wojtkowski, Blue Beetle has gone through several iterations over the years. The Jaime Reyes version of the character was introduced during the events of 2006’s Infinite Crisis and quickly became a fan-favorite.
In the pages of DC Comics, Jaime Reyes is a teenager from El Paso, Texas. Jaime discovers a scarab beetle-shaped device that bonds with his body, giving him access to an advanced suit of armor and various powers. He becomes the latest in a long line of Blue Beetles and must learn to balance his newfound abilities with his everyday life.
Angel Manuel Soto is directing Blue Beetle from a screenplay by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer.

So in terms of viewers who want to say they want to take advantage of *** $4 ticket, how do they know whether or not the theater near them applies. Ok. So all you would do is go to Fandango. You could either go to Fandango dot com or to our app. Tickets are on sale now, they're gonna be on sale all week. The thing that I love about Fandango is that you can go on and I like to sometimes gauge what time I'm gonna go see *** movie based on the, the seats that are available and where I like to sit, I have my specific seat. I like to see. So you can check the app and you can check what's available. Um, and it's gonna be busy. I mean, last year was the first annual National Cinema Day and basically it was the highest number of people that went to the cinema all year. So I'd recommend going as early as possible to get your tickets. Ok, I like that. Now, do you have to get them day of or can you book them in advance? Like today, you can get them day off or you can book them in advance. But like I said, I'd recommend getting them early because movies like Oppenheimer have tended to be sold out all summer and this weekend is going to be no exception. We've been talking *** lot about deals. Uh My last guest actually join from *** ARP if you are *** senior citizen, um, do the same deals apply to you if you want to see the film on ***, on *** Sunday. Yeah, this is basically *** flat rate situation. So, no matter what age you are. But the nice thing is like *** family of four could go see *** movie, you could bring your grandma and it's $4. So *** family of four or five could see *** movie, could see the movies for about $20. Uh, standard screens. What about IMAX screens? What all applies? So this is the beauty of it. If so, for some people who have never seen *** movie in IMAX or never seen *** movie in *** premium uh format like *** L, it's $4 no matter what cinema you go to or what theater you sit at. So for example, if you did want to see Oppenheimer and IMAX or there's *** movie coming out this weekend called Grand Charism, which I would recommend in four DX. That's where, you know, your seat moves and sometimes you get air in your face, you really get the immersive experience. Um But yeah, across the board, every movie theater, every ticket, every seat is four bucks. Ok. So I think the other big question is snacks, right? We asked our viewers on our social media pool, you know, basically like our snacks. What's tipping the edge here in terms of making the theater too expensive these days? Obviously, the discount applies to tickets. What about snacks? Well, every theater fandango sells tickets, but every theater will have different deals and I know *** lot of, I've read *** lot about *** lot of different theater chains and exhibitors that are offering snacks deals to go along with the $4 to make it just *** really affordable day for everybody. Ok, that's good. And especially something to do on *** hot day on any other ways to save Nicky. Well, I mean, we have *** Fandango Rewards program which you can sign up for. You can become *** Fandango VIP. And what that means is every ticket that you buy earns you points. Sometimes you can get double the points. So for example, about every four tickets you buy will earn you enough points to get $5 off the next movie. Or you could use it on our streaming service, Voodoo and you could, that's an *** la carte service. So there's no subscription involved. It's pay as you go. So if you wanted to see *** movie like Jennifer Lawrence, no hard feelings that I just saw. It's an R rated raunchy comedy, we have that and you could put it towards that. Do you know if any like old films are playing in the theaters on Sunday that it maybe could be like *** throwback for viewers for movie goers. This is the fun part, Kristen is that there's such *** wide variety coming out this weekend and there's going to be *** lot of re releases. So like for example, if you didn't watch the Super Mario Brothers, which is right now, the highest grossing movie of the year you, it's going to be re released in theaters for this one day only. But the fun thing is *** lot of old, old throwbacks are gonna be available. For example, Jurassic Park, the original that came out in the nineties is gonna be available in 3d. And then this is the one that I'm definitely doing. There's *** little Mermaid sing along. So the 2023 movie starring Halle Bailey, you can go in and you can sing as loud as you want to all the songs in the movie because I tend to have to like hold it back what I'm watching. So, um and then for people who love Barbie and have not seen any of Greta Gerwig, the director's other movies, Lady Bird is getting re-released in theaters. That was her solo directorial debut that earned her five Academy Award nominations. Um Indiana Jones five is getting rereleased just *** ton. Yeah. So check your local, um the fan app and your local theaters to see what's playing on Nicky. Such great insight. I think *** lot of people including myself are now excited to celebrate. So thank you for the deals and thank you for joining.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtjcmEuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmF0aW9uYWwtY2luZW1hLWRheS1tb3ZpZXMtdG8td2F0Y2gvNDQ5MTA1MzXSAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5rY3JhLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9uYXRpb25hbC1jaW5lbWEtZGF5LW1vdmllcy10by13YXRjaC80NDkxMDUzNQ?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-28 10:48:13+00:00,"Superman Legacy: Release Date, Cast, Plot, Leaks & Rumors","The new DCU is here with Superman: Legacy being next in line; find out about Superman Legacy release date, cast, and plot leaks and rumors!","The brand-new DCU has finally made its debut with its first superhero, Blue Beetle, released on August 18, 2023. The movie has been able to gather up some really good reviews all over the world, setting up high expectations for the next major DCU project — Superman: Legacy. As we all know, till now, Superman has been played by multiple actors, but the most loved out of them was Henry Cavill, who is no longer playing the caped superhero.
The recasting of Superman came as a shock to a lot of fans, but this information is equally exciting since we get to see a brand-new take on Superman, which can be rather refreshing for the audience. In this article, we discuss everything we know about the release date, cast, and plot of the next major DCU project, Superman: Legacy.
Superman Legacy is set to release on 11 May 2025, as revealed by James Gunn, in a YouTube video where he explained his plans for the DCU.
According to the plan, DCU will now follow a chapterwise approach. As of now, we only know about the first chapter, named, Chapter 1 – Gods and Monsters. James Gunn, while explaining this first chapter, revealed the release dates for almost all the upcoming DCU projects, including Superman: Legacy.
If everything goes smoothly after the ongoing writer/actor strikes in the United States, we will get to see the brand new Superman on the big screen without any delay in the given release date.
Superman Legacy Cast
@MyTimeToShineH Is this a real leak about superman legacy? pic.twitter.com/V8hQC9KZaB— 𝑱𝑪𝒉𝒖𝒄𝒌 (@jcarlosnava23) August 12, 2023
The casting for Superman Legacy is already halfway through, and we know precisely who our new Superman is going to be. James Gunn has officially cast David Corenswet as Clark Kent/ Superman and Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane. Other than the lead cast, we also know that the movie will feature certain other super-characters as well. We will get to see a new Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, Mister Terrific, and Metamorpho in the new Superman movie as well.
Nathan Fillion will be seen in the role of Guy Gardner/ Green Lantern, Isabela Merced will be playing Hawkgirl, Edi Gathegi will be playing the role of Mister Terrific and Anthony Carrigan will be seen in the role of Metamorpho.

According to an exclusive report by Deadline, María Gabriela De Faría has been cast as the Superman Legacy villain. She will be playing the role of Angela Spica who goes by the supervillain name of “The Engineer,” who is a relatively newer supervillain as compared to the origin of Superman. She is the second character to take up this name and was introduced in the comic run of The Authority vol.1 #1 in 1999. As an actress, De Faría’s most renowned role to date was in the Lionsgate exclusive movie The Exorcism of God.
As of now, The Engineer is the first officially announced villain for Superman Legacy, and if we are apparently getting to see a complete team of superheroes, we might also get to see a team of supervillains. So, let us just wait and see what James Gunn’s new DC universe presents us with at the end of the day. Brainiac will be the main villain in James Gunn’s ‘SUPERMAN: LEGACY’. pic.twitter.com/ssNtOlz39x— CanWeGetSomeToast (@CanWeGetToast) November 17, 2023
In another post, CanWeGetSomeToast claims that Superman Legacy’s main villain is going to be Brainiac who is going to lead a group of supervillains against a group of superheroes. In the Twitter post, they stated that –
“Anyway, the big bad is Brainiac behind everything. As said in the first post, I trust the source but it’s all a game of telephone with info passed ear to ear, so we’ll see how much of this (if anything) pans out. Sounds solid to me though if it’s true.”
Even though the source of this information is trustworthy, we can’t say anything for sure until and unless James Gunn or DCU comes up with an official statement regarding this rumor. However, it would be awesome if we got to see a live-action version of Brainiac but as of now, all we can do is wait and see what James Gunn has actually planned for Superman Legacy’s Villains.
Nicholas Hoult has been cast as Lex Luthor in ‘SUPERMAN LEGACY’

In addition to these exciting casting rumors, an exclusive report by Deadline states that James Gunn has finally found his Lex Luthor for Superman Legacy. According to their report, Nicholas Hoult has been cast as Lex Luthor and will be carrying forward the legacy of the role previously played by Gene Hackman, Kevin Spacey, and Jesse Eisenberg. It would be quite interesting to see where this goes since Nicholas Hoult is a phenomenal actor. Earlier this year, he also reprised his legendary role of Beast in MCU’s The Marvels and since then is a hot topic of discussion among fans.

Superman Legacy Trailer
As of now, there are no official trailers for Superman Legacy. At the time of writing, the movie hasn’t even begun production, but we expect the trailer to be released by March 2025. We will keep you updated as soon as the Superman: Legacy trailer is released by James Gunn and his team.
Superman Legacy Plot
It won’t be wrong to say that Superman Legacy is one of the most anticipated DC universe movies so far, and it’s not really a surprise. The last standalone Superman movie was Man of Steel (2013) and after that, the next major standalone movie is going to be Superman Legacy, which will be released in 2025.
As far as the plot of the movie is concerned, we don’t know anything about the official plot of the movie at the moment. But if we look at it, according to what James Gunn revealed in his Gods and Monsters video, we can speculate on what it might be.
Superman Legacy will not look at the origin story of Superman, instead, it will focus more on a grown-up Clark Kent who is trying to create a balance between his life as a symbol of hope for the whole world, and a regular everyday reporter trying to make ends meet. This movie is going to focus more on the human side of Superman and his struggles playing the part of a superhero.
As of now, we don’t know who will be the villain of Superman Legacy, but if we look at the recently released Blue Beetle movie’s easter eggs, we can assume that Lex Luthor can be the villain of this movie. Lex being the villain of this movie makes sense as well since throughout the DC comic universe, Lex Luthor has been the arch-nemesis of Superman.
There’s a lot out there about Superman Legacy, and to know what is true and what isn’t, we will have to wait till the official release date of the movie.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vYmVlYm9tLmNvbS9zdXBlcm1hbi1sZWdhY3ktcmVsZWFzZS1kYXRlLWNhc3QtbGVha3Mv0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly9iZWVib20uY29tL3N1cGVybWFuLWxlZ2FjeS1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUtY2FzdC1sZWFrcy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

Akinfemi plays the role of Goodwin and had been a series regular since its first season. However, ahead of its Season 5 renewal, Akinfemi and 10 of his co-stars were going to get bumped down to recurring and not guaranteed 22 episodes per season amid budget cuts.
The only stars to remain regulars on the show were the two leads that give the show its name played by Billy Gardell and Folake Olowofoyeku.
“It was a bit surprising, for all of 10 seconds,” Akinfemi told The New York Times in an interview before the SAG-AFTRA strike. “We are disappointed, but we also understand at the end of the day it’s a business.”
Bob ❤️ Abishola received a Season 5 renewal from CBS with an order of 13 episodes with recurring actors only guaranteed to appear in five of the episodes.
Bob ❤️ Abishola is a love story about a middle-aged compression-sock businessman (Gardell) who falls for his cardiac nurse (Olowofoyeku), a Nigerian immigrant, while recovering from a heart attack.

,"How Strays cast its raunchy, four-legged stars",'Strays' producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller tease their R-rated canine comedy — and why they cast Will Forte as a dog-hating jerk.,"Strays has a star-studded voice cast that includes Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Isla Fisher, and Randall Park, but some of the movie's biggest breakouts are total unknowns. Four-legged unknowns.
Josh Greenbaum's canine comedy centers on four dogs, who embark on an R-rated adventure to seek revenge against an abusive owner (Will Forte). The motley crew of mutts include the scruffy border terrier Reggie (Ferrell), Boston terrier Bug (Foxx), Australian shepherd Maggie (Fisher), and Great Dane Hunter (Park).
Producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller tell EW that when it came time to cast the four canine actors, seemingly every member of the production had their own opinions. ""There was a lot of discussion about what breeds the dogs were and which breeds would play well off of each other,"" Miller explains. ""Everybody had their own [input] and was like, 'Well, my dog is this.'""
""Obviously, the labradoodle is the cutest,"" Lord interjects.
""Not true!"" Miller says with a laugh. ""I have a cavapoo, and she's the cutest.""
Elsa, the Australian shepherd who plays Maggie, had previous acting experience, but the other three lead dogs were total newbies. Some proved to be professionals, like Sophie, the border terrier who plays star Reggie. Meanwhile, Dalin, the enormous Great Dane who plays Hunter, was still a puppy during filming, so he would get bursts of energy and zoom around the set, knocking over equipment. (I.e. Zoomies!)
Reggie (Will Ferrell), Maggie (Isla Fisher), Hunter (Randall Park), and Bug (Jamie Foxx) in 'Strays'. Universal Studios
And of course, filming with a pack of dogs — without human dialogue — made for an unusual shooting environment. ""It's a very surreal and quiet set because there's not a lot of improv,"" Miller explains. ""It's just like: 'Let's get these cute little muffins to get to the spots where they're supposed to be.'""
The film's raunchy rating also meant that the trainers had to teach the dogs to perform decidedly R-rated tricks. (EW has an exclusive clip from the film above, where the four dogs hump lawn ornaments.) Director Greenbaum (Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar) explains that the trainers taught the dogs to hump objects on command, using the command words, ""Humpity humpity.""
""It's a movie that's very smart about being silly,"" Lord adds. ""It's written by Dan Perrault, who we've always admired from the show American Vandal. The movie really goes there, and it takes a big swing, but it's also very big-hearted and warm. You get the sense that the movie's friendly, even though it's very naughty.""
Reggie (voiced by Will Ferrell) in 'Strays'. Universal Studios
To play Reggie's abusive owner Doug, Lord and Miller also turned to a frequent human collaborator: Forte, television's Last Man on Earth. After all, the producers note with a laugh, not every actor would willingly volunteer to star as a grumpy villain who's mean to dogs.
""That's a part that's really hard to cast because the character has to be somebody who's such a jerk that you're rooting for him to get a big, disgusting comeuppance,"" Miller says. ""But he can't be so awful that you don't like watching him. The joy about Will Forte is that he's such a sweet, kind person, and you can tell that even when he's playing a jerk, he's not really a jerk.""

2023-08-23 22:22:07+00:00,Hershey’s casts a sweet spell with a new magical collaboration,"Hershey’s chocolate always brings a sweet smile to any occasion. With Harry Potter offerings and other pop culture references, people are hungry for more.","From unwrapping the foil on those classic Kisses to breaking off a rectangle on the iconic chocolate bar, Hershey’s chocolate always brings a sweet smile to any occasion. While the seasonal offerings might be part of many people’s traditions, the reality is that the food brand is always looking for ways to bring cultural moments every day.
Recently, Hershey’s unveiled several Harry Potter inspired offerings. While these candies might not bring the flavor of that Butterbeer, they feature the imagery associated with the classic characters and storylines.
With the Spellbinding Kisses Foils, 21 different foils bring the colors, quotes and iconic images from the Wizarding World to the bag. From Harry’s Birthday Cake to House colors, a cauldron full of treats awaits. Although some people might want to pick through the pile to find their house or seek a special image, the reality is that this candy offering is perfect for a themed party or the ultimate Harry Potter fan.
Thinking about this special Hershey’s offering, it could inspire some baking creativity. From giving those classic Thumbprint cookies a magical spell to even creating a secret message for that special someone, the options are many.
For those Harry Potter fans who want a little more magic with their chocolate, the limited edition Hershey’s Milk Chocolate bars feature 12 package designs with images imprinted on the candy. From brooms to eyeglasses, the candy has a message to tell. Luckily, this special treat does not require a spell to bring those images to life.
For many people, they might want to collect all the special packages. Whether people pick based a favorite scene, character, or movie, the choices reflect them all. Maybe these special chocolate bars could make back to school a little more sweet.
Hershey’s Harry Potter Wizarding World inspired offerings are available for a limited time. Check with retailers for availability and pricing.
Hershey’s and pop culture are always a sweet combination.
While the new Harry Potter offering has many people cheering, it is one of many examples of Hershey’s brands that have leveraged pop culture connection. For example, the chocolate brand has featured DC characters on its chocolate bars. During the holidays, the Grinch brings his green-hue to the Kisses.
In addition, Reese’s recently featured a connection with DC Comic’s Blue Beetle. As fans look to power up their day, similar to how Jaime Reyes takes on all the action, the special promotional giveaway had many people clamoring for that coveted, special offering box.
The pop culture connection not only engages current fans, but it can bring in new food enthusiasts. Granted, there are many people who are never sorry to eat a Reese’s Peanut Butter cup, but others might grab a package, or two, to enjoy as a special movie watching treat. Getting more eyes on a product is always a good thing.
Whether the reason to open another Hershey’s candy is the pop culture connection, the delicious flavor, or just because, there are plenty of choices waiting on the shelf.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZm9vZHNpZGVkLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4LzIzL2hlcnNoZXlzLWNhc3RzLWEtc3dlZXQtc3BlbGwtd2l0aC1hLW5ldy1tYWdpY2FsLWNvbGxhYm9yYXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,UK-Ireland box office preview: Warner Bros’ ‘Blue Beetle’ chased by Universal’s ‘Strays’,Curzon is re-releasing Lars von Trier’s ‘The Idiots’.,"Warner Bros’ superhero sci-fi Blue Beetle and Universal’s canine comedy Strays head the new titles at the UK-Ireland box office, in a post-Barbenheimer test of how the market can handle two wide studio releases.
Opening in 556 cinemas, Blue Beetle is the third feature from Puerto Rican filmmaker Angel Manuel Soto. In the film, after an alien scarab chooses a teenager to be its symbiotic host, the youngster becomes the eponymous superhero with an unpredictable suit of armour.
Xolo Mariduena leads the cast, which also includes Bruna Marquezine, Damian Alcazar, George Lopez and Adriana Barraza.
It is the 14th title in the DC Extended Universe of films based upon DC Comics characters. The franchise started strongly, with the first three films all grossing at least £30m – 2013’s Man Of Steel (£30m), 2016’s Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn Of Justice (£36.6m) and 2016’s Suicide Squad (£33.6m).
However, subsequent titles have struggled. Most recent entry The Flash topped the chart on its release in June this year, but slipped out of most cinemas within a month, with an £8.8m total. Prior to that, Shazam! Fury Of The Gods made £6m in spring this year; while Black Adam did better with £19.9m, albeit still down on the level of the first three titles.
It is a first studio outing for Soto, who previously made 2015 drama The Farm, which played at Austin Fantastic Fest and the UK’s Raindance; and 2020 dirt-bike rider drama Charm City Kings, which debuted at Sundance.
Universal is letting Strays off the leash in 492 venues. Directed by Josh Greenbaum, the 15-rated comedy follows an abandoned dog who teams up with other strays to get revenge on its former owner. Will Ferrell and Jamie Fox lead the voice cast, which also includes Isla Fisher, Randall Park, Will Forte, Josh Gad, Sofia Vergara, Greta Lee, Jamie Demetriou and Brett Gelman
US filmmaker Greenbaum made his name in documentaries, with titles including 2013’s The Short Game, 2017’s Becoming Bond and 2017 TV film Too Funny To Fail: The Life And Death Of The Dana Carvey Show. He made his fiction debut with 2021 comedy Barb And Star Go To Vista Del Mar, which debuted online during the pandemic.
Films about dogs can be a profitable territory at the box office, from 2001 spy comedy Cats & Dogs (£24.1m total box office) and 2009 romance Marley And Me (£5.4m), to 2021 family comedy Clifford The Big Red Dog (£10m) and Wes Anderson’s 2018 animation Isle Of Dogs (£6m). The majority are PG-rated to serve families; the challenge for Strays will be to win over a more adult audience.
Lie With Me, Lars
In 15 sites, Peccadillo Pictures has Olivier Peyon’s Lie With Me, which played at a succession of French festivals including Angouleme, and international events including BFI Flare: London LGBTQIA+ Film Festival. Based on Philippe Besson’s novel, the film tells the story of an author who returns to his hometown of Cognac, where he faces the memories of his first love.
Curzon is conducting a 25th anniversary re-release of Lars von Trier’s comedy The Idiots, in 14 sites across its first week. The first film made under von Trier’s Dogme 95 manifesto promoting traditional storytelling, it debuted to strong, mixed reactions at Cannes in 1998. Danish director von Trier revealed he has Parkinson’s disease last year; he made the headlines earlier this week though by posting a video advertisement for a “girlfriend and muse” to inspire his next film.
Further new titles include Park Circus’ 50th anniversary re-release of Sidney Lumet’s crime drama Serpico starring Al Pacino, in 49 cinemas across its first week; and Pranay Meshram’s Indian thriller Akelli through Reliance Entertainment.
In event cinema, Trafalgar Releasing is playing concert film Metallica: M72 World Tour Live From TX #1 in 380 cinemas on Saturday, August 19.
Warner Bros’ Barbie has crossed the £80m mark, and will look to hold top spot for a fifth successive weekend. Earlier this week it had grossed over £1m on 24 consecutive days – the joint-second longest run with Skyfall, behind the 32 days of No Time To Die. Universal’s Oppenheimer is also holding well, and will look to cross the £50m mark this weekend.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY3JlZW5kYWlseS5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1pcmVsYW5kLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtcHJldmlldy13YXJuZXItYnJvcy1ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1jaGFzZWQtYnktdW5pdmVyc2Fscy1zdHJheXMvNTE4NTAyMy5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Blue Beetle, nelle sale il nuovo film DC con Xolo Maridueña: trama, cast e curiosità","Cos'è Blue Beetle, il nuovo film DC in uscita al cinema oggi 17 agosto 2023: trama, cast completo che include Susan Sarandon, curiosità e aneddoti.","La ricetta è promettente: l'armatura invincibile di un misterioso scarabeo alieno, atmosfere anni '80 e tanta auto-ironia
Redazione
Dopo il mezzo flop di The Flash, la DC cerca di correggere il tiro con Blue Beetle. Diretto da Ángel Manuel Soto e prodotto dai DC Studios e The Safran Company, è il quattordicesimo film del DC Extended Universe e si basa sul personaggio omonimo dei fumetti DC Comics. Xolo Maridueña veste i panni di Jaime Reyes, ed è affiancato da un cast che include Adriana Barraza, Damián Alcázar, Raoul Trujillo, Susan Sarandon e George Lopez. Un film meno ambizioso dell'altro, ma forse proprio per questo più promettente. Insomma, non il best of the best, ma due ore di onesto, coinvolgente divertimento.
Blue Beetle: trama — La storia si concentra su Jaime Reyes, un giovane neo-laureato in legge che decide di tornare a Palmera City, la sua città natale, per riunirsi alla famiglia. Jaime non ha mai pensato di diventare un supereroe, neppure per sbaglio. Tuttavia, appena rientrato a casa, scopre che suo padre, Alberto, ha chiuso l'officina a causa di un infarto. Questa situazione mette a rischio la stabilità finanziaria della famiglia, fino al punto di perdere la casa in cui Jaime è cresciuto. Data la situazione, sente la responsabilità di dare un aiuto, ma mentre cerca di trovare una soluzione, Jaime fa una scoperta sorprendente: un antico scarabeo blu che conferisce a chi lo indossa straordinari poteri, grazie a un esoscheletro riconfigurante attorno al suo corpo. Inizialmente scettico, Jaime decide di sfruttare il potere dello scarabeo per proteggere la famiglia e la città dalle minacce imminenti. E così diventa involontariamente Blue Beetle e inizia una carriera da supereroe, affrontando avversari pericolosi, dimostrando coraggio e determinazione. Ma la responsabilità che deriva dai nuovi superpoteri rende difficile bilanciare la vita da supereroe con gli obblighi familiari e soprattutto il desiderio di vivere una vita normale...
Blue Beetle: cast — In Blue Beetle, Xolo Maridueña interpreta Jaime Reyes. Il ruolo di Nana, la nonna di Jaime, è affidato a Adriana Barraza. Damián Alcázar interpreta Alberto Reyes, il padre di Jaime. Conrad Carapax, noto anche come Indestructible Man, la guardia del corpo al servizio di Victoria Kord, è interpretato da Raoul Max Trujillo. Victoria Kord, interpretata da Susan Sarandon, è una donna d'affari e la sorella di Ted Kord. È determinata ad ottenere lo Scarabeo a ogni costo. Sarandon descrive Victoria come un simbolo di ""imperialismo in nome della democrazia"". Infine, Rudy Reyes, lo zio di Jaime, è interpretato da George Lopez.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhenpldHRhLml0L2F0dHVhbGl0YS8xNy0wOC0yMDIzL3gtdXNjaXRhLWNhc3QtdHJhbWEtY3VyaW9zaXRhLWRlbC1udW92by1maWxtLWRjLnNodG1s0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2F6emV0dGEuaXQvYXR0dWFsaXRhLzE3LTA4LTIwMjMveC11c2NpdGEtY2FzdC10cmFtYS1jdXJpb3NpdGEtZGVsLW51b3ZvLWZpbG0tZGNfYW1wLnNodG1s?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,'Barbie' Cast on Representation and the 'Coolest Thing About Being a Barbie' (Exclusive Clip),"In a behind-the-scenes look at 'Barbie,' director Greta Gerwig and stars Margot Robbie, Issa Rae and more discuss how the movie allows everyone to see themselves as a Barbie in Barbie Land","Greta Gerwig felt compelled to make representation an important aspect of the Barbie movie.
In a behind-the-scenes clip shared exclusively with PEOPLE, Gerwig, 39, the film's star Margot Robbie and a number of other actors who portray Barbies in the film speak to the movie's emphasis on how everyone — and anyone — can be Barbie.
“In Barbie Land, we all are Barbie. It’s fun and friendship, female 24/7,"" Robbie, 33, says in the clip.
“Something that was really important to me is that making sure everyone could see themselves as Barbie or see themselves as a Ken,"" adds Gerwig, who cowrote the movie with her partner Noah Baumbach.
A number of actors — including Hari Nef, Emma Mackey, Dua Lipa, Ana Cruz Kayne, Sharon Rooney, Kate McKinnon, Nicola Coughlan, Alexandra Shipp, Ritu Arya and Issa Rae — play different Barbies in the movie. Ryan Gosling stars as Ken, though Simu Liu, Ncuti Gatwa, Kingsley Ben-Adir and Scott Evans also portray different Kens in Barbie Land.

“We are all Barbie, and we are all everything,"" Nef says in the featurette.
“Not every Barbie is the same Barbie, and not every girl is the same girl,"" Shipp adds. ""And to see yourself really does change your perspective.”

Rae, whose Barbie serves as the president of Barbie Land, notes in the clip that her character ""passes bills all day and every day and that's why Barbie Land gets to be what it is.""
“Beautiful feminine energy ruling the world,” Ana Cruz-Kayne says of Barbie Land in the clip, while Sharon Rooney says, ""That’s the coolest thing about being a Barbie.”
“It's just really fun,” Robbie adds. “I love it so much.”

Several Barbie trailers have teased Barbie's decision to leave Barbie Land and travel to the real world along with Ken. ""To live in Barbie Land is to be a perfect being in a perfect place. Unless you have a full-on existential crisis. Or you're a Ken,"" reads an official logline for the movie.
Gerwig recently told PEOPLE in the special Barbie issue (out now) that she hopes the movie ""is the launch of a world and a bunch of different Barbie movies.""
""There’s a tone and a humor and a joy, and obviously the world is so beautiful,"" Gerwig said. ""I want to go back to Barbie Land.""
The film's cast also includes America Ferrera, Michael Cera, Ariana Greenblatt, Emerald Fennell, Will Ferrell and more.

2023-08-25 22:00:00+00:00,Every Guardians of the Galaxy Actor James Gunn Could Cast for the DCU,Rumors abound as to which Guardians of the Galaxy actors James Gunn might reacst in key roles in the new DCU.,"Filmmaker and DCU architect James Gunn is known for casting performers he works well with. The most recent example is Nathan Fillion being cast as Guy Gardner in the upcoming Superman: Legacy.
This has made fans curious which Guardians of the Galaxy actors Gunn might bring into the DCU. Here are some potential choices.
Chris Pratt as Booster Gold
Known as “The Greatest Hero You’ve Never Heard Of,” Booster Gold is one of DC Comics most divisive heroes. After a gambling scandal, disgraced athlete Michael Carter robbed a museum and traveled back in time to become a superhero. Despite being obsessed with fame and fortune, Carter’s good heart won out over his greed. He ultimately became a secret guardian of DC Comics’ timeline.
Rumors that James Gunn would cast Chris Pratt as Booster Gold began shortly after Gunn announced a DCU Booster Gold Max series. Booster has much in common with the MCU‘s Star-Lord, being a reformed thief with a hero’s heart. Booster also has a comedic side, which would play well to Pratt’s strengths as an actor.
Gunn has not confirmed the rumors, beyond a Threads post where he said “There are Reasons” Chris Pratt would not play himself in the DCU. Pratt, for his part, is agreeable to the idea of playing Booster Gold. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Pratt said he “would have to consider it,” if Gunn thought he was right for the part.
Dave Bautista as Bane
The man who “broke the Bat” has long been a dream role of Drax actor Dave Bautista. He reportedly approached Warner Bros. about playing Bane in 2021, despite being told nothing was in the works for the character. Ironically, James Gunn taking over DC Studios seems to have eliminated any possibility of Bautista taking the role.
In a January 2023 interview, Dave Bautista told GQ he had given up on his dream. “I don’t think at this point in my career that I can bring justice to Bane anymore,” Bautista admitted. He also discussed conversations with James Gunn about the DCU, and how Gunn was “starting from scratch and starting younger.” Despite this, there are still ways Dave Bautista could play Bane in some capacity.
While the DCU in general is casting younger actors, The Brave and the Bold will reportedly feature an older Batman. It might be interesting to pit this Batman against an older Bane, who is more dependent on his mind than his muscles. Dave Bautista would be ideal to play one of the comics’ older, more cerebral takes on Bane. Another possibility is Bautista voicing Bane for an animated DCU project.
Karen Gillan as Poison Ivy
Karen Gillan — who played Nebula in the MCU — is another creator with eyes on the DCU. In a 2020 interview with Omlette, Gillan spoke of wanting to play Barbara Gordon and possibly directing a Batgirl movie. This seems unlikely, however, with Warner Bros. having shelved one Batgirl movie already.
A stronger possibility is Karen Gillan playing Poison Ivy in the DCU. Gillan discussed the character with Total Film magazine, noting she “always thought that Poison Ivy was really fun.” She also expressed a desire to work with James Gunn again. describing their work together as “one of the great joys of my career so far.”
It is worth noting that Margot Robbie has also expressed a desire to work with James Gunn again, following The Suicide Squad. Robbie also told Vanity Fair that she was pushing for her next appearance as Harley Quinn to feature a Poison Ivy romance. An action comedy starring Margot Robbie and Karen Gillan as Harley and Ivy sounds like easy money for DC Studios.
The Other Guardians in the DCU
In a January 2023 interview with Empire, James Gunn named Chris Pratt, Pom Klementieff, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldaña and Karen Gillan as the actors he most wanted to work with again. “Probably at my other job,” he added laughing. There are no specific casting rumors regarding Saldaña or Klementieff, although the latter’s name was mentioned as another person for whom Gunn had plans in the DCU.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cGVyaGVyb2h5cGUuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzLzU0NTQzMC1ldmVyeS1ndWFyZGlhbnMtb2YtdGhlLWdhbGF4eS1hY3Rvci1qYW1lcy1ndW5uLWNvdWxkLWNhc3QtZm9yLXRoZS1kY3XSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdXBlcmhlcm9oeXBlLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy81NDU0MzAtZXZlcnktZ3VhcmRpYW5zLW9mLXRoZS1nYWxheHktYWN0b3ItamFtZXMtZ3Vubi1jb3VsZC1jYXN0LWZvci10aGUtZGN1L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-09-04 15:36:00+00:00,‘Equalizer 3’ Still On Track For $42M+ 4-Day Opening; Next Up ‘Nun 2’ Eyes $30M+ Debut – Box Office Update,'Equalizer 3' is the second best opening at Labor Day box office with $42M+,"Monday AM: Pretty straight forward end of the summer with Sony/Eagle Pictures/TSG/Escape Artist’s The Equalizer 3 still on track for a $42M+ four-day opening, second best ever for the holiday after Shang-Chi ($94.6M). No melodrama like last weekend when Sony was stuffing substantial advance previews into Friday and driving Warner Bros. crazy. Boy, that was fun. However, expect other studios to emulate a practice like that again, not that it was extremely novel.
Sony will have another Labor Day opening ranking record for the books next year when they finally debut their Venom-verse title, Kraven the Hunter, which was originally scheduled to debut this year during the first weekend of October.
While there will be business today for movies, it will fall off by around -30% from Sunday’s take for most movies. Sunday was pretty good with most movies seeing single digit percent spikes over Saturday or even results.
There seems to be a little fight for seventh place with MGM’s Bottoms and Warner Bros.’ The Meg 2, both claiming $3.65M.
New Line Cinema
Despite the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike, and actors unable to promote, look for this box office rally to continue into next weekend with The Nun 2 which is eyeing a $30M-plus opening. Warner Bros. typically has had a big horror film in the post Labor Day space the last being 2019’s It Chapter Two which debuted to $91M. They had James Wan’s Malignant in 2021, but the pic got lost at the box office as it was day-and-date in theaters and on HBO Max, opening to a paltry $5.4M and ending its run at $13.3M. Previews for Nun 2 start at 4PM on Thursday. 2018’s The Nun at $53.8M clocked the fourth highest domestic B.O. opening for September, but the best ever in New Line’s The Conjuring universe. The first Nun back in 2018 pulled in 49% women per CinemaScore, and the Hispanic and Latino demo posted some of the best draws in the history of The Conjuring franchise at 35% turnout versus Conjuring‘s 17%, the sequel’s 28%, Annabelle’s 22% and its sequel’s 26%.
Michael Chaves, who helmed The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It and The Curse of La Llorona, takes over the sequel from Corin Hardy, who directed the first. Tessa Farmiga returns as Sister Irene, with Storm Reid joining as a young nun, as they square off with the demon mother superior. Also back is Jonas Bloquet as Maurice, who left The Nun with a hex on his neck.

Sunday AM Writethru: Sony/Escape Artists’ The Equalizer 3 will hit $42M over four-days, easily the second-best opening of Labor Day weekend ever following 2021’s Shang-Chi, which did $94.6M. 3-day is $34.5M (or 2.6M patrons, per EntTelligence), which is the third-best domestic opening for filmmaker Antoine Fuqua after Equalizer 2 ($36M) and The Magnificent Seven ($35M), and the second-best start for the franchise. Friday was $13.1M, including Thursday previews, which is jacking up forecasts for the weekend. Equalizer 3 is cofinanced by TSG and Eagle Pictures.
As Comscore predicted, the summer box office has clicked past $4 billion — a normal threshold in any summer, but the first post-pandemic. Thank you, Barbenheimer. Read our summer wrap here.
The other thing to applaud with this threequel is that, quite often, these guy-with-a-gun-movies become diluted at the box office. Read: Gerard Butler and Liam Neeson fare, with distributors getting by on low P&As and acquisition costs. Sony and Escape Artists have finely developed this Denzel Washington series with great care, and kept the powder dry, and the ticket sales are showing that. The series is Washington’s only film franchise on his resume. It’s not about shoot ’em ups in an Equalizer movie — rather, the intensity of the character Robert McCall, who the 2x Oscar-winner adores playing.
In regards to getting the pic’s opening B.O. to this level sans actors’ promotions during the SAG-AFTRA strike, that’s a glass half-full situation. On one hand, it’s an excellent start, with the threequel opening right in the wheelhouse of other Equalizer films on a 3-day basis. We always knew sequels and genre titles would be able to open at the box office during a SAG-AFTRA strike. But on the other hand, one wonders how much bigger the box office would be here for Equalizer 3 if there wasn’t a strike.
The threequel gets its second “A” after Equalizer 2 (first movie got an A-) with Comscore/Screen Engine PostTrak exits seeing a 90% positive and a 72% recommend. Mostly guys showed up at 55%, which is no surprise, while the 18-34 year olds repped 31%. However, older moviegoers are definitely out of the house, watching this movie with 49% over 45, and the largest demo being 55+ at 26%. Diversity demos were 33% Caucasian, 31% Black, 20% Latino and Hispanic, and 15% Asian/other. PLF and Imax are pulling in 38% of the weekend ticket sales so far, shelling out an average of $16.37 to see the Fuqua pic vs. $13.28, which was the average ticket price for all formats on the title. 54% of the audience came to see the movie after 5 PM, per EntTelligence.
As of EOD Saturday, the AMC Southlake Pavillion in Atlanta is Equalizer 3‘s top-grossing venue, with north of $76K.
Imaxes were apparently split between Equalizer 3 and Oppenheimer. The Washington movie did a 4-day opening of $3.4M at 360 Imax auditoriums, while Oppeneheimer made $900K, for a running total of $85.5M for that film.
Bottoms: L-R Ayo Edebiri, Rachel Sennott, Zamani Wilder, Summer Joy Campbell, Havana Rose Liu, Kaia Gerber, Virginia Tucker United Artists Releasing / Courtesy Everett Collection
MGM’s expansion of Bottoms from ten locations to 715 theaters should not be ignored. The teen LGBTQ+ high school comedy posted a $3M 3-day and $3.58M 4-day. Great numbers in NYC, LA, San Francisco, DC, Chicago, Austin, and Dallas. Look out for this one.
Audience exits for the pic outside NYC and LA continue to be above norms, at 91% positive and 86% recommend, with a big young audience here; 80% are between 18-34. 55% are female, 42% male, and 3% non-binary. Diversity demos are 67% White, 29% Latino and Hispanic, 2% Black, and 2% Asian/other.
Social buzz is big at 106K convos, the most volume for a theatrical comedy since 2020, trailing only the social phenomenon that is Barbie. Female (58%) moviegoers lead buzz, LGBTQ+, GEN Z, African American, AAPI, Hispanic. College audiences comprise this younger-skewing and diverse coalition of moviegoers.
Newcomer Kushi (in Telugu) is showing strong numbers in Austin, Dallas, DC, Seattle, NYC, San Francisco, and Atlanta, for an estimated $1.28M 4-day weekend at 336 locations in 109 markets. Friday was $363K and yesterday was $352K. 3-day is bound for $1.04M.
The 4-day box office for all movies looks to land around $115.9M, which is up 63% over last year’s Labor Day weekend of $71.1M per Box Office Mojo, when there wasn’t any product. However, this year’s holiday B.O. is off -17% from 2021, when Shang-Chi began bringing moviegoers back, all pics then grossing $139M.

The Australian horror pic becomes the highest grossing genre pic stateside for A24, besting Hereditary‘s $44M. Overall, it’s A24’s fourth highest grossing movie at the domestic B.O. after Everything Everywhere All at Once ($77M), Uncut Gems ($50M) and Lady Bird ($49M).
Friday afternoon: Sony/Escape Artists’ The Equalizer 3 is doing what it’s supposed to be doing this weekend with an eye at $11.5M today, for a low-$30Ms 3-day and high-$30Ms 4-day.
The pic, which cost a reported $70M with co-financing for TSG and Eagle Pictures, is booked at 3,965 theaters.
Warner Bros would be delighted to know that Sony including is recently found ticket money from the pandemic romantic comedy The Broken Hearts Gallery in Equalizer 3‘s first Friday, but that is absolutely not the case. The Denzel Washington threequel’s first Friday only includes $3.8M from Thursday early shows last night. That’s just slightly more than what the extensive advance sneaks (less Thursday) did for Gran Turismo, which won’t be in second place for the Culver City lot but rather fourth with a second weekend take of $6.5M, -63%, and four-day of $8M. That gets the Neill Blomkamp-directed take on the Sony PlayStation movie to $30.2M by Monday.
Like several pics as of late, there’s been no publicity from Equalizer 3 actors due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, so the fact that it can open in the neighborhood of the previous movie is testament to Sony’s marketing. The last time Antoine Fuqua, Washington and Dakota Fanning were together was at CinemaCon back in April. Producers Todd Black, Jason Blumenthal and Fuqua have been talking up the movie to press as of late.
More testament to Sony marketing: RelishMix says that Equalizer 3’s social media universe at 233.7M across Facebook, X, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok is 9% higher than other action-thriller norms with trailer reposting rate at a high 38:1. “Current stats are over 2x from the 2018 installment,” RelishMix said. “Overall intensity is good by comparison but softened by the absence of cast in the promo cycle and on social.”
RelishMix adds, “Convo on Equalizer 3 runs predominantly positive as the gravitational pull of Denzel Washington is keeping a large faction of die-hard fans enthralled as audiences express their adoration and his partnership with Dakota Fanning — comping and challenging John Wick vs The Equalizer.”
Warner Bros. Barbie is taking second place with $9.1M in weekend 7, -40%, over three days and $12M over four days for a running total of $610.8M at 3,586 locations.
Blue Beetle at 3,316 locations in Weekend 3 is eyeing $6.4M, -47%, over three days and $8.3M over four for a running total of $57.6M.
Universal’s Oppenheimer is booked at 2,537 theaters for what’s a seventh weekend of $4.9M in 5th place, -40%, four-day $6.4M and a running total of $309.4M.
Friday AM Update: Antoine Fuqua’s The Equalizer 3 will not let this summer go out quietly in what’s expected to be a $30M-$40M 4-day opening weekend; poised to be the second-best ever for the holiday after Shang-Chi ($94.6M). Last night from showtimes that began at 3PM, the Sony threequel clocked $3.8M at 3,241 locations.
While 76% with critics on Rotten Tomatoes, Equalizer 3 is 92% with audiences currently. Sony has extra bullets at the box office with Imax and PLFs this weekend for Equalizer 3.
Last night’s previews best those of Equalizer 2 which took in $3.1M at 2,934 theaters from Thursday showtimes that began at 4PM. That repped 23% of the pic’s $13.3M Friday in what was a No. 1 $36M over the July 20-22, 2018 frame, besting Universal’s opening for Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again which made $34.9M.
The first Equalizer, released on Sept. 26, 2014, did $1.45M in previews, a $12.4M Friday and a $34.1M opening. That movie ended its stateside run at $101.5M, while Equalizer 2 did $102M. The Equalizer franchise from Escape Artists has minted $382.7M worldwide.
Equalizer 2‘s opening repped Denzel Washington’s third biggest start at the domestic B.O. after American Gangster ($44M) and Safe House ($40M).
Sony’s Gran Turismo wins the week with $22.1M, again boosted by nine days of advance preview figures. The pic at 3,856 theaters made $772K yesterday, -29% from Wednesday.
Warner Bros.’ Barbie won Thursday with $1.3M at 3,736, -13% from Wednesday, for a sixth week of $21.1M and a running total of $598.8M. The pic will click past $600M today in its 43rd day of release.
Universal’s Oppenheimer at 2,872 posted a sixth Thursday of $824K, -14%, for a running total of $303M. Pic’s sixth week is $12M.
Warner Bros/DC’s Blue Beetle booked at 3,871 theaters took in a second Thursday of $685K in fourth place for the day, -13% from Wednesday, for a $15.7M second week, and running total of $49.3M, which is 1% ahead of Shazam: Fury of the Gods at the same point in time.
Paramount’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem at 3,145 theaters saw a fourth Thursday of $501K, -19%, a $9.6M week, and running total of $101.7M.

2023-08-18 11:00:00+00:00,What's happening in the DC Universe? All the DCU movies and TV shows coming up,"The new DC Universe will start in 2025, so here's all you need to know about the new DCU movies and TV shows and their release dates.","A new DC Universe is nearly upon us once the releases of Blue Beetle and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom are out of the way this year.
Forget about Zack Snyder's grim superhero tales: DC Studios' co-CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran are bringing their own projects across film, television, live action, animation and gaming, interconnected in the same way as the MCU.
With almost a decade's worth of content planned, the DCU will kick off with 'Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters', a new era focusing on different interpretations of established DC superheroes such as Superman, Batman and Supergirl, as well as other characters like Swamp Thing.
While Gunn considers Blue Beetle the ""first DCU character"", the character's solo movie — now out in cinemas — isn't considered the first DCU film. (We know it's confusing, but just roll with it.)
Hopper Stone/SMPSP // Warner Bros.
Even less is clear when it comes to Jason Momoa's Aquaman and his fellow DC stars, including Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman.
The new universe is expected to be a reset, but perhaps some characters might return. We do know that Aquaman 2 is (probably) not considered part of the new universe, canonically.
From now on, Gunn and Safran want to ensure that ""characters are consistent, played by the same actors, and it works in one story"". This does apparently include DC's 2023 releases — although The Flash didn't exactly ""reset"" the universe as Gunn claimed it would.
So, right now, it's probably cleaner if we focus on the new slate of projects that Gunn and Safran announced in January 2023, and we can worry about how (or if) everything else fits in later.
DC Universe release dates: All upcoming DCU movies and TV shows
MediaPunch/Bauer-Griffin // Getty Images
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is set for release this Christmas, but as mentioned above, we're going to focus on all the upcoming projects that are definitely part of the DC Universe and its Elseworlds universe (more on that in a bit).
Below are all DC movies coming up in the next few years. As ever, release dates are subject to change.
October 4, 2024 - Joker: Folie à Deux
July 11, 2025 - Superman: Legacy
October 3, 2025 - The Batman Part II
TBA - The Brave and the Bold
TBA - Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow
TBA - The Authority
TBA - Swamp Thing
There are also some TV shows in development that will be part of DCU's timeline — and they could well arrive before Superman: Legacy officially kicks off the main DCU timeline in July 2025. No release dates as of August 2023, but here are the titles:
TBA - Creature Commandos
TBA - Waller
TBA - Paradise Lost
TBA - Lanterns
DC Universe movies: Which DCU movies are coming up?
Superman: Legacy
Release date: July 11, 2025
Director: James Gunn
Cast: David Corenswet, Rachel Brosnahan
Superman will be back in what Gunn considers the ""first full DCU movie"".

As announced on June 28, 2023, David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan will lead Superman: Legacy as Clark Kent/Superman and Lois Lane, respectively.

Gunn also revealed the movie won't be an origin story. Instead, it will feature a younger Clark Kent dealing with his past and Kryptonian heritage while working at the Daily Planet.

The Brave and the Bold

Release date: TBA

Director: Andy Muschietti

Cast: TBA

Another Batman movie is in the works at DC, parallel to Matt Reeves' sequel of The Batman. Gunn has announced The Brave and the Bold will focus on the Batman & Son storyline, which explores the relationship between Bruce Wayne and his 10-year-old son with Talia al Ghul, Damian Wayne. Father and son together will fight crime in Gotham.

Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow

Release date: TBA

Director: TBA

Cast: TBA

We don't know if The Flash's Sasha Calle will reprise her role as Supergirl, but the character's solo movie is definitely in the works. Based on Tom King and Bilquis Evely's comic of the same name, the story follows Kara Zor-El in a revenge-driven quest across space to find the villains responsible for her world's destruction.

DC Comics

The Authority

Release date: TBA

Director: TBA

Cast: TBA

Based on the comic The Authority by Warren Ellis, The Authority will bring DC's favourite antiheroes to the big screen. The movie will likely focus on the origin story of this team, a group of powerful heroes whose idea of justice differs from the Justice League's.

The original comics featured characters like Jenny Sparks, Jack Hawksmoor, Midnighter, Apollo and The Engineer, but there's still no confirmation about who will appear in the movie.

Swamp Thing

Release date: TBA

Director: TBA

Cast: TBA

The TV series was short-lived, but fans are hoping the next Swamp Thing nails the beloved comics character. Although not many details are known so far, we do know the movie will explore the dark origins of Alec Holland's monstrous alter ego.

Indiana Jones 5's director, James Mangold, is writing the script and might be confirmed as the director.



DC Universe TV shows: Which DCU TV shows are coming up?

Warner Bros.

DC superheroes have a long history on TV — from popular stand-alone stories like Doom Patrol to CW's ambitious Arrowverse franchise, spanning more than a decade with six live-action shows and two animated series.

However, the first time DC movies and TV shows officially crossed paths was fairly recently, with HBO Max's Peacemaker, James Gunn's spin-off show released after The Suicide Squad.

Now, with Gunn and Peter Safran leading DC's content strategy, there are new TV projects to be excited about.

These are the first five TV series announced as part of DCU's 'Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters'.

Creature Commandos

Release date: TBA

Cast: Frank Grillo, Maria Bakalova, Indira Varma, David Harbour

Two characters from James Gunn's The Suicide Squad, Frankenstein's monster and Weasel, will appear in DCU's first TV series, composed of seven episodes. Gunn is working on the script, which will focus on a motley crew of military superhumans.

It's been announced as an animated show, but Gunn explained that ""animation will lead into live action and back into animation"".

Waller

Release date: TBA

Cast: Viola Davis

Suicide Squad's most recurring character, Amanda Waller, will have her own show, with Viola Davis returning once more to play the role.

As a spin-off to Peacemaker, the show will bring back other supporting characters known to the fans, though there are still no details about the cast or the plot.

DC Studios announced that Christal Henry (Watchmen) and Jeremy Carver (Doom Patrol) will lead this project.

Booster Gold

Release date: TBA

Cast: TBA

During DC's January presentation, Safran described Booster Gold's main character as ""a loser from the future who uses his basic future technology to come back to today to pretend to be a superhero"". Sounds like fun.

Based on the comic of the same name from the '80s, the HBO series is like ""the story of a superhero's impostor syndrome"", according to Gunn.

Paradise Lost

Release date: TBA

Cast: TBA

Although Wonder Woman 3 doesn't seem to be on Gunn and Safran's plans, we will be able to explore the character's original homeland in Paradise Lost. The story is set in Themyscira before Diana Prince was born, showing how this fearless society of female-only warriors was created. The show has been compared to Game of Thrones.

Warner Bros.

Lanterns

Release date: TBA

Cast: TBA

Green Lantern's John Stewart and Hal Jordan will be at the centre of this new TV show, officially titled Lanterns. Not many details are available about it at the moment, but Safran has described it as a mystery-thriller similar to True Detective.

DC Elseworlds explained: Is Joker 2 part of the DCU?

Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin // Getty Images

According to Gunn and Safran, some projects won't feed into the main narrative, but they'll still be allowed to exist under the DC movie franchise brand.

For that purpose, DC has created a new movie branch: DC Elseworlds.

DC comic fans will find that word familiar since it's also the name of the publication imprint used for alternate-reality comics that take place outside the canon.



Here are the upcoming movies confirmed to be part of DC Elseworlds, alongside past releases like The Batman and Joker.

Joker 2: Folie à Deux

Release date: October 4, 2024

Director: Todd Phillips

Cast: Joaquin Phoenix, Lady Gaga, Brendan Gleeson, Zazie Beetz

Like its predecessor, Joker: Folie à Deux won't be part of the main DC timeline. But it will bring back Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck, aka Joker — and this time, he's paired with the exciting prospect of Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn.

The Batman II

Release date: October 3, 2025

Director: Matt Reeves

Cast: Robert Pattinson

Even after the change of leadership, it seems Matt Reeves is still writing a sequel to The Batman, which will bring back Robert Pattinson's Batman.

Consistent with DC's announced plans, Gunn denied reports that Pattinson's version would be integrated into the main timeline. Instead, it exists in DC Elseworlds branch.

UK comic actor Peter Serafinowicz will play Reginald Smith in Dawn of the Nugget, while Miranda Richardson is reprising her role as archvillain Mrs Tweedy.

From multi-Academy and BAFTA-winning Aardman, Dawn of the Nugget comes more than 20 years after its hugely-popular predecessor. A trailer today gives more of a flavor of what viewers can expect when it launches on December 15. The movie follows Ginger, who, having pulled off a death-defying escape from Tweedy’s farm, has finally found her dream – a peaceful island sanctuary for the whole flock, far from the dangers of the human world. When she and Rocky hatch a little girl called Molly, Ginger’s happy ending seems complete, but back on the mainland the whole of chicken-kind faces a new and terrible threat.

Aardman/NETFLIX © 2023

Dawn of the Nugget features huge stars including Thandiwe Newton (Ginger), Zachary Levi (Rocky), Bella Ramsey (Molly) and Imelda Staunton (Bunty), along with Lynn Ferguson (Mac), David Bradley (Fowler), Jane Horrocks (Babs), Romesh Ranganathan (Nick), Daniel Mays (Fetcher), Josie Sedgwick-Davies (Frizzle), Serafinowicz (Reginald Smith), Nick Mohammed (Dr Fry) and Richardson (Mrs Tweedy).

Staunton, Ferguson and Horrocks are all reprising roles alongside Richardson. The voice of Ginger has been recast to Newton, which Julia Sawalha, who played the character in Chicken Run, has previously said she was “devastated and furious” about.

Sam Fell is director, Steve Pegram and Leyla Hobart are producers and screenplay is by Karey Kirkpatrick, John O’Farrell and Rachel Tunnard. EPs are Peter Lord, Nick Park, Carla Shelley, Fell, Paul Kewley and Kirkpatrick.

Dawn of the Nugget will debut at next month’s London Film Festival.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA5L25ldGZsaXgtY2hpY2tlbi1ydW4tZGF3bi1vZi10aGUtbnVnZ2V0LWNhc3QtdHJhaWxlci1wZXRlci1zZXJhZmlub3dpY3otbWlyYW5kYS1yaWNoYXJkc29uLTEyMzU1MzY0NDQv0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDkvbmV0ZmxpeC1jaGlja2VuLXJ1bi1kYXduLW9mLXRoZS1udWdnZXQtY2FzdC10cmFpbGVyLXBldGVyLXNlcmFmaW5vd2ljei1taXJhbmRhLXJpY2hhcmRzb24tMTIzNTUzNjQ0NC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

(L to R) Emily Rudd as Nami, Taz Skylar as Vinsmoke Sanj, Jacob Gibson as Usopp, Inaki Godoy as Monkey D. Luffy, and Mackenyu Arata as Roronoa Zoro in Season 1 of One Piece

We’re seeing and hearing from the cast in Netflix’s buzzy live-action series One Piece, based on Eiichiro Oda’s best-selling manga series in history.

Netflix has dropped photos of the series stars including Iñaki Godoy as Monkey D. Luffy, Mackenyu as Roronoa Zoro, Emily Rudd as Nami, Jacob Romero as Usopp, and Taz Skylar as Sanji, along with quotes as told to Tudum.com about their characters.

One Piece has started off strong. The series adaptation soared to the top of Netflix’s English-language TV charts during its premiere week with 18.5M views from August 28 to September 3. The live-action adaptation of Eiichiro Oda’s manga is in the Top 10 in 93 countries and No. 1 in 46 of them, according to Netflix.

In One Piece, Luffy sets off from his small village on a perilous journey to find the legendary fabled treasure, One Piece, to become King of the Pirates! But in order to find the ultimate prize, Luffy will need to assemble the crew he’s always wanted before finding a ship to sail, searching every inch of the vast blue seas, outpacing the Marines, and outwitting dangerous rivals at every turn.

One Piece is created in partnership with Shueisha and produced by Tomorrow Studios and Netflix. Matt Owens and Steven Maeda are writers, executive producers, and showrunners. Eiichiro Oda, Marty Adelstein, and Becky Clements also executive produce. Additional cast includes Vincent Regan (Vice Admiral Garp), Ilia Isorelýs Paulino (Alvida), Morgan Davies (Koby), Aidan Scott (Helmeppo), Langley Kirkwood (Captain Morgan), Jeff Ward (Buggy), Celeste Loots (Kaya), Alexander Maniatis (Klahadore), McKinley Belcher III (Arlong), Craig Fairbrass (Chef Zeff), Steven Ward (Mihawk), Chioma Umeala (Nojiko), and Michael Dorman (Gold Roger).

See the photos and quotes below:

“Why do you love playing Luffy? Luffy has to be one of the most interesting characters that I’ve ever had the opportunity to play. He’s so cheerful, loves adventure, and he’s a little bit crazy. And oh my gosh, the eating scenes! Don’t get me started on that. That’s so much fun. He’s a big dreamer and I find a lot of Luffy in me too. I think we both share a lot of the same values and it’s been such a ride to play him.” Brad Ogbonna/Netflix

“Why do you love playing Zoro? I have filmed so many anime adaptations in Japan and always feel the pressure when doing live-action manga. But, I want to do my best to please the fans and those who will first experience ONE PIECE as live-action. I grew up with ONE PIECE and I didn’t need to do much research because Zoro has always been my favorite character.” Brad Ogbonna/Netflix

“How has anime influenced you today? I grew up on Dragon Ball Z, Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh!. I saw Spirited Away in theaters when it came out here in the States. All of the anime stuff made me into who I am, 100%. Sailor Moon? I made my parents rent the Sailor Moon movie all the time and they were so sick of it, but I was like “Oh my gosh, women are so cool and so powerful and they can do anything.” Brad Ogbonna/Netflix

“Why do you love playing Usopp? I think he’s the realest. You know, when everyone else is like, “Let’s run into a burning building,” Usopp is like, “Okay, but it’s on fire, you know?” [Laughs.] So he’s, like, the voice of reason sometimes, and uses his storytelling to lift everybody up. I think that’s his medicine.” Brad Ogbonna/Netflix",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDkvb25lLXBpZWNlLWNhc3QtcGhvdG9zLWx1ZmZ5LXN0cmF3LWhhdHMtbmV0ZmxpeC1tYW5nYS0xMjM1NTM5NjQyL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDkvb25lLXBpZWNlLWNhc3QtcGhvdG9zLWx1ZmZ5LXN0cmF3LWhhdHMtbmV0ZmxpeC1tYW5nYS0xMjM1NTM5NjQyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-24 15:51:00+00:00,‘Superman: Legacy’ Director James Gunn Addresses Cast Size Fears,"Superman: Legacy is set to take place in a DC Universe filled with other heroes, and James Gunn assures fans that the film won’t be negatively impacted.","Superman: Legacy is set to take place in a DC Universe already filled to the brim with other heroes. The film’s director James Gunn has finally addressed the worry that there may be too many characters.

Superman films are usually an isolated affair, with no other heroes appearing alongside the Man of Steel outside of crossover films. James Gunn appears to be taking the opposite approach for Superman: Legacy to kick off his new DC Universe, casting multiple established heroes such as Green Lantern and Metamorpho. Many fans have wondered if this may lead to the film being overstuffed, a fear Gunn can’t seem to understand:

Despite being the film to rocket Judd Apatow into being the king of early 2000s rom-coms, The 40-Year-Old Virgin had a packed cast with everyone from Steve Carell to Kevin Hart. Despite this, Carell never strayed from the spotlight. Given James Gunn has experience grappling with much larger casts with Guardians of the Galaxy, fans should rest assured that Superman: Legacy will be an amazing start to the DC Universe.

Superman’s DC Universe Future

Superman: Legacy is a much-anticipated project, given that Clark Kent has been an integral part of the DC Universe for over 80 years, with various iterations and adaptations across different media. The movie promises to explore the character’s origins and his struggles to balance his dual identities as Clark Kent and Superman while fighting off villains and saving the world.

James Gunn and Peter Safran told journalists that their vision for the DC Universe includes locked scripts, wiggle room, and a unified storyline across film, television, animation, and video game projects. The two explained that the DC Universe could bring back elements from previous DC regimes, meaning that their eight-to-year plan is not a full reboot.

The trailer was unveiled yesterday (August 16), and comes just a few months ahead of the series’ release, which has now been confirmed for November 17 exclusively via the streaming platform.

While the trailer doesn’t give much of the show’s plot away, it features scenes identical to Edgar Wright‘s 2010 live-action film, titled Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. That film starred Michael Cera in the titular role, with supporting performances from Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona Flowers. Mark Webber will return as Stephen Stills, alongside Alison Pill as Kim Pine, and Johnny Simmons as Young Neil.

2023-08-27 00:00:44+00:00,"Margot Robbie Auditioned For ‘AHS: Asylum,’ According To Casting Director: “She Was Out Of Our Realm Of Possibility Of Hiring”",Margot Robbie could've starred in American Horror Story: Asylum as she auditioned for a role in the horror anthology series.,"Margot Robbie could’ve starred in American Horror Story: Asylum as she auditioned for a role in the horror anthology series.

Casting director Eric Dawson opened up about seeing Robbie in action during a test for the second season of the FX series back in 2012.

“Margot has a lot of ‘it’ factors. That’s the tough thing for casting directors who aren’t in the room [anymore] with actors,” Dawson said in an interview with In the Envelope: The Actor’s Podcast.

Dawson continued, “Margot is probably one of my favorite auditions of all time, and it was right before she broke out. She was such a star. It was crazy, her star appeal when she walked in the room.”

AHS: Asylum aired for 13 episodes in 2012 and although Robbie didn’t get the part in the series, she would go on to star in Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street.

“Even though she didn’t get that role, that was one of those things as a casting director where you go: This is a star, what do we do with her? Immediately, though, she was out of our realm of possibility of hiring. But that’s really the fun part of casting, is seeing the people whose careers are just rising,” Dawson added.

AHS: Asylum took place in 1964 and followed the stories of the staff and inmates who occupy the fictional mental institution Briarcliff Manor intercutting events from the past and present. The Ryan Murphy series starred Zachary Quinto, Joseph Fiennes, Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Lily Rabe, Lizzie Brocheré, James Cromwell and Jessica Lange.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvbWFyZ290LXJvYmJpZS1hdWRpdGlvbmVkLWFocy1hc3lsdW0tMTIzNTUyOTAxNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-22 15:21:49-04:00,Josh Trujillo on ‘Blue Beetle: Graduation Day’ and his personal connection to Jaime Reyes,"Josh Trujillo talks about 'Blue Beetle,' writing superheroes, and more.","Jaime Reyes, aka Blue Beetle, is one of my favorite DC characters. So it wasn’t a surprise that one of the first-ever reviews I did for this site was the premiere issue of Blue Beetle: Graduation Day. Written by Josh Trujillo & illustrated by Adrian Gutierrez, the series more than lived up to its premise as it featured Jaime graduating from school while also struggling to figure out what to do with his life – on top of the return of the alien conquerors known as the Reach.

Typical teenage superhero problems. At the DC Booth this morning, I spoke with Trujillo about the inception of the book, as well as how he related to Jaime and the surprising DC character he’d love to write.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

AIPT: What drew you to Blue Beetle as a character?

Josh Trujillo: I was around Jaime’s age when the character debuted, and we both had a lot of similarities. We’re Mexican-American, we’re teenagers, our mothers worked in health care & we were both kind of curious kids about the DC Universe. So I’ve always been kind of drawn to him. And even his Blue Beetle series…the first one, it’s the first comic I ever had from like issue one to the last issue. So it was my entry point into like monthly DC comics, and I haven’t left since.

AIPT: The book comes in two editions – English and Spanish. Was that always part of your initial pitch?

JT: Yeah. You know that a big thing I wanted to do was to include some Spanish language dialogue in the English edition because it felt more authentic to Jaime’s life, Jaime’s story, and the environment he grew up in. DC didn’t bat an eye…they were like “That’s a great idea! Let’s publish an entire Spanish version as well!” I’m really excited to get this book into the hands of people who might not read a superhero comic.

This book introduces a lot of new characters; what’s the fun of introducing new characters to the vast tapestry of the DC Universe?

JT: It’s a big thrill honestly to get to create characters that other writers and artists might pick up later. It’s like, I just want to fill out Jaime’s cast with new characters, new villains, new allies, and just kind of make it feel a little fresh.

AIPT: What stuck out to me when I reviewed Blue Beetle: Graduation Day #1 was the conversation between Jaime and Superman about how Jaime is taking on too much. What’s it like writing a superhero who has to actively step back from superhero’ing?

JT: It’s a little tough, right? We want our heroes to succeed and be awesome all the time, but Jaime is at a kind of a crossroads in his life. And I thought Superman would be a great character to have that conversation with. They have a lot of similarities. Jaime is more of a Batman fan but doesn’t realize that he is Superman in a lot of ways. I just love seeing those characters bounce off of each other.

AIPT: Who other than Jaime is your favorite character to write?

JT: She isn’t in the book that much, but I love Jaime’s little sister Milagro. And beyond that, we introduce Ted Kord’s sister Victoria Kord. She’s new to the comics universe, she’s been a lot of fun to write. She’s got some schemes going on.

AIPT: Is there any other DC character other than Blue Beetle that you can see yourself writing?

JT: I say this a lot…his name is Bunker, he was a Teen Titan. Big fan of Bunker, and hopefully, I’ll get a chance to tackle him sooner rather than later.�

Blue Beetle: Graduation Day is available wherever comics are sold.

The newest rumor suggests that Daniel Radcliffe will appear in the film in a secret role.

This newest rumor comes from reliable insider Daniel Richtman, who states that the Harry Potter actor has been cast in a “secret role” in Deadpool 3. While Richtman didn’t specify Daniel Radcliffe’s Marvel role, it’s likely he would play a variant of Wolverine, as he was a popular fancast to take over the role before it was announced that Hugh Jackman would return.

Daniel Radcliffe is far from the only actor to be rumored for Deadpool 3. Everyone from Liev Schreiber’s Sabretooth, to Channing Tatum’s Gambit, and even Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man have all been said to make cameos in the film. While only a few cameos like Jennifer Garner’s Elektra are confirmed to appear, it’s certain Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds are set to deliver a film for the ages.

Who else is attached to the Deadpool threequel?

Shawn Levy is directing Deadpool 3 after working with Ryan Reynolds on Free Guy and The Adam Project. The upcoming Marvel Studios project also marks a reunion between Levy and Hugh Jackman as the two worked together on Real Steel.

Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick are developing the Deadpool 3 script after penning the first two installments in the series. The Molyneux sisters worked on a previous draft of the project.

Batman vs. Superman drew inspiration from the comic run of The Dark Knight Returns and Death of Superman where Batman and Superman battle each other over a conflict of ideas in the former comic title and Superman dies in the latter one. If we look at all the DC movies in order, this movie takes place eighteen months after the events of Man of Steel, and Bruce Wayne, or Batman is not in favor of being a superhero as powerful as Superman roaming free across the world.

One of the few characters in DC who wield the power of magic is Shazam.

In the comics, when Billy says the word and turns into an adult superhero, he takes up the appearance of his late father. This is because the spell that turns Billy into a superhero, gives him the form of the person he adores the most.

11. The Suicide Squad (2021)

A loosely tied sequel to the earlier Suicide Squad, this version of the franchise is a new take on Task Force X and is directed by James Gunn. This DC movie does include certain characters that were previously seen in the franchise like Amanda Waller, Captain Boomerang, and Harley Quinn but the general storyline revolves mostly around Bloodsport and Peacemaker.

Even though the movie is largely disconnected from the ongoing storyline of the DCU it does contain a major easter egg in the form of the main villain of the movie, Starro the Conqueror. He is an intergalactic mind-controlling alien who was the first ever villain the Justice League fought in the original comic-book series.

12. Black Adam (2022)

Black Adam was meant to introduce a brand new set of superheroes into the DCU but sadly, was unable to perform that well and also received a lot of negative reviews all over the world. Also, the fact that now James Gunn has taken over the direction of the upcoming DCU, it is highly unlikely that we will get to see Dwyane Johnson as Black Adam again. Now, if we talk about where Black Adam fits in if we put DC movies in order of their timeline, the events of Black Adam take place after Justice League and Suicide Squad.

13. The Flash (2023)

The Flash is the last project of DC under the banner of DC Extended Universe which follows Barry Allen, who while using his superspeed, discovers that he can travel back in time by tapping into the speed force. Barry uses his powers to go back in time and save his mom from dying but because of this small change in the series of events, everything changes in the world and now it’s up to Barry to fix the timeline.

In this movie we see Ezra Miller returning for his role as the Flash, even after the controversies surrounding him. We also witness a historical moment where Michael Keaton reprises his role of Batman and Sasha Callie takes up the role of Super Girl.

Kickstarting the brand new DCU under James Gunn’s wing, Blue Beetle is going to be the first superhero of DCU. Blue Beetle revolves around a freshly graduated young boy named Jaime Reyes who stumbles upon an ancient symbiotic bioweapon called the Scarab. The Scarab, chooses Jaime as its host and binds itself to his nervous system granting him an indestructible suit of armor and powers beyond compare. This movie explores themes that are new to DC movies like light heartedness, family, and humor.

A new photoshoot from the cast recreates one of the most iconic covers from the series.,"Netflix’s live-action One Piece adaptation hits the streamer in just a few days. A new photoshoot from the cast recreates one of the most iconic covers from the series.

Netflix is taking a gamble with One Piece. Adapting one of the most iconic manga of all time after a less-than-stellar track record seems like nothing but trouble. However, it seems as though the streamer may have finally gotten one right, with a new photoshoot from the cast showcasing them recreating one of the most iconic covers from One Piece‘s early days in the form of Volume 11: The Meanest Man In The East.

It seems as though, unlike other live-action Netflix adaptations, One Piece is absolutely dripping with passion from everyone involved. Even series creator Eiichiro Oda is involved with the project and seems positive about its potential. Though with only a few days left until release, time will only tell if the project sinks or swims.

What is One Piece about?

The manga series follows Monkey D. Luffy as he leads his crew of pirates in a search of the world’s ultimate treasure known as the “One Piece” to become the next Pirate King. Their journey brings them to all kinds of exotic islands and oceans across the Grand Line.

The One Piece manga led to a multimedia franchise that includes a festival film produced by Japan’s Production I.G and an anime series from Toei Animation. To date, over 490 million copies of the One Piece manga have been published worldwide.

2023-08-16 15:32:00+00:00,James Gunn Breaks Silence The Craziest ‘Superman: Legacy’ Casting Rumor Yet,"Rumors have been aplenty on who James Gunn will play Lex Luthor in Superman: Legacy, but could the answer be in beloved adult film actor Johnny Sins?","Rumors have been aplenty on who James Gunn will cast as Lex Luthor in Superman: Legacy. However, could the perfect DC Universe casting be found in beloved adult film actor Johnny Sins?

Fans have been joking about Johnny Sins as Lex Luthor ever since Henry Cavill was cast for Man of Steel. With the DC Universe on the lookout for a new actor for the role in Superman: Legacy, jokes have once more flared about his casting, so much so that James Gunn took to Twitter to confirm he hasn’t been cast in the role.

Oh my God, you can't possibly believe that. — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) August 15, 2023

Johnny Sins is an incredibly versatile actor, having played everything from a plumber to a doctor to a karate master, making him a perfect fit for such a dangerous villain in the DC Universe. Though given the adult film star is one of the most prolific in the industry, it’s not likely he’d take the pay cut to play Lex Luthor in Superman: Legacy, which is certainly why James Gunn didn’t cast him.

Superman’s DC Universe Future

Superman: Legacy is a much-anticipated project, given that Clark Kent has been an integral part of the DC Universe for over 80 years, with various iterations and adaptations across different media. The movie promises to explore the character’s origins and his struggles to balance his dual identities as Clark Kent and Superman while fighting off villains and saving the world.

James Gunn and Peter Safran told journalists that their vision for the DC Universe includes locked scripts, wiggle room and a unified storyline across film, television, animation and video game projects. The two explained that the DC Universe could bring back elements from previous DC regimes, meaning that their eight-to-year plan is not a full reboot.

2023-09-09 20:57:37+00:00,"‘His Three Daughters’ Review: Carrie Coon, Elizabeth Olsen And Natasha Lyonne As Reunited Sisters In Well-Acted But Claustrophobic Family Drama – Toronto Film Festival","Toronto Film Festival hosted the World Premiere of dysfunctional family drama His Three Daughters with Carrie Coon, Elizabeth Olsen and Natasha Lyonne","Writer-director Azazel Jacobs has made a couple of indie pictures I really loved. French Exit gave Michelle Pfeiffer one of her meatiest roles in years and she ran with it in a delicious Paris-set tale. He also provided Debra Winger and Tracy Letts with terrific roles in the sophisticated The Lovers. And now Jacobs shows once again he knows how to attract top actors with well-written characters in the intimate drama His Three Daughters, which stars Carrie Coon, Elizabeth Olsen and Natasha Lyonne.

The trio play sisters gathering in the New York City apartment where their father (Jay O. Sanders) is down the hall (unseen for most of the film) and near death. Jacobs purposely wants the confined atmosphere to let the dialogue rise to the top. They have arrived to spend his final days with him, but also to renew their own dysfunctional dynamic. In what could easily have been a play rather than a film, His Three Daughters feels a bit too stagey for its own good.

The film premiered at the Toronto Film Festival today and is looking for distribution. With its starry trio it should find a willing buyer. Ironically it is competing for attention with another film here about three sisters reuniting. That’s debuting director-star Kristin Scott Thomas’ wonderful, much brighter and more cinematic comedy North Star. The characters in that one have a reunion at their mother’s latest wedding, a happier occasion than the downbeat reason the three women in His Three Daughters are back together.

Coon is the organizer, a mother who likes to tie up all loose ends and keep things in order. Olsen is also a mother. She’s the daughter who seems to want to reconnect with dear old dad on a deeper level and has her own issues with her siblings. Lyonne is the outcast, a half sister who still lives in the apartment with Dad, smokes weed and seems as much as home with the street characters outside as she does with her interloping sisters.

We learn much about their lives, their weaknesses, their fractured relationships with family and each other as Jacobs exploits the dynamic between them. Until the final act we don’t even see the father, although his presence is felt throughout. When he finally emerges it is really up to the audience to decide if this is all just illusion, a fantasy, or the siblings’ final moment with a parental figure.

What makes this worthwhile, if not as engaging of the other aforementioned works of Jacobs, are the performances of three superb actors who get to sink their teeth into dialogue-heavy roles, each emerging with a distinct and recognizable character. Lyonne perhaps gets the most intriguing role, the one that feels most lived-in, and as is often the case with this fascinating performer, the one we will remember the most. But all get their moments, as does Jovan Adepo appearing more briefly as a friend. Sanders pays off with limited screen time to present a man we have only heard about for most of the running time, but now see vividly coming alive.

For the filmmaker this very personal movie comes as a bookend to an early film he made 15 years ago, Momma’s Man, which actually starred his aging parents and also dealt directly with the chasm between child and parent, and dealing with all the vagaries that come with grown children now in a reverse position of taking care of their elders.

Producers are Jacobs, Alex Orlovsky, Duncan Montgomery, Matt Aselton, Marc Marrie, Mal Ward, Lia Buman, Tim Headington, Jack Selby and Diaz Jacobs.

2023-08-02 14:43:00+00:00,‘Wonder Woman’ Actress Gal Gadot Reacts To ‘Superman: Legacy’ Casting,Wonder Woman actress Gal Gadot has finally reacted to the role being recast for the new DC Universe with David Corenswet in Superman: Legacy.,"Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman was one of the first superheroes introduced following Henry Cavill’s debut as the Man of Steel. The actress has finally reacted to the role being recast for the new DC Universe with David Corenswet in Superman: Legacy.

While Gal Gadot’s constant Wonder Woman appearances have become a joke in the fandom, she’s been one of the few characters to truly connect the DC Universe. With recent confirmation she’ll likely be returning for Wonder Woman 3, the actress has reacted to her Justice League co-star Henry Cavill being replaced in the upcoming Superman: Legacy film:

“I saw that they were testing, doing different screen tests, but I don’t know who got it, but it seemed like everyone was super legit and talented and, like, great,” Gadot told ComicBook.com. “So I’m happy for them. It’s such a huge take-on and it’s such an exciting beginning to any actor, and I wish whoever it’s going to be the best of luck and enjoy the ride.”

It’s unclear if Gal Gadot and David Corenswet will cross paths in the new DC Universe. Unlike with Henry Cavill where Wonder Woman met Clark Kent in Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League, there are currently no plans for a team-up film following Superman: Legacy or Wonder Woman 3, though it’s entirely possible one is announced in the future.

A new era for the DC Universe

James Gunn and Peter Safran now in charge of DC’s film, television and animations efforts at Warner Bros. Discovery, bringing the company’s comic book-related assets under one roof. Gunn is said to be focusing on the creative direction of the DCU while Safran is handling things that are related to business and production.

Blue Beetle and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom are currently in various stages of post-production at Warner Bros. Discovery, with both DC Universe movies slated to hit theaters in 2023. Will the characters from those movies make appearances in the new DCU? Only Gunn and Safran know.

2023-09-15 10:56:12+00:00,"Aquaman 3: Plot Details, Cast, Release Date And More","Is Aquaman 3 on the horizon? Well, here is everything we know about the future of the Aquaman franchise starring Jason Momoa.","James Wan’s Aquaman made big waves back in 2018, becoming the only DCEU film to smash the billion-dollar milestone at the global box office. However, Aquaman 2‘s troubled production, rife with controversies, on-set drama and public spats, caused confusion and delays over its release. The whole chatter raised doubts about the superhero franchise’s future, especially as a new DC Universe began to take shape. However, as they say, all’s well that ends well and now, after much anticipation, the trailer for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom aka Aquaman 2, has finally been released, promising an epic showdown between Jason Momoa’s Aquaman and the vengeful Black Manta.

While Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom signals the end of the current DCEU era, it doesn’t necessarily mark the end of Jason Momoa and Amber Heard’s Aquaman saga. After all, the hints about the franchise’s future are coming straight from the visionary director James Wan himself.

So, if you are wondering whether Aquaman 3 is in the works, here’s everything we know about the next aquatic adventure.

‘Aquaman 3’: Is it happening?

During the trailer screening event of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, director James Wan dropped a tantalising update. He revealed that the sequel‘s conclusion hints at Momoa’s return in Aquaman 3. Wan cryptically stated, “The Jason Momoa story as Aquaman definitely has more places to go,” emphasising that the ending of Aquaman 2 will “tee up something bigger.” He further added at Aquaman 2’s trailer launch;

“Where we go at the end of this movie, it does tee up something bigger—or, not bigger, but it does tee up a direction for that story and I don’t want to speak to that just because it’s the end of the movie.”

Who will be in the cast of ‘Aquaman 3’?

In interviews following the trailer launch of Aquaman 2, James Wan shed more light on what Aquaman 3 might bring to the table. In a conversation with Entertainment Weekly, Wan stressed the importance of character growth in the next film by saying, “It should be about growing these characters.” Wan also pointed out how Arthur’s character has evolved between the first and second instalments, from a wanderer to someone with a clearer purpose.

He further said, “If and when there is a third one, it should be about growing these characters because I think we’ve set up certain things in a good place in the second movie that you can definitely draw upon in a third.”

What will ‘Aquaman 3’ be about?

While specific details of Aquaman 3’s plot are not clear yet, the focus on character development promises a richer narrative. Not to mention, there are many intriguing possibilities.

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom hints at Black Manta’s quest to target Arthur Curry’s family, a storyline borrowed from the comics. Could the movie witness Black Manta taking the life of Aquaman’s son, mirroring the comics’ tragic events? This would undoubtedly align with Wan’s promise of ‘something bigger’ and the need to ‘grow the characters.’ Such a devastating loss could push Momoa’s protagonist into uncharted emotional territory, setting the stage for some inspiring character development.

Do we have a release date for ‘Aquaman 3’?

As of now, the film remains in the discussion phase. Given the considerable time gap between the release of the first Aquaman instalment in 2018 and the upcoming Aquaman 2, it’s safe to assume that we’ll have to wait a while before even catching a glimpse of Aquaman 3’s teaser.

More about ‘Aquaman 2’

For the uninitiated, Aquaman 2 is the sequel to the record-breaking first movie of the franchise, grossing a staggering USD 1.1 billion worldwide, a milestone for any previous DCEU standalone film. Directed by James Wan, the film stars Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry, aka Aquaman, alongside Amber Heard as the water-bending Atlantean Mera and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Aquaman’s human adversary Black Manta.

The film is set to hit theatres on December 20, 2023.

Check out the trailer for ‘Aquaman 2’ below:

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

– When is Aquaman 3 expected to be released?

As of now, there is no official release date for Aquaman 3. The film is still in the discussion phase.

– Will Amber Heard be a part of Aquaman 3?

Considering Amber Heard’s character Mera, the water-bending Atlantian, has been imperative to the plot of the franchise so far, there’s a good chance that she will be part of Aquaman 3 as well.

– What will be the plot of Aquaman 3?

The film could explore a storyline involving Black Manta targeting Aquaman’s family, possibly leading to a significant event such as the death of Aquaman’s son, mirroring events from the comics. This could also provide an emotional and character-driven plot for Aquaman 3.

2023-08-22 14:35:00+00:00,James Gunn Provides DCU Batman Casting Update Amid John Krasinski Rumors,DC Studios co-chair James Gunn reveals they’re a long way away from cementing casting for Bruce Wayne in Batman: The Brave And The Bold amid casting rumors.,"This past weekend, a rumor began to make the rounds claiming that John Krasinski, best known for his role as Jim on The Office, is in the running to play Bruce Wayne in Batman: The Brave And The Bold for the new DC Universe. However, according to DC Studios co-chair James Gunn, they’re a long way away from cementing casting.

With David Corenswet officially being cast as Superman in the new DC Universe, DC fans have been eagerly awaiting any news about who would be playing the Caped Crusader. Rumors have ranged from The Boys star Jensen Ackles to Finn Wittrock, who was originally set to play Guy Gardner. The newest rumor suggests DC Studios is eyeing The Office and Jack Ryan star John Krasinski for the role. When asked if this was true, James Gunn revealed that DC Studios is a long way from casting given Batman: The Brave And The Bold doesn’t even have a script yet:


Casting a role without a script isn’t a concept foreign to Hollywood, though Blade‘s ongoing production troubles suggest it’s not the best idea. However, James Gunn’s hesitance to cast without one further highlights his stated commitment to storytellers at DC Studios with the new DC Universe. It also means that John Krasinski still has a chance for the role once casting does officially begin.

The future of the DC Universe

James Gunn and Peter Safran told journalists that their vision for the DC Universe includes locked scripts, wiggle room, and a unified storyline across film, television, animation, and video game projects. The two explained that the DC Universe could bring back elements from previous DC regimes, meaning that their eight-to-year plan is not a full reboot.

Shazam! Fury of the Gods, The Flash, and Blue Beetle have all been released following the announcement of the new DC Universe, with Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom still slated to hit theaters in 2023. Will the characters from those movies make appearances in the new DCU? Only Gunn and Safran know.

A new rumor suggests that their Fantastic Four prayers may very well be answered.

This latest rumor comes from The Hot Mic podcast. While previously host Jeff Sneider stated that Ebon Moss-Bacharach was cast in Fantastic Four in a separate role, the newest episode of their show suggests he has been cast as Ben Grimm a.k.a. The Thing in the MCU.

This rumor should certainly be taken with a grain of salt. Not only is this rumor a correction from a previous report about Ebon Moss-Bacharach’s Fantastic Four role, but the original rumor was bundled with the information that Jack Quaid was cast as The Human Torch which the actor has since debunked. While Moss-Bacharach would certainly be a fun Ben Grimm, The Thing with rumors is that they’re never confirmed until official news is already out, meaning fans will have to wait for MCU news either way.

What we know about the Fantastic Four movie

The Fantastic Four reboot is expected to be a fresh take on the classic Marvel characters, with a new cast. Matt Shakman is directing the movie from a screenplay by Josh Friedman. It is currently scheduled to hit theaters in 2025.

John Krasinski played the Earth-838 variant of Reed Richards in Sam Raimi’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, but his future as the character is currently in doubt. Krasinski’s wife Emily Blunt has said that she’s hopeful we’ll see the actor back as Richards for Fantastic Four.

Blue Beetle, la trama del film

Jaime Reyes, un neolaureato alla ricerca di un lavoro, torna a casa pieno di desideri per il suo futuro. Questo ragazzo si ritrova inaspettatamente in possesso di un’antica reliquia di biotecnologia aliena: lo Scarabeo. Quest’ultimo sceglie il giovane come suo ospite simbiotico. Jamie si trasforma nel supereroe Blue Beetle, dotato di una potente armatura esoscheletrica.

Blue Beetle, i villain

Il protagonista dovrà affrontare diversi nemici, tra cui Conrad Carapax (un archeologo con un corpo robotico ""indistruttibile"") e Victoria Kord (un'imprenditrice senza scrupoli che vuole impossessarsi della tecnologia dello Scarabeo).

Blue Beetle, le origini e i poteri

Pubblicato da diverse case editrici, Blue Beetle è un personaggio dei fumetti creato nel 1939. Nel tempo, ha avuto diversi alter ego, tra cui Dan Garrett, Ted Kord e Jaime Reyes. La prima versione debuttò in Mystery Men Comics n. 1 (agosto 1939) di Fox Comics, ma – dopo essere apparso in alcuni fumetti e in una serie radiofonica - finì nel dimenticatoio negli anni Cinquanta.

Dopo la chiusura di Fox Comics, i diritti di Blue Beetle furono acquistati da Charlton Comics, che ideò due diverse versioni. DC Comics, nel 2006, introdusse la versione che troveremo nel film: il teenager Jaime Reyes, con un oggetto di un’avanzata tecnologia aliena. Questo personaggio dei fumetti entrò anche nei Teen Titans e poi nella Justice League.

Le versioni di Blue Beetle presentano origini e poteri differenti. Per quanto riguarda Jaime, il ragazzo utilizza un esoscheletro estremamente resistente che può generare armi. La tuta offre diversi vantaggi, tra cui la guarigione rapida, l’assorbimento dell’energia e la protezione.

Jaime - con un acuto senso di responsabilità - vive a El Paso (Texas) con il padre, la madre e la sorella. Il ragazzo trova e raccoglie lo Scarabeo. Successivamente, Booster Gold (un supereroe e membro della Justice League, proveniente dal XXV secolo) cerca questo oggetto, ma scopre che è fuso nella spina dorsale di Jaime. Inizia così l'avventura di Blue Beetle.

Il cast di Blue Beetle

Il cast del film è guidato da Xolo Maridueña nei panni di Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle. Questo attore statunitense - di origine messicana, cubana ed ecuadoriana - è conosciuto per Cobra Kai, Twin Peaks, Parenthood, Dealin' with Idiots e Major Crimes.

2023-08-25 17:38:01+00:00,Where Have All the DC Fans Gone?,"DC movies are at a crossroads, with the shadow of Zack Snyder still looming large as James Gunn attempts to put his own stamp on a new universe.","It’s been more than a decade since Man of Steel ushered in the DCEU, and 10 years this very week since Ben Affleck was announced to play Batman in Zack Snyder’s cinematic saga. We all know the turmoil that endeavor ultimately resulted in, and the seemingly ceaseless restructuring of DC that followed partially as a result.

But for now, let’s journey back to the summer of 2013, a simpler, yet undeniably passionate age. The noise from comic book movie fans circling the newly minted DC Extended Universe was near deafening that summer. Everyone had an opinion, both on Man of Steel with its controversial third act in which Superman killed Zod, and the casting of Affleck, who still hadn’t quite come clean of the spandex stench of 2003’s Daredevil yet was somehow supposed to measure up to Christian Bale’s beloved Dark Knight.

The DCEU was shiny and new, and whether positive or negative, everyone had an opinion on its future. Fan theories took hold quickly, comic creators took sides, bloggers discovered they could gain control of the narrative early, and DC fans fortified defenses and stockpiled ammunition. In just a few years, they would take what was theoretically supposed to be fun (Comics! Movies! Superheroes!) and turn it into pure misery, a war of personal attacks, vendettas, cult mentalities, antagonistic journalism and career-altering decisions.

Cut to 10 years later, and Henry Cavill is no longer the Man of Steel, Ben Affleck is no longer Batman, Zack Snyder is building universes at Netflix with his Army of the Dead and Rebel Moon franchises, Joss Whedon is persona non grata in Hollywood, and that guy who showed everyone just how successful the Guardians of the Galaxy could be, James Gunn, just wrapped up the Guardians trilogy on a successful note and is now the co-head of DC Studios, alongside Peter Safran.

Together they are relaunching the universe as the DCU. And as for the DCEU? Blue Beetle is in theaters — though, sadly, it seems few know it. Is it the penultimate installment of the DCEU, paving the way for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom? Or is it the DCU’s first entry? Few seem to know the answer to that one either, given Gunn’s perplexing comments that Blue Beetle is the first DCU character but not the first DCU film. Blue Beetle’s opening weekend, among the lowest in the franchise’s history, comes after a string of box office misses including The Flash, Shazam! Fury of the Gods, Black Adam, and COVID-affected titles Wonder Woman 1984 and The Suicide Squad. As Gunn and Safran tee up their relaunch with a slate of film and television projects, pundits are wondering: Where have all the DC film fans gone?

A decade of constantly shifting decisions, executive musical chairs, overly aggressive critics and overly aggressive fans have left DC fandom a house divided, the reflections of which we can see all over social media. It’s a swamp that even Swamp Thing would be hesitant to dip a mossy toe into. There are those who are optimistic about the DCU’s future and eager for a reboot following Gunn and Safran’s unveiling of “Chapter One” in January. There are those who are puzzled over what the DCU actually is, given the mixed messaging behind some actors and projects continuing on — like the Suicide Squad spinoff series, Peacemaker — while most will not. There are those who lament that Snyder did not get to finish the saga as he envisioned, but there are others who have moved on, just as the director has. There are those who find a reboot unnecessary given the decade of work that’s gone into building the DCEU. There are those who have taken a cult-like approach to Snyder’s films, making them (and him) their entire identity, and crowding out those who were just fans of his movies and didn’t conjure up images of Eminem’s “Stan” with violent threats and mobilized harassment. And there are those who have moved on from the whole comic book movie thing.

It’s a difficult, and often hostile environment for any casual fan to thrive in, and too much work for those, myself included, who are invested in these characters but find the online discourse to be filled with traps. Many of those who were excited about Man of Steel and Affleck back in the summer of 2013, and found much to appreciate in the follow-up Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), have since receded to the background, keeping our DCEU fandom close to the vest, while being crowded out by the hashtag brigades and burn-book zealots.

While the MCU has been able to create a fairly unified fan base (though not without its own share of sycophants and antagonists) nobody really has a strong idea of what DC fans want, or who the fans really are. At the moment, it doesn’t even feel possible for DC to have a celebratory DCU Hall H panel at San Diego Comic-Con, certainly not one without a plane flying over the city with a banner proclaiming #SellZSJLtoNetflix (the latest hashtag campaign).

Truthfully, it’s barely possible to go to a movie theater for a new DC film opening night and feel like you’re there sharing the experience with like-minded fans — that is, if you’re sharing the theater with anything other than rows of empty seats. It’s difficult to generate any excitement about DC Films. Unless, of course, it’s related to Batman. Fans love Batman. But not Batman as a supporting character in a Flash adventure, or Batman as an unseen reference in a Harley Quinn heist film. They just want Batman. And if not him, then the Joker will do just fine. As it stands, Warner Bros.’ safest future bets are The Batman Part II and Joker: Folie à Deux, neither of which are part of the shared universe that makes up the upcoming DCU, and both reach beyond the core comic book movie fandom.

On one hand, you can look at the poor turnout for the past year of DCEU films as a lack of faith in the brand from general audiences and fans, to the point where even the good movies, like Blue Beetle, are getting brushed off. But on the other, perhaps this string of box office disappointments casts a lasso of truth around audiences, revealing that when it comes to movies, DC fans en masse aren’t broad fans of the characters and universe itself, but of filmmakers. When we look back at the history of the most successful DC films, and the ones that created passionate fan bases, there is almost always a distinctive filmmaker who can fit into auteur theory behind them. Richard Donner, Tim Burton, Christopher Nolan, Zack Snyder, James Wan and Matt Reeves are all filmmakers with instantly recognizable styles and directorial traits. Hell, we could even add Joel Schumacher to that list, as even his films have found their audience of late. The fact that the lion’s share of those filmmakers took on Batman has only cemented his place as the biggest draw for DC fans.

It seems that it’s this factor, not the necessarily characters themselves, that really separates DC’s film projects from the MCU. The MCU has created a system in which fandom is generated by its characters and the directors, for the most part, are secondary. The fans love Spider-Man, but they’re not buying Jon Watts shirts or expressing interest in his personal life. But DC’s fandom is driven by filmmakers elevated to celebrity status, and as a result, trust is placed in their decisions. It’s that rationale that led to Black Adam, Shazam! Fury of the Gods and Blue Beetle — all of which were marketed as Marvel-lite — failing to draw out the fandom. Their target audience already had versions of those movies in the MCU, and the merits of representation that Black Adam and Blue Beetle offered, while commendable, are not a big enough draw in and of themselves. But when Warners puts someone like Matt Reeves or James Gunn behind those titles, then there’s a draw, and everything from unconventional casting choices to character alterations becomes easier for fans to not only embrace but defend.

The future of the DCU relies on Warners’ awareness that much of this particular fan base is less interested in cinematic universes and cameos, and more invested in filmmakers with distinct, sometimes even controversial, visions. Those are films that fans will rally behind, but hopefully in a well-adjusted way that doesn’t make you think you’re going to see them inserting themselves into their directors’ family photos. James Gunn certainly seems like a filmmaker who can deliver an inspired take on Superman with Superman: Legacy. He has a built-in fan base, which, truthfully, matters a lot less with general audiences in the grand scheme of things. Most folks just want to see a good movie, and if that is delivered upon, a new fan base can emerge. As a filmmaker, Gunn has earned a lot of trust, but for fans, both old and new, to stick around after Legacy, he’s going to need more than a blueprint for the future. He’s going to need a league of filmmakers in whom audiences can put their trust.

Warner Bros. isn’t going to win back everyone, and it would be a mistake — one that the studio made in the past with the DCEU — to even think that they can. Attempting to make films for everyone resulted in the theatrical cut of Justice League (2017), a film for no one. And it will take time to rebuild DC’s fandom, to unify the parts that can be unified, and simply let the rest go. Not everyone is going to be sold, and expecting a billion-dollar Superman film out the gate would be absurd, but of course, we’ve been down that road before. Perhaps the simplest lesson for this current regime comes from the film that spearheaded a DC cinematic universe in the first place, The Dark Knight: “Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded.”

That means offering consistency and not changing directions every time some critics and certain segments of fandom become blinded by nostalgia or throw tantrums when the story isn’t told the way they wanted it to be. That means decisiveness and letting filmmakers do more than simply adapt the familiar, but challenge what we think we want from these movies and what we think we know about these characters. The DCU has to do more than make fans believe a man can fly. It has to make them believe that this time, there’s a willingness to stay the course and see that flight to its destination. Only then will the DC film fans be found again.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtZmVhdHVyZXMvZGMtbW92aWVzLXdoeS1mYW5zLXphY2stc255ZGVyLTEyMzU1NzM4OTUv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy9tb3ZpZS1mZWF0dXJlcy9kYy1tb3ZpZXMtd2h5LWZhbnMtemFjay1zbnlkZXItMTIzNTU3Mzg5NS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-09-03 07:30:40+00:00,"Everything We Know About ‘The Equalizer 4’: Plot, Release Date, Cast And More","With the release of Equalizer 3, here is everything you need to know about its potential sequel Equalizer 4.","After two successful movies in The Equalizer series, Denzel Washington has returned as retired assassin Robert McCall with a third adventure, this time in Italy. In Equalizer 3, McCall faces off against the Italian mafia and if the reviews are anything to go by, Denzel has given yet another stellar performance. However, despite the positive reception to the film, it is being billed as the ‘final chapter’ of the franchise.

The first instalment, which hit theatres in 2014, and the 2018 sequel were big hits, despite receiving mixed reviews from critics. For the uninitiated, both Equalizer and Equalizer 2 have made over USD 100 million at the box office. Considering the massive fan following for Antoine Fuqua’s iconic franchise, Equalizer 3 is expected to fare even better at the box office than its predecessors.

So, is it all that surprising to see fans wondering if this really is the end of their favourite action franchise? And if not, could there be an Equalizer 4 in the works? Let’s find out!

Is ‘The Equalizer 4’ happening?

A fourth Equalizer film hasn’t been confirmed yet, but it’s a possibility if certain conditions are met.

Director Antoine Fuqua mentioned in an interview with Total Film that he’d consider making a fourth movie only if Denzel Washington returns to play McCall. He said in a statement, “I believe this would be it. We’ve both talked about it that way. But you never know! Listen, Denzel’s in shape. He’s training every day. If you saw him now, it would blow your mind. He’s like 60 pounds lighter, even from The Equalizer. He’s really healthy. Yeah, it’s up to him. Obviously, if he wanted to do another one, I would as well, but I don’t see it. But who knows?”

Does ‘Equalizer 4’ have a release date?

While fans eagerly await news of the next thrilling instalment in this beloved franchise, as of now there’s no release date for The Equalizer 4 because the sequel hasn’t been officially announced yet. However, considering the four to five-year gaps between the previous movies, we might have to wait a while before another instalment is announced.

The ‘Equalizer 4’ cast: Who could be in it?

We don’t have any confirmed information or details about The Equalizer 4 cast. If the film does happen, we would expect Denzel Washington to reprise his iconic role as Robert McCall, unless it turns out to be a prequel or spin-off with a different character taking on the mantle.

Regardless of what happens with The Equalizer franchise, Antoine Fuqua has exciting plans for his next project – a biopic of Michael Jackson starring the singer’s nephew Jaafar Jackson.

Washington’s long-standing collaboration with the franchise

Denzel Washington first portrayed McCall in 2014’s The Equalizer, a modern-day reboot of the ’80s series directed by Antoine Fuqua. The story followed McCall, a former Marine and DIA agent, as he reluctantly got involved in battling the Russian mob’s sex trafficking ring, leading to a showdown with a ruthless overseas enforcer. The actor has now returned as the retired assassin in Equalizer 2 and Equalizer 3.

Xolo Mariduena stars ase Jaime Reyes in Warner Bros.' ""Blue Beetle."" Warner Bros. Discovery
It's pink vs. blue at the box office this weekend. As ""Barbie"" continues a historic run in theaters, a little-known superhero called ""Blue Beetle"" is looking to take the top spot on the charts this weekend. With $3.3 million from Thursday night previews, Warner Bros. Discovery's latest film based on a DC Comics character is expected to take in between $22 million and $32 million during its domestic debut. Meanwhile, Warner Bros.' ""Barbie,"" which has steadily tallied $545 million domestically since its late July release, is expected to add between $17 million and $22 million during its fifth weekend. ""Blue Beetle"" arrives in theaters after several DC Comics-based films have flopped at the box office and while the studio undergoes a major creative regime change. ""The four movies released this year are orphans,"" said Robert Thompson, a professor at Syracuse University and a pop culture expert, referring to DC titles ""Shazam! Fury of the Gods,"" ""The Flash,"" ""Blue Beetle"" and the upcoming ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom."" ""They're part of the old universe that's about to get completely rebooted. [Warner Bros.] has to promote these, they want them to be big hits, obviously, but there is a sense that they're part of the old guard,"" Thompson said. And audiences haven't turned out for these films so far. ""Shazam! Fury of the Gods"" generated just $57.6 million domestically and ""The Flash"" tallied a little more than $100 million in the U.S. and Canada. These performances show an ""indifference"" from audiences, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.
Will 'Blue Beetle' take flight or be squashed?
When ""Blue Beetle"" first entered development in 2018, there was potential for the character of Jaime Reyes, the man behind the moniker, to cross paths with DC's other famed heroes. However, turnover at the studio, mostly due to the merger between Warner Media and Discovery, has put the future of the hero in question. As superhero movies have become more popular in the cultural zeitgeist, much of the appeal of big franchises has been the interconnectability of the stories. It's why Disney's Marvel Studios was able to to introduce obscure comic book characters like the Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man and Moon Knight into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and turn them into fan favorites. Blue Beetle, without the promise of interaction with Justice League veterans like Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, the Flash or Aquaman, might not be able to drum up much enthusiasm at the box office. To be sure, standalone, unconnected films have had success for DC in the recent past, but they featured well-known characters like Batman and the Joker. ""We're in limbo now,"" said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. ""In a world where superheroes aren't really novelties anymore, that's going to be a tough sell for a lot of people."" Robbins said ""Blue Beetle,"" which features a Mexican-American family at its core, could benefit from an influx of Hispanic moviegoers in the same way that Marvel's ""Black Panther"" saw Black moviegoers who were not comic book fans rush out to see the film. Critics have raved about Xolo Mariduena's magnetic performance as the titular character and how the film centers on a hero who is family-focused, not a lone gunslinger. ""Blue Beetle"" still falls into some of the old trappings of past superhero movies, including chaotic, repetitive CGI fight sequences, but some say as DC course corrects in the next few years, it should look to keep Mariduena and Blue Beetle on its roster. ""A film like 'Blue Beetle' could benefit from solid word-of-mouth,"" said Dergarabedian. ""Judgement for the latest DC entry should come after the first three weeks, not the first three days in theaters.""

2023-08-16 16:23:20+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’ Aims to End ‘Barbie’s’ Box Office Reign With $30 Million Debut,"""Blue Beetle"" is taking on ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" at the box office.","Will “Blue Beetle,” the latest DC superhero adaptation, knock down “Barbie” at the domestic box office?
It may be a closer-than-expected race between the two Warner Bros. releases for the top spot, despite “Barbie” entering its fifth weekend in theaters. “Blue Beetle,” starring Xolo Maridueña as the alien symbiote, is targeting $25 million to $32 million in its debut. The comic book adventure is landing on Friday in 3,850 venues, including some Imax screens.
Meanwhile, “Barbie” is expected to add a stellar $17 million to $20 million over the weekend. With $537.4 million in North America, Greta Gerwig’s very pink comedy is closing in on Universal’s “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” ($574 million) as the highest-grossing release of the year. The juggernaut has impressively remained the No. 1 movie for four consecutive weekends and recently overtook Christopher Nolan’s 2008 superhero epic “The Dark Knight” ($536 million) as the biggest domestic release in Warner Bros. history.
“Blue Beetle” cost $125 million and is the third of four DC films to open theatrically in 2023. It’s hoping to avoid a similar box office fate as the comic book studio’s two prior misfires: “Shazam: Fury of the Gods,” which missed projections in March with its $30.1 million debut, and “The Flash,” which fell short of expectations in June with $55 million to start. After “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” a sequel to the billion-dollar 2018 blockbuster, opens in December, the studio’s new chiefs James Gunn and Peter Safran plan to push the faltering comic book universe in an entirely new direction.
Ángel Manuel Soto directed “Blue Beetle,” which was originally commissioned for HBO Max but changed to secure a theatrical release. The story centers on a college graduate named Jaime Reyes, who returns to his hometown of Palmera City. He’s chosen to become a symbiotic host to an ancient alien biotech relic that turns him into the superhero known as Blue Beetle.
“Blue Beetle” will open alongside Universal’s R-rated comedy “Strays,” which is looking to dig up $15 million to $17 million over the weekend. It cost $46 million to bring to the big screen. When it comes to recent theatrical comedies, a rare breed in Hollywood these days, the projected ticket sales are better than Bert Kreischer’s stand-up inspired “The Machine” (which crumbled with $5 million) and on par with Jennifer Lawrence’s raunchy “No Hard Feelings” ($15 million). But it may not reach the initial heights of Universal’s drug-fueled “Cocaine Bear” ($23 million).
Will Ferrell leads the pack in “Strays,” which follows a gullible Border terrier named Reggie who gathers a group of abandoned pups to exact revenge on his ruthless prior owner, Doug (Will Forte). The formidable voice cast also includes Jamie Foxx, Isla Fisher, Randall Park, Josh Gad and Sofía Vergara.
Because of the ongoing SAG strike, the casts of “Blue Beetle” and “Strays” have not been permitted to promote the movies on talk shows or in the press. Recent summer releases, like Disney’s “The Haunted Mansion,” shark sequel “Meg 2: The Trench” and “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” faced the same predicament. In the case of “Blue Beetle,” Warner Bros. held a star-free “fan screening” since it wasn’t able to mount a splashy Hollywood premiere.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYm94LW9mZmljZS1ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1vcGVuaW5nLXdlZWtlbmQtZXN0aW1hdGVzLTEyMzU2OTY4NzAv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vYm94LW9mZmljZS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWJsdWUtYmVldGxlLW9wZW5pbmctd2Vla2VuZC1lc3RpbWF0ZXMtMTIzNTY5Njg3MC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-20 15:07:44+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Blue Beetle’ Stumbles With $25 Million Debut, Ends ‘Barbie’s’ Four-Week Streak","""Blue Beetle"" overtook ""Barbie"" on box office charts.","“Blue Beetle” has dethroned “Barbie” at the domestic box office. The latest DC superhero adventure claimed the No. 1 spot despite a softer-than-expected debut of $25.4 million.
At the international box office, “Blue Beetle,” starring Xolo Maridueña as the alien symbiote, added $18 million from 63 markets. With $43 million globally, it’s one of the softest starts in the history of the DC Cinematic Universe.
After four consecutive weekends in first place, “Barbie” landed on her feet at second place with $21.5 million from 4,003 theaters, a huge result at this point in its theatrical run. After five weeks of release, Greta Gerwig’s fantasy-comedy has generated $567 million and will soon overtake Universal’s animated “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” ($574 million) as the biggest domestic release of the year.
“Blue Beetle” cost more than $100 million to produce and many millions more to promote, so it’ll need to defy the box office odds to justify its price tag. Reviews and word of mouth may not do much to fill seats; the film has a “B+” CinemaScore and 77% on Rotten Tomatoes. In a note to press, Warner Bros. suggested the impact of Tropical Storm Hilary “is anticipated to be significant, particularly in Southern California where the film is over‐indexing.”
It’s the third DC film in 2023 to tumble out of the gate after “Shazam: Fury of the Gods” ($30.1 million in March) and “The Flash” ($55 million in June). Even 2021’s “The Suicide Squad,” which debuted simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max, enjoyed a bigger start with $26.2 million. But that film — as well as “Shazam 2” and “The Flash,” which flopped in their theatrical runs — were based on higher-profile characters compared to Blue Beetle.
Directed by Ángel Manuel Soto, the film centers on college graduate Jaime Reyes, who gets chosen to become a symbiotic host to an ancient alien biotech relic that turns him into the superhero known as Blue Beetle. A fourth DC adaptation, “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” is slated to release in December before the studio’s new chiefs James Gunn and Peter Safran take the faltering comic book universe in an entirely new direction.
“After a dozen nearly flawless years, the [comic book] genre has performed unevenly during the last 3-and-a-half years,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “We’re going to know more about superheroes in November and December,” he adds in reference to “Aquaman 2” as well as Disney’s sequel “The Marvels” on Nov. 10. “Those two films will determine the state of superheroes in 2023 and going forward.”
Universal’s talking-dog comedy “Strays” also stumbled in its debut, digging up a paltry $8.3 million from 3,223 theaters for a fifth-place finish. The R-rated movie cost $46 million and could struggle overseas, where funny films tend to have limited appeal. It flopped at the international box office with $1.9 million from 21 territories for a global tally of $10 million.
“This is a soft opening,” says Gross. “Audience ratings are good, with lukewarm reviews from critics.”
Theatrical comedies are a rare breed in Hollywood these days, and even with a starry voice cast of Will Ferrell and Jamie Foxx, “Strays” fared far worse than Jennifer Lawrence’s raunchy “No Hard Feelings” ($15 million) and Universal’s drug-fueled “Cocaine Bear” ($23 million). It barely beat Bert Kreischer’s stand-up inspired “The Machine,” which crumbled with $5 million.
“Strays” landed behind two holdovers, Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” and Paramount’s “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.”
“Oppenheimer” took third place with $11 million in its fifth weekend of release, bringing ticket sales to $286 million. The R-rated historical drama crossed $700 million at the global box office over the weekend, surpassing 2014’s “Interstellar” ($714 million) to stand as Nolan’s fourth-highest grossing movie. It’s the fourth-biggest release of the year behind “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” ($1.35 billion), “Barbie” ($1.27 billion) and “Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3” ($845 million).
Paramount’s “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” landed at the No. 4 spot with $8.4 million from 3,477 venues. After three weekends on the big screen, the animated family comedy has grossed $88.1 million in North America and $30 million internationally. It cost $70 million and will end up as a modest box office performer.
At the specialty box office, Park Chan-Wook’s 2003 vengeance thriller “Oldboy” returned to 250 theaters in honor of its 20th anniversary. The film grossed $880,000 in five days and will cross $1 million in its first week of re-release, an impressive result for a re-release. The top-performing cities were San Francisco, New York City, and Los Angeles at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas, according to Neon.
Elsewhere, “Meg 2: The Trench” swam past the $300 million mark with worldwide ticket sales at $316.6 million. A majority of those returns are coming from international territories, where the shark sequel has grossed $250 million. The follow-up isn’t living up to its predecessor, 2018’s “The Meg,” which earned $145 million in North America and $529 million globally. At the domestic box office especially, “The Trench” has been shark bait in the wake of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYm94LW9mZmljZS1ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1zdHVtYmxlcy1vcGVuaW5nLXdlZWtlbmQtYmFyYmllLTEyMzU3MDA2NzYv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vYm94LW9mZmljZS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWJsdWUtYmVldGxlLXN0dW1ibGVzLW9wZW5pbmctd2Vla2VuZC1iYXJiaWUtMTIzNTcwMDY3Ni9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,'Blue Beetle' squashes 'Barbie' as No. 1 movie at the box office,"'Blue Beetle' squashed 'Barbie,' topping the box office with a slightly buzzy $25 million opening weekend.","After four weeks perched at the top of the box office, Barbie is stepping down, its reign coming to an anticlimactic end as DC's Blue Beetle hit No. 1 this weekend, raking in $25.4 million, per Comscore. Internationally, the caped caper earned an additional $18 million, for a global total of $43.4 million.
Featuring one of DC's lesser-known superheroes, the film, directed by Angel Manuel Soto, stars Xolo Maridueña, playing the title role as well as his alter ego, Jaime Reyes.
In the movie, recent college grad Jaime returns home full of aspirations for his future, only to find that home is not quite as he left it. As he searches for his purpose in the world, fate intervenes when Jaime unexpectedly discovers an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab.

""With this movie, really what we wanted to highlight was Jaime's story and the Reyes family's story,"" Maridueña recently told EW. ""But my heart is already so fulfilled with this movie. If we do 20 of these movies and 40 cameos or if it's just this one, what's most exciting to me is the opportunity for people to see it and have little kids everywhere saying, 'Oh my gosh, this guy looks like me. I can be a hero, too.'""
In the fifth blockbuster week of its release, Barbie wasn't that far behind Blue Beetle, racking up $21.5 million for a domestic gross of $567.3 million ($1.3 billion globally). Oppenheimer took third place with $10.6 million, bringing its domestic total to $285.2 million ($717.8 million globally).
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem secured the fourth spot this weekend, with those heroes in a half shell powering their way to $8.4 million in the movie's third week of release. So far, the TMNT reboot has earned $88.1 million domestically and $118.4 million globally.

Meanwhile, Strays, a.k.a. the R-rated Homeward Bound for the TikTok generation, opened to $8.3 million. The raunchy comedy, produced by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, has an all-star voice cast that includes Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Isla Fisher, and Randall Park.
""It's a movie that's very smart about being silly,"" Lord told EW. ""It's written by Dan Perrault, who we've always admired from the show American Vandal. The movie really goes there, and it takes a big swing, but it's also very big-hearted and warm. You get the sense that the movie's friendly, even though it's very naughty.""

With Shazam 2, Black Adam, and The Flash underperforming, DC movies are under a lot of scrutiny right. Will Blue Beetle be the movie to break the trend, or will it continue DC’s poor luck in theaters? Here are the latest projections.
How much money is Blue Beetle predicted to make?
Blue Beetle box office predictions estimate that the movie will earn $12-17 million in its domestic opening weekend, ultimately setting at $27-55 million domestically.
Buy Blue Beetle merch on Amazon here
The projections by Box Office Pro are based on strengths like the DC brand having a “modest strength” and the relatively unknown Blue Beetle hero appearing “fresh” to audiences. As for weaknesses, it’s noted that audiences are becoming more selective about which superhero movies they go and see, in addition to competition from some other family-friendly movies.
Will the Blue Beetle movie be a flop?
Current predictions set Blue Beetle up to flop. With a reported $120 million budget (via The Wrap), the movie appears to have a steep climb ahead of it.
With other DC movies failing to perform recently, it seems like Blue Beetle will have to perform a miracle to get superhero fans into theaters. If the movie reviews well, there’s a chance that more people will flock to see it.
If Blue Beetle fails to break DC and Warner Bros.’s string of bad luck in theaters, it will be up to Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom to try and right the ship when it starts showing in late December.

The Greta Gerwig-directed Mattel doll adaptation has become the highest grossing Warner Bros. movie in the studio’s 100-year history at the domestic box office with $537.4M, unseating previous champ, Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight which made $534.9M back in 2008.
Barbie crossed the half billion mark in U.S. and Canada late last week in her 22nd day of release, beating that of Top Gun: Maverick last year (30 days) and this year’s Super Mario Bros Movie (31 days) to that benchmark. Barbie is one of 20 movies in domestic box office history to gross north of $500M. Her global running cume stands near $1.2 billion. Worldwide, she’s the second highest grossing movie for Warner Bros, gaining on their all-time record of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part Two which made $1.34 billion.
As previously reported, among the myriad records Barbie has achieved is becoming the highest grssing movie ever from a female filmmaker at the domestic box office, besting Frozen II‘s $477.4M, which was co-directed by Jennifer Lee. Barbie‘s global tally also makes her the highest grossing live-action pic from a female filmmaker at the box office, besting Captain Marvel‘s $1.13 billion WW take, that movie co-directed by Anna Boden.

Warner Bros. $129M production of Meg 2: The Trench (funny enough, entitled Shark 2 in Italy) is looking at $20M-$30M at 3,500 locations in third. Expect lower on this because of Barbenheimer just like we pegged lower for Haunted Mansion. Meg 2 will chomp on Dolby Cinema, PLFs, 4DX, Screen X, Drive-ins and Dbox formats. Jason Statham is back. The first movie released in early Aug 2018 opened to $45.4M and went on to make $145.5M. The fish is strong with guys. The original movie had a B+ CinemaScore. No reviews yet, but critics weren’t wild about the beast the first time around at 46% rotten. There’s a shot this sequel could do another $90M abroad, $50M of that coming from China. The PRC was huge for Meg which had co-financing from China Gravity; the movie opening to $50M and finaling at $153M, unadjusted for inflation and currency swings. Previews here in the U.S. and Canada start at 3PM Thursday at 3,000 theaters.

As we told you earlier, Paramount/Nickelodeon/Point Grey’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is heading toward a $30M+ five-day opening after minting $3.85M in previews last night. At 95% certified fresh, it’s the best reviewed animated film YTD alongside Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. There was previously an animated version of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from Warner Bros/Weinstein Co back in 2007, TMNT, which opened to $24.2M and legged out to $54.1M domestic. Critics splattered that at 36% Rotten while audiences gave it an A- CinemaScore.

,‘Barbie’ is about to become America’s highest-grossing movie of 2023,,"‘Barbie’ is about to become America’s highest-grossing movie of 2023
By Jordan Valinsky, CNN
New York (CNN) — “Barbie” is now within striking distance of becoming the highest-grossing movie at the domestic box office this year, taking the crown away from “Super Mario Bros.”
According to studio estimates, “Barbie” has made $572.3 million at the American box office as of Wednesday, edging closer the Mario’s domestic haul of $574.2 million.
It’s likely that “Barbie,” based on the iconic doll, will officially snatch the title from the video game adaptation, “Super Mario Bros.” on Thursday, when Wednesday’s box office results are released.
“Barbie’s” run to the top will be faster than “Mario’s.” Deadline notes that “Barbie” will likely reach the record-breaking title in only 35 days since its release, while it took Mario, Luigi and the gang 138 days to cross the $574.2 million benchmark in the United States.
Since premiering July 21, “Barbie” has broken numerous records. The film made $155 million domestically in its opening weekend, making it the largest opening weekend of the year and the biggest-ever debut for a female director. In the weeks to follow, it also was crowned Warner Bros. Discovery’s highest-grossing domestic release, beating the former title holder, the 2008 blockbuster, “The Dark Knight.”
Last week, “Barbie” had also crossed the $1.2 billion mark globally, after hitting the $1 billion milestone less than three weeks ago — a feat achieved only by about 50 films in history, adjusted for inflation, Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, previously told CNN. It also placed director Greta Gerwig as the highest-grossing woman movie director in history.
The movie’s reign of sitting at the top of the box office came to an end last weekend, when “Blue Beetle” unseated “Barbie.” The newest DC superhero film grossed an estimated $25.4 million, while “Barbie” slipped to second, bringing in $21.5 million, according to studio estimates.
“Barbie” and “Blue Beetle” are distributed by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.

2023-07-27 18:46:46+00:00,"Long Range Box Office Forecast: Can NINJA TURTLES, MEG 2, GRAN TURISMO, BLUE BEETLE, and STRAYS Carry August?",This week's report takes a quick look at how August's key releases are shaping up so far as there is no wide release addition to the forecast for the weekend of August 25.,"With no new wide releases coming to theaters for the weekend of August 25, this week’s report takes a look at how the month’s key releases are shaping up.
PROS:
With the sustained holdover success of July releases Barbie and Oppenheimer, August looks poised to be a healthy month overall.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (August 2, Paramount) continues to track well as a late summer animated offering that will appeal to young and older fans alike. Pre-sale trends are well ahead of Elemental and not far behind those of Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.
Meg 2: The Trench (August 4, Warner Bros.) provides a late summer, PG-13 action-horror-comedy hybrid for audiences looking to end the summer on a lighter note after the longer, more dramatic genre films that have come earlier. Blue Beetle (August 18, Warner Bros.) hopes to ride the same wave among DC comic fans and Latin American families, while Strays (August 18, Universal) aims for the older audiences on the comedy spectrum.
CONS:
As Barbie and Oppenheimer settle in for leggy runs that could see both films rank highly on the box office chart moving into early fall, their success is likely to overshadow some upcoming releases—especially if the ongoing WGA and SAG/AFTRA prevents studios from marketing those newer films as much as they otherwise would have.
Meg 2‘s marketing campaign has left something to be desired, and early pre-sales reflect a lower initial burst of enthusiasm than seen for its 2018 predecessor. It’s likely to be the most impacted by the current Barbenheimer craze.
Gran Turismo (August 11, Sony) remains a wild card as it hopes to build beyond its core video game fan base. Pre-sales are relatively slow out of the gate.
Blue Beetle and The Last Voyage of the Demeter (August 11, Universal) continue to trend very modestly as marketing begins to ramp up. Strays remains a volatile film to forecast due to reasons mentioned in prior reports.
The final weekend of August is currently without a major studio title, meaning holdovers will have to carry the market before The Equalizer 3 (September 1, Sony) opens for Labor Day weekend.

,'Barbie' tops box office for second week in a row,'Barbenheimer' crossed the global $1 billion mark as 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' showed strong second weeks at the box office.,"Long live Barbenheimer!
In their second weeks, Barbie — whose ticket sales declined just 43% from its debut —and Oppenheimer continued to dominate the box office, bolstering a previously lackluster summer box office, as per Comscore.
At the top spot, Barbie earned $93 million domestically, bringing its cume to $351.4 million. Internationally, the Greta Gerwig-directed smash raked in $122.2 million this weekend, bringing the film's worldwide total so far to a staggering $774.5 million.
In only its second week, the certified global phenom is already the third highest-grossing film of the year, behind the Chris Pratt-starring The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. At this pace, Barbie could become only the second film to cross the billion-dollar mark at the global box office, behind other childhood icon Super Mario.

Oppenheimer continued to benefit from being hitched to Barbie's hot pink wagon, taking in $46.2 million, for a domestic total of $174 million and a global total of $400.4 million. That brings Barbenheimer's cume to over $1.1 billion.
Opening at No. 3, Disney's all-star Haunted Mansion, inspired by the theme park ride, grossed $24.2 million domestically ($33.3 million globally). With a cast that includes Owen Wilson, Tiffany Haddish, LaKeith Stanfield, Jamie Lee Curtis, Rosario Dawson, and Danny DeVito, the film follows a woman and her son who enlist a motley crew of so-called spiritual experts to help rid their home of supernatural squatters.

Rounding out the weekend's top five at the box office, Sound of Freedom continues its controversial run, snagging $12.4 million in its fourth week of release, for a domestic total of $149 million. And Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One shows little sign of life domestically with $10.7 million in its third week, bringing its total in the States to $139.2 million, though it's netted a much more respectable $448.5 million globally.

2023-08-16 09:30:56+00:00,"South Korea Police Allege Box Office Manipulation On 320+ Local Films; Exhibition, Distribution Officials Referred To Prosecutor – Reports",South Korea police say 69 exhibition and distribution officials have been referred to the prosecutor over alleged box office manipulation on 320+ films,"Police in South Korea said today that 69 officials from theater chains including CGV, Lotte and Megabox and from 24 film distributors have been referred without detention to the prosecutor on charges of obstruction of business, local media reports.
This follows an investigation that began in June into suspicious box office numbers. Police claim the accused were involved in fabricating figures to boost film rankings over the past five years.
Ticket sales for at least 323 movies screened in the market from March 2018 to June of this year allegedly were inflated, per the Korea Herald, citing police. SBS reports the alleged falsely reported sales at certain shows were on local titles and resulted in 2.67 million overcounted viewers.
In June, police raided the major exhibitors and the offices of three film distributors on suspicion of box office manipulation and allegations they had obstructed the business of the Korean Film Council (KOFIC) by falsely counting audience numbers for some local films.
News agency Yonhap reports today that police alleged the accused theater officials, in collusion with film distributors, entered inflated ticket sales information onto KOFIC’s compiling service to boost rankings of the films released at their cinemas.
A translated report from SBS News says methods used to inflate numbers included purchasing large quantities of tickets for late-night movies and holding so-called “ghost screenings” without an audience.
KOFIC manages box office data, including the audience numbers and sales for each movie, through the Korean Box Office Information System, to which multiplexes and film distributors report box office numbers.
As part of the investigation, police examined box office figures and ticket sales on 462 films released by 98 firms.
Local media reports that among the titles allegedly inflated were action thriller Emergency Declaration (2021), romantic drama Endless Rain (2021) and last year’s documentary The Red Herring.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvc291dGgta29yZWEtaW5mbGF0ZWQtYm94LW9mZmljZS1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLWV4aGliaXRvcnMtZGlzdHJpYnV0b3JzLTEyMzU1MjA0ODMv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC9zb3V0aC1rb3JlYS1pbmZsYXRlZC1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24tZXhoaWJpdG9ycy1kaXN0cmlidXRvcnMtMTIzNTUyMDQ4My9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

Learn more at Empire.,"While his latest directorial gig, DC superhero film Blue Beetle, didn't exactly light up the box office this weekend (it opened to a soft $25.4 million, but did manage to dethrone Barbie), Ángel Manuel Soto is still an in-demand filmmaker. He's now attached to make The Wrecking Crew for MGM.
Written by Banshee and The Adam Project's Jonathan Tropper, the film has nothing to do with the Dean Martin 1968 Matt Helm action comedy or the documentary on session musicians from 2008, but is, in fact, the buddy comedy originally brainstormed by Dave Bautista and Jason Momoa as a project for them to star in.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtcGlyZW9ubGluZS5jb20vbW92aWVzL25ld3MvYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtZGlyZWN0b3ItYW5nZWwtbWFudWVsLXNvdG8tYm9hcmRzLWJ1ZGR5LWFjdGlvbi1maWxtLXRoZS13cmVja2luZy1jcmV3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

2023-08-10 13:00:00+00:00,How ‘Blue Beetle’ Landed at the Center of a Historic Strike and a Latino Movement,"Advocates of diverse representation argue that the cast of ""Blue Beetle"" should be able to talk up the movie, but SAG-AFTRA has other ideas.","Fears are rising amid Latino activists and fans that the double strike will endanger the box office success and the legacy of “Blue Beetle.”
When DC’s latest comic book movie hits theaters on Aug. 18, it will be the first superhero feature starring, written by and directed by Latinos on the big screen. This event has the potential to be what “Black Panther” was for Black audiences and “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” was for AAPI viewers: a celebration of a film representing marginalized audiences in a Hollywood landscape that remains remarkably white.
In order to get to the screen this summer, “Blue Beetle” had to survive three regime changes, a straight-to-streaming greenlight, a pandemic and content cuts at Warner Bros. Discovery that overwhelmingly affected BIPOC-driven shows and movies. Now, it’s opening amid a historic double strike. And for many in the Latino activist community, that’s what may finally do it in.
SAG-AFTRA is prohibiting promotion of projects by actors at the struck studios — all of the majors, including Warner Bros. So while the movie is a groundbreaking piece of Latino representation, its cast can’t do anything to hype the film.
This has caused concern among groups that have long advocated for authentic Latino representation in media. They fear that Latino-led movies and TV shows such as “Blue Beetle” will lose their cultural significance and be forgotten. To prevent this, 27 Latino advocacy groups issued an unprecedented joint open letter on Wednesday urging the public to #SupportLatinoCreatives at a time when they can’t promote their projects themselves.
And the ramifications can be bigger: The double strike, the group wrote, “will have a significantly disproportionate impact on artists from underrepresented communities.”
So many hurdles already
“Blue Beetle” miraculously survived three different regime changes at Warner Bros. It was initially announced in December 2018 under Time Warner. From there it was developed, cast and prepped under the AT&T-owned WarnerMedia and went into production shortly after the deal that created Warner Bros. Discovery closed in 2022. Originally planned for an HBO Max premiere, confidence in the film grew enough to transition it from the small screen to theaters — complete with an Imax release.
However, when “Batgirl” was canceled by the studio’s new owners, there was fear in the Latino community that the same fate would befall “Blue Beetle” since it was greenlit by a previous regime. That didn’t happen, but just two months from release, the SAG-AFTRA/WGA strike has thrown a new wrench into things.
Representatives for DC and Warner Bros. declined to comment.
Barriers to diversity
“Pre-strike there were so many challenges facing film properties targeted towards BIPOC audiences,” Pilaar Terry, managing partner and COO of POV Agency, told TheWrap. “This includes lack of investment in those projects due to a dearth of confidence that these types of films would deliver a return.”
The major concern is a lack of promotion for films with marginalized casts and writers will lead to poor performance at the box office and perpetuate arguments that audiences don’t want to see films starring BIPOC actors. Though the box office often disproves that notion (“Black Panther” and “Shang-Chi” are proof in the superhero space alone), the myth persists.
“There remains an unspoken and unspecified stigma about these types of films from mainstream studios and streaming [services],” Terry said. “Studios and [streamers] continue to be ‘pleasantly surprised’ that these films are not only tapping into the cultural zeitgeist but that they’re making actual money. It’s wild.”
Latinos make up 19% of the U.S. population and 39% of Californians, according to Census figures. They make up an estimated 25% of the moviegoing audience.
Yet their representation in Hollywood falls far short of that and has worsened, not improved, in recent years. Latinos made up 2.3% of the leads in theatrically released movies in 2022, according to UCLA’s 2023 Hollywood Diversity Report, and 6.1% of the leads in streaming movies.
SAG-AFTRA unveiled a plan to boost diversity and inclusion in 2021, including the creation of diversity committees for underrepresented groups. But since the basis of SAG eligibility is working as an actor, a lack of representation in film roles is inevitably reflected in the demographics of the union.
“It definitely seems like an unfair struggle for the Latino actor,” said a Latino SAG member who spoke to TheWrap, requesting anonymity so as not to jeopardize his ability to get future work.
Now add the strikes
The promotional restrictions of the strike are intended to impose painful costs on the studio. But the added pressure of being a BIPOC picture needing to make a box office killing in order to become a launchpad for more marginalized groups’ stories could make “Blue Beetle” collateral damage.
“This should be a moment to celebrate what is a fun ride for all told through this lovable family,” a rep who has talent in the film and requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject told TheWrap. “Latinos would love to celebrate its cultural achievement but fear the repercussions from the guild. Everyone is looking to guild leadership to say it’s OK to be proud publicly about this moment.”
For his part, “Blue Beetle” star Xolo Maridueña stood with his fellow SAG-AFTRA members, saying shortly before the strike began that going on strike meant being “on the right side of history.” An Instagram post encouraging followers to see the movie was the last message he could post about the film he starred in.
Ironically, he was able to walk the red carpet for Warner Bros.’ “Barbie,” whose July 9 premiere came well before the SAG-AFTRA strike, but not his own movie.
The talent rep estimates that the combined reach of the cast on social media is more than 90 million people. Maridueña has 3.2 million followers on Instagram, for instance. That free promotion isn’t available for the movie now.
There are some who want to see “Blue Beetle” obtain an interim agreement so its cast can promote the film. Currently, SAG-AFTRA does have a process that can allow independent productions that agree to the guild’s terms to continue working. These interim agreements also extend to promotion, with the Lily Gladstone-starring film “The Unknown Country” receiving a waiver, as well as Luc Besson’s upcoming Venice drama “Dogman.”
Clearly, “Blue Beetle” would not be eligible for an interim agreement for promotion as it hails from Warner Bros., a major studio. And even if it got a waiver, “Blue Beetle’s” stars may refuse to cross the picket line. Granting this or any other major studio film an exception would likely draw even fiercer opposition from union members than those made for independent productions which have agreed to guild terms.
As TheWrap previously reported, there is growing division over these waivers, with some union members arguing that they go against what the guild is on strike for while some of those who have been given waivers have still decided to pause production and promotion of their projects out of solidarity.
SAG-AFTRA didn’t respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.
So what can be done?
Fans who call themselves the Blue Beetle Battalion are trying to make up the difference by posting about the movie. But supporters of the film and diverse representation in Hollywood still worry whether it will be enough.
“It’s incredibly difficult to market any property without talent that stakeholders know will resonate with the target audience,” said Terry. “It hurts because teams can’t access the road-tested [ways] of promotion. At the same time, it’s an opportunity. Promotional teams have to get incredibly creative with the assets that they have available at hand.”
She cites, as an example, how Universal, Interscope and Beats by Dre crafted a digital and social strategy that worked to fabulous effect on “Straight Outta Compton.” Terry argued it’s still too early to tell how the movie will fare.
“Instead of seeing ‘Blue Beetle’ as [an] example that showcase[s] the limits of BIPOC film marketing, these are spaces for opportunity and ingenuity, which, honestly, we thrive in,” she said.
And there is some upside to “Blue Beetle” that will pave the way for more diverse films regardless of how it fares.
“In spite of the inclusion movement, there is still, in my opinion, not enough work for a Latino actor to have the opportunity to receive health care and pension benefits,” the Latino SAG member said.
The days logged filming BIPOC projects like “Blue Beetle” will give more marginalized actors their SAG cards and fund their benefits. So while Maridueña may not be able to offer words in support of his movie, he’s already changing the numbers.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL2JsdWUtYmVldGxlLXVuZGVyZG9nLWJpcG9jLWZpbG1zLXN0cmlrZS1wcm9tb3Rpb24tcnVsZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-24 20:11:23+00:00,Latinos Resilient Amid Strike With “Blue Beetle”,"“When we get hit, we get stronger.” This single line from ""Blue Beetle"" encompasses an entire culture, celebrating Latinos' grit.","“When we get hit, we get stronger.” says Alberto Reyes in Blue Beetle. The patriarch of the Reyes family – played by Damián Alcázar (Alcapulco) – encompassed 99.9% of the Latino experience with a single sentence in a movie that is the first of its kind.
And mi gente, it got hit, again and again.
Primer Problem
The blows started with the captain of the Blue Beetle ship, director Ángel Manuel Soto. He took on Beetle and having begun the climb in Hollywood one hundred miles from the starting line – not unlike his fellow Latino gente. Soto’s first big project Charm City Kings was a king-sized success at the Sundance Film Festival in 2020 winning the U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Prize for ensemble acting. The film was bought and given a spring 2020 release date.
Then the pandemic hit.
Charm City Kings would find temporary housing at HBO Max. We say temporary because not only did HBO Max drop the “HBO” in its rebrand, but it also dropped the film from the platform. Blow number one.
Blue Beetle = Big Break
Blue Beetle is the first film under the new leadership of DC Studios. And it’s possible that was to Soto’s favor. New leadership + new(er) director = box office success. Theoretically at least. But, more importantly, Blue Beetle opened the doors for Latinos and signaled an opportunity not seen before – the first ever Latino-led superhero character. This in a generation where Latinos are not only under-represented on-screen but when called upon are cast by non-Latino artists.
So yes, Ángel Manuel Soto was carrying an entire culture and a heavier-than-normal lift on his Blue Beetle wings. That onus is certainly relatable for most Latinos, regardless of your occupation. Who among us hasn’t been tasked with a situation that is .1mm away from impossible?
Familiar Familial Foundation
So what is a director to do? Well, quite simply, you do what you know. And for Soto and the rest of us Latino movie lovers, Blue Beetle hatched with an unshakable foundation – family.
“We’ve been used to seeing Superheroes go solo or hide their superpowers,” said Ángel Manuel Soto earlier this year at Cinemacon. Soto knew Blue Beetle’s main man Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña/Cobra Kai) was going to be a superhero – whether he liked it or not. And he was going to make that transition with his family by his side. “His family has been with him through the entire process. Good luck hiding something from your Latina mother,” said Soto. “We wanted to make them feel like not only they were there, but they also help him get to the place to become the next superhero.”
And help they did. Beetle has some of the most prominent leading and up-and-coming Latino talent in entertainment. In fact, the cast reads like a phonebook in El Paso or Miami. Starring alongside Maridueña is the aforementioned Damián Alcázar, George Lopez (The George Lopez Show), Adriana Barraza (Rambo: Last Blood), Harvey Guillén (What We Do in The Shadows), Elpidia Carrillo (Mayans M.C.), and the ridiculously likable Belissa Escobedo (The Baker and The Beauty).
For those of you who – like a lot of beetles – have been in the dark, Blue Beetle is a coming-of-age story. Well, a superhero coming-of-age story that is. Jamie Reyes returns home after graduating college in search of a job only to discover that his family is in dire economic straits. But, an ancient alien technological marvel called the scarab fuses with Reyes, giving him unparalleled power not seen in the fictional Palermo City – or the real one for that matter. So, what is a beetle, blue or otherwise, supposed to do? Well, if you are a Latino, you lean on your family.
Together this family not only echoes the Latino experience, it highlights the diversity within our own community. Sure, there are elements most Latinos are familiar with. Among the crocheted blankets and novelas screaming from the TV are homes reminiscent of our own childhood. There are blessings by the abuelita and cactus in our yards. Honestly, this fictional superhero does a better job of making Latinos feel seen than most movies made from real life.
Same Difference
But, there are also differences inside the family such as citizen status, political beliefs, and economic levels of success. And that is where Blue Beetle flies above other Latino-led films. It’s a fact that we all know to our core, even though we are all the same, we are different. And that not only needs to be recognized but celebrated.
To take a line from Jamie Reyes, “this sh*t doesn’t get much better for us!” Just as Soto and the cast were beginning their big promotional push, Hollywood shut down, refusing to pay fairly the folks who write and bring to life films like Blue Beetle. Yes, I’m talking the WGA/SAG-AFTRA strike. Unable to take part in a red carpet or a press junket, the cast was left in the dark while Soto talked to anyone and everyone who would listen about the film. For those keeping count, that was hit number two.
Blue Beetle may have been down, but it was far from being exterminated. Latinos did what Latinos do. We support the gente. With the help of its family, the film prevailed. In fact, 27 different organizations came together to support the film with an open letter. Blue Beetle opened up number one at the box office. Officially it banked $25 million bucks, kicking Barbie out of the top spot for a second week in a row.
Turns out Latino-led projects in Hollywood are a good idea. And why shouldn’t they be? Us Latinos make up more than 25% of the box office sales (and 40% of Blue Beetle’s). It’s impossible to know how much more successful Blue Beetle would have been if the strike didn’t happen. But one thing is for sure: “When we get hit, we come back stronger.”
Blue Beetle is in theaters now and is rated PG13.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vbGF0aW5hbWVkaWEuY28vYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtcmVsZWFzZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

‘Oppenheimer’ tops worldwide chart for first time – boosted by Italy opening
UPDATE: Even since releasing into cinemas in late July, Universal’s Oppenheimer has trailed Warner Bros’ Barbie at the global box office. But now, in both films’ sixth week of release, Christopher Nolan’s nuclear tale has bested Greta Gerwig’s toy adaptation in a single weekend frame, topping the latest worldwide chart.
Oppenheimer grossed a confirmed $8.2m in North America, down 23% (and, like all titles, boosted by the $4 ticket prices on National Cinema Day on Sunday), plus $30.7m for international markets, down 27% in holdover territories. The cumulative totals are now respectively $299.2m and $478.7m, combining for $777.9m worldwide.
The international weekend number is boosted by the film belatedly opening in two fresh markets: Italy (grossing a confirmed $9.7m) and Greece ($882,000).
In Italy, Oppenheimer not only delivered the biggest ever opening for a Christopher Nolan film – the $9.7m five-day debut is more than double the opening of all previous Nolan films except The Dark Knight Rises (which Oppenheimer beat by a margin of 55%).
Oppenheimer enjoyed more than 70% market share in Italy, also delivering the biggest opening weekend ever in the territory for IMAX.
Oppenheimer is set for release in China this Wednesday (August 30) – and Nolan last week became the most prominent Hollywood director to visit the country in support of a film since the pandemic. There remain no confirmed release plans for Japan.
‘Barbie’ poised to become top film of 2023
UPDATE: With Oppenheimer moving up to the top spot in the worldwide chart, Barbie holds steady in second place, and the previous weekend’s chart champ – Chinese film No Bets – slides to third place.
Barbie added a confirmed $15.1m in North America plus a confirmed $19.6m for international (down 27% in holdover markets). Cumulative totals are respectively $594.8m and $747.6m, combining for a global total of $1.34bn.
The past week saw Barbie overtake The Super Mario Bros Movie to become the top film of 2023 at the North America box office – and it’s now poised to move past the Universal Illumination/Nintendo title’s $1.36bn worldwide total to become the biggest film this year globally.
Today (Monday) will see Barbie overtake Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2 to become the highest-grossing Warner Bros film ever globally. (This comparison is not adjusted for inflation.)
‘Gran Turismo’ expansion takes total to $54m
Following an early launch in 34 markets, Sony introduced Gran Turismo: Based On A True Story to North America (topping the chart with an estimated $17.3m, just ahead of Barbie), and also expanding the international footprint to 61 territories.
For international, Gran Turismo added an estimated $11.0m (dropping 28% in holdover markets), taking the total outside North America to $36.5m. These numbers combine to give a global total of $53.8m so far.
Latin America launched to an estimated $4.1m, including a chart-topping $2.2m for Mexico.
Neill Blomkamp directs the film, which is based on the true story of Nissan and Sony PlayStation recruiting world-class videogame players to train and compete to become professional racing drivers. Archie Madekwe stars as real-life gamer turned racing driver Jann Mardenborough, with David Harbour, Orlando Bloom and Djimon Hounsou in supporting roles.
Suitable box office comparisons for Gran Turismo are open to debate. Unlike Need For Speed (which grossed $203.3m in 2014), it’s not a fictional tale adapted from a racing videogame. Dramas drawn from real-life motor racing include Ford V Ferrari (2019, $225.5m) and Rush (2013, $97.0m).
Upcoming key markets for Gran Turismo include China (September 1), Japan (September 15), Italy and South Korea (both September 20).
‘Blue Beetle’ slides down global ranking
Despite the boost of National Cinema Day in both the US and Canada on Sunday, Warner Bros/DC Studios’ Blue Beetle fell a fairly hefty 49% from the opening weekend in North America – the biggest drop of any title in the top 10.
Blue Beetle grossed an estimated $12.8m in North America plus $10.0m in 71 international territories (down 52% in holdover markets). The comic-book adaptation opened in Middle East with an estimated $1.2m.
The film tells the story of the titular Mexican-American superhero, and has particular appeal in Latin markets. Top territories so far are Mexico ($4.0m) and Brazil ($4.2m), with UK/Ireland in third place ($3.5m).
The next markets to release are Australia and New Zealand on September 14.
Also for Warner Bros, Meg 2: The Trench added another estimated $20.3m globally to take its total to $352.5m. The sequel – which sees China’s Wu Jing star alongside the UK’s Jason Statham – is boosted by a strong showing in China, grossing $112.9m so far there (32% of the worldwide total).

2023-07-24 15:00:00+00:00,Michael Cieply: Great Movie Weekend. What Else Have You Got?,"As ""Barbie,"" ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Sound of Freedom"" sweep the box-office, viewers will be wondering what else have you got, Michael Cieply writes.","It was a magnificent movie weekend. Barbie, Oppenheimer, Sound of Freedom. All hits, a blowout!
So what else have you got?
The question sounds obnoxious, like its near-cousin, the always infuriating: “What have you done for me lately?”
But it’s an honest query, and an important one for a strike-bound, streaming-bent, pandemic-emergent industry that is still in need of revival.
The record-breaking weekend is a wonderful tonic, a welcome reminder that the audience, given half a chance, is still willing. But one weekend, even with the anticipated hold-over business from its hits, doesn’t mean a return to health.
That requires yet more watchable movies, lots of them, preferably offered in quick succession, while the viewers are showing an appetite. And those won’t be easy to come by in a Hollywood that has been shut down by dual strikes — raising the prospect of potential scheduling delays — and is already operating with perhaps a third fewer than the 900-plus theatrical films it released before the pandemic.
An old show business maxim says that “hits beget hits.” Tantalized by a film one week, a viewer is more likely to come back next week for something else. Before social media, the dynamic was driven by what producers and executives used to call “the wheel of movies” — just the right trailers attached to just the right hits, all of which kept the turnstiles turning.
Granted, there was a counter-theory. Some executives persistently argued that fewer films, and less competition, would mean more ticket sales for the lucky possessors of a major studio distribution slot. I can remember one competition-averse executive telling me — off the record, unfortunately — that his large studio had just acquired and closed a pesky, too-prolific indie distributor, because, in his words, “it was our turn to take one down.”
But those big guys were wrong, just as they were wrong about Betamax killing the movies. As we’ve learned in the backwash of the pandemic, fewer films means fewer ticket sales, and the audience, once turned off, takes an awful lot of wooing.
So with viewers looking in on Barbie, Oppenheimer, and, yes, Sound of Freedom, what can they hope to see next?
Strictly by the numbers, not nearly enough.
Relying on the fairly reliable Box Office Mojo counts, there appear to have been about 50 films in the theatrical marketplace each weekend this summer — a number that dropped by about half when the current hits sucked up screens last weekend.
Assuming that the choices re-inflate to about 50 in August, the available pictures will still number about half the late-summer count in 2018 and 2019.
Worse, the “wheel of movies” is missing its sturdiest spokes: tantalizing events like the trio that got things moving this weekend.
This isn’t to say that nothing can hit in the next month. It is foolhardy to judge the prospects of pictures you haven’t seen. But the scheduled wide releases between now and late August — Haunted Mansion? Gran Turismo? Blue Beetle? — are entirely different from the movies we just watched, and can’t count on Barbenheimer for momentum.
For long-term perspective, compare the present to 1999, when Week 25 in the movie calendar, the equivalent of last weekend, was dominated by Eyes Wide Shut and American Pie — like this year, one serious picture, one comic.
Each of the next five weekends found an average of 65 films in release, about one-third more than we’ll see this August. And on the “wheel” were a series of memorable pictures: Bowfinger, Mickey Blue Eyes, Runaway Bride, The Thomas Crown Affair, The Sixth Sense, The Iron Giant. Not all were major hits. But each did its bit to keep the audience involved.
That’s what a healthy business looks like. Great weekend notwithstanding, we’re not there yet.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvZ3JlYXQtbW92aWUtd2Vla2VuZC13aGF0LWVsc2UtaGF2ZS15b3UtZ290LWNvbW1lbnRhcnktbWljaGFlbC1jaWVwbHktMTIzNTQ0NjAxNS_SAXFodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3L2dyZWF0LW1vdmllLXdlZWtlbmQtd2hhdC1lbHNlLWhhdmUteW91LWdvdC1jb21tZW50YXJ5LW1pY2hhZWwtY2llcGx5LTEyMzU0NDYwMTUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-28 23:31:56+00:00,Box Office: $4 Ticket Day Boosts ‘Blue Beetle’ and ‘Ninja Turtles’,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and Blue Beetle were among those who saw the biggest boost from $4 tickets on Sunday.,"The results are in for the second annual National Cinema Day.
On Sunday, more than 3,000 theaters across the U.S. and Canada offered patrons the chance to see any movie in the theater, in any format, for only $4. That’s a huge discount, considering the average movie ticket price is at least $10.53, while the cost can be notably higher in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago. And if electing to see a film on a premium large format, including Imax, expect to pay $25 or more in some cinemas.
The Aug. 27 promotion resulted in 8.5 million moviegoers taking a trip to the cinema. That’s an uptick of 5 percent over the 8.1 million people who participated in last year’s National Cinema Day, which fell on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend. A major difference: Tickets were $3 last year.
According to Comscore, moviegoers aged 18-24 and 25-34 each made up 22 percent of the National Cinema Day audience, and the next-largest age group was 13-17 with 16 percent. Women turned out in slightly higher numbers than men, making up 52 percent of the audience.
Total revenue for this year’s National Cinema Day was $34 million, a gain of nearly 42 percent over 2022’s haul of $24 million, thanks in large part to ticket prices being raised to $4. Looking at other comps, Sunday revenue was up by 16 percent over the previous Sunday (Aug. 20). One unknown factor is how much the Sunday discount impacted Friday and Saturday attendance.
National Cinema Day is the brainchild of the Cinema Foundation, a nonprofit organization affiliated with the National Association of Theatre Owners. Jackie Brenneman, who was recently ousted as president of the Cinema Foundation and general counsel of NATO, led the effort.
In terms of general trends, films appealing to younger adults or families who are perhaps more mindful of their spending saw the biggest revenue boost from Saturday to Sunday, led by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and Blue Beetle at 37 percent and 32 percent, respectively. The R-rated raunchy canine comedy Strays also saw a hearty 25 percent boost.
Barbie led National Cinema Day in terms of sheer grosses with $5.7 million, followed by Blue Beetle ($5.5 million), Gran Turismo ($4.7 million), Mutant Mayhem ($3.3 million) and Oppenheimer ($2.7 million). Barbie was up 6 percent from Saturday to Sunday, while Gran Turismo saw a 12 percent day-over-day boost. Oppenheimer, which has a stronghold in terms of Imax screens, was down 21 percent day-over-day.
Consumers could choose from an array of other offerings timed to National Cinema Day, including The Super Mario Bros. Movie and The Little Mermaid Sing-Along, along with rereleases of such classics as Jurassic Park (3D), American Graffiti, Lady Bird and Oldboy.
“The positive response to National Cinema Day is just another reminder of how much people love going to the movie theater,” said Michael O’Leary, the newly installed president-CEO of NATO. “These numbers show us that the future of exhibition is strong, and that consumer enthusiasm for the theatrical experience continues unabated.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtMTIzNTU3NTc2MS_SAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3MvYm94LW9mZmljZS1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLWJsdWUtYmVldGxlLTEyMzU1NzU3NjEvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3
Focus Features
September 8, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $8M-$13M
Domestic Total Range: $24M-$43M
PROS:
My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 will court fans of the original films, primarily adult women, as a counter-programmer to other films in the market. The prior installment was a notable mid-range box office contributor back in 2016, drawing $59.7 million domestically and $92.1 million worldwide.
Favored to win the weekend, The Nun 2 will aim to continue capturing the success and popularity of Warner Bros.’ Conjuring franchise. The first Nun still owns the fourth highest September opening in history, pulling $53.8 million in 2018. Early tracking and trailer metrics are encouraging as the horror genre continues to index well with a variety of audiences.
The Nun 2
Warner Bros. Pictures
September 8, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $30M-$45M
Domestic Total Range: $70M-$97M
CONS:
Greek Wedding‘s target audience has been among the more challenging demographics to bring back to movie theaters in recent years. The prior sequel posted significantly lower returns than the 2002 sleeper blockbuster ($241.4 million domestic and $374.9 million global). With a projected audience breakdown of 75 percent women and at least 60 percent over the age of 40, early metric models are most comparable to recent films like Downton Abbey: A New Era and 80 for Brady.
Some regression is likewise expected for The Nun 2. The first film was severely frontloaded, earning a 2.18 multiple off its strong debut to finish with $117.5 million. Given the proliferation of the broader Conjuring franchise with three more chapters released since then, it’s safe to expect that not all of the first Nun‘s audience will return for this sequel.

2023-09-04 16:05:56+00:00,Box Office: Warning Signs Amid Summer’s Big Highs,"Studios banked on their franchise sequels, but it was original fare like Barbie and Oppenheimer that powered revenue past $4 billion.","In addition to the chaos of the strikes, Hollywood is facing a moment of reckoning after some of the costliest franchise installments in history were washed out to sea at the 2023 summer box office, while such original fare as Barbie and Oppenheimer created a surprise cultural tsunami.
A box office aficionado would have to go back years, if not decades, to find another summer where two of the five top-grossing movies in North America were fresh and original nonfranchise tentpoles. Greta Gerwig’s Barbie tops the 2023 season with a current domestic haul north of $600 million and more than $1.38 billion worldwide. The movie has shattered numerous records, including becoming the top-grossing movie in Warner Bros.’ history after passing up the final Harry Potter pic, not adjusted for inflation. And over Labor Day weekend, Barbie became the biggest film of the year to date at the global box office after eclipsing spring blockbuster The Super Mario Bros. Movie.
Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, from Universal, has earned more than $300 million domestically and north of $850 million globally to rank as the filmmaker’s biggest film behind the two Dark Knight superhero pics, among other honors. Then there’s Sound of Freedom, the indie movie about child trafficking that’s earned $182 million domestically after Utah-based Angel Studios tapped into its faith-based conservative audience.
Thanks in large part to the trio of very different films, summer domestic revenue has crossed $4 billion for the first time since the pandemic, according to Comscore. Final numbers for the season show revenue clocking in at $4.091 billion by the close of Labor Day weekend, a gain of 19.1 percent over 2022’s $3.434 billion and narrowing the gap from 2019’s $4.348 billion to 5.9 percent. “Without Barbie and Oppenheimer, we would be having a very different conversation. It would have been a rather mundane summer,” says Wall Street analyst Eric Handler of MKM Partners. Adds Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian, “Disruption comes in many forms, and the audience has spoken by their presence and absence for the movies released this summer.” (Before Barbenheimer, summer revenue was down 7 percent over 2022 and 15 percent behind 2019.)
Hollywood has reason to be rattled by the Barbenheimer phenomenon, which challenges the notion that established franchises rule above all else. “Has it changed the internal dialogue? You bet,” says one top studio executive. “I’ve been in at least three meetings where we’ve talked about how we need to look for something special. It’s scary because you have to make sure your convictions and instincts are right. It’s all about creating a critical mass. That was never the case before.”
Notes Warners domestic president of distribution Jeff Goldstein: “The world is different than it was pre-pandemic. The biggest difference is the amount of programming on streaming. In terms of theatrical, you need to be more original and have higher quality. There’s no ceiling and there’s no floor. You must be smart and take chances.”
While Barbie is based on an iconic IP, no one in Hollywood — including within Warners — knew whether Gerwig’s irreverent, feminist take would sync with audiences. And Oppenheimer, well, it’s a three-hour biographical drama. “It’s a great sign that audiences coming out of the pandemic are eager to come out and see original titles that captivate their imagination. We’ve all been discussing getting adult audiences back after the pandemic. Wow, did we ever just do that to an amazing degree,” says Universal president of domestic distribution Jim Orr of Oppenheimer‘s stunning results.
Heading into summer, analysts looking at the lineup this spring were focused on more traditional, all-audience tentpoles such as Harrison Ford’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One.
There was no sign of franchise trouble when Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 kicked off the summer on a high note — the superhero pic has grossed roughly $845.5 million globally, nearly on par with the sequel’s $863.7 million haul. And Sony’s animated Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse impressed as it soared to $688 million at the worldwide box office by Aug. 29, well ahead of the $384.2 million earned by Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.
But a disturbing trend developed. Fast X topped out at just $146 million domestically, the third-lowest showing of the series (though the film made up ground overseas with a huge $719 million). Then came DC’s June bomb, The Flash, which earned less than $268.5 million worldwide. One source says the biggest mistake Warners made was focusing on DC’s new era under James Gunn and Peter Safran. “It rendered the leftover titles in the DC stable uninteresting,” says the insider. (The more recent Blue Beetle is another example, although the family friendly movie is showing some staying power, earning north of $100 million globally through its third weekend.)
Disney and Lucasfilm’s Dial of Destiny was also a serious stumble, grossing just $381.1 million globally against a $300 million budget and badly trailing the $790.6 million brought in by 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Then came Dead Reckoning, which was perhaps the biggest psychic blow of the summer, considering Cruise had played a key role in box office recovery with 2022’s Top Gun: Maverick. The latest M:I film — likewise costing $300 million to produce before marketing — had earned $551.9 million worldwide by the end of August, the lowest showing of the series since 2006’s Mission: Impossible III, after opening a week ahead of Barbie and Oppenheimer.
Like numerous other summer tentpoles, the latest Mission: Impossible movie was hit hard by dramatically declining returns from the China box office, where Hollywood fare is struggling. Excluding China — and Russia — Dead Reckoning Part One is running on par, if not ahead of Mission: Impossible — Fallout, internationally. (Fallout grossed north of $181 million in China, versus roughly $47 million for Dead Reckoning.)
In late June, Cruise played the role of theatrical ambassador once again when urging moviegoers to support Oppenheimer and Barbie. (He likely never anticipated what was to follow).
One production executive says no amount of marketing money can replace what happens when a movie breaks out socially, as evidenced by Barbie and Oppenheimer. “It’s like catching lightning in a bottle,” he says.
The newly announced Taylor Swift concert pic The Eras Tour hopes to do just that, given her clout. The movie will play over the course of several weekends, beginning Oct. 13, and has already whipped up a record $26 million in advance sales for AMC Theatres in the first 24 hours after tickets became available for purchase. Exhibition sources believe the concert pic could earn north of $100 million in its first weekend alone, and perhaps ultimately $150 million.
Studio executives say cost control is a new imperative after this summer. “You have to figure out how to make movies at a reasonable price, and then pick those movies that you want to take a big swing at,” says another top studio executive. Adds another veteran studio source: “This has always been a speculative, volatile business, but the big [budget] movies are bigger than ever. It’s a killer when they don’t work.”
Paramount spent a relatively modest $70 million to make its August family pic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which has grossed north of $153 million to date and, according to studio insiders, has successfully relaunched the franchise. In regards to the family marketplace, other summer highlights — led, of course by Across the Spider-Verse — included The Little Mermaid, which came in No. 5 on the domestic summer chart with north of $297 million, one of the best showings for a Disney live-action remake (its global earnings are more than $569 million).
Pixar and Disney’s Elemental was a win in terms of overcoming a soft opening and enjoying strong legs to gross north of $478 million to date at the worldwide box office, but its pricey production budget of at least $200 million makes a financial victory difficult.
Disney and its stable of marquee film stables, including Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm, continues to lead in terms of sheer marketshare, and was the only major studio whose summer ticket sales crossed the $1 billion threshold in North America. Marketshare has little to do with profitability — as Sony movie chief Tom Rothman is fond of saying — and Disney has certainly taken its lumps this summer but is proud of its overall contribution to the $4 billion victory.
“It is terrific to see the overall summer box office coming in close to pre-pandemic levels as moviegoers from all audiences once again embrace a robust and diverse slate of titles,” says Disney global distribution chief Tony Chambers. “And all of this despite a number of titles across all studios possibly not delivering to the levels that we all had originally hoped and expected.”

Summer Scorecard: What Worked
Sound of Freedom The indie film from Angel Studios arrived out of nowhere to earn north of $180 million domestically, putting it at No. 6 on the list of top-grossing summer films, ahead of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and the latest Mission: Impossible feature.
Barbie Greta Gerwig’s fresh, feminist take on the doll came in 187 percent ahead of the previous record-holder for a toy-to-movie adaptation (The Lego Movie). That’s on top of other records Gerwig smashed, including the top-grossing solo female director of all time. “Nobody could have guessed what Barbie would turn out to be,” says Goldstein. “Audiences will tell your clearly what they like and what they don’t like.
Oppenheimer No one could have foreseen that this three-hour biopic would become Christopher Nolan’s biggest film in more than 50 overseas markets when factoring in current exchange rates and excluding unreleased territories. (It’s No. 3 in North America, behind the final two Dark Knight films. “Oppenheimer has been phenomenally strong overseas. And what’s particularly interesting is that it’s the biggest Nolan film of all time in more than 50 territories, representing a cross section of different cultures and tastes in upmarket and downmarket territories alike,” says Universal president of international distribution Veronika Kwan Vandenberg.
What Didn’t
The Haunted Mansion The movie, with a global haul of $100 million through Labor Day, marks the second-lowest-grossing title in Disney’s stable of theme park rides or attractions adapted for the big screen behind 2002’s The Country Bears ($18 million), not adjusted for inflation.
The Flash It was a total flameout, grossing less than $270 million worldwide, behind even last year’s superhero disappointment Black Adam. And DC’s other summer entry, Blue Beetle, is the lowest-grossing title in the DC Extended Universe, with less than $85 million. Ouch.
R-Rated Comedies So much for the return of the raunchy comedy. The Jennifer Lawrence starrer No Hard Feelings topped out at $50.5 million domestically against a $45 million production budget, followed by $21.5 million to date for the canine romp Strays and less than $13 million for Joy Ride.

2023-07-26 14:21:12+00:00,James Gunn's First DCU Movie Expected to Lose Millions - Inside the Magic,"The first DCU movie that will be released under James Gunn is projected to be a major flop, which won't help the case for the franchise.","The DCU might be off to a rough start under the leadership of James Gunn, as he has constantly had to deal with blowback for films that he was not even responsible for. He took over long after The Flash was in development, but the film flopping at the box office will likely be tied to Gunn, which could cause significant issues with his own releases. His first DCU release is already projected to be a flop.

DC has been a mess for many years, going back to when Zack Snyder was all but running the show and building out his SnyderVerse. The issue with DC films has always been about continuity. Instead of trying to play catch up to Marvel, DC should have been building out its solo hero movies before creating the Justice League.
Despite what people may think about it, Man of Steel (2013) was a perfect jumping-off point for the SnyderVerse, which was ruined when DC forced the Justice League team up after the success of the first Avengers film that the MCU made. It has been tough to be a DC fan simply because the live-action efforts have paled compared to what Marvel has been accomplishing for the better part of 15 years.
DC has had some successes, but mostly with solo Batman films. Batman has always been the darling of DC, and that could be because every creator comes to the Dark Knight with a brand-new take. The rest of the DC Universe has not been given the proper tools to succeed, and it appears that the first big DCU reset film will sadly join the long list of DC flops.
James Gunn DCU ‘Blue Beetle’ Projected to Flop
James Gunn will have to sit around and wait for the passing of films he has not directly worked on, as Blue Beetle and Aquaman 2 are the final films on the DC calendar that were in production before Gunn took over. Aquaman 2 is still part of the DCEU, but Blue Beetle is considered the “first DCU hero,” according to Gunn.
Based on a report by Box Office Pro, Blue Beetle is projected to make somewhere in the $12 to $17 million range in its opening weekend. That number will only rise to around $27 to $55 million for domestic box office projections.
These numbers were likely devised based on how films generally face significant drop-offs in numbers as the weeks progress, which is certainly what happened to The Flash and Shazam 2. The good news is that Blue Beetle has a reported budget of $12o million, making it the third-lowest of the entire DC franchise.
These are also domestic projections; the film could find its wings (pun intended) in international markets. That will likely not be the case, but the hope is certainly there.
DC fans have long longed for tangible continuity, which has not been the case for DC films over the last 15 years. James Gunn is now running the show for the DC Films division of Warner Bros. Discovery, and the hope is that he can pull the company out of mediocrity.

Blue Beetle could still shock the world and become an underground hit, though it might be collateral damage next to the box office disasters that The Flash and Shazam 2 were. Everyone must be patient and wait for Gunn’s Superman: Legacy to arrive, hopefully bringing a cohesive plan to the rest of the DC Universe.

,'Oppenheimer' Becomes Third Biggest Movie of 2023 at Global Box Office,"'Oppenheimer' has officially surpassed 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' at the global box office, making Christopher Nolan's new movie the third-highest grossing film of 2023 across the world","Oppenheimer has hit another box office milestone.
As of Thursday, Box Office Mojo counts Christopher Nolan's latest movie — a biopic centered around American theoretical physicist and Manhattan Project scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer — as the third highest-grossing movie of the year at the global box office.
The World War II-focused drama has now grossed $854 million worldwide, surpassing Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3's total, which sits at $845.5 million across the world. The only two films that have made more money globally so far this year are Barbie and The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which have each grossed more than $1 billion worldwide.
In North America, Oppenheimer remains this year's fifth-highest grossing movie. Barbie and Super Mario Bros. are also on top at the domestic box office, with Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and the end Marvel Studios' Guardians trilogy standing in third and fourth place, respectively.
Oppenheimer has made $311.2 million domestically and $542.8 million at the international box office. Without adjusting for inflation, the movie is 53-year-old Nolan's biggest box office hit worldwide since 2012's The Dark Knight Rises, which did cross the $1 billion mark globally.

Oppenheimer and Barbie notably both opened in theaters on July 21, creating the fan-driven ""Barbenheimer"" box office phenomenon that resulted in the best single weekend at the box office so far this year, per Box Office Mojo. Oppenheimer opened to $82.4 million and helped boost the nation's largest movie theater chain, AMC Theatres, to the most revenue made from admissions in a single week in the company's entire history.
After those films' outstanding opening weekend, outlets like Variety reported that July 21-23 was the highest collective opening weekend for the domestic box office since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

Oppenheimer stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, while Emily Blunt portrays his wife Kitty. Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett and David Krumholtz also play significant roles in the film among an ensemble cast that also includes Kenneth Branagh, Bennie Safdie, Josh Peck and Jack Quaid, among others.



The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin.

2023-08-18 16:10:27+00:00,Box Office Mayhem: Starless Publicity Campaigns Start to Impact Grosses,"Movies could see grosses slashed by 15 percent as talent sits on the sidelines. ""Nada. Zero,"" laments one Hollywood studio marketing executive.","The scene on the Paramount lot on a warm Saturday afternoon late in July was unusual — to say the least — as the studio threw what was essentially a premiere for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem without the film’s star-studded voice cast. Instead, director Jeff Rowe had to man the green carpet on his own at what was billed as a special family screening.

Across Hollywood, marketers are having to scrap media tours amid the dual Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes, with guilds forbidding their members from promoting any movie from a struck company.

Now, the box office is feeling the impact as films open without the full participation of stars and writers. Several studio sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that a movie’s earnings at the box office could be hurt by as much as 15 percent because of the dramatic falloff in talent-driven publicity.

Turtles’ voice cast alone includes Ayo Edebiri, Maya Rudolph, Seth Rogen, John Cena, Rose Byrne, Natasia Demetriou, Giancarlo Esposito, Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Paul Rudd and Post Malone.

The new TMNT faced a double whammy, since Rogen is also one of the film’s writers and has been unable to bank any press since the writers strike commenced more than 100 days ago. “It was bizarre,” says one source close to the movie of the July 29 screening. “Can you imagine what the group photo [of stars] would have been like on the carpet?”

Turtles, which debuted Aug. 2, a Wednesday, posted a respectable five-day domestic opening of $43.1 million. In terms of sheer dollars, insiders believe the movie will take a hit of $7 million to $10 million because of the publicity restrictions.

Universal’s R-rated comedy Strays, about a pack of raunchy dogs, and DC’s Blue Beetle both open during the Aug. 18-20 weekend and will be observed closely to see how they perform. Strays’ high-wattage voice cast includes Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Will Forte, Isla Fisher, Randall Park, Josh Gad and Sofía Vergara.

A top marketing executive at another studio notes that no amount of paid advertising can make up for the kind of awareness a star can ignite if a personal social media post, interview or other promotional bit, goes viral. “Not having stars to do publicity for your movies is a huge detriment to the overall campaign,” says the exec. “You lose the cultural impact of having talent talk about the film. Some movies wouldn’t have worked anyway, but they had more of a shot.”

There are dozens of films set to open between now and the end of the year. Some studios have already made changes to their release calendars because of the publicity deficit, such as Sony, which delayed the early August release of Gran Turismo, whose cast includes Orlando Bloom and David Harbour, in order to build buzz by first holding sneaks over two weekends.

On the awards front, MGM pushed back the September release of Luca Guadagnino’s awards hopeful Challengers, starring Zendaya, to 2024 (the sports drama had been slotted to open the Venice Film Festival, but pulled out).

Zendaya — who has a huge reach on social media — also stars in Denis Villeneuve’s upcoming event pic Dune: Part 2, which, as of now, is set to open Nov. 3 in North America timed to its global rollout. But that could easily change, since Legendary is said to be insistent on a full press tour by the cast, which also includes Timothée Chalamet and Austin Butler.

Legendary and studio partner Warner Bros. will need to make a decision soon regarding Dune 2, since the marketing and publicity campaign needs to ramp up in earnest by early September.

Like Zendaya had been, Chalamet is on double duty this year. In addition to Dune 2, he plays the lead in Warner Bros.’ Christmas tentpole Wonka. Insiders say Warners and other studios are loath to push back movies wholesale considering theatrical is still in the midst of recovering from the pandemic, which leveled the box office. At the same time, there is no denying the risk of staying the course if the strikes aren’t resolved. (Barbie and Oppenheimer, which have been a boon for moviegoing, were all but done with their publicity campaigns before SAG-AFTRA went on strike.)

“The inability of stars to actively participate in the promotion of their films has definitely set the industry on edge,” says box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian of Comscore. “While the box office impact is difficult to quantify with mathematical certainty, there is no question that this time-honored tradition has value.”

2023-09-13 18:42:47+00:00,Weekend Box Office Forecast: A HAUNTING IN VENICE,"September's slate of sequels rolls on with the third frame of the month offering up the third installment of Kenneth Branagh's series of Agatha Christie adaptations, while other market holdovers hope to carry their weight.","© 2023 20th Century Studios.

September’s slate of sequels rolls on with the third frame of the month offering up the third installment of Kenneth Branagh’s series of Agatha Christie adaptations, while other market holdovers hope to carry their weight.

A HAUNTING IN VENICE

20th Century Studios

September 15, 2023 (WIDE)

Opening Weekend Range: $14M-$19M

PROS:

The return of Branagh both in front of and behind the camera is a motivating factor for fans of Murder on the Orient Express (2017) and Death on the Nile (2022), as is the casting of another star-driven ensemble cast for A Haunting in Venice.

Venice‘s lean into supernatural and horror elements could help the film reach beyond the typically older female-driven audience of the prior Christie adaptations, especially as Halloween season takes hold.

Pre-sale trends are encouraging for the most part with models ahead of last weekend’s My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 and Death on the Nile itself.

CONS:

While deflated by Super Bowl weekend and the late stages of Covid-19’s impact on audience sentiment in early 2022, Nile‘s $12.9 million domestic start declined 55 percent from Orient Express‘ $28.7 million debut.

As a contrast to Venice‘s potential audience expansion compared to Nile, it could be argued that the horror lean for this sequel may be counteracted by existing competition for younger genre fans vis-à-vis The Nun II‘s second frame (though that film itself is likely to see a sharp decline).

Current projection ranges call for a 31% increase from the comparable weekend’s top ten aggregate of $43.05 million in 2022 and a 42% decrease from 2019’s $97 million frame.

2023-09-16 15:35:59+00:00,‘Oppenheimer’ Crosses $900M At Global Box Office; Universal Tops $4B WW In 2023,"In its latest milestone, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer has passed the $900M mark worldwide.","L to R: Robert Downey Jr is Lewis Strauss and Cillian Murphy is J. Robert Oppenheimer in OPPENHEIMER, written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan.

In its latest milestone, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer has passed the $900M mark worldwide. The estimated total through Friday is $903M, including $586M from the international box office. With Saturday and Sunday numbers, that global cume is projected to reach $912M. This will make it the highest grossing biopic ever at the global box office, ahead of Bohemian Rhapsody.

Oppenheimer is expected to gross $10M from 83 offshore markets this session, reaching $593M through Sunday. It is the biggest Nolan film of all time at the international box office when restated to today’s dollars.

The Universal title is already the No. 3 movie of the year globally and internationally (behind only Barbie and The Super Mario Bros Movie). Topping the nine-century benchmark is an astounding feat for a three-hour R-rated drama.

This is Nolan’s third-biggest film ever globally, behind The Dark Knight Rises and The Dark Knight. Overseas, it is Nolan’s second-biggest in reported grosses behind just TDKR. Also offshore, Oppenheimer is now Nolan’s highest-grossing film in 64 markets, including the UK where it has now surpassed Dunkirk.

Led by Cillian Murphy, the film boasts a stellar cast including Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Benny Safdie, Gary Oldman and Jason Clarke among many others.

It began overseas rollout on July 19 with domestic joining on July 21. Since then, it has enjoyed massive play. Last weekend, its eighth in release, saw a drop of 52% as summer drew to a close in many markets.

Oppenheimer’s Top Five offshore markets through Friday are the UK ($72.6M), China ($50M), Germany ($47.5M), France ($41.3M) and Australia ($26.2M).

Also, big hat tip here to Universal which has now crossed $4B at the global box office, only the second studio to the milestone in 2023. It is also only the third time any studio has reached the mark since 2019 and the fourth time Universal has passed $4B (2015, 2017, 2018, 2023).

Universal has released three of the top five films this year globally to date. Oppenheimer is the studio’s 12th biggest movie ever worldwide and its biggest non-franchise film of all time.

Internationally, Uni has released three of the top four films this year. Oppenheimer is the 11th biggest Uni title of all time overseas.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA5L29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLW1pbGVzdG9uZS05MDAtbWlsbGlvbi1nbG9iYWwtYm94LW9mZmljZS1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi1jaWxsaWFuLW11cnBoeS11bml2ZXJzYWwtMTIzNTU0ODU0MS_SAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wOS9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1taWxlc3RvbmUtOTAwLW1pbGxpb24tZ2xvYmFsLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItbm9sYW4tY2lsbGlhbi1tdXJwaHktdW5pdmVyc2FsLTEyMzU1NDg1NDEvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

This week’s update brings summer to a close and takes an early look at the start of fall movie season, with Sony’s The Equalizer 3 slated to release over Labor Day weekend.

The Equalizer 3

Sony Pictures

September 1, 2023 (WIDE)

Opening Weekend Range: $25M-$32M

Domestic Total Range: $65M-$88M

PROS:

Prior Equalizer installments have performed well, earning nearly identical box office openings ($34.1 million in 2014 and $36 million in 2018) as well as final totals ($101.5 million and $102.1 million domestically; $192.9 million and $190.4 million globally).

The return of Denzel Washington should bring back much of the target audience, which skews heavily male. 2018’s The Equalizer 2 drew 58 percent men and 68 percent over the age of 25 during its midsummer debut.

Early forecast models are comparable to those of 2019’s Angel Has Fallen and ahead of Rambo: Last Blood.

CONS:

With another five-year gap between installments, this is the kind of sequel that could be impacted by the recent trend of aging franchises seeing diminishing returns in tandem with changing consumer habits.

Labor Day weekend is not historically a major moviegoing frame, with the exception of 2021 when Marvel Studios launched Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.

Staying power could be challenged by the likes of A Haunting of Venice, Expend4ables, and The Creator during Equalizer 3‘s chase weeks.

Director Gareth Edwards (2016’s Rogue One: A Star Wars Story $533.5M domestic/$1 billion global, 2014’s Godzilla $200.6M domestic/$524.9M global) brings a new science-fiction epic to the screen with The Creator. His first feature since Rogue One, The Creator is set amidst a future war between the human race and a topic that’s currently making headlines–artificial intelligence. Joshua (John David Washington), a hardened ex-special forces agent grieving the disappearance of his wife (Gemma Chan), is recruited to hunt down and kill the ‘Creator’, the architect behind the advanced AI, who has developed a mysterious weapon with the power to end the war and life itself (September 29th).

Blue Beetle launches a new DC superhero, the first DCU character in the new universe, according to DC Studios Co-CEO James Gunn. Recent college grad Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) returns home full of aspirations for his future. As he searches to find his purpose in life, fate intervenes when an ancient scarab chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, bestowing him with an incredible suit of armor and forever changing his destiny (August 18th). The DC Universe’s most recent entry, The Flash, currently stands at $106.9M as of Monday.

Director Alexander Payne (Downsizing $24.4M domestic/$55M global, Nebraska $17.6M domestic/$27.6M global), returns to cinemas with his first film since 2017. The Holdovers follows a curmudgeon (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who is forced to remain on campus during Christmas break to watch troublemaker (Dominic Sessa), who has nowhere to go for the holidays. Da’Vine Joy Randolph co-stars as the school’s head cook, who has just lost her son in Vietnam. The film arrives in select theaters on October 27th, before opening wide on November 10th.

Sophie Barthes (2014’s Madame Bovary $44K domestic/$658K gobal) helms The Pod Generation, in which a New York couple (Emilia Clarke and Chiwetel Ejiofor) in the not-so-distant future suddenly enter parenthood after landing a coveted spot at the Womb Center, which offers detachable, artificial wombs called ‘pods’ (August 11th).

2023-08-15 13:28:25+00:00,Blue Beetle Burger King Meme: Is the Blue Whopper Real or Fake?,"Here are the details about the Blue Beetle Burger King meme. For those wondering if the blue Whopper is real or fake, here's the info.","The Blue Beetle Burger King meme has been doing the rounds across social media and forums like Reddit. The blue Burger, which swaps the normal burger bun for a blue version, is gaining traction for its revolting appearance.

Is the Blue Beetle burger real?

No, the Blue Beetle burger is not real. Burger King is not selling a Blue Beetle burger.

While the image of the burger looks convincing, especially when you consider the trendy charcoal burger buns that are now available. Turning a burger bun blue doesn’t seem so outlandish in this day and age. But no, the Blue Beetle burger is not real and you can’t buy one from Burger King.

What is the Blue Beetle Burger King meme?

The Blue Beetle Burger King meme takes the image of a standard Whopper and turns the bun blue. This is the Blue Beetle burger: a blue Whopper.

The image of the blue burger was posted on Twitter by @NebsGoodTakes alongside the caption:

“Available nationwide starting July 17, Burger King guests can summon the power of the Scarab with the Blue Beetle Whopper.”

As convincing as the image might be, it’s simply a meme. Burger King is not selling a blue-colored burger in order to promote Blue Beetle. Despite this, the image has gained traction on TikTok, which has probably helped increase awareness of the movie.

Should fake burgers like this continue to blow up online, it’s very possible that we will see fast food chains embracing the hype and working to create more limited edition themed burgers, pizzas, and other food items to help promote movies and TV shows.

‘Blue Beetle’ Director Encourages Audiences To Go To Theaters By Claiming A Green Beam In The Movie’s Title Sequence Is Green Lantern

Xolo Maridueña as Blue Beetle in Blue Beetle (2023), DC Studios

Blue Beetle director Angel Manuel Soto appears to have resorted to desperation in order to convince potential moviegoers to see the movie in theaters.

Speaking with Heroic Hollywood, Soto tried to encourage viewers to go see the film multiple times by promising them they will discover hidden Easter eggs.

He said, “There are a lot of Easter Eggs. I always say, if you watch it a second time, or even three times, you’re gonna find different Easter Eggs every single time, because they’re very minimal.”

Specifically, he claimed a green beam seen in the title sequence is Green Lantern, “Do you notice the green beam in the title sequence? That’s the Green Lantern. See? You’ll have to see it again!”

Heroic Hollywood also reports that Soto also attempted to tease the possibility that the film’s story might continue by telling them, “Get ready for Black Beetle.”

Soto previously attempted this tactic to no avail in the leadup to the film’s release when he claimed he had an entire trilogy planned. He told Total Film, “Our first movie, the way we wanted to do it, was always with the mentality that we wanted to do two more, at least. And taking the traditional three-act structure of a story, we wanted our first movie to practically be the first act of a saga.”

He would elaborate on the plans for the second film with The Playlist informing the outlet, “Blue Beetle [the first film] is Jamie’s story. We wanted to focus on him and his family. By the end of the movie, there will be questions about the scarab, and I hope to answer them. For the next film, I hope to tell the whole story of what happened to the scarab, where he comes from, why he was sent, and hopefully in the end, who they have to defeat.”

As for the idea that there were Easter Eggs, Soto previously confirmed the movie featured references to Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel.

Speaking with Nestor Cine, he said, “In Blue Beetle there are some references to Man of Steel that we made out of honor and respect for the work and art of Zack Snyder.”

None of this drove people to the theaters as Blue Beetle became the second worst opening for a DC film ever. The film only grossed $25 million at domestic box office and another $18.6 million internationally for a global gross of $43.6 million.

The only DC film that Blue Beetle best in its opening weekend was Wonder Woman 1984 which released on HBO Max the same day it arrived in theaters. The film grossed $16.7 million in its opening weekend back in December 2020 when the country was still coming out of the government-induced fears of Covid-19 that led to widespread lockdowns and shuttering of theaters.

While none of Soto’s ploys worked to drive people to theaters, Warner Bros. did place the blame on Hurricane Hilary for keeping people from seeing it in California.

As reported by Exhibitor Relations. Warner Bros. informed them, “The storm’s impact is anticipated to be significant, particularly in Southern California where the film is over-indexing.”

What do you make of Soto trying to claim a green beam in the film’s title sequence is a Green Lantern Easter egg?

Angel Manuel Soto Doubles Down On Promoting ‘Blue Beetle’ With Identity Politics, Questions If It Was Possible To Have A Latino Superhero On A Times Square Billboard

Xolo Maridueña as Blue Beetle in Blue Beetle (2023), Warner Bros. Pictures

Angel Manuel Soto, the director of Blue Beetle, continued to market the film through identity politics by recently questioning if it was possible to have a Latino superhero on Times Square billboard.

Speaking with TheWrap, Soto stated, “I’m very happy that finally we’re able to see how the whole promotion is being manifested.”

He then specifically pointed to the film’s promotion in Times Square in New York City, “Us seeing a Latino superhero of our own in Times Square is something that, if were think about it, is that even possible? Now it’s happening!”

Soto continued, “Being able to not only be promoted in the areas where our community transmits, but to also be up there with the other big posters and the big movies just shows you the power that we have and that we can also be the heroes that we know we can be.”

RELATED: Bane Creator Graham Nolan Reacts To ‘Blue Beetle’ Director Claiming The Character Represents American Interventionism In Latin America

To no one’s surprise, Soto’s comments are completely devoid from reality in an attempt to paint the Latino community as some kind of victims who are unable to get advertisements on Times Square billboards.

Just how devoid from reality are they? In 2022, Marvel Studios promoted Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and their race replaced Namor with huge billboards in Times Square. Actor Tenoch Huerta even shared the billboards to his Twitter account.

Outside of superheroes, The Walt Disney Company purchased Times Square billboards in 2021 to promote their West Side Story film, which features the Puerto Rican gang the Sharks who vie for dominance against the white gang, the Jets.

One Twitter user back in December 2021 shared an image of the West Side Story promotion on the New York Marriot Marquis, which is located in Times Square.

RELATED: Report: ‘Blue Beetle’ To Feature Illegal Immigration Allegory

This isn’t the first time Soto attempted to use identity politics to promote the film. The director confirmed the film features an illegal immigration allegory.

The outlet MovieMaker detailed, “Before the movie begins, the family has immigrated to America from Mexico, but [Jamie Reyes’ father] Alberto doesn’t have documentation, so he’s under the constant threat of deportation.”

“Though the film doesn’t depict an ICE raid, it does include a scene that echoes one,” MovieMaker added. “Kord Industries invades the family’s home in a scene that can play as just another dramatic moment in a superhero movie – or be taken as symbolic of events that tear apart real families.”

Soto confirmed this scene in the film does indeed exist and that it’s an allegory for illegal immigration. He told MovieMaker, “There is a history that exists before an ICE raid. A history that includes traveling miles, and danger, working hard, becoming a family, creating memories, and thinking that everything is going to be okay.”

“But all of a sudden, everything that you have fought for, everything that you have worked for, everything that you have built, is now burning. I needed the depiction to be triggering, because it’s the experience of many,” he continued.

RELATED: ‘Blue Beetle’ Actress Susan Sarandon Reveals Her Character Is The “White Military Industrial Complex” Bad Guy

The scene likely includes a racial context given Susan Sarandon previously described her Victoria Kord charcter as the “white military industrial complex” in an interview with Jimmy Fallon in September 2022.

Sarandon stated, “What’s fabulous about [Blue Beetle] is it’s the first Latinx hero that has his own movie. Even better all of the Mexican — because his family is Mexican and all the actors were Mexican and it’s in Spanish so it’s subtitled.””

Sarandon then shared, “I’m, of course, the bad guy. I’m the white military industrial complex.”

“So I had a fabulous time because there’s nothing better than being bad,” she added.

RELATED: ‘Blue Beetle’ Director Says DC Villain Bane Represents The “Unknown Or Forgotten Or Brushed Under The Rug History Of Interventionism In Latin America And The Caribbean”

Soto also detailed that the film’s supervillain Carapax is a representation of interventionism in Latin America and the Caribbean.

He told The Playlist, that he sees the character of Bane in this regard, but did not know on whether he would get to work on the character so he took his ideas for Bane and applied them to Blue Beetle’s Carapax.

First, Soto explained his ideas for Bane, “As far as Bane goes, the comics that are about Bane’s story, it felt like he’s very misunderstood much like Carapax in the movie. He is a product of his environment and that history has been buried. The history of the Caribbean, the Antilles. It’s a history that’s brushed off in history books.”

“So for me, it was very important to be seen,” he continued. “And with the character of Bane, the formation of this villain, I think in his own right, he’s also a hero in his story. So whether whatever happens at the end that might have gotten distorted because of what was done to him, I think that what he represents is a lot of the unknown, or forgotten, or brushed under the rug history of interventionism in Latin America and the Caribbean.”

He later revealed he took what he viewed as Bane’s backstory and grafted it on to Carapax in the Blue Beetle film, “But while working on the character of Carapax, I was like, ‘Well, I don’t know if I’ll ever make a Bane movie. Let me take what I loved about Bane, about the backstory that I wanted to explore and let’s give it to Carapax.’ Because part of the idea was that maybe Carapax and Bane came from the same place. Maybe!? I mean Pago Island, right?”

Soto then explained the importance of taking his perceived version of Bane’s backstory and applying it to Carapax, “Because we need it. When we’re introduced to the world in movies, right, where we are seen as villains, it’s just given that we are born that way.”

“And when we talk about the history of Latin America, nobody dares to question, well, what happened before. Okay, well what happened before? More times than none when you go back even before 1954, but if we want to go to 1954 in Guatemala it was U.S. interventionism that drove these places to the miseries that they’re in.”

RELATED: ‘Blue Beetle’ Actor Xolo Maridueña Says Goal Of Film Is To Tell People That Hispanics Can Be Superheroes

It’s quite likely that Soto’s constant promotion of the film through identity politics and victimhood status is turning moviegoers away from the film. According to Box Office Pro’s latest projections the film is only expected to have an opening weekend between $20 million and $27 million domestically. The outlet also believes the film will only gross between $45 million and $87 million in its entire domestic run.

These predictions are a significant increase from Box Office Pro’s original long-range predictions. The outlet originally predicted the movie would bring in between $12 million and $17 million in its domestic opening weekend and only $27 million and $55 million in its entire domestic run.

However, these new numbers are still very bad given the film has an estimated production budget of $120 million. That means the movie needs to make at least $300 million globally to break even.

What do you make of Soto questioning if it was possible to have a Latino superhero or character on a Times Square billboard in New York City? What do you make of his constant promotion of this film through identity politics and victimhood?

2023-09-02 14:56:00+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Equalizer 3’ Balances Out $13.1 Million Opening Day, Aims for Second-Biggest Labor Day Debut Ever","""The Equalizer 3,"" the third entry in the Denzel Washington action series, is targeting the second-biggest Labor Day weekend opening ever.","Denzel Washington’s “The Equalizer 3” is showing some box office virtuosity, taking flight in its domestic debut after grossing $13.1 million on opening day from 3,241 venues. That includes $3.8 million in Thursday previews, boosted by showtimes in premium large format auditoriums.

The third and ostensibly final entry in Sony’s action series is gunning for the second-highest Labor Day weekend opening in history. The holiday isn’t typically a boon for box office, though Marvel’s “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” set a record two years ago with a $94.6 million four-day opening. “Equalizer 3” won’t reach those heights, but it’s contending against the runner-up for the record — Rob Zombie’s “Halloween” remake, which stabbed into $30 million in 2007. After Friday, the new vigilante film, co-financed by Sony, TSG and Eagle Pictures, is projecting a four-day opening north of $42 million.

Those numbers show that Washington is one of the few names in entertainment that can still open a film in theaters without the boost of intellectual property (though “The Equalizer” series represents the actor’s only sequels in his career). The projected debut shows some box office déjà vu, landing in the same ballpark as the two previous “Equalizer” entries. The 2015 original landed $34 million in a traditional three-day frame, while the 2018 sequel had a light uptick with $36 million. Both films eventually crossed $100 million in North America and neared $200 million worldwide.

With a production budget of $70 million, “Equalizer 3” will look to put together a similar performance over the coming weeks. Reviews have been mostly warm, with a series-high 79% approval rating from top critics on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes. And the film has got game with audiences, as indicated by its glowing “A” grade on Cinema Score.

Antoine Fuqua returns to direct the entry after helming the first two installments. “Equalizer 3” sees Washington return as ex-Marine Robert McCall, this time working to free friends from the Italian mafia. Washington reunites with his “Man on Fire” co-star Dakota Fanning, while David Denman, Sonia Ammar and Remo Girone round out the cast.

After preview grosses helped boost “Gran Turismo” to the strange achievement of a No. 1 opening without it ever actually being the top grosser on last Friday, Saturday or Sunday, the Sony release is now projecting $6.55 million over the three-day frame, which would mark a 62% fall from its debut. That’d be good for fourth place on domestic charts, falling behind “Barbie” and “Blue Beetle,” two Warner Bros. releases. That’s not exactly a dazzling hold for a film with a strong Cinema Score, a $60 million production budget and homegrown Sony PlayStation IP. The domestic total should reach around $30 million through the end of Labor Day.

“Barbie” looks to take silver in its seventh weekend in theaters. The comedy earned $2.5 million on Friday, down only 38% from its previous outing. This morning, the Warner Bros. release officially surpassed “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” to become the highest-grossing global release of the year with $1.36 billion and counting.

Warner Bros. should also secure bronze over the four-day frame, as “Blue Beetle” earned $1.52 million on Friday, tallying a 42% drop from its second Friday. After a disappointing opening that came in behind projections, the superhero film has certainly held better than its DC Studios peers from this year, “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” and “The Flash.” But with only $50 million in North American ticket sales, “Blue Beetle” likely won’t be able to justify its production budget north of $100 million.

Rounding out the top five, Universal’s “Oppenheimer” is projecting $5.38 million over the three-day frame for another modest drop (-35%). The Christopher Nolan epic will push to $310 million domestically and $850 million worldwide through Monday.

Expanding this weekend, MGM’s queer comedy “Bottoms” jumped from 10 locations to 715.

2023-07-19 16:35:00+00:00,‘The Flash’ Becomes Historic Box Office Bomb,"With its dismal box office now fully in perspective, The Flash has become one of the worst flops in Hollywood history, right behind John Carter.","The Flash has all but officially finished its box office run following its digital release. With its dismal box office now fully in perspective, it has become one of the worst flops in Hollywood history.

While studios are notoriously tight-lipped with their budget, outlets seem to agree that The Flash had a budget of somewhere between $200 million and $220 million. Grossing only $263 million worldwide as of Monday, July 17, fans might say it narrowly avoided disaster. However, that budget comes in before marketing costs. It’s estimated that marketing nearly doubled the budget of the film, causing Warner Bros. Discovery to lose around $200 million on the film.

This $200 million loss puts The Flash as the sixth biggest box office bomb in Hollywood history. Some of the few movies to outpace its flop are The Long Ranger, a movie featuring Johnny Depp as an ancient Native American living in a carnival tent that lost $239 million, and John Carter, a movie that failed to launch a franchise so badly it lost Disney $255 million. While The Flash may no thave killed the DC brand entirely, it seems clear Ezra Miller won’t be returning to the role anytime soon.

The Flash’s DC Universe future

Warner Bros. Discovery already has a script for a potential sequel to The Flash, written by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, the man behind the two Aquaman movies starring Jason Momoa. However, James Gunn and Peter Safran did not discuss the Flash sequel during their DC Universe presentation.

Directed by Andy Muschietti from a script written by Birds of Prey scribe Christina Hodson, The Flash is inspired by the Flashpoint comic book storyline, which followed Barry Allen as he navigated an altered DC Universe. Written by Geoff Johns and penciled by Andy Kuber, Flashpoint radically altered the status of the DC Comics universe and led to the launch of the New 52 titles.

In addition to Ezra Miller, The Flash also features Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck as two separate versions of Batman, Ron Livingston as Henry Allen, Maribel Verdú as Nora Allen, Kiersey Clemons as Iris West, Michael Shannon as General Zod, Antje Traue as Faora-Ul and Sasha Calle as Supergirl.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has hit the $100 million mark at the U.S. box office, with potentially much more to come.","Cowabunga! TMNT: Mutant Mayhem Has Passed $100 Million At The Domestic Box Office

Audiences have spoken, and they are continuing to speak in favor of ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem."" The latest adaptation of the comic book heroes created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird has been slowly but surely piling up cash at the box office since its release at the beginning of this month. Now, the film has crossed a major milestone, eclipsing the $100 million mark domestically.

With $730,000 added to its growing total on Tuesday, director Jeff Rowe's animated crowd-pleaser has now taken in $100.57 million in North America, per The Numbers. As far as the overseas take goes, the movie has earned $37 million to date, bringing its grand total to $137.57 million. While that might not be a gigantic sum compared to something like ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" ($1.35 billion), the latest ""TMNT"" film was produced for a shockingly reasonable $70 million budget. So it's already well on its way to turning a profit.

Benefiting greatly from strong word of mouth from both critics and audiences alike (read our review here), the animated flick has had really long legs at the box office even in the face of competition from the likes of ""Barbie,"" ""Blue Beetle,"" ""Meg 2: The Trench,"" and, most recently, ""Gran Turismo."" Amazingly enough, it's actually the first animated movie to make at least $100 million in North America not released by Disney or Universal, save for the ""Spider-Verse"" films from Sony.

James Gunn has cleared up a point of confusion surrounding the recasting of Henry Cavill as Superman.

Cavill had played the role of the Kryptonian superhero in several DC comics films, including Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Justice League.

Despite the actor reprising the role for a recent cameo in The Flash , it was confirmed last year that Cavill would be replaced in the DC universe going forward.

The decision was said to have rested with Guardians of the Galaxy directorJames Gunn, who along with producer Peter Safran was appointed co-chairman and co-CEO of DC Studios last year.

In June, Gunn announced that the role of Superman would be played in the forthcoming Superman: Legacy by The Politician star David Corenswet. The film is set to come out in cinemas in 2025.

Gunn had initially written that Cavill was being recast because Superman: Legacy was set to focus on a younger version of the character.

“In the initial stages, our story will be focusing on an earlier part of Superman’s life, so the character will not be played by Henry Cavill,” he wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter).

However, this week, Gunn issued a clarification on the social media platform Threads, after a question from a fan concerning the recent DC release Blue Beetle.

“So in Blue Beetle at least in the commercial Jaime knows who Superman is, and you’ve said Blue Beetle is in your DCU,” they asked. “So is your young Superman movie set in the past?”

“I was never making a ‘young Superman’ movie, just a Superman movie!” Gunn responded.

As well as producing the film, Gunn is also set to direct Superman: Legacy. Rachel Brosnahan will star alongside Corenswet as Lois Lane.

Superman is the second major role Cavill has stepped down from in recent months, with the Mission: Impossible – Fallout star also standing down from the Netflix fantasy series The Witcher.

Cavill had played the lead role of demon slayer Geralt of Rivia in three seasons of the popular fantasy series. He will be replaced by The Hunger Games star Liam Hemsworth.

Fans effusively praised Cavill’s performance in his final episodes, with many lamenting the actor’s exit.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL2FydHMtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9maWxtcy9uZXdzL2phbWVzLWd1bm4tc3VwZXJtYW4tZGN1LWJsdWUtYmVldGxlLWIyMzk2NDUxLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

Moviegoers appear to be suffering from superhero fatigue, but that hasn’t stopped Toyota from hitching their wagon to Blue Beetle.

Set to hit theaters on August 18, the movie tells the story of Jaime Reyes who returns home after graduating college. As the story unfolds, Jaime is given an “ancient relic of alien biotechnology” known as the Scarab.

It promptly bonds with him, turning Jaime into the Blue Beetle. The rest seems like a boilerplate superhero origin story as there’s bad guys, struggles, and family drama.

First Look: 2024 Tacoma Shows Why Toyota Dominates The Mid-Size Truck Segment

While the film likely won’t win any points for originality, it will have plenty of product placement as Toyota is the “official automotive partner.” As a result, an older Toyota Tacoma has been integrated into the story and is the “Reyes’ beloved family vehicle” as well as the “pride and joy of Jaime’s Uncle Rudy.”

Since advertising an old truck isn’t the smartest move, the 2024 Tacoma makes a “special cameo.” Toyota has also launched a cringey ad campaign that compares the superhero to the truck.

While the film doesn’t look particularly good, the same can’t be said about the Tacoma as it’s a mid-size pickup that doesn’t make you compromise. As part of this effort, the model can be had in XtraCab and Double Cab configurations with 5′ and 6′ long beds.

Choice extends to the engine compartment as there’s 2.4-liter four-cylinder engines with outputs of 228 hp (170 kW / 231 PS), 270 hp (201 kW / 274 PS), and 278 hp (207 kW / 282 PS). The truck is also notable for offering a six-speed manual, which features automatic rev matching and anti-stall technology.

The manual isn’t the only highlight as the truck offers an all-new i-Force Max powertrain that consists of a turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, a 1.87 kWh nickel-metal hydride battery, and an electric motor that is integrated into an eight-speed automatic transmission. It produces 326 hp (243 kW / 331 PS) and 465 lb-ft (630 Nm) of torque, which makes it one of the mightiest powertrains in its class.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8yMDI0LXRveW90YS10YWNvbWEtdG8tc3Rhci1pbi1ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1hbG9uZ3NpZGUtY2xhc3NpYy10YWNvLXRydWNrL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8yMDI0LXRveW90YS10YWNvbWEtdG8tc3Rhci1pbi1ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1hbG9uZ3NpZGUtY2xhc3NpYy10YWNvLXRydWNrL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

2023-08-17 14:34:39+00:00,"China Box Office Reaches All-Time Summer Record, With Minimal Help From Hollywood",China's cinematic summer season has boomed due to a succession of local hits.,"The box office in mainland China reached an all-time high in the summer season, according to figures from ticketing agency Maoyan Entertainment. The record was achieved with minimal input from Hollywood.

Maoyan, which defines China’s cinematic summer as running from the beginning of June to the end of August, says that the previous record of RMB17.8 billion, set in 2018, was beaten on Thursday evening (local time) – some two weeks before the end of the current season.

China’s cinema-going rebound started with a jolt after mainland authorities abruptly dropped anti-COVID restrictions in mid-December 2022 allowing “Avatar: The Way of Water” to profit from a wave of revenge consumption. The late January to early February Chinese New Year period also delivered a record box office of about $1 billion, before the gravitational pull of China’s slowing economy flattened the recovery.

The summer season has witnessed a succession of locally-produced films across a span of different genres become major hits. These include: “Lost in the Stars” (mystery drama), “No More Bets” (crime-action), “Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms” (historical fantasy), “One and Only” (youth dance-drama), “Chang An” (animation), “Meg 2: The Trench” (English-language action adventure) and “Never Say Never” (uplifting martial arts drama).

Unusually, there has been no sign of the summer season blackout period that authorities have mandated in many previous years. These “Chinese film support months” have typically lasted for three to four weeks and seen revenue-sharing Hollywood movies prevented from receiving theatrical releases.

Instead, this year, Hollywood films have been imported with almost pre-pandemic frequency and received releases on an almost weekly basis throughout the June to mid-August period. Despite that, most Hollywood titles have underperformed in China this year.

The Hollywood films’ contribution to the summer box office record has therefore been modest — the strongest being “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” with $97 million and “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 1” with $51 million. “Barbie” has defied initial skepticism and reached $36 million. (“Meg 2,” which was jointly produced by CMC Pictures and Warner Bros., is considered a local title in China and did not require an import license, has a running total of $104 million).

Maoyan, which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exhange, saw its January-June results lifted significantly by the rising box office and its expanding role beyond ticketing. On Thursday, Maoyan reported first half revenues that leaped by 84% year-on-year to RMB2.20 billion and net profits that increased by 166% to RMB405 million.

Maoyan was a co-producer on “Lost in the Stars” (RMB 3.52 billion), joint producer on “Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms” (RMB 2.19 billion), and co-producer on “Never Say Never” (RMB2.14 billion. (The company is also a distributor of “Papa,” which releases on Friday and which pre-sales suggest will open in the top position.)

Earlier this week, another data provider, Artisan Gateway, reported that China’s year to date box office total had reached $5.51 billion. The company said that is fully 72% ahead of the same point last year and just 6% behind the equivalent date in 2019.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvY2hpbmEtYm94LW9mZmljZS1zdW1tZXItcmVjb3JkLWxvc3QtaW4tdGhlLXN0YXJzLW5vLW1vcmUtYmV0cy0xMjM1Njk4NzcwL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvY2hpbmEtYm94LW9mZmljZS1zdW1tZXItcmVjb3JkLWxvc3QtaW4tdGhlLXN0YXJzLW5vLW1vcmUtYmV0cy0xMjM1Njk4NzcwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

Movie has crossed the $100M (13.74B yen) mark in Japan. In doing so, it becomes Universal’s top title ever there. In local currency, Mario overtakes Top Gun: Maverick as the No. 6 Hollywood film of all time in Japan, and is the No. 1 studio picture since the beginning of the pandemic.

Japan debuted Super Mario in late April with a huge $14.3M to score the biggest opening weekend ever for an animated studio movie, as well as the biggest Saturday box office in Universal history – topping Jurassic World Dominion. In only two days, Mario and Luigi led the fastest Universal film to reach 1B yen. That weekend’s result was Universal’s best ever start in the market.

The worldwide total is to date $1.357B. When excluding China, the total is $1.332B, just edging Frozen II outside that market. The international box office cume is $782.8M.

Globally, Super Mario remains the biggest film of the year, having scored the top opening of 2023 with $375.6M, which was also good for the biggest animated opening ever, the top Illumination debut and the best video game launch of all time. It’s Illumination’s highest-grossing movie ever, pushing the Chris Meledandri-led production house’s global box office across $9.4B.

It’s also the No. 3 Universal film ever worldwide and the top animated movie of all time in 15 markets including Mexico, France, Australia, the Netherlands, Central America, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Argentina, Ecuador, the UAE, Bolivia, Venezuela, Lebanon and Iceland.

Japan now leads all markets with $100.1M, followed by Mexico ($85.4M), the UK/Ireland ($67.7M), France ($62.4M) and Germany ($56.1M).

Directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic from a screenplay by Matthew Fogel, Super Mario is produced by Illumination founder and CEO Meledandri and by Shigeru Miyamoto for Nintendo.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvdGhlLXN1cGVyLW1hcmlvLWJyb3MtbW92aWUtamFwYW4tYm94LW9mZmljZS1taWxlc3RvbmUtdW5pdmVyc2FsLTEyMzU1MjA2NzAv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC90aGUtc3VwZXItbWFyaW8tYnJvcy1tb3ZpZS1qYXBhbi1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW1pbGVzdG9uZS11bml2ZXJzYWwtMTIzNTUyMDY3MC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

After a seemingly disastrous opening, the studio's Elemental has outgrossed Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse at the international box office.","Pixar's Elemental Overtakes Across The Spider-Verse At The International Box Office

This summer has had its fair share of bummer headlines in regard to the box office, save for the shocking success of ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer."" This past weekend saw ""Blue Beetle"" become another disappointment for DC, while ""Strays"" got straight-up buried in no small part due to the ongoing strikes that are preventing casts from doing press for films. But amidst the doom and gloom is one of the feel-good stories of the year in Pixar's ""Elemental."" The film rebounded from absolute disaster to become a success. So much so that it has actually surpassed ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" at the international box office, amazingly enough.

Over the weekend, ""Elemental"" overtook Sony's animated ""Spider-Man"" flick overseas, with Pixar's latest now sitting at $307.1 million outside of North America, per The Numbers. Meanwhile, ""Across the Spider-Verse"" has earned $302.1 million internationally. Now, as far as the overall total goes, the edge still goes to Spidey. The ""Spider-Verse"" sequel has earned $380.9 million domestically, giving it a $683 million total, whereas ""Elemental"" has taken in just $151.1 million domestically for a $458.2 million running total.

That said, the fact that Pixar now has the biggest animated movie of the year outside of North America is nothing shy of amazing. An original film has outgrossed a ""Spider-Man"" movie throughout most of the world. It's a sign that Pixar's good name still has a lot of cache with audiences, even if Disney sent several of the studio's films straight to Disney+ during the early years of the pandemic (a decision that CEO Bob Iger has acknowledged did some damage, it should be noted). Yet, Pixar endures.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTM3MTczOC9waXhhci1lbGVtZW50YWwtb3ZlcnRha2VzLWFjcm9zcy1zcGlkZXItdmVyc2UtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

2023-08-23 21:59:48+00:00,"DC Drops Bombshell, Kills Most Recent Movie While Still in Cinemas - Inside the Magic",Warner Bros Discovery are actively taking steps to kill their latest movie in theaters due to underwhelming box office numbers.,"In the wake of the Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) merger last year, there were some significant organizational shifts resulting in the replacement of Walter Hamada, the former head of DC. Subsequently, WBD acquired James Gunn, the esteemed Marvel director recognized for his work on the Guardians of the Galaxy series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), who was then appointed as the fresh leader of DC Studios, alongside Peter Safran.

It’s noteworthy that Gunn possessed prior experience within the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), now rebranded as the DC Universe (DCU), having directed films like The Suicide Squad (2021) — notably distinct from the earlier Suicide Squad (2016) starring Jared Leto as the Joker. Currently, DC Studios is reportedly embarking on a totally unique endeavor — allegedly completely different from the offerings of Marvel Studios.

As part of the DC Universe’s (DCU) new Chapter One – Gods and Monsters, James Gunn is gearing up for a significant “reboot” of the former DCEU, aiming to start anew. Presently, the focus centers on DCU’s inaugural film, Superman: Legacy, already penned by Gunn just prior to the Writers Guild of America/WGA strike that’s now impacting Hollywood. The plot details of Superman: Legacy remain mostly under wraps, but what’s clear is that it will portray a younger Clark Kent as he navigates his role as Superman. Speculation regarding the casting of the titular Superman/Clark Kent and his partner Lois Lane created a buzz for a while, until recently when it was unveiled that David Corenswet (Hollywood) and Rachel Brosnahan (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel) would respectively assume these roles.

DC’s Doomed Blue Beetle

In the groundbreaking Latino culture-centric superhero film Blue Beetle (2023), Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña), a recent law school graduate, takes a job under Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) to save his family’s home. Tasked with protecting the Scarab, a cosmic weapon, Jaime inadvertently bonds with the Scarab, and becomes the mighty Blue Beetle, gaining the powers to counter Victoria’s sinister plot and save the world.

The film’s ensemble includes Adriana Barraza as Nana, Damián Alcázar as Alberto Reyes, Elpidia Carrillo as Rocio Reyes, Bruna Marquezine as Jenny Kord, and Raoul Max Trujillo as Ignacio Carapax / OMAC. The story unfolds as Jaime navigates his newfound abilities, confronts Victoria Kord’s ambitions, and ultimately becomes the hero the world needs.

DC Studios Actively Killing off Own Movie

The year 2023 has posed significant challenges for DC Comics properties at the box office. With the official end of the Justice League Snyderverse helmed by Zack Snyder, Shazam! Fury of the Gods (2023) was the first significant setback for the studio since WBD reshuffled DC Studios. Preceding this was another DC flop, Black Adam (2022) (AKA the infamous Dwayne Johnson passion project). This was followed closely by an even larger box office disappointment, The Flash (2023), which similarly fell short of meeting DC fans’ expectations.

Now, DC Studios has recently dropped some news that caused a fair amount of fan uproar.

Twitter (now X) user @NicholasPas5 posted the following reaction to The Hollywood Handle’s shocking news from DC Studios — that Warner Bros. Discovery have already announced the date that Blue Beetle will go digital. Nicholas is astonished, believing that WBD are actively sabotaging their own film with a move like this — seeing as the film merely came out last Thursday:

The movie came out LAST THURSDAY and already has a digital release date… WB what are you doing??? The Hollywood Handle (quoted): ‘BLUE BEETLE’ hits digital platforms on September 19. Find out what other movies are releasing on digital next month: http://bit.ly/DSep23

Users like @SpiritDiveRamon were shocked, reminding everyone that the movie was not even out around the world — referencing Disney’s Pixar Animation Studios sleeper hit, Elemental (2023), which turned its box office performance around after sticking it out in theaters throughout the summer:

Ramon: Movie not even out around the world, and did they not learn anything from elemental Nicholas: This could be a sleeper hit if they just let it try and gain some legs at the box office, now this is just telling ppl to wait a month

This could be a sleeper hit if they just let it try and gain some legs at the box office, now this is just telling ppl to wait a month — Nicholas (@NicholasPas5) August 23, 2023

This definitely sounds like DC Studios is more or less sounding the death knell for the severely underrated film.

Do you think DC Studios is making a mistake by announcing Blue Beetle‘s digital release already? Share your thoughts in the comments below!

The DC Universe (or DCU) is owned by Warner Bros Discovery, and originally termed the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). Previously, the DCEU was more or less helmed by Zack Snyder, whose popular “Snyderverse” Justice League (2017) had its fair share of fans. Finished by Marvel alum Joss Whedon, which consists of Superman/Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), Wonder Woman/Diana Prince (Gal Gadot), Batman/Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck), Aquaman/Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa), The Flash/Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) and Cyborg/Victor Stone (Ray Fisher). The DCU is now run by ex-Marvel director James Gunn, writer and director of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, in conjunction with Peter Safran. Based on the DC Comic world, the new reboot of the DC Universe under Gunn is set about to begin, with anything from the comic books — everything from Superman (and upcoming Superman Legacy), to Lex Luthor, and even the Green Lantern, or Black Adam — about to be reshaped for the new DCU.

2023-08-21 08:55:37.237000+00:00,Blue Beetle ha superato Barbie al box office americano,Nonostante una partenza in salita il nuovo supereroe spodesta la bambola fenomeno dell'estate,"Dopo quattro settimane in vetta alle classifiche dei film americani più visti, Barbie ha dovuto cedere lo scettro a Blue Beetle. Il blockbuster già cult firmato da Greta Gerwig è ancora il fenomeno cinematografico dell'estate, ma lo scorso weekend ha dovuto cedere la vetta dei box office a stelle e strisce al nuovo film supereroistico firmato Dc: quest'ultimo, infatti, ha guadagnato la posizione numero uno con 25,4 milioni di dollari, ai quali si aggiungono i 18 milioni racimolati all'estero. Non che sia una partenza grandiosa, anzi Blue Beetle rappresenta uno dei debutti più deboli di un film Dc degli ultimi anni, superato da Shazam 2 (30 milioni di dollari nel primo weekend) e The Flash (55 milioni), che pure avevano avuto delle partenze non proprio brillanti. Tanto è bastato però per scalzare, almeno temporaneamente, il mondo delle bambole interpretate da Margot Robbie e Ryan Gosling.

Seppur non con guadagni esaltanti, Blue Beetle ha avuto un buon riscontro da parte della critica ed è stata soprattutto particolarmente apprezzato per via della rappresentazione della cultura latinoamericana negli Stati Uniti. Al centro della vicenda, infatti, troviamo Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña), neolaureato figlio di una famiglia di immigrati messicani, che torna nella città natale di Palmera City - chiaramente ispirata a Miami - per ritrovare i propri cari e il proprio quartiere in una situazione molto problematica, schiacciati come sono dagli spietati affari delle Kord Industries. Lo stesso Jaime si troverà ad affrontare la spietata Victoria Kord (interpretata da una inaspettatamente malvagia Susan Sarandon) dopo essere venuto in possesso di uno Scarabeo alieno che prende possesso del suo corpo e lo trasforma in un potentissimo eroe simbionte.

Al di là della classica origin story di un giovane ai margini che si ritrova a salvare il mondo grazie a facoltà soprannaturali, Blue Beetle è anche una lettera d'amore alla famiglia messicana, ai legami affettivi più puri e al modo in cui l'unione e l'inclusione siano sempre la risposta rispetto a una società che invece vuole far prevaricare la violenza e il profitto. Il cast è poi composto per la stragrande maggioranza di attori di origini latine (George Lopez, Adriana Barraca e Raoul Max Trujillo tra gli altri) ed è quindi un'occasione senza precedenti per dare un volto alla cultura messicana e non solo che è propria di milioni di immigrati negli Stati Uniti (a un certo punto del film c'è persino una statua di Cristoforo Colombo che viene abbattuta in modo ironico, o si fa riferimento a battaglie antimperialiste o alle immigrazioni clandestine nel paese). Nonostante Blue Beetle non sia destinato a essere il film più fruttuoso dell'anno, insomma, è già una soddisfazione aver battuto almeno momentaneamente una “macchina da guerra” come Barbie.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLml0L2FydGljbGUvYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtYm94LW9mZmljZS1zdXBlcmEtYmFyYmllLXRyYW1hLXRyYWlsZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

2023-08-21 15:30:00+00:00,Ezra Miller’s ‘The Flash’ Ends Box Office Run As A Massive Flop,"While superheroes typically dominate cinema screens with colossal earnings, The Flash’s solo cinematic debut tells a different tale at the box office.","The race is over, and the results are in: The Flash couldn’t outrun its production and marketing costs. While superheroes typically dominate cinema screens with colossal earnings, the Scarlet Speedster’s solo cinematic debut tells a different tale, culminating in a global box office total of just $268 million.

However, while cinema earnings fell short of expectations, the digital realm provided a silver lining. Since its release on Premium Video On Demand, The Flash has consistently been a strong contender, lingering near the top of VOD charts.

Despite this promising resurgence on digital platforms, it’s difficult to sidestep the theatrical figures. The box office performance, when held against expectations and production costs, marks The Flash as one of the most significant letdowns in the history of comic book movies.

The Flash’s DC Universe future

Warner Bros. Discovery already has a script for a potential sequel to The Flash, written by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, the man behind the two Aquaman movies starring Jason Momoa. However, James Gunn and Peter Safran did not discuss the Flash sequel during their DC Universe presentation.

Directed by Andy Muschietti from a script written by Birds of Prey scribe Christina Hodson, The Flash is inspired by the Flashpoint comic book storyline, which followed Barry Allen as he navigated an altered DC Universe. Written by Geoff Johns and penciled by Andy Kuber, Flashpoint radically altered the status of the DC Comics universe and led to the launch of the New 52 titles.

In addition to Ezra Miller, The Flash also features Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck as two separate versions of Batman, Ron Livingston as Henry Allen, Maribel Verdú as Nora Allen, Kiersey Clemons as Iris West, Michael Shannon as General Zod, Antje Traue as Faora-Ul and Sasha Calle as Supergirl.

2023-08-18 19:55:45+00:00,‘The Nun II’ Looks For $30M+ Post Labor Day Blessing At Box Office — Early Look,'The Nun II' Looks to Open to $30M+ at the domestic box office as the SAG-AFTRA strike goes on.,"Before the strikes completely turn the theatrical release calendar inside-out, the fall box office isn’t going to just give up. Following what is expected to be a robust $30M+ four-day for Sony’s The Equalizer 3 over Labor Day weekend, New Line‘s The Nun II is expected to file a post Labor Day weekend start of $30M+.

It’s still early for the film campaign wise with only two teaser posters released and the YouTube trailer at 26M views (versus The Meg 2‘s official trailer at 43M on the Warner Bros channel), so there’s a chance for upside. You’ll remember that Warner Bros began owning this post-Labor day weekend space with horror movies, starting with the Stephen King It movies back in 2017 when It: Chapter One posted September’s best opening ever at $123.4M. It Chapter: Two at $91M in that post-holiday space is the second biggest opening for the first month of fall, followed b 2018’s The Nun at $53.8M which reps the fourth highest domestic B.O. opening for September, but the best ever in New Line’s The Conjuring universe.

Right now tracking stats for The Nun II look similar to Insidious: The Red Door, ($33M opening) despite the fact that the former is an R-rated movie, and the latter PG-13. Translation: Unaided awareness (the organic stat where those polled actually name a studio’s a movie as what they want to see without any prompting) is very hot among women under 25. The Nun II in unaided awareness is also higher than Blumhouse’s Black Phone ($23.6M), Paramount’s Smile ($22.6M) and New Line’s Evil Dead Rise ($24.5M).

The Nun wound up being the highest grossing movie ever in The Conjuring universe on a global basis with $365.5M. At $117.4M domestic, The Nun is the second highest in the series behind The Conjuring‘s $137.4M.

The Nun II is directed by Michael Chaves. It’s Chaves’ third movie to be directed for James Wan’s Atomic Monster after 2019’s The Curse of La Llorona and 2021’s The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvdGhlLW51bi1paS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLXByb2plY3Rpb24tMTIzNTUyMjcwNi_SAU1odHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4L3RoZS1udW4taWktYm94LW9mZmljZS1wcm9qZWN0aW9uLTEyMzU1MjI3MDYvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-23 21:20:51+00:00,Summer box office 2023: what were the big hits and misses?,It was the season of Barbenheimer but also one that saw some of the costliest flops that the industry has ever seen,"While Hollywood suffered its fair share of furrowed brows this season, the end result is looking like a win. If all goes to plan by the end of the week, then this summer will see the box office reach the magic $4bn mark, making it the biggest summer since the pre-pandemic era.

It’s all going to be perilously down to the wire though and with a number of major films losing a major amount of money, there are still some vital cautionary lessons to be learned.

It’s a Barbie world

Not even Fortune Teller Barbie could have foreseen the costume-inciting, record-breaking, billion-dollar-making success of this summer’s live-action Barbie movie, not just the biggest film of the season but likely to become the biggest film of the year. Mattel’s robust sales numbers (last year it still made more than $1.4bn from Barbie products) and an inescapably effective marketing campaign suggested big things, but Greta Gerwig’s well-reviewed semi-satire, headlined by Margot Robbie, outdid every expectation and then some, the rare blockbuster that turned into a genuine phenomenon. To date, it’s the biggest film ever from a female director, the biggest film ever from Warner Bros, and with $1.2bn and counting (unlike so many summer hits, it has legs), it’s set to enter the top 10 biggest films of all time. It was the kind of event that the industry had been craving, dragging millions off the couches they had become so comfortable on (a study showed that around a quarter of all Barbiegoers hadn’t been to a cinema since before the pandemic) and proving that the theatrical experience can still be big business.

Inevitably, it’s led to a doubling down by Mattel Studios, confirming plans for films based on everything from Polly Pocket (with Lena Dunham at the helm) to Barney the Dinosaur (starring Daniel Kaluuya) to Uno. But while its monster box office was undoubtedly tied to a long-running, wide-reaching brand (the year’s only other billion-dollar hit is the similarly nostalgia-fuelled Super Mario Bros Movie), the level of its popularity is down to something harder to replicate: the perfect confluence of director, star, timing and tone. It was also yet another reminder of the financial sway of the female audience following earlier summer hits like Sex and the City, Mamma Mia!, Girls Trip and last year’s Where the Crawdads Sing. Its success can also be linked to another summer hit …

Oppenheimer was far from a bomb

It was the summer of Barbie and Oppenheimer but it was mostly the summer of Barbenheimer, the unlikely double bill of comically opposed movies that turned competition into collaboration. Millions decided to see them both on opening weekend and continued to do so in the weeks after, allowing for a rare global duopoly. While Barbie’s box office remains a momentous achievement, it was the $722m (and counting) made by a 3-hour period drama that really shook the industry, a biopic welcomed like a superhero movie. It certainly helped that it was directed by someone with a bit of experience in that field, The Dark Knight trilogy’s Christopher Nolan, one of the few directors working today whose name carries the same weight as an A-list actor. While there were some major names in the film (Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh), it was Nolan who acted as the biggest sell, his blank-cheque passion project proving fruitful not just for him, but for other film-makers hoping to get theirs made in the future.

But like Barbie, it may not be the broad industry game-changer some may view it as. There might not have been a raft of other big-budget historical dramas announced in its wake à la Mattel, but execs will surely be looking at its ongoing success (it’s the fourth biggest film of the year and will soon become the third, dethroning Guardians of the Galaxy 3) and wondering how to force another lightening strike. The smarter among them will be waiting until the release of both Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon and Ridley Scott’s Napoleon to see if audiences are as eager to rush out and see other auteurs allowed the run of a bigger canvas.

Hollywood’s elder statesmen and women struggled

The sky-high box office of last summer’s Top Gun: Maverick, the out-in-front success story of the season, seemed to suggest that Tom Cruise, experiencing his biggest hit to date, could do no wrong, a dethroned Hollywood king given back his crown. But a year on and his star has been dimmed by the underwhelming box office of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, a long-awaited sequel given an impossible mountain to climb. The film has made $541m to date, a number not to be sniffed at free of context but it’s the lowest-performing film of the series since the third back in 2006 and with a bloated Covid-impacted budget of $291m, it’s an instant money-loser. It’s set to lose Paramount around $100m, and a similar number is also being swallowed by Disney, whose even longer-awaited Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has done even worse with just $378m from a similarly hefty $295m budget (almost half of the money made by 2008’s Kingdom of the Crystal Skull). Both films are also believed to have marketing budgets of around $100m each, making them two of the most expensive films ever.

They were perhaps big bets that would have been too big in any year but timing was also not on either side with budgets ballooned by Covid and, for Cruise, the runaway Barbenheimer train arriving just a week later hobbling whatever legs a well-reviewed movie might have otherwise had (Ford suffered a more ho-hum response with a Cannes debut looking ill-advised on reflection). They’re also older franchises that require some legwork for beginners, at least on the surface, the fifth (Ford) and seventh (Cruise) chapters in series that haven’t necessarily trickled down to a younger fanbase. Elsewhere things were similarly unrewarding for actors over the age of 50 with Book Club: The Next Chapter bombing as summer counter-programming, making a limp $28m worldwide (compared to the original’s $104m) and Robert De Niro’s comedy About My Father struggling with less than $18m. Older cinemagoers have still been slower to return to cinemas post-height of Covid (Oppenheimer’s opening weekend was surprisingly led by 18-34-year-olds) and after last year’s crop of Oscar movies failed to lure them out, all eyes will be on this fall’s contenders to see if the tide can turn.

Conservative audiences made some noise

There has been a long line of small, underestimated films aimed at a Christian, conservative audience that have over-performed theatrically in the US from 2014’s God’s Not Dead to 2019’s anti-abortion propaganda Unplanned, but these were mostly drops in the ocean compared to what happened this summer, the tsunami-level arrival of Sound of Freedom. The film, originally made back in 2018 yet shelved by its original distributors Disney who then sold it on, became one of many left vs right culture war success stories of the summer alongside dark, divisive country songs from Jason Aldean and Oliver Anthony. The Trump-endorsed child trafficking thriller starring Jim Caviezel was viewed as QAnon-adjacent by critics at the Guardian, Jezebel and Rolling Stone (Caviezel has also appeared at QAnon-organised events and has rabbited some key theories) and dangerous by some experts, but became an unlikely summer smash, making $178m to date from a budget of $14.5m.

Its success spoke to the quality of the film-making (content aside, it’s visually sleeker than any of the breakout Christian films of the last decade), the debate it generated fuelling an audience that feels undervalued to show up in support and a controversial pay-it-forward ticket scheme that pushed viewers to buy more tickets in bulk after watching which has resulted in “sold-out” shows being empty. A sequel is of course on the way (if the issue over who owns the rights to it can be solved) and with its margins making it one of the most profitable independent films of all time, you can expect more eventising of films from the right in the future.

Necessity was the mother of invention

The aforementioned success of Barbie can be traced to a number of factors from brand awareness to infectious marketing but so much of the attention it attracted was a result of Gerwig’s desire to subvert the expected. Rather than the Barbie movie one might have anticipated, it was (within the constraints of the system) a film of thoughts and challenges, adding fizz where too often film-makers settle for flat. One of the season’s other major success stories achieved something similar, the dizzyingly inventive animated sequel Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, a film overstuffed with ideas and a plot that plays on our fatigue with not just the superhero genre but with the Spider-Man story itself. It was a major hit with critics and crowds (at $687m globally, it topped its predecessor by $300m) and showed that there was life in the Marvel universe after all. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, the biggest superhero hit of the summer, might not have had quite as much to it, but the series has remained one of the studio’s most reliably popular franchises because its director, James Gunn, has always tried to do something a bit different, opting for character over cliche. There was also a strong start for the Spider-verse-inspired reinvention that was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, swapping in visually unexpected animation and a Seth Rogen co-written script of surprising humour, the film slowly creeping past $120m worldwide after three weeks in release boosted by superlative-heavy reviews.

But it was more of the same elsewhere. The Little Mermaid, yet another live-action Disney film sleepily going through the motions, made just $567m worldwide, a notable step down from the billion-dollar-plus totals of Aladdin, The Lion King, Alice in Wonderland and Beauty and the Beast. After crashing and burning with Black Adam and Shazam 2, DC suffered with another bummer summer with the much-hyped adventure The Flash becoming the biggest superhero flop of all time, estimated to lose Warner Bros around $200m, and then August’s Blue Beetle stumbling with the worst DC opening weekend in almost 20 years. Even the usually reliable Fast and Furious trilogy was showing signs of exhaustion with Fast X sputtering out with the worst US total since Tokyo Drift in 2006. With so many audiences still needing a more substantive reason to swap couch for cinema, not enough films were giving them more than what they were used to, and this summer showed critical reception directly correlated with audience enthusiasm more than ever before. The message this season was clear: adapt or die.

No funny business

It was supposed to be the summer that saw the return of the studio comedy (last year’s season only saw The Bob’s Burgers Movie and Easter Sunday dare to brave a theatrical release, to predictably puny numbers) but yet again, audiences mostly stayed away from funny business. The raucous road trip comedy Joy Ride crashed with $15m worldwide, the Sebastian Maniscalco vehicle About My Father may prove to be his last, Searchlight’s $8m Sundance buy Theater Camp barely made it past $3m, Bert Kreischer’s Bert Kreischer movie The Machine couldn’t make it past $11m, Book Club 2 was left on read, The Blackening couldn’t make it up to $18m and last weekend the R-rated dog comedy Strays was left in the doghouse with a rough opening of just $8m.

The summer’s one comedy success story was Jennifer Lawrence’s sweet and sour comeback No Hard Feelings, but even that was only cause for mild applause, making just $50m in the US and $87m worldwide from a considerable, for the genre, budget of $45m. It’s a far cry from the big comedy hits of summers past, such as 2009’s The Hangover ($468m worldwide), 2011’s Bridesmaids ($306m worldwide) or 2015’s Spy ($235m worldwide). There’s a dearth of both bankable comedy leads and general audience interest in seeing a comedy on the big screen, the majority heading straight to streaming (one-time hit-makers Adam Sandler and Melissa McCarthy chose to partner with Netflix rather than risk ever-diminishing box-office returns). The success of Barbie did show that people were enthused to enjoy a comedy with an audience, even if it was hidden in different packaging – so the laughs are out there it just requires a more energised search to find them.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjMvYXVnLzIzL3N1bW1lci1tb3ZpZS1yZXZpZXdzLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVy0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2ZpbG0vMjAyMy9hdWcvMjMvc3VtbWVyLW1vdmllLXJldmlld3MtYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXI?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,A 'last gasp' for superhero films,"The new Warner Bros' DC movie should be full of fresh ideas, but it's ""a pale imitation of other, better films"", writes Nicholas Barber.","Blue Beetle is a 'last gasp' for superhero films
By Nicholas Barber Features correspondent

The new Warner Bros' DC movie should be full of fresh ideas, but it's ""a pale imitation of other, better films"", writes Nicholas Barber.
Over the past year, Warner Bros' DC superhero films seem to have suffered a severe case of Kryptonite poisoning. Black Adam, Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash all crashed and burned at the box office, and it's not likely that their new offering, Blue Beetle, is going to save the day. It was always a long shot, mind you. Compared to Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, Blue Beetle is a lesser known, fuzzily defined character: his main claim to fame is that he inspired Nite Owl in Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' classic graphic novel, Watchmen. But if the Blue Beetle film had had enough fresh ideas, its protagonist's obscurity might not have been an issue. Unfortunately, the average beetle has more fresh ideas than this one.
More like this:
The story begins as Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) returns to his hometown, the futuristic, fictional, and horribly fake-looking Palmera City, having studied for a pre-law degree in Gotham. He doesn't say whether he met Bruce Wayne while he was at university, but things didn't go well for his family in the meantime. His dad (Damián Alcázar) is recovering from a heart attack, and the family is about to be kicked out of its cosy barrio house by developers from the evil Kord corporation. Nonetheless, Jaime apparently has no qualms about getting a job as a cleaner for the corporation's villainous CEO, Victoria (Susan Sarandon), or about flirting with Victoria's non-villainous niece, Jenny (Bruna Marquezine). For reasons that aren't clear, Victoria is obsessed with creating cyborg Robocops with the help of a small extra-terrestrial device called The Scarab. But, much to her annoyance, this shiny metal bug chooses Jaime as its host. After it attaches itself to his spine, he is wrapped in an ugly exoskeleton that allows him to fly, blast people with energy beams, and do various other generic super things.
The one distinguishing feature that Blue Beetle has are its Latin elements
So... you've got the alien symbiote from Venom, you've got the corporate squabbles over high-tech armour from Iron Man, and you've got just about everything else from the Tom Holland version of Spider-Man, who, like Jaime, was a gauche youngster in a creepy-crawly-related super-suit with a female AI voice. Blue Beetle is cheerful and competent enough to pass a rainy afternoon during the school holidays, but it's all too obviously a pale imitation of other, better films. Sarandon is good value as the blithe baddie, a fairy-tale wicked queen who flashes a twinkly smile as she goes about her nefarious business, but few of the other cast-members have more than a fraction of her charisma. Aside from George Lopez, who is energetically wacky as Jaime's counter-cultural uncle, most of the actors are so bland that they could be the cast of a spin-off TV show which couldn't afford to pay the stars of the original film.
The one distinguishing feature that Blue Beetle has are its Latin elements. The key members of its creative team have a Latin background, including its Puerto Rican director, Ángel Manuel Soto. There are even some comments in the screenplay about how Mexican people need their own superhero, and how they're exploited by white Americans. But don't imagine that the film's politics are as challenging or as well integrated as, say, those in Black Panther. For every mention of revolutionary direct action, there is a scene with is a stereotypical trope, so I'm not convinced that the film takes a major step forward in terms of representation.
Blue Beetle is both tediously simple and annoyingly confusing
A bigger problem is that Blue Beetle is both tediously simple and annoyingly confusing. There are no clever twists in a plot that consists of Jaime gaining the powers of The Scarab, and Victoria trying to snatch them from him. Victoria's scar-faced henchman Carapax (Raoul Max Trujillo) is a grunting nobody, and the dialogue is made up of speeches explaining situations that everyone within earshot would already know about: again, only Sarandon is capable of making these exposition dumps worth hearing.
Blue Beetle Director: Ángel Manuel Soto Cast: Xolo Maridueña, Damián Alcázar, Susan Sarandon, Bruna Marquezine, George Lopez Run time: 2hr 7m Release date: 18 August
And yet, as rudimentary as the film's by-the-numbers screenplay might be, it still leaves you scratching your head, because it never tells you where The Scarab came from, why it happens to resemble a beetle, why it bonds with Jaime, or why there was once another superhero called the Blue Beetle who couldn't activate The Scarab, but who was nonetheless capable of inventing lots of Scarab-like weaponry.
Presumably, the filmmakers were hoping to explore such matters in a sequel or two, but they may have been over-optimistic. James Gunn, the writer-director of the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy, is now masterminding a reboot of DC's superhero universe, beginning with a Superman film he is directing himself – and Blue Beetle comes across as a relic of the ill-fated pre-Gunn era. Nearly everything about it is stale and derivative, all the way to the teasing extra scenes during and after the end credits. Instead of feeling like the birth of a thrilling new franchise, it feels like the last gasp of a worn-out old one.

2023-08-24 16:27:38+00:00,It Takes More Than One Superhero,"Despite the success of Blue Beetle, Latinos remain the most underrepresented group in films.","Warner Bros. Pictures and DC Comics’ Blue Beetle, the first live-action Latino superhero film, leapt over some high barriers to top the box office in its debut weekend, displacing Warner Bros. behemoth summer hit, Barbie.
Because the cast of Blue Beetle was sidelined from promoting the film due to the actors’ strike, Latino organizations wrote an open letter calling on audiences to watch the movie in theaters, and fans started their own social media campaigns under the banner #bluebeetlebattalion to drive turnout. They managed to pull out a victory.

But at the same time the first Blue Beetle audiences were buying their tickets for Thursday night screenings, the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative published the latest edition in its ongoing study on diversity in Hollywood. Representation both on and behind the screen is virtually unchanged since the study began in 2007. Women, people of color, LGBTQ+ and disabled persons continue to be cast aside.
Women and girls held fewer than 35% of speaking roles in films released in 2022, according to the study. Among racial and ethnic groups, Latinos continued to be the most underrepresented group per capita in film. The researchers found that Latinos accounted for about 5% of speaking roles in films. Latinos comprise about a fifth of the U.S. population, according to the U.S. Census.
With a cast that’s predominantly Latino, a Puerto Rican director in Ángel Manuel Soto, and a Mexican screenwriter in Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, Blue Beetle could move Hollywood Latino representation up a few percentage points this year, but not enough to make up for decades of lost stories: Latino talent who missed out on casting opportunities, scripts centering on Latino experiences that were never produced, and underrepresented directors who never got a shot at a superhero-sized budget.
Still, it’s a start. Blue Beetle can be a blueprint for the kind of deeper change Hollywood needs.The film features more than a token diverse character and, critically, employs POC on both sides of the camera. In Blue Beetle, Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) is a young man with big ambitions and a big Mexican American family. When the reality of his family’s finances comes to light, he puts his dreams on hold to help them. By chance, Jaime crosses paths with a mystical blue scarab that attaches itself to him, and he becomes the superhero Blue Beetle. When crisis comes to the Reyes home, his family also steps up to help him, whether that’s pulling off a mischievous heist with his Uncle Rudy (George Lopez) or fighting alongside his Nana (Adriana Barraza), an anti-imperialist fighter in the Mexican Revolution. The movie goes beyond the usual CGI fight fests to weave in mentions of gentrification, undocumented family members and the harrowing legacy of the United States’ interventions in Latin America through the School of the Americas.
Cultural references roll off characters’ tongues like they were pronouncing their “rr”’s. They’re seamless and natural, from old school Mexican music to alluding to classic telenovelas, the long-running variety show Sábado Gigante and the Mexican horror movie Macario. The family switches easily between Spanish and English. It’s not just a few words of affection, either. There’s plenty of non-English dialogue blended naturally into the fabric of the Reyeses’ conversations. It’s more than just representation for representation’s sake. It reflects the care of the filmmakers and cast to hit the right tone, the body language, the word choices to feel authentic. In doing so, they reflect the actual lives of the millions of Latinos who watch U.S. films but seldom appear in them.
Considering that the industry more often erases Latino presence than celebrates it, the fact that Blue Beetle is so unapologetically proud of its roots and celebrates us as heroes feels like progress — yes, even for a family-friendly superhero movie. At a time when a number of Latino-led TV shows are among the first to get the ax or taken off of streaming services, Blue Beetle is pushing back against corporate mandates and DEI initiatives that have failed to lead to more Latino creative talent in the entertainment industry.
Blue Beetle’s big-screen appearance almost never happened. The film was supposed to premiere on the streaming service now known as Max, the same release strategy that was slated for Batgirl, starring the Latina Leslie Grace Martínez. Warner Bros. Discovery (the parent company of the DC Extended Universe) controversially canceled Batgirl before its completion.
Although Blue Beetle is finally enjoying its long-delayed debut, Hollywood’s systemic issues require much more than one movie to be fixed. It will take a multiverse of different industrywide efforts and internal change at various decision-making levels to fix the industry’s broken talent pipeline, and the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes are a part of those efforts. The strike issues include shrinking residuals and mini-writers’ rooms, a new kind of economic precarity that may force more working class, underrepresented writers and actors to leave the business.
Striking a new deal would benefit someone like Maridueña, who broke out as a lead actor in Netflix’s Karate Kid spinoff series Cobra Kai and could earn more if streaming residuals are reformed (Maridueña’s parents founded the Boyle Heights Arts Conservancy to help underrepresented communities break into film and the arts).
A new deal would also support writers like Dunnet-Alcocer, who told The Hollywood Reporter about the challenges many Latino writers face. “Latino writers don’t usually come from wealth,” he said. “So that’s an extra pressure. The less economic infrastructure you have to help you survive this, it’s less chance to write and express their stories because you can’t write.”
The flux state of streaming platforms has proven to be a double edged sword, with services greenlighting many diverse series but allowing few enough time to find an audience. Soto’s previous film, Charm City Kings, was among those acquired exclusively for HBO Max but later dropped from the service in the 2022 corporate shuffle. It’s now available to rent on VOD, which means curious viewers have to search a little harder and pay extra to see it.
Like most recent superhero movies, Blue Beetle is set to return for a sequel. Hopefully, he’ll enjoy the success of the animated Puerto Rican Spider-Man Miles Morales, and return in multiple big-screen adventures. But to truly make movie casts look more like the U.S. population, increased support for Blue Beetle will have to extend to Latino talent in scrappy indies, nonfranchise movies and comic book-inspired blockbusters alike.
The necessary quadrupling of Latinos in film will take more than a single heroic effort. Addressing the persistent lack of girls and women on screen, the USC study’s author, Stacy L. Smith, identified the same villain menacing everyone except straight, white, able-bodied men. “It is clear the entertainment industry has little desire or motivation to improve casting processes in a way that creates meaningful change,” she said.

,Latino culture fills ‘BLUE beetle’,"WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. — Director Ángel Manuel Soto didn’t think too much about the “Latino side of things” when visually crafting DC’s “Blue Beetle” alongside Mexican screenwriter Gareth Dunnet-Alcoc","I love talking about what I love. I think as exhausting as it might be, because it’s a lot for one person to do, connecting with fans and having experiences with people from other cultures, from other countries definitely fuels the energy cause I’m learning a lot. I learn a lot when I talk to people. I get reassurance, I get empowered. So any depletion of energy caused to forced nights of sleep and constant travel are immediately replenished when interacting with beautiful people.
I read that you originally wanted to pitch a Bane origin story, but instead, DC presented you with this film. What was it like for you mentally having to pivot from wanting to tell a supervillain origin story to this coming-of-age superhero one?
I had no idea they were working on something like “Blue Beetle.” Coming out of the success of a film like “The Joker” and understanding there’s other characters that might have so many things to explore, I wanted to pitch that Bane idea. So they came in and was like, ‘Yeah, that’s a great idea. But we got this product here, and it’s “Blue Beetle.’ ” I knew a little bit about Blue Beetle. I knew that Jaime Reyes was in it. My first reaction was that I didn’t want to brownwash something, you know, that already existed. It’s OK if there’s familiarity with certain things, but I didn’t want to be that person that my Latinidad had to conform to somebody else’s expectations of Latinidad. I wanted to be able to be free, and I wanted the actors that I hired that are Latino to be authentically themselves.
So when I said that, they were like, ‘Oh, no, no, don’t worry. Our writer is Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer. He is a Mexican from Querétaro and just read the script. Let me know what you think.’ And when I read the script, I could see that the person who wrote it not only is Latino, but he wrote characters that he knows and they were so relatable because we’ve realized that even though we’re both from different countries, we’re so similar. Our families are so similar. The music, the TV shows, we grew up exactly the same, just in different countries. And we’re like, ‘Oh my gosh, this is special because not only Mexicans are going to connect. I think all Latinos are going to connect. And consequently, all the people that are not Latino also are going to connect if they’re open and curious.’
Can you talk more about how you and Dunnett-Alcocer settled on the story? I love how you found a way for the women to all be strong figures and also to blend all of these Latino cultures in the film.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbHVtYmlhbi5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzL2F1Zy8yNi9sYXRpbm8tY3VsdHVyZS1maWxscy1ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-07-19 17:46:07+00:00,"Warner Bros.’ Quest to Build a Better ‘Aquaman’ Sequel: 3 Reshoots, Two Batmans and Non-Stop Test Screenings","Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has endured a grueling post-production process, including three rounds of reshoots and two Batmen.","Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is in uncharted waters, with the next several weeks potentially setting its course, for good or for ill.
The sequel to Warner Bros.’ 2018 DC movie is coming off a round of reshoots that occurred in New Zealand in mid-June and involved stars including Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson, according to multiple sources.
This is the third round of reshoots for the movie, directed by James Wan. That is almost an unprecedented number, even for a movie of this scale.
Lost Kingdom has faced several headwinds as it swims toward a Dec. 20 release date. It was postponed several times (it originally was due to bow in December 2022), and like its DC movie brother The Flash, its making has now spanned three regimes at Warners.
The movie was greenlit under the Warners regime led by former film boss Toby Emmerich and his lieutenant, DC Films head Walter Hamada, as a sequel to Aquaman, which proved to be a surprise hit and stands as the highest-grossing DC movie of all time with $1.148 billion.
Principal photography wrapped in January 2022, but by summer, Emmerich was out (Hamada soon followed), both casualties of the merger that created Warner Bros. Discovery.
The movie was in the middle of postproduction and beginning test screenings that summer. While a timeline is not clear, from summer 2022 to the beginning of 2023, The Lost Kingdom underwent two rounds of reshoots and held several uninspiring test screenings.
After one round of test screenings, new Warners film bosses Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy got involved, as they were running point on DC until Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav could find a permanent DC boss to replace Hamada. Sources say that in the fall, Abdy took a strong creative stance and got involved in the editing of one cut. However, when that version tested, it scored lower than the previous version. That led to another round of reshoots.
Different visions of executives notwithstanding, it is unclear what the problems were, but one insider said the issue of story clarity has been an ongoing concern.
Also a concern: Batman.
Hamada wanted Michael Keaton’s version of the character to be akin to Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury in the Marvel movies — an elder statesman who could pop up in various films, including the now-shelved Batgirl, as well as The Lost Kingdom. But shifting release dates muddled things. At one point, The Lost Kingdom was set to open in March 2023, several months before Keaton’s return in June 2023’s The Flash. So in late July 2022, two months after Abdy and De Luca took over Warners, Ben Affleck joined a round of reshoots as Bruce Wayne, to replace a scene Keaton shot. But then the movie was moved again, this time to after Flash, putting Affleck’s appearance in question. The latest cut of the film features neither version of the Dark Knight, according to sources, as new DC heads James Gunn and Peter Safran do not want to promise a movie universe that will not come to fruition, nor tie it down excessively to past failures. “It was pretty chaotic,” said one source.
(And some of the chaos may not have been the studio’s or filmmakers’ fault. Some of the calendar moves were due to overloaded visual effects houses, a phenomenon that occurred during the pandemic and that affected both Flash and Lost Kingdom, causing a cascade of release date pushes.)
More test screenings of cuts occurred in February, and again in April. By this time, Safran, a producer on the first Aquaman as well as The Lost Kingdom, had become co-head of the newly created DC Studios, along with Gunn.
It is unclear how Safran’s transition shifted the movie’s fortunes, if at all. Insiders say that the filmmakers were in the dumps over the seemingly never-ending postproduction process and water-logged test scores. However, the skies may have cleared with the new reshoots.
Gunn is said to have weighed in on the most recent cut, and the leadership approved a five-day shoot. Sources say the shoot went so well that Wan and company completed what they needed in only four.
And to some, the fact that Warners is willing to keep spending money to make the film better shows that the studio has faith in The Lost Kingdom. (In February, according to sources, the filmmakers of Blue Beetle, the other remaining DC movie that was made during the AT&T era and comes out in August, asked for and received two days of additional shooting. Safran had also been a producer on Beetle before his ascension to the executive ranks.)
Lost Kingdom is already an expensive production. It was greenlit at a $205 million budget and shot during the pandemic, which was a burdensome expense on tentpole productions. Additionally, every frame of the movie involves visual effects, another major cost. The reshoots have only raised that overall budget.
Lost Kingdom is the final movie of the DC Extended Universe, which launched a decade ago with Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel. Its December release date approaches as Warners’ DC movies are flopping at an unmatched level. October’s Black Adam, March’s Shazam! Fury of the Gods (also produced by Safran) and last month’s The Flash were money losers in their theatrical runs. Though Gunn and Safran plan on rebooting DC films with Superman: Legacy, that title won’t be out until July 2025. No one wants another miss, and there are questions as to how much more bruising the DC movie brand can take.
The filmmakers and studio know the value that smart postproduction can bring. The first Aquaman was also facing turbulent waves and is said to have found its footing only in post, when a new ending was burnished and the movie tightened to a zippier two hours and 23 minutes.
As for Wan, he was upbeat when he spoke to THR in April as he continued to work on the film: “This movie has something to talk about [climate change], but it’s still a fun action-fantasy movie.”
July 19, 12:24 p.m. Updated to note that the filmmakers of Blue Beetle were given two days of additional photography. A previous version said they were denied those days.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9hcXVhbWFuLWFuZC10aGUtbG9zdC1raW5nZG9tLXJlc2hvb3RzLTEyMzU1MzIxNTgv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy9tb3ZpZS1uZXdzL2FxdWFtYW4tYW5kLXRoZS1sb3N0LWtpbmdkb20tcmVzaG9vdHMtMTIzNTUzMjE1OC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,‘Blue Beetle’ is the superhero DC needs to revive its franchise,"In a sea of repetitive superhero movies, “Blue Beetle” blasts through typical narratives and gives a niche comic book character the center stage he deserves.","DC has found itself back in the good graces of Senior Staff Writer Abbey Elizondo’s after releasing “Blue Beetle.”
In a sea of repetitive superhero movies, “Blue Beetle” blasts through typical narratives and gives a niche comic book character the center stage he deserves.
The movie begins with the ominous excavation of an alien sphere as Victoria Kord, the main villain, tries to extract an alien scarab with infinite power. Separately, Jaime Reyes arrives home after graduating college and is welcomed by his whole family.
Family is at the core of “Blue Beetle” culturally and emotionally for all the characters. Each member of the Reyes family plays a crucial role in the film, which surprised me more than most Marvel film plot twists. But Marvel has never been my favorite for writing intriguing storylines — that’s all on DC.
Combining the acting, plot, villain, themes of political struggles for immigrant families and excellent score, this movie puts DC back in my good graces.
I was hesitant to see this movie, knowing DC’s track record and haphazard plot styles. It's released enough disaster movies in the last five years, “Wonder Woman: 1984” and “Aquaman” being two of the worst. But the writers and director fueled this movie with strength and grief and triumph. I can’t delve into the plot too much without spoiling a good movie.
If you want fun shenanigans, this movie has everything you need for a summer blockbuster. George Lopez is Reyes’ uncle, an eccentric conspiracy theorist with a deep love for his nephew and family. Even after he sees Reyes’ transformation with the blue scarab, the creature that gives Reyes his abilities, he skeptically goes along with his nephew’s mission.
Jenny Kord, the villain’s niece, was also one of my favorite characters, having a strong sense of justice for the harm her family’s military empire had caused. She envies Reyes’ family dynamic and the love he had been shown for years versus the loneliness she felt as an only child. It was a complex concept to place in such a lighthearted film, but DC always adds a darkness to its stories that intrigues me.
Plotting the rich against the poor, that’s an easy plot; having the rich heiress envy a poor immigrant hero because he has a loving family, now that’s more interesting.
This is DC’s chance to reestablish itself in the superhero film industry. If it continues to make movies like “Blue Beetle,” fans of all ages won’t be able to resist such a strong and loveable hero like Jaime Reyes. He’s human, funny and most of all, the superhero we need right now.

,Dune: Part Two delayed until 2024 due to ongoing Hollywood strikes,The delay of Dune: Part Two means it will be out of contention for the Oscars early next year.,"Dune: Part Two delayed until 2024 due to ongoing Hollywood strikes
By Guy Lambert Entertainment reporter
Warner Bros
The first instalment of Dune made just over $400m (£317m) at the worldwide box office
Warner Bros has delayed the planned November release of its big-budget Dune sequel until March 2024.
A spokesperson said the movie would not be released whilst the Hollywood actors' strike was ongoing because its stars cannot promote the movie.
Dune: Part Two, starring Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya, was one of the most anticipated films of 2023.
The new release date means the movie is now out of contention for awards season early next year.
Dune: Part Two is a sci-fi sequel based on Frank Herbert's 1965 novel about the adventures of mythic hero named Paul Atreides.
Alongside Chalamet and Zendaya, the franchises also stars Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin and Stellan Skarsgard.
The first movie in the franchise was a resounding critical success and with a star studded cast including the additions of Florence Pugh, Austin Butler an Christopher Walken, fans' anticipations for Dune: Part Two could not be higher.

But Warner Bros have said with the stars currently striking and unavailable to promote the film, it is reluctant to release it as scheduled for fear of missing out on financial gains.
Since the strikes began, there have been a number of lacklustre opening weekends for movies because of the promotional ban.
Warner Bros superhero movie Blue Beetle opened with $25m (£19.8m), a relatively low figure the studio will be eager not to repeat given the large scale investment in Dune.
The shift in the Warner Brothers release schedule has also caused a delay to other releases, with the studio also announcing today that it's delaying Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire from 15 March to 12 April 2024.
With the first Dune movie amassing over $400m (£317m) at the box office worldwide, the delay to the second instalment will come as a blow to cinema chains still trying to recover from the Covid pandemic.
Hollywood strikes continue
The members of the Writers Guild of America have been striking for several months, fighting for a better deal with Hollywood's studios in the streaming age.
In July, thousands of Hollywood actors from union SAG-AFTRA joined the strike, appearing at picket lines after last-ditch talks between their union and major studios broke down around a major deadline.
The beginning of the strikes saw the cast of Oppenheimer walk out of the movie's premiere in solidarity with their industry colleagues.
Since then, appearances and interviews with the press have been few and far between, with the pause in production having a knock on effect in the industry.

A number of studios have already announced delays to projects amid the ongoing strikes and there is expected to be more to come.
Originally slated for release in March 2024, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse has been delayed indefinitely by Sony, while Disney has also announced a reshuffle of its upcoming Star Wars, Marvel and Avatar films.
Awards season without Dune
In 2021 Denis Villeneuve's first Dune film received 10 Oscar nominations, eventually walking away with six wins on the night in the technical categories of production design, cinematography, film editing, sound, visual effects and original score.
Following the previous success and early buzz around the second instalment, the expectation is the movie would be very competitive those same categories and more.

Dune won six Academy Awards in 2021 (the audio team pictured with their trophies for best sound)
However, the Oscars submission deadline for general categories is 18 November 2023, with preliminary shortlist voting and results announced in December.
The voting period will then run from 11-16 January 2024, with the official nominations announcement on 23 January.
This leaves Dune: Part Two firmly out of the race and the team behind the film will have to wait until 2025 to compete.
The absence of Dune may come as welcome news to other award contenders such as Greta Gerwig's Barbie and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, both tipped for accolades next year after their box office successes this summer.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LWFydHMtNjY2MTU3NTnSAThodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3MvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1hcnRzLTY2NjE1NzU5LmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-11 21:54:17+00:00,SAG-AFTRA’s Duncan Crabtree-Ireland Thinks Warner Bros. Should Delay ‘Blue Beetle’,"SAG-AFTRA chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland has shot down the idea of ""Blue Beetle"" getting a promotion waiver for the cast.","There is a growing concern that “Blue Beetle,” the first superhero movie centered around a Latino character, could see its box office suffer due to the fact that the cast of the film, made up mostly of up-and-comers, cannot promote due to the SAG-AFTRA strike.
However, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator has explained why the film is ineligible for a promotional waiver, telling The Wrap, “We can’t make exceptions to the strike, even if they are well intentioned, because we have to keep the pressure on the company.”
“We have a national Latino actors committee as part of SAG-AFTRA, and we’ve been at the forefront of fighting for increased inclusion and diversity in the film industry in the television industry since the 1970s,” Crabtree-Ireland said. “And we pioneered the American Scene Language and we have proposals in this negotiation that are designed to enhance diversity in the industry and also provide better protections for performers of color.”
Crabtree-Ireland was at Culver City Studios on Friday on the picket lines along with the WGA and PGA. As TheWrap previously reported on Thursday, Latinos make up 2.3% of the leads in theatrically released movies in 2022, according to UCLA’s 2023 Hollywood Diversity Report, and 6.1% of the leads in streaming movies.
Crabtree-Ireland feels the studio should have delayed the release of the movie.
“What I will say is our interim agreements are providing the opportunity for independent features, which often have more exposure for performers of color, including Latinos than studio features,” Crabtree-Ireland said. “I totally recognize how unfortunate it is that the studio has decided to go forward with releasing ‘Blue Beetle’ now, instead of delaying it like they’ve delayed so many other projects so that they can have a proper promotional period. But we’re in a strike for our lives, we have to hold the studio’s accountable.”
However, Warner Brothers Discovery have not “delayed so many other projects.” The company’s dated releases are unchanged and no films have been delayed.
Crabtree-Ireland understands “Blue Beetle” will significantly increase the stats of Latinos in the SAG.
“I call on the studio to decide to delay the release of that project until a time when the actors who deserve to be out there and absolutely deserve to be promoted, can actually participate in that promotion, like they’ve done with so many other projects,” he said.
“Blue Beetle” will be released in theaters on Aug. 18.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL3NhZy1hZnRyYXMtZHVuY2FuLWNyYWJ0cmVlLWlyZWxhbmQtYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

,Blue Beetle director Angel Manuel Soto: 'Gentrification is the real villain of the movie',Angel Manuel Soto spoke to Yahoo UK about his new DC superhero film and why the film's villain isn't Susan Sarandon's Victoria Kord.,"Watch Angel Manuel Soto discusses Blue Beetle
DC's new superhero movie Blue Beetle may have an evil antagonist in Susan Sarandon’s Victoria Kord, yet the story’s true villain is gentrification and home invasion.
“We wanted the stakes to be more on the personal side, not on the global side,” Puerto Rican director Angel Manuel Soto tells Yahoo UK.
“We really wanted to focus on the things that we fear. Growing up, we did not fear alien invasion, we just feared home insecurity, getting food on the table, gentrification, displacement, erasure.
""Those are things that are villains in our daily life.”

Blue Beetle centres on Jaime Reyes, a college graduate who returns home to find out that his family are facing potential eviction from their home.
While working a job to support his family, Reyes accidentally becomes the human host to the Scarab, an alien technology that gives him superpowers. The powerful Victoria Kord then hunts him down, hoping to take Reyes’ superpowers away from him.
“[The smaller stakes] make it more visceral,” Soto says. “It's stuff that you have seen on the news, stuff that can happen next door.

""By doing it that way, I feel like it's a great starting point – so that you get to know where this hero comes from. Now [in the future] you can cheer for him without having to go through all of that again.”

Soto, who was born in Puerto Rico, previously helmed Charm City Kings, a coming-of-age story that premiered at Sundance Film Festival, and led to him landing the Blue Beetle job.
The new movie marks one of the first times a Latino actor, Xolo Maridueña, has led a major live-action superhero movie.

“Historically, Latinos, in movies, have never been shown in this light,” he says.

,'Barbie' Becomes Warner Bros.' Biggest Movie of All Time as It Hits $1.34 Billion at Worldwide Box Office,"Greta Gerwig's 'Barbie,' starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, just became Warner Bros.' biggest movie of all time at the box office","Barbie has just made history — again!
The adventure comedy just hit $1.342 billion at the worldwide box office, according to The Hollywood Reporter, cementing its status as Warner Bros.' highest-earning theatrical release of all time, not adjusted for inflation.
This new feat means Barbie has passed Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, which previously held the title as the studio's biggest release after its 2011 premiere, raking up a total of $1.341 billion in theaters globally.
Barbie's latest financial achievement also comes just days after it passed The Super Mario Bros. Movie as the highest-grossing film of 2023 thus far at the domestic box office, multiple outlets reported Thursday.
The Greta Gerwig-directed film overtook 2008's The Dark Knight as Warner Bros.' highest-earning domestic release ever the previous week, and had already crossed $1 billion at the global box office earlier in August, just over two weeks after its July 21 release.

Starring Margot Robbie in the title role, Barbie led the domestic box office in each of its first four weekends in theaters following its July 21 release up until Blue Beetle, which hit theaters Aug. 18.
The movie's reach has extended beyond theaters, too: Ryan Gosling's song ""I'm Just Ken"" entered the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 87 earlier this month.
Robbie — who produced Barbie with her company LuckyChap Entertainment — previously shared with Collider in an interview before the actors' strike that she claimed her movie would make $1 billion when initially pitching Barbie to the studio.
""I think my pitch in the green-light meeting was the studios have prospered so much when they’re brave enough to pair a big idea with a visionary director,"" the actress, 33, said at the time.
Added Robbie, ""And I was like, 'And now you’ve got Barbie and Greta Gerwig.' And I think I told them that it’d make a billion dollars, which maybe I was overselling, but we had a movie to make, okay?""

As the fantasy comedy movie based on the Mattel doll — which follows Barbie (Robbie) and Ken (Gosling, 42) as they travel to the real world — continues to succeed in movie theaters, Warner Bros. announced Wednesday that it will release Barbie in IMAX theaters for a one-week limited engagement on Sept. 22.
This version of the film will include new footage chosen by director Gerwig, 40.
""So many Barbie fans went on this journey with us, and we can’t thank them enough for supporting the film and sharing their Barbie experience in theaters, across social media, and out in the world,"" she said in a statement.
""We made Barbie for the big screen, so it’s an even bigger thrill to be able to bring it to IMAX, the biggest screen of all,"" Gerwig added. ""And as a special thanks to Barbie fans, we’re excited to share a little bit more of our cast and crew’s incredible work by adding special new footage we hope audiences will enjoy.”

Update: It turns out I’m not the only one who hates the Blue Beetle ad on the Art Museum steps. Everybody does. Read what others have to say here.
Philadelphia Art Museum Steps Get an Advertisement for the New Blue Beetle Movie
On Tuesday, the iconic steps of the world-class Philadelphia Museum of Art were transformed into a giant advertisement for Blue Beetle, an upcoming Warner Bros. movie I had never heard of until this happened. So I guess the advertisement is effective in that sense. We have this movie that most people haven’t heard of and that we can’t use our actors to promote, because of the whole strike thing. So let’s slap a mural advertising it onto the one staircase in Philly that everybody knows: the steps the namesake character runs up triumphantly in Rocky.
So that’s what they did. News cameras actually showed up for this. Getty Images sent a photographer. There were giveaways, of what I’m not exactly sure. People took selfies of themselves sitting on the huge advertisement. No word on how many of them actually bothered to, you know, go inside and see the actual art.
I’m not a fan of this plan. We need to protect public spaces from corporate influence and advertising gimmicks, most of all places like the Art Museum steps, which are so well known and such a gathering place for the community. We’ve seen what happens when you start blurring lines like this: You get a public park shut down and walled up for weeks so somebody can make money selling tickets to a Chinese lantern festival. Chunks of FDR Park are closed to the public for the Flower Show. Maybe Liberty Insurance Company would want to buy an ad on the side of the Liberty Bell?
As for the Blue Beetle: Guy suddenly develops an exoskeleton, fights bad guys. Opens in theaters this Friday. Woo-hoo.
Developing Story: Kensington Police Shooting
On Monday, a Philadelphia cop shot and killed a man in Kensington after police pursued him for a traffic stop, with the cops claiming he was driving erratically. Soon after that shooting, police said that the cop only shot the man after the man got out of the car, ignored commands, and lunged at an officer with a knife. But now, police are changing their tune. The Philadelphia Police Department now says the man police shot and killed was inside his car at the time the cop pulled the trigger, and they’re not saying whether he ignored commands or lunged. The cops involved were reportedly wearing bodycams that were live at the time, so we can only imagine we’ll have more on this one soon.
Father of Teenage Philly Terror Suspect Speaks
West Philly lawyer Qawi Abdul-Rahman didn’t exactly want to talk to me when I asked him about the arrest of his 17-year-old son on terrorism charges. (You can read about my interaction with him here.) But he did want to talk to the Daily Beast. (I’m so offended, Qawi!)
One thing a lot of people have been wondering is: How could a father not know his son was talking to overseas terrorists and plotting to build bombs, as prosecutors have alleged?
“I didn’t see it coming at all,” Abdul-Rahman, who just ran for Common Pleas Court judge in Philadelphia, told the publication. “I go to court because I want people to know that Muslims are out here doing things in the community, for the community. I’m an American like everyone else.”
Interesting that he didn’t adopt the usual “Not my son, my son is a good boy” approach.
Local Talent
One of the most anticipated movies this fall is Maestro, a Leonard Bernstein biopic directed by and starring none other than Jenkintown heartthrob Bradley Cooper. There’s already a bunch of Oscar buzz about Cooper’s performance. And now we have a taste of what the movie will look like thanks to this trailer:
I’ve never been a huge Bradley Cooper fan. But a Leonard Bernstein fan I am. And I’m enthused! Not everyone is, though. Some have accused Cooper of “Jewface” thanks to the prosthetic nose he wears to look more like Bernstein.
Speaking of music that’s better than it needs to be, David Devan has been with Opera Philadelphia since 2006 and the head of the group since 2011. But now, he’s stepping down at the end of the upcoming season. He’s chosen not to renew his contract.
It’s a true loss for Opera Philadelphia, as Devan has really transformed the company from a yawn-inducing classical performance group into an innovative organization that’s been able to draw younger crowds and carry opera in Philadelphia into the future. One of his simplest changes: renaming the group from the mouthy and overly formal Opera Company of Philadelphia to just Opera Philadelphia. (I would have gone with Opera Philly, but maybe that would have been one step too close to all-out anarchy.)
Opera Philadelphia has created close to 20 entirely new operas under Devan’s leadership. He even once paired renowned mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe with beloved Philadelphia drag queen Martha Graham Cracker in a show/dance party at the TLA. Stodgy no more! News of his departure comes amid budget and staffing cuts at Opera Philadelphia.

Boston Bosties. Meantime, in Toronto, the Blue Jays had lefty Yusei Kikuchi on the mound, pitted against Zack Wheeler, and both had near-perfect early innings, with the former allowing an Edmundo Sosa single in the third and one by Bryson Stott in the fifth, and the latter giving up a walk in the second and a single in the fourth. My esteemed colleague Victor sent me a message saying the game was boring, and I introduced him to the concept of a “pitcher’s duel.” He was not impressed.
In the sixth, finally, Sosa got his second single, and rookie Johan Rojas doubled up the left-field line to bring him home. In the bottom half, Whit Merrifield reprised the single, and a Wheeler walk to Brandon Belt put men on first and second. Wheels got a double play next, but a George Springer single tied it at 1-1. With Yimi Garcia in for Kikuchi, Stott walked in the seventh and stole second but was stranded there. In the eighth, Jordan Hicks subbed for Garcia and struck out Cave, Rojas and Schwarbs. Seranthony came in for us, and the Jays got a walk, a single and another walk to load them before Springer hit a grounder that Bohm somehow got to home for the second out.

Alas, Seranthony then whacked Cavan Biggio with a pitch to bring home a run. That was enough for him; Jeff Hoffman came in. He held the line, but … could the Phils take the lead back in the ninth? Nope. We lose, 2-1. Thanks, Seranthony.
And in Doop News …
Some dude named Messy (?) came to Subaru Park in Chester for the semifinals in the Leagues Cup, and people got really excited and put on dumb-looking pink shirts in his honor and paid too much for tickets and like that. The Union weren’t exactly favored, and that was probably the right call, since Inter Miami scored three minutes into the game. Talk about discouraging. Then the Messy One notched one, 20 minutes in:

Sigh. And one more by Jordi Alba in stoppage before the half. We almost got one at 60 minutes, but nah, their goalie just got a finger on it. And so close again at 66! But Miami came even closer two minutes later. At 72 minutes, finally, a vindicating goal by old head Alejandro Bedoya. Doop! No one could say we didn’t fight back and have chances. But it was Miami that scored again, at 83 minutes. On to the finals for them. Staying home for us.

2023-08-21 17:00:04+00:00,'Blue Beetle' Director Ángel Manuel Soto to Direct 'The Wrecking Crew' at MGM,"""Blue Beetle"" director Ángel Manuel Soto has found his next studio project and will direct ""The Wrecking Crew"" at MGM.","Coming off a number one debut this weekend for “Blue Beetle,” director Ángel Manuel Soto has found his next studio project and will direct “The Wrecking Crew” at MGM, TheWrap has exclusively learned.
“The Wrecking Crew” was written by Jonathan Topper prior to the WGA strike. Additionally, Topper’s deal was negotiated and closed prior to the WGA strike.
Plot details are being kept under wraps, but the project is being described as a buddy action movie.
Dave Bautista, Jason Momoa are being eyed to headline “The Wrecking Crew” and both were in talks to star prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike. The duo initially set up the project in 2021, and after a bidding war, the project landed at MGM.
Ángel Manuel Soto is a director, producer, and screenwriter known for bold telling stories that highlight diverse characters from a variety of backgrounds. Most recently, Soto directed “Blue Beetle,” a DC Films/Warner Bros feature film that stars Susan Sarandon, George Lopez, Xolo Maridueña, and Harvey Guillén, which opened to #1 at box office over the weekend hauling in $25 million.
“Blue Beetle” follows the story of Jaime Reyes, a Mexican-American teenager, and is the first DC film and the first live-action film to feature a Latino superhero as the lead.
In 2020, Soto’s film “Charm City Kings” premiered during Sundance Film Festival and won the U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Best Ensemble Cast. Barry Jenkins and Sherman Payne wrote the script with a cast starring Jahi Winston, Teyonah Parris, Will Catlett, and introduced Meek Mill to his acting debut.
Soto is also co-writing a “Transformers” spin-off for Paramount Pictures, which he is attached to direct. Recently, Soto produced and directed the limited doc series “Menudo Forever Young,” which just premiered on HBO Max. He is developing an animated/live-action hybrid for Paramount Pictures with Ryan Reynolds starring and producing. He currently has a series in development at Amazon, which he is co-creating with Gareth Dunnett Alcocer. Juno Diaz and Borderless Pictures are executive producing.
A native of Puerto Rico, Ángel Manuel Soto discovered soccer and boxing at an early age, which inspired his first film “El Pugil,” an homage to the kids he had grown up with and the power of sports in economically repressed communities. Angel pursued his interest in art, studying architecture and eventually documentary filmmaking and writing.
He began his career in entertainment as a TV producer and later focused on art direction at a local advertising agency. He made his feature directorial debut with “La Granga” (The Farm), which sheds a thought-provoking light on the tough realities facing the people of Puerto Rico. He went on to create several groundbreaking narrative VR pieces such as “Dinner Party” and “Bashir’s Dream,” which have premiered to critical success at festivals.
Soto is repped at CAA, Redefine Entertainment, Herrera-Reiss Strategies and Behr Abramson Levy Johnson.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL2FuZ2VsLW1hbnVlbC1zb3RvLXRoZS13cmVja2luZy1jcmV3LWRpcmVjdG9yLWJsdWUtYmVldGxlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-09-05 17:36:15+00:00,How Much Would WGA's Proposal Cost Warner Bros. Discovery?,"WBD blames ongoing strikes to cost the company $500 million, but the WGA says that ending the strike would only cost them a fraction of that loss.","As the Writers Guild of America continues to strike, studios are slowly starting to feel the heat.
The Hollywood Reporter states that Warner Bros. Discovery has lowered its 2023 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization forecast from $11.0 billion-$11.5 billion to $10.5 billion-$11.0 billion. This is a $300 million-$500 million loss. This change was made due ""to the impact of the strikes,"" according to WBD’s filing.
On Tuesday, CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels didn't go into detail about when the strikes could possibly end but did say, “Uncertainty in the studio segment has increased with the dual strikes. This may have implications for the timing and performance of the remainder of the film slate as well as our ability to produce and deliver content. And while we are hoping for a fast resolution, our modeling assumes a return-to-work date in early September. Should the strikes run through the end of the year, I would expect several hundred million dollars of incremental upside to our free cash flow guidance and some incremental downside for adjusted EBITDA.”
“While WBD is hopeful that these strikes will be resolved soon, it cannot predict when the strikes will ultimately end,"" WBD said in its filing update. ""With both guilds still on strike today, the company now assumes the financial impact to WBD of these strikes will persist through the end of 2023.""
After the story was published, WGA East published on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the studios could resolve this loss of $300-$500 million dollars by agreeing to the WGA's proposal, which would cost WBD an estimated $45 million a year.
Agreeing to the WGA’s proposal would cost Warner Bros. Discovery an estimated $45M a year… #WGAstrike https://t.co/gR7H5yWd72 pic.twitter.com/QzgIBzSbgP
— Writers Guild of America, East (@WGAEast) September 5, 2023
Although WBD states that the company would like to resolve the strikes quickly, the simple and fair solution is not the one they want to choose. Rather than pay writers $45 million a year, the company seems eager to point a finger at the strikes to blame for its quarterly loss of $500 million. But noney is not the issue that is prolonging any deal between the WGA and studios and streamers in the AMPTP.
While proper compensation is high on the list of priorities for the WGA, it seems that the snag in negotiations is around artificial intelligence and how it will impact writers in Hollywood. We don't know the details in full, but we will keep you updated on any movement in the WGA negotiations.

To better understand the demand for 8K content, Samsung and Warner Bros. trialed their partnership by showcasing the “Creed III” trailer across more than 450 retail stores in the United States and Europe earlier this year. This garnered significant attention and enthusiasm from audiences worldwide. Since then, Samsung and Warner Bros. have worked together to expand the program. Now, shoppers globally will be able to see Samsung Neo QLED 8K in action with an appealing lineup of high-profile content, including trailers for upcoming films such as “Barbie,” “Blue Beetle,” “Dune: Part Two,” “Wonka,” and “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.”

2023-07-22 13:41:13+00:00,"Warner Bros. Biggest Movie Faces Imminent Delay, Report Says - Inside the Magic",Warner Bros. Discovery isn't looking too hot with reports that their biggest movie of the year might not even release soon.,"Warner Bros. might just allow one of their top movies not to release this year after generating immense excitement for the film.
Over the past year, it’s clear Warner Bros. Discovery needs a win. After their merger, the company has been plagued with issues. Rebranding their streaming platform. Cutting costs in every way imaginable. Removing thousands of shows from their network and selling assets to the highest bidder just so they can stay afloat.
Some of their movies last year had to be delayed for one reason. The money required to market the movie was too immense for Warner Bros. Discovery that they spaced their films out. Most of the line up have been box office flops, with DC barely scratching at the surface at what Marvel Studios makes.
Now, Warner Bros just released Greta Gerwig’s Barbie (2023) which has been a huge financial success for the company. Opening with a strong preview box office, the movie starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling might save the day for the company and help ease the financial burden of The Flash (2023), which made the company lose millions.
Coming up, Warner Bros. has Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023), Blue Beetle (2023), and Dune Part Two, which are huge chances for the company to soften the earlier blows at the box office, but something stands in the way of imminent success.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, Dune Part Two (2023) might be releasing next year. Why? The SAG-AFTRA Strikes could hurt the box office, and the company would rather not repeat their mistakes again:
Due to the ongoing strikes, Warner Bros. is considering pushing ‘DUNE: PART TWO’ to 2024. ‘AQUAMAN AND THE LOST KINGDOM’ & ‘THE COLOR PURPLE’ are also being considered for delays.

Dune Part Two is Denis Villeneuve’s second part of the epic saga told in live-action. Dune Part One (2021) received outstanding praise from fans, which is why the sequel is something fans are looking forward to. While it’s easy to get upset at the strike, Warner Bros. is obviously going to release the movie when it can most benefit them, and paying more money to actors and writers and everything who works on movies is not on their current agenda.
If the strikes don’t end soon, Dune Part Two might be the first of many films waiting for the right moment to release, and that’s a shame for the studios not seeing how the strikes will hurt them either way.
Dune Part Two releases on November 3, 2023.

On the surface it looks like a mustachioed man in cargo shorts attempting to hype us all up for the upcoming Blue Beetle flick. But take a closer look. Everything seems normal right? Just a spooky looking blue did in a suit of future-armor with some Tokyo Ghoul-looking tendrils coming out of his back right? What about the materials to the figure’s right? Again, nothing special. Just some Blue Beetle comics. Has anyone even read those? I’m not so sure. Still, it’s all perfectly mundane…
Or is it…
You’re gonna have to open the image on Twitter’s website (I’d rather go to Mordor) to see parts cropped out in the embedded tweet above, but it’s there! Look just under the “C” of the DC logo and what’s that? It’s the Batgirl logo! So what? SO WHAT!? THE ONCE-UPCOMING BATGIRL FILM WAS CANCELED BY DC AND YET THEY COULDN’T EVEN TAKE THE LOGO OFF THE MARKETING MATERIALS?
HOW IS MORE POOR HEART SUPPOSED TO SUFFER THIS ABUSE?
I wanted to see Batgirl. We ALL wanted to see Batgirl. “FINALLY”, we thought in all-caps, “THE MEMBER OF THE BAT-FAMILY WHO GETS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF HYPE GETS HER OWN MOVIE” BUT NO. WE WERE DENIED THE JOY OF SEEING A LIVE-ACTION BATGIRL BY HOLLYWOOD EXECUTIVES WHO SAID THE FILM WAS “NOT RELEASABLE”. I wailed and gnashed my teeth for WEEKS.
And now I’ve FINALLY gotten over my trauma and realized that I can live in a world without a Batgirl adaptation. OR SO I THOUGHT. But NO. Seeing this Batgirl logo has once again opened up the floodgates of my heart and all my grief is pouring out once more.
Next time, Warner Bros., if you intend to retraumatize me, at least send me a check in the mail for THERAPY before you do.
This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, the work being covered here wouldn’t exist.

According to studio estimates, “Barbie” has made $575.4 million at the American box office as of Thursday, edging past Mario’s domestic haul of $574.2 million.
“Barbie’s” run to the top was faster than “Mario’s,” reaching the record-breaking title in only 34 days since its release. It took Mario, Luigi and the gang 138 days to cross the $574.2 million benchmark in the United States, according to Deadline.
Since premiering July 21, “Barbie” has broken numerous records. The film made $155 million domestically in its opening weekend, marking the largest opening weekend of the year and the biggest-ever debut for a female director. In the weeks to follow, it also was crowned Warner Bros. Discovery’s highest-grossing domestic release, beating the former title holder, the 2008 blockbuster, “The Dark Knight.”
Last week, “Barbie” had also crossed the $1.2 billion mark globally, after hitting the $1 billion milestone less than three weeks ago — a feat achieved by only about 50 films in history, adjusted for inflation, Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, previously told CNN. It also placed director Greta Gerwig as the highest-grossing female movie director in history.
The movie’s reign at the top of the box office came to an end last weekend, when “Blue Beetle” unseated “Barbie.” The newest DC superhero film grossed an estimated $25.4 million, while “Barbie” slipped to second, bringing in $21.5 million, according to studio estimates.
“Barbie” and “Blue Beetle” are distributed by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.

Barbie did not initially play in most IMAX theaters across the U.S. after it opened the same day as Christopher Nolan's film Oppenheimer, creating the fan-driven 'Barbenheimer' phenomenon. Oppenheimer shattered several records for IMAX attendance.
Barbie has surpassed $1 billion at the worldwide box office. Last week, it overtook 2008's The Dark Knight as Warner Bros.' highest-earning domestic release ever.

Pictures' upcoming movie, 'Blue Beetle.'","Inka Magnaye to voice the Scarab in the Philippine release of Warner Bros. Pictures' upcoming movie, ""Blue Beetle."" Shiela Reyes, ABS-CBN News
MANILA -- Voice talent Inka Magnaye is still in cloud nine weeks since she first learned that she will voice the Scarab in the Philippine release of Warner Bros. Pictures' upcoming movie, ""Blue Beetle.""
“[I learned about it when I got] an email from Warner Bros. I didn’t see the email myself because I have my wonderful team behind me doing that. They sent the email to our chat group without anything, just the screenshot of the email. And then I looked at it, I was a little confused. I’m like, ‘What? Oh my gosh! This is real!’” she said in a press conference on Wednesday.
Magnaye said she was on a high for the next few days and even until now.
“It’s sinking in little by little. I don’t even know if I am fully here. At the back of my head, there is an Inka going, ‘Is this really happening? I am dreaming right?’”
Magnaye said discovering that she was personally selected for the role made it even more significant.
“We had a call with Warner Bros. I was like, ‘Yeah. Okay!’ It made my year. They wanted me from the very beginning of everything,” she said.
While she did her regular physical preparation for the role, given her familiarity doing voiceovers, she felt that she needed to invest more effort into her mental preparation given how big this project is.
“It was quite the same as any other voice over gig but also with the knowledge and understanding that it was the biggest. I was walking into that studio conditioning myself to be like, ‘Okay, let’s get this voice right because this is the recording. There’s no do-over here after this is done.’ So I did a lot of trying to look for my most-AI voice because that’s something that I like to do,” she said.
“It’s more of the mental preps knowing that this is going to be the biggest project I’ve ever taken on so far. This is going to make waves. There’s a different kind of responsibility knowing that I am the first ever Philippine-based Filipino talent that DC is going to get for their superhero movie,” she added.
When she lent her voice to the Scarab, Magnaye said the biggest challenge was how to set her voice apart from all the other voices in superhero movies.
“I’d like to put a mark on that. I want people to set that apart from others. I think to make it sound more personal while making it sound synthetic is the challenge there – finding the balance to do that.”
Magnaye will voice the Scarab, described by Warner Bros. Philippines in a statement as ""an ancient alien relic pivotal to the titular DC Super Hero's story.""
Called Khaji-Da, the Scarab is voiced by singer-actress Becky G in the original version of the movie.
According to Warner Bros. Philippines, Magnaye is the first Philippine-based Filipino talent to do voiceover work in a DC film.
The movie will come out in theaters nationwide on August 16.

Angel Manuel Soto Doubles Down On Promoting ‘Blue Beetle’ With Identity Politics, Questions If It Was Possible To Have A Latino Superhero On A Times Square Billboard
Xolo Maridueña as Blue Beetle in Blue Beetle (2023), Warner Bros. Pictures
Angel Manuel Soto, the director of Blue Beetle, continued to market the film through identity politics by recently questioning if it was possible to have a Latino superhero on Times Square billboard.
Speaking with TheWrap, Soto stated, “I’m very happy that finally we’re able to see how the whole promotion is being manifested.”
He then specifically pointed to the film’s promotion in Times Square in New York City, “Us seeing a Latino superhero of our own in Times Square is something that, if were think about it, is that even possible? Now it’s happening!”
Soto continued, “Being able to not only be promoted in the areas where our community transmits, but to also be up there with the other big posters and the big movies just shows you the power that we have and that we can also be the heroes that we know we can be.”
RELATED: Bane Creator Graham Nolan Reacts To ‘Blue Beetle’ Director Claiming The Character Represents American Interventionism In Latin America
To no one’s surprise, Soto’s comments are completely devoid from reality in an attempt to paint the Latino community as some kind of victims who are unable to get advertisements on Times Square billboards.
Just how devoid from reality are they? In 2022, Marvel Studios promoted Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and their race replaced Namor with huge billboards in Times Square. Actor Tenoch Huerta even shared the billboards to his Twitter account.

Outside of superheroes, The Walt Disney Company purchased Times Square billboards in 2021 to promote their West Side Story film, which features the Puerto Rican gang the Sharks who vie for dominance against the white gang, the Jets.

One Twitter user back in December 2021 shared an image of the West Side Story promotion on the New York Marriot Marquis, which is located in Times Square.

RELATED: Report: ‘Blue Beetle’ To Feature Illegal Immigration Allegory

This isn’t the first time Soto attempted to use identity politics to promote the film. The director confirmed the film features an illegal immigration allegory.

The outlet MovieMaker detailed, “Before the movie begins, the family has immigrated to America from Mexico, but [Jamie Reyes’ father] Alberto doesn’t have documentation, so he’s under the constant threat of deportation.”

“Though the film doesn’t depict an ICE raid, it does include a scene that echoes one,” MovieMaker added. “Kord Industries invades the family’s home in a scene that can play as just another dramatic moment in a superhero movie – or be taken as symbolic of events that tear apart real families.”

Soto confirmed this scene in the film does indeed exist and that it’s an allegory for illegal immigration. He told MovieMaker, “There is a history that exists before an ICE raid. A history that includes traveling miles, and danger, working hard, becoming a family, creating memories, and thinking that everything is going to be okay.”

“But all of a sudden, everything that you have fought for, everything that you have worked for, everything that you have built, is now burning. I needed the depiction to be triggering, because it’s the experience of many,” he continued.

The scene likely includes a racial context given Susan Sarandon previously described her Victoria Kord charcter as the “white military industrial complex” in an interview with Jimmy Fallon in September 2022.

Sarandon stated, “What’s fabulous about [Blue Beetle] is it’s the first Latinx hero that has his own movie. Even better all of the Mexican — because his family is Mexican and all the actors were Mexican and it’s in Spanish so it’s subtitled.””

Sarandon then shared, “I’m, of course, the bad guy. I’m the white military industrial complex.”

“So I had a fabulous time because there’s nothing better than being bad,” she added.

RELATED: ‘Blue Beetle’ Director Says DC Villain Bane Represents The “Unknown Or Forgotten Or Brushed Under The Rug History Of Interventionism In Latin America And The Caribbean”

Soto also detailed that the film’s supervillain Carapax is a representation of interventionism in Latin America and the Caribbean.

He told The Playlist, that he sees the character of Bane in this regard, but did not know on whether he would get to work on the character so he took his ideas for Bane and applied them to Blue Beetle’s Carapax.

First, Soto explained his ideas for Bane, “As far as Bane goes, the comics that are about Bane’s story, it felt like he’s very misunderstood much like Carapax in the movie. He is a product of his environment and that history has been buried. The history of the Caribbean, the Antilles. It’s a history that’s brushed off in history books.”

“So for me, it was very important to be seen,” he continued. “And with the character of Bane, the formation of this villain, I think in his own right, he’s also a hero in his story. So whether whatever happens at the end that might have gotten distorted because of what was done to him, I think that what he represents is a lot of the unknown, or forgotten, or brushed under the rug history of interventionism in Latin America and the Caribbean.”

He later revealed he took what he viewed as Bane’s backstory and grafted it on to Carapax in the Blue Beetle film, “But while working on the character of Carapax, I was like, ‘Well, I don’t know if I’ll ever make a Bane movie. Let me take what I loved about Bane, about the backstory that I wanted to explore and let’s give it to Carapax.’ Because part of the idea was that maybe Carapax and Bane came from the same place. Maybe!? I mean Pago Island, right?”

Soto then explained the importance of taking his perceived version of Bane’s backstory and applying it to Carapax, “Because we need it. When we’re introduced to the world in movies, right, where we are seen as villains, it’s just given that we are born that way.”

“And when we talk about the history of Latin America, nobody dares to question, well, what happened before. Okay, well what happened before? More times than none when you go back even before 1954, but if we want to go to 1954 in Guatemala it was U.S. interventionism that drove these places to the miseries that they’re in.”

RELATED: ‘Blue Beetle’ Actor Xolo Maridueña Says Goal Of Film Is To Tell People That Hispanics Can Be Superheroes

It’s quite likely that Soto’s constant promotion of the film through identity politics and victimhood status is turning moviegoers away from the film. According to Box Office Pro’s latest projections the film is only expected to have an opening weekend between $20 million and $27 million domestically. The outlet also believes the film will only gross between $45 million and $87 million in its entire domestic run.

These predictions are a significant increase from Box Office Pro’s original long-range predictions. The outlet originally predicted the movie would bring in between $12 million and $17 million in its domestic opening weekend and only $27 million and $55 million in its entire domestic run.

However, these new numbers are still very bad given the film has an estimated production budget of $120 million. That means the movie needs to make at least $300 million globally to break even.

What do you make of Soto questioning if it was possible to have a Latino superhero or character on a Times Square billboard in New York City? What do you make of his constant promotion of this film through identity politics and victimhood?

The abrupt departure of Henry Cavill from the role of Superman was a shock to many DC fans, especially after Black Adam (2022) teased a face-off between the Man of Steel and Dwayne Johnson’s magically empowered anti-hero. However, James Gunn’s new vision for the DCU includes very little of Zack Snyder’s abortive DC Extended Universe, including its central superhero actor.

It turns out that not everyone involved in the DCU is quite as ready to sweep the Snyderverse into oblivion. In particular, Blue Beetle director Angel Manuel Soto says that the Henry Cavill version of Superman has a part in his upcoming superhero movie.

‘Blue Beetle’ and Henry Cavill

In a recent interview with Nestor Bentancor, the Blue Beetle director revealed that the upcoming movie starring Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes will involve the Henry Cavill version of Superman.

Specifically, Angel Manuel Soto says that his movie will directly reference Man of Steel (2013), the first film to star Henry Cavill as Superman, and the kickoff of Zack Snyder’s chaotic attempt to wrangle the lore of DC Comics. Apparently, Soto is a huge fan of Snyder’s movies and has incorporated some elements of it into Blue Beetle.

The director specifically says that “Waking up in Mexico to the news that [Zack] Snyder wants to see it too, a director that I respect so much, that his films are an immense influence… Even in Blue Beetle, there are some references to Man of Steel that we made out of honor and respect for the work and art of Zack Snyder. Also, seeing David Ayer sharing it… It’s like, ‘WOW, brother!’ How nice it feels to have that support from people that one respects and that the fans also respect.”

Soto does not say exactly how Henry Cavill’s Superman will be referenced, which opens up a whole lot of possibilities. Will we get Susan Sarandon referencing General Zod’s (Michael Shannon) attack on Metropolis, as recently seen in The Flash (2023)? Will Xolo Maridueña have a poster of Cavill on his bedroom wall? Will we get to see Superman through archival footage? Only time will tell.

‘Superman: Legacy’ or ‘Blue Beetle’

Blue Beetle has a confusing status in James Gunn’s DCU. While the DC Studios creative head has explicitly said the movie is part of his franchise reboot, he has also said that his upcoming Superman: Legacy will basically be the new starting point of the DCU, leaving it with a foot in both the past and the future.

Related: Andrew Garfield and Henry Cavill Lost Millions Over One Glaring Mistake

The news that Blue Beetle will look back to Henry Cavill as Superman and the past movies that James Gunn is working overtime to move past makes it seem like the movie might be more aligned with Zack Snyder’s old canon than Gunn’s new one.

It is likely that whatever references to Henry Cavill and Superman that Blue Beetle makes will be the last we may get to see of his variant of the last Kryptonian, so we’ll have to enjoy it while we can.

2023-08-18 05:30:00+02:00,"‘Blue Beetle’, la película de superhéroes que nadie espera que triunfe (aunque se haya ganado a la crítica)",El último proyecto de DC para Warner ha sufrido diversos cambios de rumbo del estudio y se estrena con campaña comercial bajo mínimos,"El Escarabajo Azul no es uno de los personajes más famosos de DC y tampoco está claro que su popularidad, a diferencia de lo ocurrido con otros héroes, vaya a crecer mucho tras su adaptación cinematográfica, que se estrena hoy en cines. No necesariamente es un problema de la película: historia de orígenes más que correcta, con un sólido actor principal (Xolo Maridueña, la estrella juvenil de Cobra Kai), así como toques de Spider-Man en su dimensión familiar y vecinal o de Iron Man en características y poderes del protagonista, pero con personalidad propia. Y con gracia en el modo en el que abraza la mexicanidad del superhéroe y de su rico entorno. Blue Beetle, sin embargo, llega este viernes a las salas tras una campaña publicitaria tímida, poco propia de una producción con un presupuesto estimado en 120 millones de dólares y, definitivamente, lejos del despliegue visto hace solo dos meses con Flash, la anterior película de superhéroes estrenada por Warner.

Los lazos entre la película dirigida por el puertorriqueño Ángel Manuel Soto y el resto del universo compartido de DC no se han hecho explícitos en la promoción, y el motivo es que no están muy claros. Blue Beetle contiene referencias muy de pasada a Superman y un chiste sobre Batman, pero son los espectadores quienes, de momento, tendrán que decidir qué caras les ponen a esos superhéroes: si las de Henry Cavill y Ben Affleck, actores titulares en la cancelada saga de la Liga de la Justicia, la del Superman que se estrenará en 2025 –y que inaugurará oficialmente el nuevo universo– o la del George Clooney de Batman y Robin (1997), restituido como giro cómico en Flash. Por lo pronto, el cineasta James Gunn, jefe creativo de DC Studios desde finales de 2022, ha explicado que la película está oficialmente desconectada del resto del universo cinematográfico y que Blue Beetle es el primer personaje de la nueva serie, si bien, por confuso que pueda resultar, ello no convierte a la producción en el primer episodio de dicha saga.

El héroe de la película, Blue Beetle: mitad humano, mitad escarabajo del espacio. Warner Bros (ZUMAPRESS.com / Cordon Press)

Hablar de maltrato a la película puede, sin embargo, no resultar del todo correcto. El pasado verano, el estudio decidió no estrenar Batgirl, largometraje protagonizado por Leslie Grace y el oscarizado Brendan Fraser, como heroína y villano respectivamente, y que contaba con la vuelta –al igual que en Flash– de Michael Keaton como Batman. Ya estaba rodada y tenían la fecha reservada para ese mismo 2022 en HBO Max. El motivo oficial de su desaparición: un cambio de estrategia para dar más valor a la marca, con estrenos exclusivos en cines y no en streaming. Concebida también originalmente para la plataforma, Blue Beetle sí ha logrado salvarse de la quema. Pero el perfil bajo de su promoción ha molestado a algunos sectores de aficionados, especialmente entre la comunidad hispanoamericana, puesto que Jaime Reyes, el muchacho que recibe los poderes del Escarabajo Azul, es el primer héroe latino de DC. Estos seguidores han reaccionado a la falta de marketing impulsando el meme “Blue Beetle 18 de agosto solo en cines” en redes sociales para revestirla del carácter de evento que Warner no le ha dado.

Otros memes que ha generado la película van por el lado contrario, con bromas sobre el vacío generalizado en la reserva online en las salas para mofarse de la falta de interés en la millonaria producción. Se diría que todos estos precedentes forman la crónica de un fracaso anunciado, pero la imprevisible evolución cinematográfica seguida por DC invita a, mejor, pronosticar lo menos posible. La primera sorpresa es que Blue Beetle ya ha contado, a diferencia de esfuerzos anteriores del estudio, con una positiva recepción de la crítica. De tener un comportamiento digno en taquilla o que los generosos guiños a la cultura latina (como sus referencias a El Chapulín Colorado o la transformación inicial del héroe a ritmo de El rey de Vicente Fernández) terminen de convertirla en un fenómeno comunitario, no está claro que el imprevisto vaya a suponer una alegría o más bien el enésimo quebradero de cabeza para el estudio de cara al bosquejo de sus complejos planes de futuro.

Diseñar un universo

“Creo que en DC se precipitaron, no tuvieron paciencia y fueron excesivamente ambiciosos nada más empezar su universo cinematográfico”, opina, consultado por ICON, el dibujante de cómics Rodrigo Zayas. Con El hombre de acero (2013) como primera piedra, el conocido como Universo Expandido de DC echó a andar enfrentando a sus dos héroes más icónicos ya en la segunda entrega, Batman v. Superman: El amanecer de la justicia (2016). “El universo de Marvel empezó después de que en Iron Man [2008] añadiesen, casi como broma, una escena poscréditos con Samuel L. Jackson haciendo de Nick Furia para ver lo que pasaba”, continúa Zayas. “La jugada salió bien, así que siguieron creciendo. Para llegar a Vengadores: Infinity War [2018] o Endgame [2019], han recorrido un periplo de años. DC quiso llegar muy rápido al éxito de Marvel y obtener los mismos resultados en la mitad de tiempo, creyendo que, como el subgénero estaba muy asentado, podían saltarse los pasos previos. Pero los códigos narrativos, al final, son los que son. Todo tiene unos ritmos, el público espera ver una evolución de los personajes”.

Para el ilustrador, otro factor de peso en la accidentada composición del universo DC estriba en el director que llevó sus riendas durante años. “DC realizó una propuesta audiovisual y estética marcada por la personalidad de Zack Snyder [autor de El hombre de acero y Batman v. Superman], que difería muchísimo de lo que estaba haciendo Marvel”, explica. “A mí personalmente me resultaba muy interesante, pero aquello chocó con las preferencias del público que consume de forma mayoritaria este tipo de películas”. Precisamente, el decepcionante desempeño en taquilla de la segunda película ya provocó un cambio de rumbo en el mismo año 2016 con Escuadrón suicida, remontada para alejarla del tono oscuro que el director David Ayer, a priori, le había impreso. La maniobra para convertir el universo DC en algo más simpático se consumó en Liga de la Justicia (2017), película iniciada por Snyder, que abandonó el proyecto a consecuencia del suicidio de su hija, y reconstruida por Joss Whedon, precisamente el director de Los Vengadores (2012) de Marvel.

Aquel fue el punto de ruptura entre DC y el grueso de sus aficionados. Los seguidores de Zack Snyder, alguien cuyo peso comercial andaba en entredicho pero que sabía movilizar a las redes, presionaron para conseguir el estreno de un montaje de Liga de la Justicia tal y como su director original la había creado, victoria que finalmente obtuvieron, vía HBO Max, en 2021. Snyder, que incluso ganó los dos Oscar del público que la Academia inauguró (y clausuró) para su edición de 2022 mediante votaciones online, fue acusado después de utilizar bots para ejercer presión contra Warner y efectuar amenazas de boicot organizado. Entre tanto, Dwayne Johnson, sobre cuya Black Adam (2022) recaía la responsabilidad de poner orden en el universo cinematográfico de DC, contentó a esa base de aficionados mediante la incorporación sorpresa de Henry Cavill, el anterior Superman, para una escena final. De nuevo, no fue suficiente para la taquilla.

“La jerarquía de poder en DC está a punto de cambiar” fue la precipitada frase que Johnson dijo antes del estreno de aquella película. Estaba en lo cierto, solo que la persona que iba a situarse en lo alto de esa jerarquía no sería él: con el ascenso final de James Gunn, otro director de la cantera de Marvel (ha sido, entre 2014 y 2023, el responsable de la trilogía de Guardianes de la Galaxia), llegó el final del universo narrativo anterior y el anuncio de un reinicio completo, que comenzará con Superman: Legacy, firmada por él mismo, en 2025.

El siguiente problema para Warner está en los vestigios. Flash, cuyo personaje principal fue presentado en Batman v. Superman, vio unida a su tormentoso desarrollo la retahíla de escándalos de su protagonista, Ezra Miller, con un historial delictivo, de conducta violenta y acusaciones que van del robo a los abusos sexuales, pasando por la conformación de una secta. Se calcula que su fracaso este 2023 ha hecho perder 200 millones de dólares a Warner. En diciembre, tras múltiples retrasos, está previsto que llegue a cines otra producción del anterior régimen, Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom, secuela de Aquaman (2018), cuyo papel en el nuevo orden de las cosas también es, como mínimo, intrincado. En un nuevo ejercicio de equilibrismo, para evitarse la mala imagen de un estudio estrenando nuevas entregas de una serie ya cancelada, Gunn ha dicho que Aquaman 2, como Blue Beetle, es también parte del nuevo universo (aunque el inicio vaya a seguir siendo su futuro Superman). Entre tanto, con el estreno de Blue Beetle, Zack Snyder ya ha golpeado a Warner en el punto débil, su aparente falta de interés en la comunidad latina, tras anunciar en Twitter que iría con sus hijos a verla junto al hashtag #RepresentationMatters (la representación importa).

How does the Blue Beetle movie address Ted Kord?

While speaking with Fandango, Bruna Marquezine — who plays Ted’s daughter Jenny — and George Lopez — who plays Jaime’s uncle Rudy — discuss the influence of Ted Kord on the story of the film.

“So Jenny’s Ted’s daughter, which is really exciting,” Marquezine stated. “Ted, before disappearing, was in charge of Kord Industries, and now Jenny’s trying her best to keep her dad’s legacy. He is really important for the movie, though, because we use all of his gadgets.”

“It’s really the first man cave, I believe,” Lopez said. “It’s a throwback. He’s got some Oreo cookies in there — pallets of Oreo cookies. He’s got some cool tools.”

“The Bugship,” Marquezine noted, “So thank you, dad.”

2023-08-03 18:00:18+00:00,DC Studios boss reveals ‘a handful’ of the current DC characters will return in new DCU,"While the DCU has a new beginning on the horizon, it seems some established characters will keep their roles even after the reboot.","While the DCU has a new beginning on the horizon, it seems some established characters will get to keep their roles after the reboot.

Back in 2013, Warner and DC attempted to launch an interconnected universe of films featuring some of the most recognizable heroes ever like Superman and Batman to compete against the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Although the original slate of movies had some awesome projects under its belt, it ultimately failed to receive critical acclaim and lacked a clear path over time. That led to a massive reset for the DCEU under the direction of James Gunn and Peter Safran with the hopes of a brighter future for DC heroes.

The first step toward that new universe came in the form of The Flash, a movie that completely changed the ongoing narrative for the DCU. So now that there is a blank slate set and ready for new stories to be told, a very important question has to be asked: Is every established DC hero going to be recast and rebooted? After all, there were many beloved characters whose portrayals were on point and far from being an issue related to their movies’ reception.

Fortunately, James Gunn likes to answer questions on social media regarding his vision for the DCU. This time it was no different, as a fan asked him on Threads whether Blue Beetle was going to be a part of the new universe or not, and James replied with a definite yes:

Yes. Blue Beetle (played by the wonderful @xolo_mariduena) & a handful of other characters will continue on in the DCU, even though the first DC Studios movie is Superman: Legacy (the first DC Studios project is the animated TV show Creature Commandos).

Who are the returning DCU characters?

When James Gunn released a video announcing the projects that are going to shape the first phase of the new DCU, he revealed that Viola Davis’ Amanda Waller was set to return for a live-action HBO series. That means Amanda is one of those characters that will be moving over from the old DCEU to the new DC Universe. However, she’s not alone, as Blue Beetle is set to join her as well (which was made evident by James Gunn’s reply). As if it wasn’t enough, it was recently revealed that Gal Gadot will reportedly reprise her role as Wonder Woman in her third stand-alone movie under DC’s new direction.

Does that mean every current DC character will receive the same treatment? Well, unfortunately, no. After all, it wouldn’t be a proper reset if every established hero got to keep their role in the new universe. Henry Cavill will no longer play Superman and the role will be given instead to David Corenswet. Batman will also be recast, but we have yet to learn who will play the part (However, it is safe to assume Gotham will be in safe hands after looking at recent castings of popular DC heroes).

Who else could reprise their role in the DC Universe?

(Spoilers for The Flash to follow)

It remains to be seen who else will be returning as an established hero for the new phase of the DCU. However, that won’t stop us from speculating. John Cena would be a safe bet, as he already played Peacemaker under James Gunn’s direction and his series was well-received. Jason Momoa could also return as Aquaman since he played the role in the post-credits scene of The Flash and has an upcoming movie to be released later this year.

Finally, Dwayne Johnson said his version of Black Adam could return in future chapters of the DCU that involve the multiverse.

Only time will tell who else is returning, but one thing is for certain: We can’t wait for the new phase in the DCU to begin.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYmFtc21hY2twb3cuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMDMvZGMtc3R1ZGlvcy1ib3NzLXJldmVhbHMtYS1oYW5kZnVsLW9mLWN1cnJlbnQtZGMtY2hhcmFjdGVycy13aWxsLXJldHVybi1pbi1uZXctZGN1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-09-07 01:21:40+00:00,DC’s Blue Beetle Didn’t Initially Plan to Cast George Lopez,The production team behind DC's Blue Beetle reveals they had a different vision for Uncle Rudy Reyes before comedian George Lopez came along.,"The production team behind DC‘s Blue Beetle initially had a different vision for Rudy Reyes before George Lopez came along.

In an interview with Screen Rant, Blue Beetle concept artist Phil Boutte spoke in detail about the original conception for Jamie Reyes’ uncle — and how he was “surprised” when Lopez was cast in the role. “Lopez, they had him in mind, but it wasn’t initially him. It was going to be somebody that was skinnier and wiry,” Boutte said.

“His look, the mullet and all that? Just imagine an aged Mexican rocker,” he continued. “And then George came in, and then Mayes was doing the fittings with him and everything and going back and forth and they were finding his character. Those elements strangely still worked and it was just hilarious.”

Blue Beetle’s Latino-led cast

Lopez, a comedian and former star of his own eponymous ABC sitcom, joined Blue Beetle lead Xolo Maridueña in a cast of Latino performers who make up the heart and soul of Blue Beetle’s story. Instead of simply telling a standard superhero origin story about Jamie chosen by The Scarab to become the Blue Beetle, director Angel Manuel Soto wanted to emphasize the teenager’s growth in his family and his hometown of Palmera City. Authenticity was key in Soto’s casting process, which earned Blue Beetle high praise from Latino Hollywood organizations.

“Initially, my goal with finding the family was to be able to have an authentic group of people, not just as authentic on the Latino side, but authentic on the accents and authentic on the experience overall, it was very important for me to have the elders in the family to be from Mexico,” Soto said. “And more than just being from Mexico is honoring those amazing beloved actors from Mexico that have paved the way not just in Latin American cinema, but also crossing over to the Anglo-Saxon community and Latin American community in the United States.”

The director continued, “And then you have somebody on the younger side, the new blood that’s coming in, like Belissa [Escobedo] and Xolo, they’re Mexican American,” added Soto. “And tying them with the guys that came before which have a strong history of being born in Mexico and then coming over to the US. Being able to provide a Mexican family, a brown Mexican family, that embraces that level of authenticity, I think this cast allowed us to have all of that.”

,'Blue Beetle' star Xolo Maridueña releases debut single 'On My Way',"Watch the music video for 'Blue Beetle' star Xolo Maridueña's debut single, 'On My Way.'","Xolo Maridueña is on his way.

The Blue Beetle and Cobra Kai actor just dropped his debut single, ""On My Way,"" a nostalgic love letter to '90s hip-hop and pop culture featuring Adriana Padilla. EW has an exclusive first look at its wistful Los Angeles–set music video, which Maridueña calls an homage to the aforementioned not-so-bygone era and Spike Lee's cult classic Do the Right Thing.

""There definitely is a '90s feel to the track,"" Maridueña tells EW over the phone the afternoon before its big debut. ""It's heavily inspired by the rap groups that I listened to growing up: A Tribe Called Quest, Wu-Tang [Clan], Public Enemy. Once I heard the beat, it totally brought me back."" Of the accompanying video that sees him traversing the City of Angels via one sweet ride, ""It definitely has that Fresh Prince kind of feel.""

Though best known for his turns as Miguel Diaz on Cobra Kai, Victor Graham on Parenthood, and the titular hero in the just released Blue Beetle (the first Latino superhero to lead a DC film), it's music that first helped shape Maridueña's love for the arts, nurtured in large part by his parents — including his former radio show host mother. ""Music has been a part of my life since as far as I can remember,"" he says. ""Both my parents have been heavily involved in not only the hip-hop world, but just the greater music world.""

""I have such a great appreciation for the music world; especially the hip-hop world, it really helped raise me,"" he adds. With the new single, ""I just want to show my respect and admiration for a culture and group that operates me.""

""On My Way"" is a meeting of both of Maridueña's worlds, with the actor rapping lyricisms about his rising star status in Hollywood such as, ""Representation matters, you dealin' with a monster"" and ""I'm 'bout to be a star like Al Pacino / and Leo DiCaprio / I'm stackin' C-notes, so add a zero.""

Though he was wonderful in that role, he said he did not want to be remembered only for that. While it was assumed he would not want to take on the role of another superhero, the man is pitching his idea to take on the greatest Batman villain.

DC is in flux right now, as the company is waiting to fully transform into the DCU under the leadership of James Gunn. Though the famed director and now CEO revealed that the DCU would officially start with his Superman: Legacy film, there are a couple of holdouts from the past era of DC. One of those holdouts is Blue Beetle, which has been garnering some good excitement.

There has been some confusion about where Blue Beetle fits into the new DCU; as Gunn stated, “Superman is the first DCU movie, but Blue Beetle is the first DCU character.” We think he means that there might not be a trilogy planned for Jamie Reyes, but he is often a huge ally to many DC characters highlighted in the DCU Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters slate.

Blue Beetle and Booster Gold are huge allies in the comics, meaning he could appear in that series, and there have been rumors of Blue Beetle also appearing in Peacemaker Season 2.

Either way, Blue Beetle director Angel Manuel Soto has seemingly made something special, and early reactions could lead to the man having a more expansive role in the DCU. He initially had a pitch for a Batman film, though he was given Blue Beetle. Dave Bautista has apparently seen Blue Beetle and loved it so much that he wants to work with Soto.

Dave Bautista Wants to Play Bane


Before Angel Manuel Soto was set up as the director of Blue Beetle, he had apparently given DC a pitch about a movie that revolved around Bane. Soto is introducing the first Latino superhero to DC, so it makes sense that he wanted to do the same with Bane. Though most fans know Bane to be Tom Hardy, the character is often of South American descent.

There has not yet been a truly comic-accurate version of Bane shown in live-action, so it stands to reason that someone would want to accomplish doing so. Soto made a significant impression on Dave Bautista, who now wants to portray Bane in the DCU.

DC currently has two different Batman universe franchises happening. Matt Reeves is building out his Batverse, with Robert Pattinson starring as Batman. Reeves has a more grounded approach to his films, much like Nolan, so we are unsure if he plans to bring Bane into the mix. Nolan did bring in Bane, but not the traditional South American version from the comics.

There are also the Todd Phillips Joker films that have yet to bring in Batman, though the first film did feature a young Bruce Wayne. Though there have been rumors that Harvey Dent would be in the second film, it might still not set up the traditional Batman story of him taking down these criminals to save Gotham.

James Gunn is developing his DCU Batman film, The Brave and The Bold. That could be the place to introduce Bane, as he would appear to fight Bruce and Damien Wayne. This could be where Dave Bautista could theoretically be introduced, assuming Soto doesn’t get to make his solo Bane movie.

James Gunn and Dave Bautista have also worked with one another extensively on Guardians of the Galaxy, so we imagine Gunn is a big fan of the man’s acting prowess. Gunn had stated he planned to work with actors from Marvel in his DCU, so it makes sense he would want to bring Bautista over.

Related: New Batman: The Brave and The Bold Director has IT Factor

We will have to see how Blue Beetle does in theaters when its releases next week and if Soto will be retained to develop more DC projects. Andy Muschietti directed The Flash and is staying under the DC banner to direct The Brave and the Bold. Should Soto make a splash with his film, he could be treated the same by receiving another movie. It just depends on Gunn if Bautista could take on the role of Bane.

He took over long after The Flash was in development, but the film flopping at the box office will likely be tied to Gunn, which could cause significant issues with his own releases. His first DCU release is already projected to be a flop.

DC has been a mess for many years, going back to when Zack Snyder was all but running the show and building out his SnyderVerse. The issue with DC films has always been about continuity. Instead of trying to play catch up to Marvel, DC should have been building out its solo hero movies before creating the Justice League.

Despite what people may think about it, Man of Steel (2013) was a perfect jumping-off point for the SnyderVerse, which was ruined when DC forced the Justice League team up after the success of the first Avengers film that the MCU made. It has been tough to be a DC fan simply because the live-action efforts have paled compared to what Marvel has been accomplishing for the better part of 15 years.

DC has had some successes, but mostly with solo Batman films. Batman has always been the darling of DC, and that could be because every creator comes to the Dark Knight with a brand-new take. The rest of the DC Universe has not been given the proper tools to succeed, and it appears that the first big DCU reset film will sadly join the long list of DC flops.

James Gunn DCU ‘Blue Beetle’ Projected to Flop

James Gunn will have to sit around and wait for the passing of films he has not directly worked on, as Blue Beetle and Aquaman 2 are the final films on the DC calendar that were in production before Gunn took over. Aquaman 2 is still part of the DCEU, but Blue Beetle is considered the “first DCU hero,” according to Gunn.

Based on a report by Box Office Pro, Blue Beetle is projected to make somewhere in the $12 to $17 million range in its opening weekend. That number will only rise to around $27 to $55 million for domestic box office projections.

These numbers were likely devised based on how films generally face significant drop-offs in numbers as the weeks progress, which is certainly what happened to The Flash and Shazam 2. The good news is that Blue Beetle has a reported budget of $12o million, making it the third-lowest of the entire DC franchise.

These are also domestic projections; the film could find its wings (pun intended) in international markets. That will likely not be the case, but the hope is certainly there.

DC fans have long longed for tangible continuity, which has not been the case for DC films over the last 15 years. James Gunn is now running the show for the DC Films division of Warner Bros. Discovery, and the hope is that he can pull the company out of mediocrity.

Blue Beetle could still shock the world and become an underground hit, though it might be collateral damage next to the box office disasters that The Flash and Shazam 2 were. Everyone must be patient and wait for Gunn’s Superman: Legacy to arrive, hopefully bringing a cohesive plan to the rest of the DC Universe.

2023-08-02 17:00:00+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’ Director Ángel Manuel Soto Talks Latino Resilience and Creating ‘Cronenberg for Kids’,"""Blue Beetle"" director Ángel Manuel Soto talks Hollywood strikes and Latino culture represented in the new superhero movie.","“Blue Beetle” director Ángel Manuel Soto is an eternal optimist.

It was January 2020 when Soto’s coming-of-age story “Charm City Kings” debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, winning the U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Prize for ensemble acting. Sony Pictures Classics planned to release the film on April 10, which would have come after its intended bow at South by Southwest on March 15. Yet, as for so many movies, a global pandemic changed those plans. It eventually ended up in the hands of HBO Max ahead of its rebrand, but if anyone visits Max, it’s not available, as it was one of the movies that was quietly removed from the platform.

And here Soto is again, sitting in a hotel room on Zoom amid his travels without his actors and writers to promote the film, which opens Aug. 18. He’s going at it alone due to the ongoing Hollywood strikes, hoping to get moviegoers to come out and see his latest vision. “I think it’s just the way it goes with me,” he says. “If anything, let it be a testament to my resilience. It’s part of my Puerto Rican DNA.”

In addition to being the first film under the guidance of new DC Studios heads James Gunn and Peter Safran, “Blue Beetle” marks the first Latino superhero character for Warner Bros. Amid the difficult climate in Hollywood, Soto might be echoing a line spoken by his lead character Jaime Reyes (played charismatically by Xolo Maridueña) in a scene in “Blue Beetle” where he yells in despair: “This shit doesn’t get better for us!”

Soto can see the obstacles stacked against him, but he’s determined to emerge victorious. “I think about it constantly and how this could have been our moment,” he tells Variety. “But no, it’s not could. It’s still our moment.”

“Blue Beetle” follows Jaime Reyes as he returns to his hometown after college graduation, where his family struggles to make ends meet. Soon after, he is chosen to become a symbiotic host to the Scarab, an ancient alien biotechnological relic that grants him a powerful exoskeleton armor, turning him into the titular superhero. The film also stars Latino talent like Oscar nominee Adriana Barraza (“Babel”), George Lopez, Damián Alcázar, Bruna Marquezine, Belissa Escobedo and Raoul Max Trujillo, along with Susan Sarandon.

Soto, 40, didn’t attend film school like many of his colleagues in the industry. A native of Santurce, Puerto Rico, one of the most densely populated areas on the island, he attended university on a soccer scholarship studying architecture. Despite being a die-hard cinephile and wanting to make movies, film school had too high a pricetag. Instead, he shelved his passion for later in life. “I had to spend a lot of money to create a network where I would learn by doing, not by going to school,” he says.

That natural talent is what executives like Peter Safran, co-chairperson, and CEO of DC Studios, saw in Soto’s “Charm City Kings,” which convinced him Soto was the right person for the job. “It was a coming-of-age story that had similar elements that were translatable to ‘Blue Beetle’ on a larger scale,” Safran says. “When you look at some of the great superhero movies, they’ve come from filmmakers not known for that particular genre.” Safran points to blockbuster and critical hits such as “Iron Man” from Jon Favreau, “Shazam,” directed by David Sandberg, or his co-CEO Gunn with “Guardians of the Galaxy.”

Soto began his career in entertainment as a TV producer, later focusing on art direction at an advertising agency. He made his directorial debut with “La Granja,” a film looking at the harsh realities of his native island, something Soto knows too well. Soto’s father was a lifelong Teamster and union advocate and one of the many protestors to remove Ricardo A. Rosselló, the corrupt Puerto Rico governor, in 2019.

You see Soto’s cinematic inspirations in every frame, referencing classic tentpole franchises like “Mission: Impossible” and “Indiana Jones.” He utilizes this nostalgic energy to portray the first superhero that does not want his superpowers. In fact, Soto knew what he wanted for Jaime’s transformation into the blue exoskeleton. “How can we do [David] Cronenberg for kids?” he says. “I wanted the energy to be fun but also tell the story about the movies that made me love movies.”

Filming on the “Blue Beetle” set Hopper Stone/SMPSP

Incorporating humor and action-packed battle sequences, “Blue Beetle” tells an origin story that shows promise for future iterations.

The filmmaker saw too much of himself in Jaime to not tell this story. One aspect that was important to him was the accurate pronunciation of their names, which is often disregarded in American culture — Jaime (pronounced “hay-meh”) and Ángel (“ahng-hehl”). In addition, a scene with Sarandon’s villainous Victoria Kord calling her employee scientist Sanchez (Harvey Guillén), despite it not being his name. The goal is to show that Latinos are not a monolith, and as underrepresented and misunderstood as we are in Hollywood, we are powerful when united. That’s why he’s meticulous when presenting Jaime’s family, whom he wants the audience to love and see themselves represented in, Latino or not. “By the end of the first act, you know this family. You feel the warmth. You can almost smell the food,” he says.

For decades, Latino artists have faced numerous barriers in Hollywood, including typecasting and limited opportunities. The lack of diversity behind the scenes has often resulted in a skewed representation of Latino characters, perpetuating stereotypes rather than reflecting the rich complexity of their culture and experiences.

Furthermore, securing financing for Latino-led projects can be particularly challenging due to the perception of limited market appeal. It’s a curious perception since Latinos comprise 20% of the U.S. population and represent more than 25% of domestic box office ticket sales.

The disparity in data tells the story. In a 2021 study by USC Annenberg that looked at over 1,300 films over a 13-year timeframe, only 5% of 51,158 characters identified were Hispanic or Latino. Furthermore, only 4.2% of the movies had Latino or Hispanic directors attached; even worse, only three Latina women were among them all.

While there have been Latino characters in the DC universe previously – Jay Hernandez as El Diablo in “Suicide Squad,” and Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya in “Birds of Prey” – the pressure for the film’s success couldn’t be any more pronounced after seeing the cancellation of “Batgirl” with Leslie Grace, and the underwhelming reception of “The Flash” which featured Sasha Calle as Supergirl. The fear beginning to seep into Latino communities is that if “Blue Beetle” is deemed a “failure,” it will only worsen Latinos’ visibility, preventing more projects like these for decades.

“It’s up to people like us to ensure that doesn’t happen,” says Safran. “Whether it’s Pam [Abdy] and Mike [DeLuca] or us in DC, it’s in our hands to make sure that we show a diverse slate of movies with different kinds of people represented on screen. I believe the audience will turn up for ‘Blue Beetle.’ It’s a success story that people will want to replicate.”

Filmmakers are also voicing their support for the upcoming superhero flick such as “Justice League” director Zack Snyder, who shared his excitement with his 1.4 million Twitter followers, which will surely help increase public awareness. “Looking forward to taking my kids to see Blue Beetle. #RepresentationMatters.”

With a screenplay by Mexican writer Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer (“Miss Bala”), the film is anchored with messages that can connect all viewers. Dunnet-Alcocer and Soto turn the idea that “Latinos are invisible” on its head with the line, “Invisibility is our superpower.”

“They tell us about this ‘glass ceiling’ and then tell us we should feel complacent and be grateful that we’ve even reached that ceiling. Every time someone like us excels, it’s a big surprise. We always knew we could do that. I believe in the power of community, and I’m not a fatalist. I’m a relentless optimist,” says Soto.

It’s hard to recall a mainstream movie in which so many crew members and actors’ names with accent marks and tildes on their names can be seen when the credits roll, showing the vast diversity of artists behind the camera.

Plenty of Easter Eggs are sprinkled in “Blue Beetle,” pointing to the connection with other DC titles.

There are scenes with a “Gotham Law” jacket and where George Lopez’s Uncle Rudy hilariously calls Batman “a fascist.” We even see some open boxes of Oreos, the favorite snack of the Martian Manhunter, a core member of the Justice League. With Warner Bros. reportedly discussing some shuffling of its 2023 projects including “The Color Purple,” “Dune: Part Two” and another DC Studios sequel “Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom,” Warner Bros. insiders tell Variety the Jason Momoa film is expected to hold its Dec. 20 release date.

Soto realizes that despite the promotional hurdle the strikes have imposed, the guilds are striking to help the people that make up his team.

“We want the movie to succeed, but I also want my actors and writers to be treated as they should. If that happens, we’ll have more stories like this. Things that are often deemed impossible are not.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2JsdWUtYmVldGxlLWRpcmVjdG9yLWFuZ2VsLW1hbnVlbC1zb3RvLWxhdGlub3MtaG9sbHl3b29kLXN0cmlrZS0xMjM1Njg1MTM0L9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2JsdWUtYmVldGxlLWRpcmVjdG9yLWFuZ2VsLW1hbnVlbC1zb3RvLWxhdGlub3MtaG9sbHl3b29kLXN0cmlrZS0xMjM1Njg1MTM0L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-28 20:07:04+00:00,George Lopez Was the Improvising King on ‘Blue Beetle’ — Here’s What Happened,Our Thing,"If it were up to Blue Beetle director Ángel Manuel Soto, his superhero movie would’ve extended a few more minutes past the studio’s self-imposed two-hour limit thanks to George Lopez improvising.

According to Collider, Soto gave the cast time to go off the script to see if they could create something that would make the final cut. As a veteran comedian, it was no surprise that Lopez understood the assignment.

“It was fun because we developed this thing where we shoot the script and then … everybody can do whatever they want,” Soto said. “That’s where George Lopez thrives. He gave like a seven-minute improv rant.”

Although all of Lopez’s improvised dialogue didn’t make the final movie, Soto said he was able to keep a few lines in. “We only had one line in the script, and we just had the camera there, and he gave like a seven-minute improv rant of all the different things that Kord is doing to the community.” Soto shared before adding, “[His rant] went crazy – like stuff that couldn’t be there, but it was fun.”

To narrow down what they did want to keep, they left the improvised moments in a nearly 3-hour cut of the movie. “On the first friends and family screening, when the movie was like two hours and 40 minutes long, we played the whole thing just to hear the ones that people are laughing and connecting with. So, we left three in it.”

George Lopez as Uncle Rudy absolutely stole every scene he was in. He had my entire theater laughing at every line! pic.twitter.com/0F4jScvt6m — ogbrownnerd (@ogbrownnerd) August 20, 2023

Considering how funny and dynamic Uncle Rudy was in Blue Beetle we wouldn’t mind seeing this extended cut. When asked if it would be released, Soto said, “We should. I should!”

Along with Lopez and Maridueña, Blue Beetle stars Mexican actors like Adriana Barraza, Damián Alcázar, and Elpidia Carrillo. Casting Mexicans was something Soto made a point to do since the family in the movie is portrayed as such.

“They bring their own authentic experiences to the movie, and that helps a lot to inform the conditions we want to put the Reyes family in,” he said. “We want the Reyes family to live in a world that affects their environment, that affects their decisions.”

2023-08-20 16:17:31+00:00,‘Strays’ Stumbles at Box Office Without Its Stars’ Promotion,"The R-rated comedy opened to a fifth place showing this weekend, while the comic book movie “Blue Beetle” came in at No. 1. Both were hurt by the actors’ strike.","When selling a movie about raunchy talking dogs, it helps to have some star power to get moviegoers into seats.

And “Strays,” which opened Friday, has it — at least on the screen. Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Randall Park and Isla Fisher are among those who contribute their comic voice talents. Normally, a cast like this would translate into countless promotional appearances in settings like “Saturday Night Live,” late-night talk shows and on social media platforms. Not during the actors’ strike, when such efforts by the actors are forbidden.

Instead, the most exciting thing to happen during the press tour for the film may have been during a rehearsal for a segment on NBC’s “Today” show when Dylan Dreyer, a meteorologist, took a tumble while practicing a trick with an Australian Shepherd.

“Strays,” which had a budget of $46 million, is one of four movies that opened widely across the country this weekend. It grossed an estimated $8.3 million for a fifth place showing, a poor opening and not close to the number Universal Pictures was hoping for when it greenlit the film. (The studio’s previous R-rated comedy that paired raunchy material with family-friendly characters, “Good Boys,” opened in 2019 to $21 million. “Cocaine Bear,” also from Universal, had a far more robust opening, $23 million, in February.)",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMjAvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVkaWEvc3RyYXlzLWJsdWUtYmVldGxlLWJveC1vZmZpY2UuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-28 23:31:56+00:00,Box Office: $4 Ticket Day Boosts ‘Blue Beetle’ and ‘Ninja Turtles’,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and Blue Beetle were among those who saw the biggest boost from $4 tickets on Sunday.,"The results are in for the second annual National Cinema Day.

On Sunday, more than 3,000 theaters across the U.S. and Canada offered patrons the chance to see any movie in the theater, in any format, for only $4. That’s a huge discount, considering the average movie ticket price is at least $10.53, while the cost can be notably higher in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago. And if electing to see a film on a premium large format, including Imax, expect to pay $25 or more in some cinemas.

The Aug. 27 promotion resulted in 8.5 million moviegoers taking a trip to the cinema. That’s an uptick of 5 percent over the 8.1 million people who participated in last year’s National Cinema Day, which fell on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend. A major difference: Tickets were $3 last year.

According to Comscore, moviegoers aged 18-24 and 25-34 each made up 22 percent of the National Cinema Day audience, and the next-largest age group was 13-17 with 16 percent. Women turned out in slightly higher numbers than men, making up 52 percent of the audience.

Total revenue for this year’s National Cinema Day was $34 million, a gain of nearly 42 percent over 2022’s haul of $24 million, thanks in large part to ticket prices being raised to $4. Looking at other comps, Sunday revenue was up by 16 percent over the previous Sunday (Aug. 20). One unknown factor is how much the Sunday discount impacted Friday and Saturday attendance.

National Cinema Day is the brainchild of the Cinema Foundation, a nonprofit organization affiliated with the National Association of Theatre Owners. Jackie Brenneman, who was recently ousted as president of the Cinema Foundation and general counsel of NATO, led the effort.

In terms of general trends, films appealing to younger adults or families who are perhaps more mindful of their spending saw the biggest revenue boost from Saturday to Sunday, led by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and Blue Beetle at 37 percent and 32 percent, respectively. The R-rated raunchy canine comedy Strays also saw a hearty 25 percent boost.

Barbie led National Cinema Day in terms of sheer grosses with $5.7 million, followed by Blue Beetle ($5.5 million), Gran Turismo ($4.7 million), Mutant Mayhem ($3.3 million) and Oppenheimer ($2.7 million). Barbie was up 6 percent from Saturday to Sunday, while Gran Turismo saw a 12 percent day-over-day boost. Oppenheimer, which has a stronghold in terms of Imax screens, was down 21 percent day-over-day.

Consumers could choose from an array of other offerings timed to National Cinema Day, including The Super Mario Bros. Movie and The Little Mermaid Sing-Along, along with rereleases of such classics as Jurassic Park (3D), American Graffiti, Lady Bird and Oldboy.

“The positive response to National Cinema Day is just another reminder of how much people love going to the movie theater,” said Michael O’Leary, the newly installed president-CEO of NATO. “These numbers show us that the future of exhibition is strong, and that consumer enthusiasm for the theatrical experience continues unabated.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtMTIzNTU3NTc2MS_SAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3MvYm94LW9mZmljZS1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLWJsdWUtYmVldGxlLTEyMzU1NzU3NjEvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,How BLUE BEETLE’s OMAC Could Tie Into the DCU’s Future,Blue Beetle's introduction of OMAC and its DC Comics ties to Superman and the Authority could lead to its inclusion in James Gunn's DCU.,"With James Gunn and Peter Safran’s DC Universe on the horizon, one Blue Beetle character could provide the connective tissue between the previous studio regime and the future that’s to come: OMAC. The film introduced OMAC—an acronym for “One Man Army Corps”—as a technological enhancement for the villain Carapax (Raoul Trujillo). It was featured as an armored exoskeleton that could be implanted into the spines of ordinary humans. It then turns them into bulky weapons of war. Blue Beetle (Xolo Maridueña) and his family and friends destroyed the OMACs at Kord Industries. However, the OMAC mythos is too big and too promising to be contained in one film. A film about DC’s Authority is in development and OMAC could tie the emergent threads of the DC Universe together.

The Origin Story and Purpose of the First OMAC, Explained

Jack Kirby/Mike Royer

The original OMAC first appeared in Jack Kirby and Mike Royer’s OMAC #1 (1974). We meet Buddy Blank, a mild-mannered office-worker chosen by an omnipotent peace-keeping agency to become OMAC. Using an enormous eye-shaped satellite called Brother Eye, the peace-keeping agency imbued Blank with superhuman strength, speed, and durability. He also got a costume reminiscent of the Greek god of war, Ares, complete with a decorative fin.

From the very beginning of OMAC’s history, the character focused on the relationship between technology and the human body. In the beginning pages of his first issue, OMAC muses, “Where does humanity stop and technology begin? We no longer know…”

Seeing how much Blue Beetle explores the connections between Jaime Reyes and the Scarab, OMAC is a natural point of comparison for the protagonist.

OMAC, Superman, and the Authority’s DC Comics Relationship

Grant Morrison/Mikel Janín/Travis Foreman/Jordie Bellaire/Alex Sinclair/Steve Wands

OMAC could be an essential part of the DCU because of a relationship with a team on the horizon: the Authority. The Authority is traditionally made up of members like Apollo, Midnighter, and Jack Hawksmoor. In the nineties, The Authority was the edgy alternative to the Justice League. Their members were flawed and disinterested in being the model of heroism for anyone.

But recently, The Authority’s lineup and purpose got a new reimagining in print form. Grant Morrison and Mikel Janín’s 2021 series, Superman and the Authority, debuted a new OMAC as a team member. This OMAC, nicknamed “Mac,” is distinct from Buddy Blank’s iteration of the character as well as the militaristic vision of OMAC presented in Blue Beetle.

Warner Bros.

Blank’s OMAC suit includes a warlike fin and eye insignia. Conversely, Mac dons a pink mohawk hairstyle and pink facial marking shaped like an eye on his forehead. When Mac introduces himself to Superman and the rest of the new Authority team, he mentions that he uses he/him and they/them pronouns. Mac’s OMAC suit includes heavy armor. It works by him verbally commanding how much power he wants to use on a scale of one to ten. Mac is from Earth 9, and is in love with Earth 9’s version of Lightray. This makes him a character from DC’s multiverse.

Because of Mac’s uniqueness, as well as his comic book ties to the characters in future film projects involving the Authority and Superman, he presents a striking opportunity to strengthen this emergent lore in the DC Universe. This new OMAC has shaped the course of Superman’s mythology over the past two years in DC Comics.

We see their journey in the Warworld Saga arc, spanning principally Action Comics #1029-1036 and Superman: Warworld Apocalypse by Phillip Kennedy Johnson, Daniel Sampere, Riccardo Federici, David Lapham, and more. Along with the rest of Superman’s new Authority team, Mac went to Warworld, a desolate gladiatorial planet ruled by the tyrant, Mongul, in order to liberate the people trapped there. The Warworld Saga laid the foundation for a new era for Superman and redefined the Authority within DC’s status quo.

The Future of OMAC in James Gunn’s DCU

Grant Morrison/Mikel Janín/Travis Foreman/Jordie Bellaire/Alex Sinclair/Steve Wands

James Gunn said the comic book influences for the new DC Universe includes stories written by Grant Morrison. These include stories such as All-Star Superman and their Batman run. Morrison’s Superman and Batman work is setting the stage for two pillars of the DC Universe. Therefore, it isn’t a stretch to wonder if Superman and the Authority’s OMAC will make an appearance in Superman: Legacy or The Authority as a member of the team. There is no way of knowing if another OMAC was already operating outside of Palmera City in Blue Beetle. And we also don’t know if there is one like Mac existing someplace else within the multiverse.

Grant Morrison explored the multiverse heavily in works like The Multiversity. So fans will have to wait and see if this element is adapted into the DC Universe. Featuring OMAC in the Authority’s team would cultivate a greater sense of cohesion between Blue Beetle and the future DCU. Mac’s version of OMAC in The Authority would be relatively accessible to newcomers, even if they don’t know much about this collective.

OMAC’s thematic focus on the hybridity between technology and the human body is relevant to today’s world and era of superheroes. It would be a huge missed opportunity if OMAC is just a one-off character. From everything that James Gunn and Peter Safran have revealed about the new DCU, it’s clear that the franchise will pull from the lore from DC Comics. OMAC is a powerful example of the creativity in DC’s superhero comics and it’s time to bring it into full focus.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL25lcmRpc3QuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtZmlsbS1vbWFjLWNvdWxkLXRpZS1pbnRvLWphbWVzLWd1bm4tZGN1LWZ1dHVyZS1zdXBlcm1hbi1sZWdhY3ktdGhlLWF1dGhvcml0eS1jb21pYy1oaXN0b3J5L9IBhwFodHRwczovL25lcmRpc3QuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtZmlsbS1vbWFjLWNvdWxkLXRpZS1pbnRvLWphbWVzLWd1bm4tZGN1LWZ1dHVyZS1zdXBlcm1hbi1sZWdhY3ktdGhlLWF1dGhvcml0eS1jb21pYy1oaXN0b3J5Lz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

Ben Affleck’s last appearance in the DCEU was in The Flash or at least that is what we were led to believe. A few sources confirmed he would get the opportunity to return and continue on as one of the Multiverse’s Batmen, but the chances of that were dead in the water by the time James Gunn took over DC Studios.

So The Flash, in its final form, was the end officially until a rumor popped up claiming he had one last appearance on deck. It simply was cut. Scooper Syl Abdul reported this, saying Affleck recorded a line that would have been used in Blue Beetle. This small cameo was to be voice-only and not physical.

It also was meant to get a laugh according to the scooper, but it still would have planted Blue Beetle in the DCEU. “Ben Affleck had a VOICE-ONLY CAMEO for #BlueBeetleMovie that was cut by Gunn,” Abdul posted on X. “Was purely comedic BUT it placed blue Beetle film in batfleck continuity.”

This claim wouldn’t go unchallenged.

Since his name was mentioned, James Gunn took notice and decided to respond to it. The studio head denied the rumor, replying to Abdul he did not hear about any voice or Affleck cameo from Blue Beetle’s producers. “I never heard of one because one never existed (just asked the producers),” Gunn wrote, putting to rest more speculation for now.

At one point, Gunn embraced Blue Beetle as the first hero of his DCU. A little later, he seemed to walk back from that to (one would think) let the film stand on its own. It didn’t do a good job of that, despite a few rave reviews and a high score on Rotten Tomatoes.

If there was an Affleck cameo, no one would have seen it or cared. Moreover, he has moved on as Affleck rejected the opportunity to direct The Brave and The Bold. He expressed renewed excitement for playing Batman again after The Flash wrapped, but that comes naught with Gunn’s universe relaunch, which is its own can of worms.

Do you believe Affleck had a voice cameo? More importantly, do you think he is done with DC for good? Sound off in the comments.

2023-08-16 19:38:47+00:00,Should You Stick Around for a ‘Blue Beetle’ Post-Credits Scene?,Superhero movies are all but required to have a post-credits scene—or two. So should you stick around after the credits roll for 'Blue Beetle'?,"Ever since the titanic rise of Marvel movies in the early ’10s, blockbuster films are now all but REQUIRED to have a post-credits scene. Many Barbie movie-goers played themselves DJ Khaled-style waiting around for a post-credits scene that never came. Meanwhile, the eternally pop culture-literate franchise Scream actually managed to subvert the post-credits scene trope in the new Scream 6. Like it or not, post-credits scenes are now part of the movie-going experience. And you know what? I’m cool with that. I LIKE waiting around in the theater to watch a little secret scene that everyone else missed. If I’m spending $20 on a ticket, you can BET that I wanna get the absolute biggest bang for my hard-earned buck.

Now, does Blue Beetle have a post-credits scene? If not, then you can tell those Hollywood suits THAT I AIN’T GONNA WATCH THE MOVIE.

Okay, but does Blue Beetle have a post-credits scene tho?

Yes. Yes it does. In fact, going off the glorious tradition established by Marvel films, Blue Beetle has TWO post-credits scenes! That’s like two lil baby movies at the end of a big mommy movie! A single mommy movie because Blue Beetle doesn’t have an Oppenheimer to its Barbie. Sad!

While I won’t totally spoil the scenes, I will leave them out in the sun for a little while so they a get a funky smell to them. The mid-credits scene gives hints as to what could be next for the Blue Beetle franchise and how it could connect to other DC universe projects. The end-credits scene? Again, as with Marvel, this one is just a gag. A goof. A lark.

And one I’m sticking around for.

Born in Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, the 28-year-old actress started her career as an actress at the young age of 8. And after becoming a big name in her home country, Bruna is preparing to captivate new audiences, with the theatrical release of her latest film ‘Blue Beetle.’

Fans of the actress also remember all about her former relationship with soccer star Neymar Jr. However, it was her charisma and talent the reason for her success, as she has also positioned herself as an influential style icon, even winning the It Girl recognition at the GQ Men of the Year Awards in 2018.

Starring in the upcoming D.C. film as the love interest of Jaime Reyes AKA Blue Beetle, played by Xolo Maridueña, Bruna is known for making regular appearances at some of the most exclusive fashion and film events, including Paris Fashion Week, Milan Fashion Week, Venice Film Festival, the Academy Museum Gala, and Cannes Film Festival, among others.

The last few years have been a transformational period for the upcoming Hollywood star, after starring in over 17 telenovelas and 6 miniseries, Bruna presented the MTV Miaw awards in 2020 and went on to announce her role in the Netflix series ‘Maldivas’ starring as Liz Lobato.

The actress would also audition for the role of Supergirl in the D.C. film ‘The Flash,’ which was ultimately played by Sasha Calle. However, executives would still have her on their radar and decided that she would be the perfect choice to play Jenny Kord, making her Hollywood feature film debut official.

,"Movies to watch in August, from 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' to 'Blue Beetle'","A video game adaptation, a pair of raunchy comedies, and more","To those who finally returned to theaters for the first time in forever thanks to ""Barbenheimer,"" welcome back! Movies are pretty cool, huh? Unfortunately, the summer movie season has likely peaked with the dual release of ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer."" But there are still plenty of intriguing new releases in August, from a reboot of a beloved '80s property to a pair of raunchy comedies that could make for your next great double feature.

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" (Aug. 2)

Cowabunga! The ninja turtles are back for their first animated movie in more than 15 years, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"" following two live-action Michael Bay films. ""After years of being sheltered from the human world,"" the turtles set out to ""win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts,"" per Paramount. Seth Rogen worked on the screenplay and voices Bebop, and the rest of the voice cast includes John Cena as Rocksteady, Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman, Ayo Edebiri as April O'Neil, and Jackie Chan as Splinter. The turtles also have a new look, as the film's art style is reminiscent of ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse."" With great turtle power comes great turtle responsibility.

""Meg 2: The Trench"" (Aug. 4)

What better way to close out the summer than with a big, dumb shark movie? Jason Statham returns in this sequel to ""The Meg,"" the 2018 surprise hit that saw him gloriously face off against a megalodon shark. This time, he and Wu Jing ""lead a daring research team on an exploratory dive into the deepest depths of the ocean,"" which ""spirals into chaos when a malevolent mining operation threatens their mission and forces them into a high-stakes battle for survival,"" per Warner Bros. It's based on the follow-up to the original novel, and the screenwriters from the first movie are back, though there's a new director: Ben Wheatley, the filmmaker known for disturbing horror movies like ""Kill List."" Hopefully, the sequel hasn't bitten off more than it can chew.

""Shortcomings"" (Aug. 4)

Randall Park has long been a delightful on-screen presence, but he's now ready to get behind the camera. Variety described Park's new dramedy ""Shortcomings"" as a ""fresh-faced, funny directorial debut"" for the ""Fresh Off the Boat"" star. From Sony Pictures Classics, the movie follows a struggling filmmaker, Ben (Justin H. Min), and his girlfriend Miko (Ally Maki), who works for an Asian American film festival. ""When Miko moves to New York for an internship, Ben is left to his own devices, and begins to explore what he thinks he might want,"" the synopsis says. Sherry Cola stars as Ben's best friend Alice. Sony also described Ben as a man who ""spends his time obsessing over unavailable blonde women"" and ""watching Criterion Collection DVDs."" Wait, is this play about us?

""Heart of Stone"" (Aug. 11)

Gal Gadot's future as Wonder Woman may be in doubt, but if that gig falls through, at least she's got a home in the Netflix ecosystem. After starring in the streamer's ""Red Notice,"" Gadot returns for another Netflix original film that she also produced, the spy thriller ""Heart of Stone,"" in which she plays secret agent Rachel Stone. She's the ""only intelligence operative who stands between her global, peace-keeping organization and the loss of its most valuable — and dangerous — asset, codenamed: The Heart,"" per Netflix. Jamie Dornan also stars. Director Tom Harper told Entertainment Weekly the aim is for the film to spawn a new female-led action series like James Bond. In its attempt to craft more original franchises, Netflix is leaving no stone unturned.

""The Last Voyage of the Demeter"" (Aug. 11)

If ""Renfield"" got you in the mood for more Dracula on the big screen, Universal has another movie for you. From ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" director André Øvredal, ""The Last Voyage of the Demeter"" is based on a chapter from the original Bram Stoker ""Dracula"" novel, ""The Captain's Log,"" in which Dracula travels on board a merchant ship and things don't end well for those aboard. ""Strange events befall the doomed crew as they attempt to survive the ocean voyage, stalked each night by a merciless presence onboard the ship,"" per Universal. Think of it as ""Alien,"" but on a boat and with Dracula instead of a Xenomorph. Corey Hawkins and Liam Cunningham star, and Javier Botet plays Dracula. With their help, for now, the Universal monsters franchise is alive.

""Gran Turismo"" (Aug. 11)

The race to find the next great video game movie is shifting gears with ""Gran Turismo."" David Harbour and Orlando Bloom star in this film based on the popular racing video games, though it's not a direct adaptation of them. Instead, it's inspired by the true story of Jann Mardenborough, who became an actual race car driver after playing the video game competitively. The stakes are high for director Neill Blomkamp, who has struggled to follow up his critically-acclaimed debut film, 2009's ""District 9;"" his last two movies, ""Chappie"" and ""Demonic,"" were both widely panned. Can bringing a racing game to the big screen get his career back on track?

""Blue Beetle"" (Aug. 18)

The end of the DC universe as we know it is in sight, but it's not quite over yet. The DC Extended Universe still has two more films left before new boss James Gunn reboots the franchise. First up is ""Blue Beetle,"" in which a young college graduate, played by Xolo Maridueña, ""unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab,"" which ""chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host,"" leading him to become the superhero Blue Beetle, per Warner Bros. Gunn described Blue Beetle as the first character of the new DC universe, suggesting he could stick around even after the upcoming reboot. But that likely depends on how well this film performs, as if it's another DC bomb, expect the character to be tossed aside as quickly as Ezra Miller's Flash.

""Strays"" (Aug. 18)

In June, Jennifer Lawrence did her part to keep comedies alive in theaters with ""No Hard Feelings,"" and ""Strays"" is now picking up the torch. This new comedy produced by ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller has a unique hook: it's a filthy, R-rated film starring a bunch of talking dogs. The pups ""hatch a plan and embark on an epic adventure to help Reggie,"" a Border Terrier voiced by Will Ferrell, ""find his way home"" and make his ""lowlife owner"" pay for abandoning him. Jamie Foxx and Will Forte also flesh out the voice cast, and Dennis Quaid appears in the movie as himself. Will this barking dog comedy have bite?

""Bottoms"" (Aug. 25)

Two of the biggest rising stars in Hollywood today are Rachel Sennott and Ayo Edebiri, but fans introduced to them though ""Shiva Baby"" and ""The Bear"" may not realize the two collaborated in 2020 on the digital shorts ""Ayo and Rachel Are Single."" Three years later, they're teaming back up for the raunchy sex comedy ""Bottoms,"" in which two girls ""start a fight club as a way to lose their virginities to cheerleaders,"" per MGM. Emma Seligman directed the film in her follow-up to ""Shiva Baby,"" and Sennott co-wrote it with Seligman. Marshawn Lynch also stars. The movie earned near universal acclaim at South by Southwest, with Mashable's Kristy Puchko calling it a ""ruthless and hysterical parody of the teen sex comedy."" This is one fight club everyone will be talking about.

""Retribution"" (Aug. 25)

We've got five words for you: ""Speed,"" but with Liam Neeson. If you're not already on board, you should be. The actor leads this new action-thriller in which a man receives a call from a mysterious person who tells him there's a bomb under his car seat. The caller demands he ""complete a specific series of tasks,"" and with ""his kids trapped in the back seat and a bomb that will explode if they get out of the car, a normal commute becomes a twisted game of life or death,"" per Lionsgate. Nimród Antal, the filmmaker behind 2010's ""Predators,"" directs, and Jack Champion and Matthew Modine also star. Following new blockbusters starring Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford, it's the perfect conclusion to the summer of aging action stars proving they've still got it.

,The DC Comics History of BLUE BEETLE’S Cyborg OMAC Army,"In Blue Beetle, we learn about the nefarious OMAC project. But the OMAC has a long history at DC, going back to Jack Kirby himself.","In the film Blue Beetle, one of the major plot points has Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon), CEO of Kord Industries, attempting to make a highly sophisticated army that integrates man and machine. They were called OMAC, short for “One Man Army Corps.” The project was conceived of by her missing brother Ted Kord, who was once the Blue Beetle himself. But he abandoned it, realizing the danger it posed. Later, Victoria revived it, for her own nefarious ends. But the OMAC has a long history at DC Comics, both as a hero, and also as many, many villains.

Buddy Blank, the Original ’70s OMAC

DC Comics

As with many important pieces of comics lore, it all began with Jack Kirby. In the early ‘70s, Jack Kirby famously left Marvel Comics to work for rival DC, where he created iconic characters like Darkseid and the New Gods. But he also created a lesser-known character that would blossom into a prominent DC fixture. This character was OMAC—the One Man Army Corps. His adventures took place in the near future of the DC Universe. Kirby conceived OMAC as a Captain America type for DC. OMAC was originally Buddy Black, a nobody employee who worked for the Global Peace Agency. He volunteered for the OMAC Project to be their soldier. An A.I. satellite with the name Brother Eye conducted a “computer-hormonal operation via remote control” transforming Buddy into the OMAC.

DC Comics

Buddy would interface with the Brother Eye satellite, through an invisible beam to his receiver belt. When this happened, he’d get several super powers via this unique method of molecular rearrangement. He had superhuman strength, as well as flight and super speed. He could repair his own injuries, having a healing factor of a sort. OMAC also had a degree of energy projection powers. And he had one fierce mohawk. The GPA would send OMAC as its primary response agent during a crisis. Sadly, OMAC only fought a few battles. His series only lasted eight issues, and they canceled it when Jack Kirby left DC to go back to Marvel. (This version of OMAC also looks just like Gladiator from Marvel’s Shi’ar Empire. Fun fact.)

The OMAC Project in the 2000s Changes the Original Concept

DC Comics

For the next several decades, OMAC made very sporadic appearances in the DC Universe. He had backup stories in the science-fantasy Warlord series, and then in 1991, writer/artist John Byrne did a four-part OMAC limited series. Other than that, OMAC was more or less a footnote in DC Comics’ history. Then, in the 2000s, DC reinvented OMAC in a big way for the modern DCU. During the 2005/2006 event Infinite Crisis, OMAC went from “One Man Army Corps” to “Observational Meta-human Activity Construct,” and later, “Omni Mind And Community.” Long gone were the days of the heroic OMAC. These OMACS and Brother Eye became genuine threats to the DC Universe.

DC Comics

During the lead-up to Infinite Crisis, they reinvented OMACs as the brainchild of the secret organization known as Checkmate. They created an OMAC virus under the leadership of their Black King, former Justice League International financier Maxwell Lord. Using Checkmate’s vast resources, he hijacked Batman’s Brother Eye satellite, which Bruce Wayne used as a surveillance system across the globe to spy on metahumans. With Brother Eye under Lord’s control, they use infected human drones to neutralize metahuman threats everywhere on Earth. And ultimately, not just metahuman threats, but just metahumans in general. This virus was something the US Government gained from alien Brainiac technology.

OMAC Goes from One Hero to Many Villains

DC Comics

This legion of OMACs were cyborgs, humans with bodies altered by the nano-virus. As a nod to Jack Kirby’s original OMAC, Buddy Blank, these new OMACs kept the mohawk and Brother Eye symbol on their chests. The Brother Eye AI became sentient, thanks to the manipulations of Alexander Luthor, the son of the Lex Luthor of Earth-3. Now technically alive, it took the combined efforts of Batman and several heroes, including the Jaime Reyes version of Blue Beetle, to destroy it. One OMAC drone survived, a man named Michael Costner. He retained his individuality and actually became a hero, bringing OMAC full circle.

Blue Beetle Reinvents the OMAC for the Big Screen

Warner Bros.

In Blue Beetle, the OMACs retain their original acronym—the One Man Army Corps. They were a program of highly advanced robotic armor, originally created by Ted Kord, the second Blue Beetle. He ultimately abandoned the program, realizing how easily others might use it for evil. But when he disappeared, his sister Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) revived the OMAC Project. She was hoping to use the alien Scarab to perfect the OMACs, creating a functioning high-tech world police force that she could control.

In the film, Victoria Kord’s agent, Ignacio Carapax, had his robot armor explained as being the final form of an OMAC suit, combining his mythology from the comics together with the OMACs from the 2000s era comics.

The much talked about US box office surprise, Sound of Freedom, is also starting at cinemas this week. The film’s success must be credited to the highly relevant yet disturbing subject matter of human trafficking, as well as a philanthropic “pay it forward” campaign enabling consumers to put movie tickets in less economically fortunate people’s hands.

Award-winning director Alejandro Gomez Monteverde portrays the harrowing true story of a federal agent’s (Tim Ballard) daring mission to rescue children who have been trafficked. It stars Jim Caviezel as Tim, Mira Sorvino, Eduardo Verastegui, Bill Camp and Kurt Fuller. Next week’s episode features an interview with Ballard.

This week’s final cinema release sees the return of Dracula in The Last Voyage of the Demeter.

Astrónoma y estrella en Instagram y TikTok, Teresa Paneque es a los 26 años una de las divulgadoras científicas más populares de Chile. Su mayor aporte a la ciencia es Carlota, paradójicamente un personaje de ficción que motiva a las niñas a adentrarse en el estudio del universo. Paneque profesa la ciencia en la capital mundial de la astronomía, como se conoce a Chile por la gran cantidad de telescopios instalados en el desierto de Atacama, el más árido del planeta.Hija de un bioquímico cubano y una química farmacéutica chilena, Paneque comenzó a estudiar astronomía a los 16 años y actualmente cursa un doctorado en Países Bajos. Nació en España, pero llegó a vivir a Chile a los nueve años.Comenzó a ser conocida en 2019 gracias a sus publicaciones en redes sociales. Con un lenguaje sencillo, aborda temas como la rotación de la Tierra, la formación de planetas o la llegada del hombre a la Luna. Actualmente tiene 247.000 seguidores en Instagram y 771.000 en TikTok.Una editorial la buscó para que escribiera un libro ""divertido"" sobre astronomía. En 2021 ""El universo según Carlota"" vio la luz. Ya van tres tomos y unos 25.000 ejemplares vendidos. El personaje es una niña de 12 años, sin lentes y pelo largo que lleva un suéter estampado de estrellas. Carlota odiaba las clases de ciencia, pero en una feria científica - a la que asistió obligada - conectó con la inmensidad. ""Este libro no es para que todos los niños y niñas que lo lean sean científicos y científicas. Es para que se den cuenta que si lo quieren, pueden serlo"", sostiene.Recientemente nombrada embajadora de la Unicef en Chile, Paneque habló con la AFP a su paso por Santiago.P: ¿Cómo llegó a la astronomía?R: Me gustaba mucho entender y comprender nuestro entorno. Descubrí la física, que ocupa las matemáticas como un lenguaje para poder predecir y modelar la naturaleza, y eso me pareció mágico. (...) Y dentro de la física, me pareció que la astronomía era lo más desafiante, porque estudia algo que no podemos tocar, interactuar, que no podemos experimentar con el más allá de la luz.Los primeros años de universidad tuvo sólo profesores hombres, pero tardó en darse cuenta que no tenía ni una referente mujer: ""Eso me produjo un shock muy grande. (...) Eso estaba en mi cabeza, hasta que empecé mi magíster y tuve profesoras mujeres que eran físicas, que eran astrónomas, que eran líderes en sus áreas. (...) Hoy cuando yo pienso en quién me inspira la ciencia, son mis profesoras"".P: ¿Qué mensaje le transmite Carlota a las niñas?R: Me gustaría que en los siguientes libros hablásemos sobre mujeres en ciencia. Y hablásemos quizás sobre esta crisis de representatividad. (...) Me gustaría a través de Carlota poder presentar esos personajes, estas figuras escondidas o perdidas, porque las mujeres siempre hemos estado, siempre hemos sido fundamentales.P: ¿Cómo ve el movimiento feminista en Chile?R: Como cualquier lugar en el mundo seguimos teniendo grandes problemas de inequidad de género (...) en todos los temas: en la política, en la academia, en las escuelas, pero hemos tenido grandes avances (...). Hay muchos lugares donde hoy se entiende la necesidad de hacer políticas de equidad de género, pero quizás se siente que el tema ya está saturado, que no es necesario seguir hablando. En Chile el movimiento feminista ha sido muy importante para mí, pero yo creo que también ha sido importante para mantener el tema en la palestra pública.P: ¿Por qué su interés en las mujeres y la ciencia? R: Porque las mujeres estadísticamente tienen la mitad de las respuestas, igual que los hombres tienen la otra mitad. No nos sirve una ciencia que sean todas mujeres, no nos sirve una ciencia que sean todos hombres, y por cada gran idea que surgió el siglo pasado probablemente hubo otra gran idea de una mujer que nunca tuvo la oportunidad, nunca tuvo la posibilidad de acceder a esa educación.P: ¿Científica o divulgadora científica?R: Las personas somos multidisciplinarias. (...) Además de las redes, de los libros y de la ciencia, a mí me gustaría mucho poder aportar a políticas públicas.

2023-08-16 14:02:35+00:00,« Blue Beetle » : que vaut ce nouveau super-héros mexicain ?,"Signé par un réalisateur portoricain, ce blockbuster place la conception mexicaine de la famille au cœur de l’intrigue. Un film aussi touchant que spectaculaire et qui offre un humour bon enfant d’un bout à l’autre du récit.","C’est le dernier grand blockbuster américain de l’été, mais à la différence des précédents – « Indiana Jones 5 », « Mission Impossible 7 », « Barbie » et « Oppenheimer » –, il n’a pas été montré à la presse avant ce mercredi. On se demande bien pourquoi, tant « Blue Beetle » nous a fait forte impression lors de l’une de ses premières séances parisiennes à 10 heures. On ne savait pas trop où on allait avec ce super-héros méconnu, apparu pour la première fois dans un comic américain en 1939 et relancé sous diverses formes depuis. Réalisé par Angel Manuel Soto, un cinéaste portoricain, le casting est essentiellement sud-américain. Le film est quant à lui produit par les géants américains DC Comics et Warner.

Reprenant la dernière mouture des aventures du « Scarabée Bleu » parues à partir de 2006, le long-métrage introduit le personnage de Jaime Reyes, jeune américain d’origine mexicaine qui vient fêter son diplôme de droit avec sa famille aussi fière que soudée dans sa ville natale. À la suite d’un concours de circonstances, le beau Jaime se retrouve en possession d’un scarabée métallique. D’origine extraterrestre, l’insecte entre en symbiose avec lui et lui permet de développer d’incroyables superpouvoirs.

Mais c’est là que les ennuis vont commencer pour Jaime : le scarabée est convoité par la cynique Victoria (Susan Sarandon), dirigeante d’une firme d’armements, tandis que Jenny (Bruna Marquezine), héritière spoliée de la firme, cherche aussi à récupérer l’objet. Voilà le jeune homme pourchassé de toutes parts, et lancé dans une course infernale pour protéger sa famille chérie…

Rires et tendresse

Cette notion de famille constitue le noyau de ce film de super-héros qui ne ressemble à aucun autre. Ramenant sans cesse l’intrigue autour de la générosité, de la solidarité et de l’entraide qui unissent proches et voisins sud-américains, le réalisateur Angel Manuel Soto touche droit au cœur tout en signant un film très spectaculaire et bourré d’effets spéciaux. En filigrane, le film se penche sur l’histoire des relations entre les États-Unis et certains pays d’Amérique du Sud et esquisse quelques critiques sur la politique américaine en matière d’immigration.

Mais, surtout, Angel Manuel Soto truffe son film de gags et de répliques hilarantes, là encore directement en lien avec la notion de famille telle qu’on la conçoit au Mexique. Il y a du Robert Rodriguez chez ce jeune cinéaste, tant « Blue Beetle » rappelle l’esprit des blockbusters familiaux (« Spy Kids », « C’est nous les héros »…) du maître latino-américain, avec des personnages jamais à court de vannes même dans les moments les plus tendus.

Read on.","The global Box Office in the past one month has seen the wildest of the phases in the world cinema. With the release of Christopher Nolan’s epic saga Oppenheimer alongside Margot Robbie’s pink craze Barbie, the footfalls saw a mammoth growth and both the movies are talking about a billion-dollar collection, one already surpassed and other on the verge. But for Nolan, this Box Office war also meant he was fighting with his ex-love Warner Bros, with whom he made movies for 20 years before parting ways to join hands with Universal. While it is far from surpassing Greta Gerwig’s directorial, it is still giving WB tough time.

Oppenheimer, directed by Nolan, stars Cillian Murphy as J Robert Oppenheimer alongside Robert Downey Jr, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Rami Malek, and others. The movie has so far managed to earn $852 Million at global Box Office, with a very good uplift coming from the China release. Which means the movie is now heading to a billion.

But while it is busy taking over the Box Office, the movie has managed to give Warner Bros a tough competition in one of the section. The director who gave DC wing of the studio three of its most iconic movies ever with an Oscar winning twist to the Joker, has now managed to earn way more than three recent DCU movies combined at the Box office which says a lot about his hold. Read on to know everything you should know about the same.

While it was speculated that Warner Bros releasing Barbie against Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer was their revenge against the filmmaker who broke up with them to join Universal. But if not the Margot Robbie starrer, the studio has only faced flops and losses in the past one year. The fact that Oppenheimer alone with a collection of $852 million has earned more than the last 3 DCU releases says a lot.

As per We Got This Covered, Oppenheimer’s collection is more than The Flash ($268 Million), Shazam! Fury Of The Gods ($133 Million) & Blue Beetle ($100 Million) combined. And if the Christopher Nolan directorial manages to touch the $900 Million, it will be more than 4 DCU movies combined, including Black Adam ($393 Million).

2023-08-17 13:30:00+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’ Director Ángel Manuel Soto Is Relieved That His Characters Have a DCU Future,Blue Beetle director Ángel Manuel Soto is relieved that the characters introduced in this movie will live on in the DC Universe.,"Director Ángel Manuel Soto and his DC film Blue Beetle have prevailed over a number of obstacles en route to Aug. 18th’s theatrical release. As the first mainstream Latino-led superhero film in live action, Soto and co. have overcome the lack of proper Latino representation that has existed for generations, while introducing a much-needed hero in Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña), as well as his thoroughly developed Latino family, the Reyeses.
Blue Beetle producer Zev Foreman originally had theatrical ambitions, but given WarnerMedia’s emphasis on streaming at the end of 2020, the project was designated as an HBO Max release. However, in December 2021, just months prior to WarnerMedia’s merger with Discovery, the powers that be at Warner Bros. decided to upgrade the film to a theatrical release, allowing Latino audiences to finally have their moment in the live-action superhero genre.
“We wanted to see our history and our legacy on the big screen, in a way that is respectful, and that was an opportunity that we didn’t want to miss,” Soto tells The Hollywood Reporter. “So it was something that we were very committed to, and we wouldn’t take no for an answer. And eventually, Warner Bros. saw it fit, and they allowed us to go back into the theaters.”
Unfortunately, Blue Beetle’s release coincides with the SAG-AFTRA strike, which means Soto’s cast members are unable to promote and share the film through various press opportunities, premieres and fan screenings. But Soto has picked up the promotional slack by honoring his cast’s work in their absence, and he’s also updating them every step of the way in a group text.
“It is heartbreaking. I wanted them to have their moment. This is their moment,” Soto says. “But at the same time, it’s a necessary thing. So, having them actually sacrifice this opportunity to be on the picket line and to fight for a better future — not only for them, but also to secure something better for future generations to come — is a heroic act of its own.”
April 2022’s merger between WarnerMedia and Discovery to form Warner Bros. Discovery eventually led to new DC Studios leadership in the form of James Gunn and Peter Safran. This changing of the guard initially put Blue Beetle in a bit of a gray area regarding the future of its characters and storylines. Fortunately, it didn’t take long for Gunn to anoint Maridueña’s Blue Beetle as the first DCU character, which took a huge weight off Soto’s shoulders.
“Yeah, that was for sure one of the elements of relief. It’s the fact that all of this effort was not going to die during this regime change,” Soto admits. “There’s also a belief in our characters, who are now going to be part of this new DC universe, especially Xolo’s character and his whole family and Bruna Marquezine’s character. So, knowing that they are going to continue to move forward in the DCU allowed me to feel relief for myself and for them.”
Below, during a conversation with THR, Soto also discusses his initial Bane pitch and why he was hesitant to say yes to Blue Beetle at first.
Well, these are very strange days, obviously, so how’s your solo tour going so far?
Man, the traveling gets tiring, but the energy of the interviews and the fans and the screenings is so intoxicating that it just gives you a second wind. So I feel great. We’re in Toronto right now, and yesterday’s fan screening had a lot of cosplay. People were waiting in line for hours outside to go into the movie. So, knowing that we made something with a lot of love and that we put our hearts and souls into it — not just me as the director, but all the actors — it’s very reassuring that it’s translating in that way with a lot of energy and enthusiasm.

Given how significant this film is for the Latino community, it must be heartbreaking to not have your Blue Beetle family with you.
It is heartbreaking, and it’s more than just wanting to have their company. I wanted them to have their moment. This is their moment. We’ve never had a [mainstream live-action Latino-led superhero film] that celebrates our culture, with characters who look like my family and many other families out there. So it’s a shame that they cannot have the spotlight that they deserve, but at the same time, it’s a necessary thing. I do believe that the strike needed to happen. I wish it happened after the release of our movie, but at the end of the day, there’s no better time than now. So, having them actually sacrifice this opportunity to be on the picket line and to fight for a better future — not only for them, but also to secure something better for future generations to come — is a heroic act of its own. So I’m celebrating them through their sacrifice in this moment, while also honoring the amazing work that they did. Representing them gives me the energy to continue doing this.
Have you been keeping in touch throughout it all?
Yeah, I’m sending them pictures and sharing the enthusiasm with them. I talk with Xolo [Maridueña] and Bruna [Marquezine] all the time. We’re all in a group thread with Belissa [Escobedo] and George [Lopez]. When I went to Mexico, I had dinner with Damián Alcázar. In Miami, I couldn’t run into Adriana Barraza, but we’ve been talking constantly. Her participation in the movie means so much to us. [Alcázar and Barraza] are two actors that I grew up watching in Mexican cinema, and being able to work with two people I respect so much and also keep them as family is a dream come true. And Susan [Sarandon] has also been super helpful. She’s helped me navigate this process and given me tips. Her expertise is a school that I never thought I’d have the opportunity to attend, and she’s been like a mother to me throughout all this.

So you originally had a meeting with DC in order to pitch Bane, but you instead walked out with Blue Beetle. Is that actually how it went down?
During the pandemic, I had a general meeting with DC after the response to Charm City Kings winning [U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Ensemble Cast] at Sundance and then streaming on HBO Max. So I got a call from Galen Vaisman, one of the executives at DC, and for a general meeting, you have to be prepared if they ask you what you want to do. And I’ve always wanted to explore the origin story of Bane. It’s super intriguing, especially where he comes from and the different topics that could be explored if we take into consideration that maybe he’s the hero of his own story. So it was very interesting to be able to talk about situations that have affected the Caribbean and Latin America for centuries through the character of Bane.
So I came in with that idea, but that was Matt Reeves’ universe with The Batman, and I don’t know what’s going to happen now with this new regime. But that was my main attempt, and Galen was like, “Okay, that’s a good idea, but we wanted to pitch you something.” And that’s when he introduced the idea of Blue Beetle. Now, I was already aware of the character of Blue Beetle. I have a lot of friends that have been fans of his, not just because he was a Mexican-American superhero, but also the pop culture impact that he has had with cartoons like Young Justice. I also used to play as his character in the Injustice 2 game.
So I got the call to do it, but I was a little bit hesitant at first, because Hollywood has had a history of misrepresenting us or putting us in a box of stereotypes. So I wanted to make sure that I wasn’t going to participate in perpetuating any stereotypes, and Galen reassured me, “Don’t worry about it. We have a guy from Queretaro, Mexico writing the script. His name is Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer. So just read the story, and if you don’t connect with it, then we can talk about something else.” And when I read the story, I saw not only an honest depiction and a window into Latin American culture through the Reyes family, but I also saw a lot of myself and a lot of the same situations that have affected me as a Puerto Rican. So I connected with the shared experience that we have as Latinos, and that’s when I was convinced that this movie had to happen.
In December 2021, four months before the Discovery merger, Blue Beetle became a theatrical release. Who deserves the credit for moving the film from HBO Max to theatrical?
It was a collective effort. When I came onto the project, it was already labeled as an HBO Max thing, but [producer] Zev Foreman, who brought the project to DC, always intended it to be a theatrical release. And then with the streaming mandate that was happening at the time, it fell into that. But when we were doing all the concept art and the world building, we really went above and beyond in trying to make this story feel worthy of the biggest screen possible. I wanted to present the film as a collective experience, because it makes a world of a difference. Conversations and dialogues can spark out of seeing a film with other people, but it was also to see our families on the big screen. We wanted to see our history and our legacy on the big screen, in a way that is respectful, and that was an opportunity that we didn’t want to miss. So it was something that we were very committed to, and we wouldn’t take no for an answer. And eventually, Warner Bros. saw it fit, and they allowed us to go back into the theaters.

How did you approach practical versus digital elements?
This film has a budget that is way less than a lot of all these big movies, but we still wanted to make it bigger than life. So our production team and our VFX supervisor [Kelvin McIlwain] understood the challenges of maximizing our budget, and we used as much practicality as possible. It was not just the practical Blue Beetle suit, but we also used real locations so that we weren’t heavily dependent on visual effects. We didn’t want to exploit the VFX artists as much as they have already been exploited. And using real locations allowed us to have better integration of the practical suits, so the VFX serve as an enhancement. It’s a tool, not a dependency, and that really helped to make this whole thing feel bigger than life. We shot the third act in a real 500-year-old fortress in Puerto Rico. The communities depicted weren’t a set. We went to the barrios of Puerto Rico and shot there. A lot of the people in the background are people from that community. So being able to make the film as lived in as possible felt worthy of the big screen experience.
When DC bosses James Gunn and Peter Safran told you that Jaime Reyes would continue on in the new DCU, was it a huge relief to know that your hard work would not be in vain?
Yeah, that was for sure one of the elements of relief. It’s the fact that all of this effort was not going to die during this regime change. We survived regime changes throughout this whole process, and that was a testament to the hard work that everybody put into it. There’s also a belief in our characters, who are now going to be part of this new DC universe, especially Xolo’s character and his whole family and Bruna Marquezine’s character. So, knowing that they are going to continue to move forward in the DCU allowed me to feel relief for myself and for them. It’s a testament to the amount of heart and talent that they have.

2023-08-08 11:00:00+00:00,Director Angel Manuel Soto on ‘Blue Beetle’ and Latino Representation in Hollywood,"Soto talks to Shondaland about casting Xolo Maridueña as superhero Jaime Reyes, filming in his homeland Puerto Rico, and what changes he wants to see in the industry.","This interview was conducted prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike authorization.
The first Latino superhero to emerge from DC Comics is about to win over a whole new generation of fans when director Angel Manuel Soto’s Blue Beetle introduces us to Jaime Reyes.
The comic book adaptation will bring to the screen on August 18 a story that has existed in various iterations since 1939 when the original Blue Beetle, Dan Garret, first appeared. When DC Comics bought the rights to Blue Beetle in 1983, it inherited the character of Ted Kord, the second Blue Beetle. Kord was killed decades later, enabling DC Comics to introduce its own creation: Jaime (pronounced “Hi-Mee”) Reyes, a teenager who transforms into the crime-fighting Blue Beetle with the power of the original Blue Beetle scarab (“an ancient alien biotechnological relic”).
The film was originally scheduled to stream on HBO, but in December 2021 it was decided that the movie would be released in theaters with Xolo Maridueña in the lead role. Once casting had been completed, director Angel Manuel Soto began filming in Atlanta, Texas, and Puerto Rico in May through July of 2022.
While the Khaji-Da scarab and the Blue Beetle suit are Reyes’ superpowers, it is clear from Soto’s movie that his teenage protagonist cannot battle the world’s evils alone. Family is fundamental to the heart of the film, as well as to Soto’s own formative experience as director, he explains.
“The writer [Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer] and I really wanted to home in to our collective experiences as Latinos,” Soto says during an interview with Shondaland. “I’m from Puerto Rico, and he’s from Mexico. One of the things we connected over was the strength we find with our families, and how our families — for better or worse — form who we are. In the movie, family are at the front and center as the pillars that form our hero. That came naturally to us because of how we were raised.”
The multigenerational Reyes family includes Adriana Barraza as Nana; Damián Alcázar as Jaime’s father, Alberto; George Lopez as Jaime’s Uncle Rudy; Elpidia Carrillo as Jaime’s mother, Rocio; and Belissa Escobedo as Milagro, Jaime’s little sister.
There is a nod to the second Blue Beetle, Ted Kord, via the characters who are creating all the obstacles in Jaime’s life: Susan Sarandon is Ted’s sister Victoria Kord, a villainous businesswoman who is determined to get her hands on Jaime’s scarab with the help of Dr. Sanchez (Harvey Guillén). Jaime’s love interest is Victoria’s daughter, Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine).
The L.A.-born Maridueña was Soto’s first and only choice for Jaime, an El Paso-based Mexican American teenager who discovers his superhero powers and makes no effort to conceal them from his family. Blue Beetle will be the young actor’s big-screen debut after he made his streaming career through the roles of Miguel Diaz in the Netflix series Cobra Kai and Victor Graham in the NBC series Parenthood.
“I met Xolo way before we started Blue Beetle,” recalls Soto. “I met him at Sundance, and it was clear he was a kid that had strong family values. His mom is always with him; he’s very protective of his sister — as a big brother should be! He’s super-charismatic, down to earth, humble. That stuck with me because I had not seen Cobra Kai then, and when I met him, he was so nonchalant about everything. When I got the question from DC about who I was thinking of, I said — right off the bat — Xolo Maridueña.”
Soto’s research into the character of Jaime Reyes made it evident to the director how strong the aesthetic resemblance of Maridueña was to the comic book representation of Jaime. It was a likeness that many fans online had also enthused over, which only fortified Soto’s gut instinct that he’d found his Blue Beetle.
“I never had a doubt that he was the guy, but it was solidified for everyone the moment we saw him on the screen. It was impossible not to see him as Jaime. The moment we saw him, it was like, ‘Oh, yeah, we’re good,’” Soto says.

The most challenging part was how Soto and his team could make a film this big without blowing out their budget and in the most time-efficient way, considering that discussions had been going on since 2018 and pandemic-related restrictions had hampered their plans.
“Not only did we have to make up for time, but we couldn’t depend on everything being VFX-heavy, which is so expensive,” he says. “We saved a lot by going to real locations to shoot and using a practical, amazing suit designed by Mayes C. Rubeo.”
That amazing suit was the result of creating more than 500 designs before the final design was locked in. Rubeo’s suit was crafted in collaboration with Ironhead Studio in Los Angeles, which combined the concept, digital designs, 3D printing, the fabrics, and physical armor pieces into a custom production made specifically to Maridueña’s measurements. The fabric was designed to evoke a futuristic, alien-inspired pattern, with every intricately crafted element rendered to look like a cosmic creation.
“The lighting, the atmosphere, and everything is already integrated into the suit. The VFX didn’t have to be created from scratch,” Soto elaborates.
While the suit is spectacular, it is Puerto Rico that provides a truly breathtaking landscape and atmosphere in the film. For Soto, filming in his homeland was layered with meaning.
“One of the most amazing things was that I was able to bring a production this big to Puerto Rico, where I was born and raised and where I still live,” the director shares. “To provide jobs and work again with the friends who helped to get me to where I am today was a big achievement. It fulfilled dreams that I had as a kid because I always wanted to film in one of the fortresses.”
One of those fortresses is the Castillo San Felipe del Morro, or El Morro, which was the second fort built on the islet of what is now Old San Juan and Puerta de Tierra. Construction took 251 years, beginning in 1539 and ending in 1790, ultimately turning El Morro from a promontory mounted with a cannon to a six-level fortress.
“Being able to shoot there was surreal,” Soto says. “The action sequences we shot there were very special to me. … Along with El Paso and Miami, it felt very humbling to be able to see the island where I was raised as an inspiration for this fictional new city within the DC universe.”

The pressure on Soto to deliver a movie that honors the history of Blue Beetle while also recognizing that many moviegoers will be discovering Jaime Reyes for the first time required striking a delicate balance: “We know that there is a big fan base for Jaime Reyes’ story and an even bigger one for the Young Justice cartoons, so we really wanted to home in on what made those comics special. A lot of the manifestation of weapons and storylines are taken from all the different runs of Jaime Reyes, tracing back to 2006.”
Soto continues, “At the same time, being that it is an origin story and knowing there’s so much more story to cover, we wanted to see how we could introduce a character to the world who isn’t as well known as other alien superheroes so that he becomes a hero of his own story. A Latino hero within an origin story that is authentic to where he comes from. When we see him again in the future, we can jump right into the action because we have met his family and this magnificent superhero in this first movie. Even if you don’t know anything about Blue Beetle, you can jump in.”
When Soto talks about Jaime Reyes, it is as if the superhero teenager is a member of his own family, or perhaps even Soto himself in a parallel universe.
“A lot of people like me can relate to Jaime, coming from a working-class home with little resources, born outside of privilege in marginalized communities,” Soto says. “Reyes embodies that resilience and that hope. His stakes are not crazy global stakes but personal stakes. My greatest fear is home insecurity, gentrification, displacement, erasure, and not being able to provide for my family. That stuff provides the real monsters in our stories, so how can Jaime be the hero that saves the family? His biggest challenges are those that affect the most marginalized communities right now. The way he cares selflessly for his family and his community? Those are principles that I was raised on too. For more of the world than not, that’s what makes him so relatable.”
Soto recognizes that Blue Beetle is more than his own triumph. He has not only nudged his foot into the door of a primarily white hegemony in comic book-to-film adaptations but has also taken the door off its hinges so that there are less barriers for other creatives.
“I hope that this means there will not only be more Puerto Rican filmmakers, but more Latino directors and stories from around the world,” Soto says. “I hope that this allows for many other stories to be told, and having directors tell their own stories for their own communities.”

And while many out there may be unfamiliar with the character, let me just say, Jaime Reyes is awesome! This is a movie worth celebrating, not just because it represents the first major Latino superhero movie to hit theaters, but because it’s actually really very good, and one of the best cinematic surprises of the year! And we at The Nerds of Color were lucky enough to sit down with the clever maestro behind the film, director Angel Manuel Soto!
Hailing from Puerto Rico, there was no better candidate to bring Jaime Reyes and the entire Reyes clan to life other than Soto! With critically acclaimed films like Charm City Kings and La Granja under his belt, Soto is known for making strong, emotional, character driven films. And through Blue Beetle, he certainly showcases his ability to blend deep emotional moments with big budget special effects better than even some of the most veteran directors in Hollywood. Click below to hear what this brilliant filmmaker had to say about crafting one of the best DC movies of all time!
Though the praise I’m giving this one may seem exaggerated, I assure you it’s not. Soto has executed a spectacular movie filled with great characters and genuine heart, and this is something that cannot be overstated. This is not a Flash situation. On the contrary. This is the one WB and DC should have poured more money into promoting, because it’s sincerely a charming winner.
Blue Beetle hits theaters August 18! Make sure you see this one, folks!

2023-08-22 01:37:02+02:00,"Ángel Manuel Soto, director of ‘Blue Beetle’: ‘It is worth investing in telling stories within the Latino identity’","In the newest movie from the DC universe, the Puerto Rican director introduces Jaime Reyes, a superhero of Mexican descent, to the big screen","The director of ‘Blue Beetle,’ Ángel Manuel Soto, on the set of the film. Cortesía Warner Brothers
Who is your favorite superhero? That was the first question that Ángel Manuel Soto and Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer asked themselves. The first is from San Juan, Puerto Rico, and the second from Querétaro, Mexico. Soto remembers, with a laugh, that they both agreed that they still cherish the memory of a yellow heart-shaped shield: “More agile than a turtle. Stronger than a mouse. Nobler than lettuce. His shield is a heart. It’s the Chapulín Colorado.” According to the Puerto Rican filmmaker, the character created by Mexican comedian Roberto Gómez Bolaño, Chespirito, transcended borders.
That connection helped the duo understand how stories can connect everyone in different ways. That idea was the impetus behind the film Blue Beetle, which introduces the character Jaime Reyes, a superhero of Mexican descent, into the DC Comics universe, along with characters such as Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman.
In the film, Jaime Reyes (played by Xolo Maridueña), a recent graduate, returns home full of aspirations for his future, but he discovers that his home is not exactly as he left it. In his quest to find his purpose in the world, fate intervenes when he unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the scarab. When the beetle chooses him as a symbiotic host, he receives an suit of armor with extraordinary powers, turning him into the superhero Blue Beetle.

Soto joined the project during the pandemic. His film Charm City Kings was about to be released, but due to the global lockdown, it could not be shown in theaters. It debuted on the streaming platform on HBO Max. DC Comics was looking for a Latino director, and due to Charm City Kings’ good reception, they approached Soto. Defending and preserving the film’s identity was the most challenging and difficult part, he admits. “Both the creators and the actors wanted to have the freedom to be freely Latino, of not having to explain our Latinness. The most complicated thing was having to explain that over and over again to those who saw that as unnecessary simply because they didn’t understand it,” says Soto.
Apart from Maridueña —an American with a Cuban father and Mexican mother— the film’s cast includes Mexican talent such as Adriana Barraza, Damián Alcázar and Elpidia Carrillo, as well as American actors with Mexican roots, such as George López and Harvey Guillen, and the Brazilian Bruna Marquezine.
The film is peppered with nods to Latin American culture, such as the similarity of Blue Beetle’s suit with the Mexican wrestler Blue Demon, references to the telenovela María la del Barrio, starring Thalía —”an inheritance” from Soto’s grandmother, the director says—, and iconic songs from the continent, such as Nada Personal by Soda Stereo, Cumbia Poder by Celso Piña and even Demolición, by the Peruvian punk rock band Los Saicos.

Although the story portrays a multigenerational Mexican family, the director admits, it was “illogical and absurd” to assume that a single film can include the collective experience of a million people. Soto and Dunnet-Alcocer attempted to find a focus that took into account the responsibility that fell on their shoulders, while capturing the intersections between different Latin cultures.
“We want Blue Beetle to be a letter of introduction to the different ranges of colors that exist within Latinidad, but also for this experience to serve as an example that it is worth investing in telling stories of different demographic groups within the Latino identity, because Latin American experiences are as diverse as our cultures,” adds Soto.
The Blue Beetle character was created in 1939. It has had three different incarnations, with Jaime Reyes the most recent, coming from the minds of Keith Giffen, John Rogers and Cully Hamner in 2006. Since then, the character has appeared in different comics series, television shows and video games. Soto and Dunnet-Alcocer took the best of the character to the film. “There are countless versions of the Blue Beetle, from the Infinite Crisis to the New 52. There are the animations of The Brave and the Bold, Young Justice and the comic Graduation Day, and the fighting moves in the video game Injustice 2, to mention a few. We have a shot with different facets of Jaime Reyes, and Gareth is a total geek for the character. I told him, ‘let’s have fun and make a version with his greatest hits,’” says Soto.
The film comes at a time when the superhero genre seems to be going through a crisis, due in part to an overproduction of films that fans insist do not meet quality standards, as well as a saturation of the genre. Since 2008, the year that Marvel Studios, DC’s competitor, released Iron Man, films have appeared in an incessant stream. The premiere of Soto’s film also coincides with the Hollywood actors and screenwriters strike, which prevents them from promoting any film or series.
Despite the uncertain environment around the movie, its best allies have been the fans, the internet and memes. For months the phrase “Blue Beetle August 18 only in theaters” has crept into all kinds of images and memes. In the United States, 27 groups have issued a letter in support of the film stating that their “stories are universal and need to be told.”
The next few weeks will be key to DC ending the year well, after two of its bets, Flash and Shazam! The Fury of the Gods, have not performed as expected at the box office. Faced with these ups and downs of the genre, Soto believes that the solution is to “bet on art.” “Before thinking about the commercial, authors must be given freedom so that they can express what they want without feeling that they are governed by a corporate shadow. I feel like that’s the way to refresh the genre when you feel stagnant. By doing things differently. Algorithms don’t know everything. Art has much more power than anything else,” he concludes.

,Recent Event,,"A young man finds himself transformed into a superhero by an alien technology in Director Ángel Manuel Soto’s Blue Beetle.
Based on the DC Comics character, Soto’s film tells the story of Jaime Reyes, whose life is changed when an alien scarab chooses him to be its symbiotic host granting him access to a suit of armor that transforms him into the superhero Blue Beetle.
On August 27, after the DGA membership screening in Los Angeles, Soto discussed the making of Blue Beetle during a Q&A moderated by Director Jaume Collet-Serra (Black Adam).
During the conversation, Soto revealed that even though this is a large scale superhero feature, he still thought of it as a ""small movie.""
""Small in terms of the superficial spectacles, expectations that people have of superhero movies. But we never saw that as a challenge, or a weakness or a threat to our project. We just saw it as an opportunity to go back to the original hero's journey and focus on that emotionality and that more character-driven than spectacle-driven aspect. So, by embracing the heart of the movie, we were able to create something big — that the action sequences feel like they are supporting the dramatic journey of our characters.""

,Filmmaker Angel Manuel Soto Reveals Bane-Sized Twist In Journey To Directing DC's Blue Beetle,The Charm City Kings director found deeper meaning in Blue Beetle's origins.,"When filmmaker Angel Manuel Soto received a call from Warner Bros. about potentially directing a DC comic book film, he was prepared to present a completely different idea. Soto, known for his work on Charm City Kings, recently revealed to Den of Geek magazine, ""I wanted to pitch ideas, and one of them was the Bane origin story. I always thought that there was something interesting in exploring his reality and how a character like that comes to be... [but] the conversation was not about that.""
Instead, According to the director, the studio said, ""There's this character that we've been developing for a couple of years. The Blue Beetle, a Latino superhero.""
Soto's desire to delve into the Bane story is not the first instance of interest in the character's return to the big screen. In April 2021, Dave Bautista also expressed his wish to play Bane, even approaching Warner Bros. on the matter. In 2023, it came out that the campaign to play the character went as far as having official talks with director James Gunn, who is now overseeing the DC Universe at Warner Bros.
Initially unsure if Blue Beetle was the right project for him, Soto eventually embraced the opportunity by grounding the superhero story in reality. He aimed to explore the protagonist's growth, family dynamics, and community impact, stating, ""He's not going to save the world yet; he doesn't deserve to yet.""
Starring Xolo Maridueña as Jamie Reyes, a college graduate who gains superpowers through an alien Blue Beetle scarab, Blue Beetle features an ensemble cast including Adriana Barraza, Damián Alcázar, Raoul Max Trujillo, Susan Sarandon, and George Lopez.

2023-08-21 18:47:00+00:00,‘Blue Beetle’ Director Angel Manuel Soto Reveals Dream Casting For Ted Kord,"Even though former Blue Beetle Ted Kord was subtly hinted at but never fully revealed on-screen, Angel Manuel Soto has an exciting vision for this role.","The superhero film landscape witnessed a unique addition with Blue Beetle, directed by the talented Angel Manuel Soto. Even though former Blue Beetle Ted Kord was subtly hinted at but never fully revealed on-screen, Soto has an exciting vision for this role. In a recent conversation with The Digital Fix, the director expressed his aspiration to see Ted Lasso star Jason Sudeikis bring Kord to life.
Speaking about his ideal Ted Kord, Angel Manuel Soto revealed: “My dream cast for Ted Kord has always been Jason Sudeikis. But at the end of the day, it’s about who’s best for the character, who loves what we’re trying to do. And who’s willing to see Jaime Reyes’ story continue.”
Choosing Jason Sudeikis could be seen as a strategic move. He has witnessed a meteoric rise in popularity thanks to his role in the award-winning series Ted Lasso. With his undeniable charisma, comedic timing, and proven ability to tap into the emotional depth of his characters, Sudeikis aligns with what many would envision for Ted Kord.
Over the weekend, Blue Beetle debuted with a tally of $25.4 million in North America. When combined with its international earnings, an additional $18 million from 63 different markets, the global opening stands at a somewhat underwhelming $43 million.
DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn has confirmed that Xolo Maridueña’s Jaime Reyes and a handful of other characters from Blue Beetle will continue within the canon of the DCU. Although this film was made under the previous regime, Gunn’s confirmation regarding the future of these characters bodes well for future stories. After all, a Booster Gold series was announced as part of DCU’s Chapter One: Gods and Monsters, and given that character’s ties to both Ted Kord and Jaime Reyes, it looks possible that we will see those three interact together sometime in the future.
Who is DC’s Blue Beetle?
Blue Beetle is one of DC’s lesser-known heroes, but he has a dedicated fanbase nonetheless. Created in 1939 by Charles Wojtkowski, Blue Beetle has gone through several iterations over the years. The Jaime Reyes version of the character was introduced during the events of 2006’s Infinite Crisis and quickly became a fan-favorite.
In the pages of DC Comics, Jaime Reyes is a teenager from El Paso, Texas.

Almost Delayed Blue Beetle to 2024 Over Actors’ Strike,"A new report reveals that Warner Bros. briefly considered delaying its upcoming DC film, Blue Beetle, to 2024.","Blue Beetle — the second-last entry in the DC Extended Universe — was almost pushed back to 2024 by Warner Bros., according to a new report.
Puck claims that studios, like Warner Bros., were considering delays to some of their upcoming films until after the strikes have concluded. Warner Bros. reportedly wanted to delay Blue Beetle to an undisclosed date in 2024, so that the cast could properly promote the DCEU film. However, the studio ultimately decided against it.
What is Blue Beetle?
Blue Beetle is directed by Angel Manuel Soto (Charm City Kings) from a screenplay adapted by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer (Miss Bala). Cobra Kai breakout Xolo Maridueña stars in the Latino-led superhero movie as Mexican-American college graduate, Jaime Reyes. In the comics, Jaime Reyes is the third character to assume the mantle of Blue Beetle after Dan Garrett and Ted Kord.
The ensemble cast also includes Bruna Marquezine as Jenny, George Lopez as Rudy, Adriana Barraza as Nana, Belissa Escobedo as Milagros Reyes, Elpidia Carrillo as Rocio, Damián Alcázar as Alberto, Raoul Trujillo as Carapax the Indestructible Man, and Harvey Guillén as Dr. Sanchez, with Becky G as the voice of the alien Scarab, Khaji-Da, and Susan Sarandon as the film’s main villain, Victoria Kord.
In Blue Beetle, Jaime Reyes “returns home full of aspirations for his future, only to find that home is not quite as he left it. As he searches to find his purpose in the world, fate intervenes when Jaime unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab,” reads the film’s synopsis. “When the Scarab suddenly chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, he is bestowed with an incredible suit of armor capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the Super Hero Blue Beetle.”

,Blue Beetle Hits Global Box Office Milestone,Blue Beetle has now crossed $100 million at the global box office.,"Blue Beetle has just hit a major box office milestone. After a few weeks at the box office, the latest DC film has finally crossed $100 million at the global box office. Over the weekend, the film's global box office climbed to $101.9 million through Sunday. Domestically, the film took the third spot behind Barbie (number two) and The Equalizer 3 in the top spot. Domestically, Blue Beetle's haul is sitting around $57.9 million.
At this point, while Blue Beetle is having a somewhat lackluster performance at the Box Office, it's still tracking to beat out Shazam! Fury of the Gods. The second Shazam! film's worldwide total hit around $133.8 million and Blue Beetle is projected to end its theatrical run with a global haul of between $140 and $170 million.
Will There Be More Blue Beetle?
While Blue Beetle's box office may not be as high as perhaps some would have hoped, head of DC Studios James Gunn has confirmed that we'll see Xolo Maridueña's Blue Beetle, along with ""a handful of other characters"" in the new DC Universe.
""We are part of the universe, we are part of the world, we are part of the plans that they have been creating for the future instalments of the DCU,"" Blue Beetle director Angel Manuel Soto said in an interview earlier this summer. ""But we are not tied to all the films from the past. Yes, our movie lives in the world where superheroes exist. But that doesn't mean that a certain event, or certain alliance, or certain things from the past dictate where our film is going.""
What Is Blue Beetle About?
From Warner Bros. Pictures comes Blue Beetle, which arrives in theaters on August 18th, marking the DC superhero's first time on the big screen. The film, directed by Angel Manuel Soto, stars Xolo Maridueña in the title role as well as his alter ego, Jaime Reyes. Recent college grad Jaime Reyes returns home full of aspirations for his future, only to find that home is not quite as he left it. As he searches to find his purpose in the world, fate intervenes when Jaime unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab. When the Scarab suddenly chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, he is bestowed with an incredible suit of armor capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the super hero Blue Beetle.
Starring alongside Maridueña are Adriana Barraza, Damían Alcázar, Elpidia Carrillo, Bruna Marquezine, Raoul Max Trujillo, with Oscar winner Susan Sarandon, and George Lopez (the ""Rio and ""Smurf"" franchises). The film also stars Belissa Escobedo and Harvey Guillén. Soto directs from a screenplay by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, based on characters from DC. John Rickard and Zev Foreman are producing, with Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Garrett Grant serving as executive producers.

2023-09-07 01:21:40+00:00,DC’s Blue Beetle Didn’t Initially Plan to Cast George Lopez,The production team behind DC's Blue Beetle reveals they had a different vision for Uncle Rudy Reyes before comedian George Lopez came along.,"The production team behind DC‘s Blue Beetle initially had a different vision for Rudy Reyes before George Lopez came along.
In an interview with Screen Rant, Blue Beetle concept artist Phil Boutte spoke in detail about the original conception for Jamie Reyes’ uncle — and how he was “surprised” when Lopez was cast in the role. “Lopez, they had him in mind, but it wasn’t initially him. It was going to be somebody that was skinnier and wiry,” Boutte said.
“His look, the mullet and all that? Just imagine an aged Mexican rocker,” he continued. “And then George came in, and then Mayes was doing the fittings with him and everything and going back and forth and they were finding his character. Those elements strangely still worked and it was just hilarious.”
Blue Beetle’s Latino-led cast
Lopez, a comedian and former star of his own eponymous ABC sitcom, joined Blue Beetle lead Xolo Maridueña in a cast of Latino performers who make up the heart and soul of Blue Beetle’s story. Instead of simply telling a standard superhero origin story about Jamie chosen by The Scarab to become the Blue Beetle, director Angel Manuel Soto wanted to emphasize the teenager’s growth in his family and his hometown of Palmera City. Authenticity was key in Soto’s casting process, which earned Blue Beetle high praise from Latino Hollywood organizations.
“Initially, my goal with finding the family was to be able to have an authentic group of people, not just as authentic on the Latino side, but authentic on the accents and authentic on the experience overall, it was very important for me to have the elders in the family to be from Mexico,” Soto said. “And more than just being from Mexico is honoring those amazing beloved actors from Mexico that have paved the way not just in Latin American cinema, but also crossing over to the Anglo-Saxon community and Latin American community in the United States.”
The director continued, “And then you have somebody on the younger side, the new blood that’s coming in, like Belissa [Escobedo] and Xolo, they’re Mexican American,” added Soto. “And tying them with the guys that came before which have a strong history of being born in Mexico and then coming over to the US. Being able to provide a Mexican family, a brown Mexican family, that embraces that level of authenticity, I think this cast allowed us to have all of that.”

Susan remarked, ""The ensemble he curated, encompassing not only the actors but also the crew, such as the costume designer and others, was truly remarkable.""
She elaborated, saying, ""What captivated me about the script and the entire experience was its strong focus on human connections. Ultimately, the prevailing force is love and the concept of family. The protagonist's evolution from resisting responsibility to ultimately embracing it offers a captivating narrative. As a mother of two boys, I see them venturing into a world traditionally molded for men, where the expectation of dominance clashes with the reality of survival as they mature. The crux of their journey lies in acknowledging their own capabilities, understanding that true empowerment comes from within, and recognizing the necessity of self-driven determination.

More than 8.5 million tickets were sold on Sunday, according to The Hollywood Reporter and participating theaters saw an increase in attendance by five percent compared to last year. In 2022, tickets were sold for $3.
While moviegoers appreciated the low ticket prices, some movie studios were pleased with how this impacted their films.

“Blue Beetle,” which was expected to drop 61% in its second weekend, actually got a boost in attendance because of National Cinema Day. The cheaper tickets reduced the drop to 49%, that’s according to The Wrap.
When it comes to “sheer grosses” from the cheap ticket day, “Barbie” came in at number one with $5.7 million. “Blue Beetle” came in at second with $5.5 million and the newest film, “Gran Turismo” raked in $4.7 million.

2023-08-12 12:15:50+00:00,First Reactions to DC's New Film Are Actually (Surprisingly) Good - Inside the Magic,"The first reviews for 'Blue Beetle' are in - and, surprisingly, critics are hailing it as the best DC film since 'Wonder Woman.'","If you thought Marvel was on a losing streak right now, spare a thought for DC Studios.
While Warner Bros. may have announced in late 2022 that James Gunn was stepping away from Marvel and Guardians of the Galaxy to take the creative helm of a new DC Universe, it still had a handful of existing films to deal with in the meantime – none of which have gone down well with fans or critics.
In March, DC released its follow-up to Shazam! (2019). Shazam! Fury of the Gods (2023) flopped at the box office, earning just $133.8 million on a $125 million budget. DC’s next film, The Flash (2023), bombed even harder. The controversial multiverse film led by Ezra Miller has earned the title of the biggest flop in the 100-year history of Warner Bros., as well as attracting endless critiques for everything from its CGI to its unethical cameos.
There are now just two more pre-Gunn movies left on DC’s release schedule: Blue Beetle (2023) and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023). Considering its recent history – and considering that both will likely be irrelevant to the reimagined DC Universe – hopes weren’t exactly high for either installment.
However, first reactions are in for Blue Beetle, and it seems like the prospects may be better than we first thought.
The film follows Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña), a recent college graduate who returns to his hometown of Palmera City, where he is chosen to become the symbiotic host to the Scarab – an ancient relic that turns him into the superhero Blue Beetle.
Critics have heaped on the praise for Maridueña and his “charismatic star-making performance” that, according to journalist Vanessa D., makes Blue Beetle “the best film to come out of the DCU since Wonder Woman.”
This seems to be a common comparison, with The Washington Post reporter David Betancourt claiming that it’s “right up there with the first Wonder Woman,” as well as pushing for Maridueña’s character to become a part of the new DCU once James Gunn takes the reins. Others have gone so far as to dub it the best DC superhero movie since Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy.
A major high point is said to be the film’s focus on family and Latin culture. Director Angel Manuel Soto has reportedly “filled the film with the heart of Latin culture and focused on the importance of family and believing in yourself against all odds.”
Happy to finally share #BlueBeetle is everything I hoped it would be! @angelmanuelsoto filled the film with the heart of Latin Culture and focused on the importance of family and believing in yourself against all odds.

Fortunately, it seems like Gunn is on the same page. The writer and director has previously commented that while Superman: Legacy (2025) is the first DCU film, Blue Beetle will technically count as the first character in the DC Universe. Angel Manuel Soto has also expressed interest in making a Blue Beetle trilogy.

Though he was wonderful in that role, he said he did not want to be remembered only for that. While it was assumed he would not want to take on the role of another superhero, the man is pitching his idea to take on the greatest Batman villain.
Related: ‘Blue Beetle’ Director Didn’t Want The Movie, Pitched This DC Villain Instead
DC is in flux right now, as the company is waiting to fully transform into the DCU under the leadership of James Gunn. Though the famed director and now CEO revealed that the DCU would officially start with his Superman: Legacy film, there are a couple of holdouts from the past era of DC. One of those holdouts is Blue Beetle, which has been garnering some good excitement.
There has been some confusion about where Blue Beetle fits into the new DCU; as Gunn stated, “Superman is the first DCU movie, but Blue Beetle is the first DCU character.” We think he means that there might not be a trilogy planned for Jamie Reyes, but he is often a huge ally to many DC characters highlighted in the DCU Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters slate.
Blue Beetle and Booster Gold are huge allies in the comics, meaning he could appear in that series, and there have been rumors of Blue Beetle also appearing in Peacemaker Season 2.
Either way, Blue Beetle director Angel Manuel Soto has seemingly made something special, and early reactions could lead to the man having a more expansive role in the DCU. He initially had a pitch for a Batman film, though he was given Blue Beetle. Dave Bautista has apparently seen Blue Beetle and loved it so much that he wants to work with Soto.
Dave Bautista Wants to Play Bane
Before Angel Manuel Soto was set up as the director of Blue Beetle, he had apparently given DC a pitch about a movie that revolved around Bane. Soto is introducing the first Latino superhero to DC, so it makes sense that he wanted to do the same with Bane. Though most fans know Bane to be Tom Hardy, the character is often of South American descent.
There has not yet been a truly comic-accurate version of Bane shown in live-action, so it stands to reason that someone would want to accomplish doing so. Soto made a significant impression on Dave Bautista, who now wants to portray Bane in the DCU.
DC currently has two different Batman universe franchises happening. Matt Reeves is building out his Batverse, with Robert Pattinson starring as Batman. Reeves has a more grounded approach to his films, much like Nolan, so we are unsure if he plans to bring Bane into the mix. Nolan did bring in Bane, but not the traditional South American version from the comics.
There are also the Todd Phillips Joker films that have yet to bring in Batman, though the first film did feature a young Bruce Wayne. Though there have been rumors that Harvey Dent would be in the second film, it might still not set up the traditional Batman story of him taking down these criminals to save Gotham.
James Gunn is developing his DCU Batman film, The Brave and The Bold. That could be the place to introduce Bane, as he would appear to fight Bruce and Damien Wayne. This could be where Dave Bautista could theoretically be introduced, assuming Soto doesn’t get to make his solo Bane movie.
James Gunn and Dave Bautista have also worked with one another extensively on Guardians of the Galaxy, so we imagine Gunn is a big fan of the man’s acting prowess. Gunn had stated he planned to work with actors from Marvel in his DCU, so it makes sense he would want to bring Bautista over.
Related: New Batman: The Brave and The Bold Director has IT Factor
We will have to see how Blue Beetle does in theaters when its releases next week and if Soto will be retained to develop more DC projects. Andy Muschietti directed The Flash and is staying under the DC banner to direct The Brave and the Bold. Should Soto make a splash with his film, he could be treated the same by receiving another movie. It just depends on Gunn if Bautista could take on the role of Bane.

,‘Blue Beetle’ filmmaker Ángel Manuel Soto to direct Jason Momoa/Dave Bautista comedy ‘The Wrecking Crew’,,"Ángel Manuel Soto, who called the shots on Warner Bros.’ last superhero film to be finished prior to its DC Films restructuring, Blue Beetle, has signed on to direct two superhero movie veterans for his next project.
The Hollywood Reporter says Soto will be behind the camera for The Wrecking Crew, the MGM buddy comedy starring Aquaman veteran Jason Momoa and Guardians of the Galaxy‘s Dave Bautista.
Incidentally, while the plot is still under wraps, the project is a bit of manifesting from Bautista, who tweeted in August 2021, “Just going to throw this out into the atmosphere and see what happens. Here we go… Me and Momoa in a Lethal Weapon‘ type buddy cop movie directed by David Leitch. Ok! There it is. Now we wait.”
Leitch is the stuntman-turned-director behind Bullet Train and the first John Wick film, among others.
Soto’s Blue Beetle enjoyed a decent Critics Score of 77% and an impressive Audience Score of 92% on the aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, though it didn’t have a stellar opening weekend at the box office. Its $24.5 million take was enough to knock Barbie from the number one position after a month at the top — but not by much.
While DC Films co-chairs James Gunn and Peter Safran have said its star, Xolo Maridueña, will live on in their newly organized cinematic universe, Blue Beetle was the third superhero misfire in a row for Warner Bros. this year, following Shazam: Fury of the Gods and The Flash.

2023-09-17 21:00:57+00:00,Making the First Live-Action Superhero Film with a Latino Lead: Ángel Manuel Soto Chats 'Blue Beetle',"Fourteen movies in, the DC Extended Universe charts new territory by bringing a lesser-known caped-crusader to the screen.","Batman. Superman. Wonder Woman. Aquaman. Ask someone to name a DC superhero and one of these figures might be their first response. They're the characters that've also been anchoring the big screen's DC Extended Universe for the past decade. Shazam, Harley Quinn, Black Adam and The Flash each scored movies bearing their monikers over that period — some have popped up in Justice League and not one but two Suicide Squad flicks as well — but the franchise's best-recognised players still remain unchanged.
Enter Blue Beetle, which brings a lesser-known caped crusader to picture palaces, but one that dates back 84 years on the page to 1939. The DCEU's 14th entry also achieves a feat that no other caped-crusader film has before it, among the company's own flicks or the rival Marvel Cinematic Universe. It shouldn't have taken a decade since this specific franchise began, and 15 years after the MCU initially arrived, for the first live-action superhero movie with a Latino lead to hit. This important achievement shouldn't be forgotten from here on in, either.
Blue Beetle's significance isn't lost on filmmaker Ángel Manuel Soto, who leaps from 2015 Puerto Rican drama La Granja and 2020 Sundance Film Festival standout Charm City Kings to helming Hollywood history. It isn't the type of feature he ever saw himself making, but it's an opportunity that he's wholeheartedly embraced. As he tells Jaime Reyes' (Xolo Maridueña, Cobra Kai) tale, charting his journey from ordinary Mexican American twenty something to Spider-Man-meets-Venom-meets-Iron Man-style hero, he tells of Latinx culture, of the importance of family, and of everyday experiences and struggles. Indeed, as he explains to Concrete Playground, that's the only way he could ever envisage spinning this story.
Accordingly, this is a caped-crusader flick that nods to 90s telenovela María la del Barrio, shoots a crucial scene like an immigration raid and knows how difficult keeping secrets can be in close Latinx families where the bonds of blood are everything. In dialogue around Jaime's name, it references Ángel's own experience having his moniker mispronounced daily. With a scientist played by What We Do in the Shadows' Harvey Guillén, it calls out racist tendencies to give everyone from a particular culture the same term.
Again and again, Blue Beetle grounds its narrative in authentic details, all as Jaime comes into contact with an alien gadget that turns him into the titular figure. And, it does so with its protagonist's mother Rocio (Elpidia Carrillo, Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities), father Alberto (Damián Alcázar, Acapulco), sister Milagro (Belissa Escobedo, Hocus Pocus 2), Nana (Adriana Barraza, Penny Dreadful: City of Angels) and uncle Rudy (George Lopez, Lopez vs Lopez) always by his side.
With Blue Beetle in cinemas Down Under, we chatted to Soto about his journey from adoring cinema to his latest film, his approach to introducing a Latino lead to the superhero genre, building in that crucial authenticity and making a family drama as much as a save-the-world feature.
ON THE JOURNEY FROM GROWING UP LOVING MOVIES TO DIRECTING A SUPERHERO FILM
""I never saw myself making a movie like this. It's still — I have to pinch myself all the time because after Charm City Kings, I didn't know it was going to cause the impact that it did, and I didn't know it was going to draw that much attention. Because at the end of the day, I try to do everything out of love and and passion, especially for the communities that I represent in my films.
Having a movie like this happen was very humbling. Being able to also tell stories that I want to tell within the superhero genre is something that I'm going to be forever grateful for to the guys at DC, because they respected the stories that I wanted to tell.
At the same time, it gave me another another stepping stone in in my career to explore this passion that I have for my craft in a genre that's so beloved by many.""
ON MAKING THE THE FIRST LIVE-ACTION SUPERHERO MOVIE WITH A LATINO LEAD
""That that was probably the reason why I accepted to do it — because it was introducing a Latino character to the DC world. It being the first live-action Latino superhero [film], I felt a great responsibility and an opportunity at the same time to be able to tell our stories in a way that is reflected through the lens and the eyes of a Latino as well.
It helped a lot to have the writer, Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, be from Querétaro in Mexico. And he bringing his own authenticity to the script, and me coming with my experiences from Puerto Rico. And working together to create something that felt authentic to our experiences growing up — and translating that into Jaime Reyes and Blue Beetle, that made it very easy for us.
The whole team was onboard, and casting the right talents, and having them be from Mexico as well, was part of the plan. So we wanted to do it the right way. We cannot tell the story of of every Latino in the world, because one, we're not a monolith, and two, we're too many. But being able to tell at least one story of those, our hope is to hear and see and enjoy other stories from all over Latin America as well.""
ON BUILDING AUTHENTICITY INTO EVEN THE SMALLEST OF EXCHANGES AND DETAILS
""Well, the truth is that the ongoing joke with Jaime is something that I experience daily. My name is Ángel. Some people call me Angel [Ángel pronounces it like the spiritual being]. Some people call me 'on-hell'. Some people call me Angel [Ángel pronounces it 'angle']. And the whole thing of trying to explain my name and how to pronounce it phonetically, it's a daily thing, so we wanted to to have fun with that and show what we have to deal with all the time.
Also, the way Victoria Kord [Blue Beetle's villainous CEO, as played by Maybe I Do's Susan Sarandon] treats Sanchez [her chief scientist, as played by Guillén] is something that as Latinos — and this happens with other communities as well — sometimes they they try to minimise us by calling us one name. You know, like ""hey Jose, come here Jose"", with a little bit of a racist, biased joke behind them.
But we wanted to to really showcase in the case Doctor Sanchez that there is power to our name. And there's an individual power that everybody has, and our name carries that. Because our name comes from, especially in our culture — like, I go through Ángel Manuel Soto Vázquez — we have both our parents names. For us that means a lot because we honour our ancestors, and we try to go as far back as we can and wear that name with pride because we would never be where we are without them.
So it was very important to to give Doctor Sanchez that arc, because when he says his name, that's when he gets empowered, and that's when he actually becomes his hero of his story.""
ON MAKING A FAMILY DRAMA AS MUCH AS A SUPERHERO FILM
""It was definitely very important for us to to tell the story of the whole family. We wanted to do a fresh take on the superhero origin story. And the writer and I, we were very keen to treat the first act like Latin cinema, where we spend time with our characters, with their environment, where you get to know bits and pieces of everyone so that before all the action starts to happen you're already invested — not only in in our superhero, not only in our main character Jaime, you're also invested with the family. Because how they relate and everything that they're going to end up giving to the story and to the character of Blue Beetle, it's as important as the hero himself.
Another thing that we wanted to flip on its head a little bit is the fact that most superheroes, what happens to them happens in secret. And they keep this secret from their family, you know to protect them — and it does make sense.
But both the writer and my experience is that it's very hard to keep a secret from a Latino mother — and my parents and my family, they're very nosy. They still are. It was crazy for us to think that the family wouldn't have any involvement in the creation of the superhero.
Like I mentioned before, what our parents and our ancestors have done for us make us who we are, and we wanted to honour that. So we really felt that that was something that we wanted to protect — and not just in terms of like teachings or mentorship; we also wanted them to have an active participation in the success of our hero, giving them all heroic arcs as they end up protecting and saving Jaime.
Part of that comes from the fact that we feel that way about our family. They're not just passive bystanders, they're actually active components to who we are and how far we're able to go. But also in this whole family adventure, we wanted every single family member from the youngest sister to the oldest grandfather to see themselves also in a movie that treats them with respect, but also sees them as heroes — so they can see themselves as heroes, too.
And to that end, we really focused it on trying to be like 'let's make this into a family adventure that does have these superhero elements'. And as an introduction to the world of Jaime and Blue Beetle, we felt like this is a beautiful first act to what his whole journey is going to be.""

,Blue Beetle: Angel Manuel Soto confirma peculiar cameo de Linterna Verde,El director asegura que la cinta está llena de easters eggs y referencias a DC,"AFP
Astrónoma y estrella en Instagram y TikTok, Teresa Paneque es a los 26 años una de las divulgadoras científicas más populares de Chile. Su mayor aporte a la ciencia es Carlota, paradójicamente un personaje de ficción que motiva a las niñas a adentrarse en el estudio del universo. Paneque profesa la ciencia en la capital mundial de la astronomía, como se conoce a Chile por la gran cantidad de telescopios instalados en el desierto de Atacama, el más árido del planeta.Hija de un bioquímico cubano y una química farmacéutica chilena, Paneque comenzó a estudiar astronomía a los 16 años y actualmente cursa un doctorado en Países Bajos. Nació en España, pero llegó a vivir a Chile a los nueve años.Comenzó a ser conocida en 2019 gracias a sus publicaciones en redes sociales. Con un lenguaje sencillo, aborda temas como la rotación de la Tierra, la formación de planetas o la llegada del hombre a la Luna. Actualmente tiene 247.000 seguidores en Instagram y 771.000 en TikTok.Una editorial la buscó para que escribiera un libro ""divertido"" sobre astronomía. En 2021 ""El universo según Carlota"" vio la luz. Ya van tres tomos y unos 25.000 ejemplares vendidos. El personaje es una niña de 12 años, sin lentes y pelo largo que lleva un suéter estampado de estrellas. Carlota odiaba las clases de ciencia, pero en una feria científica - a la que asistió obligada - conectó con la inmensidad. ""Este libro no es para que todos los niños y niñas que lo lean sean científicos y científicas. Es para que se den cuenta que si lo quieren, pueden serlo"", sostiene.Recientemente nombrada embajadora de la Unicef en Chile, Paneque habló con la AFP a su paso por Santiago.P: ¿Cómo llegó a la astronomía?R: Me gustaba mucho entender y comprender nuestro entorno. Descubrí la física, que ocupa las matemáticas como un lenguaje para poder predecir y modelar la naturaleza, y eso me pareció mágico. (...) Y dentro de la física, me pareció que la astronomía era lo más desafiante, porque estudia algo que no podemos tocar, interactuar, que no podemos experimentar con el más allá de la luz.Los primeros años de universidad tuvo sólo profesores hombres, pero tardó en darse cuenta que no tenía ni una referente mujer: ""Eso me produjo un shock muy grande. (...) Eso estaba en mi cabeza, hasta que empecé mi magíster y tuve profesoras mujeres que eran físicas, que eran astrónomas, que eran líderes en sus áreas. (...) Hoy cuando yo pienso en quién me inspira la ciencia, son mis profesoras"".P: ¿Qué mensaje le transmite Carlota a las niñas?R: Me gustaría que en los siguientes libros hablásemos sobre mujeres en ciencia. Y hablásemos quizás sobre esta crisis de representatividad. (...) Me gustaría a través de Carlota poder presentar esos personajes, estas figuras escondidas o perdidas, porque las mujeres siempre hemos estado, siempre hemos sido fundamentales.P: ¿Cómo ve el movimiento feminista en Chile?R: Como cualquier lugar en el mundo seguimos teniendo grandes problemas de inequidad de género (...) en todos los temas: en la política, en la academia, en las escuelas, pero hemos tenido grandes avances (...). Hay muchos lugares donde hoy se entiende la necesidad de hacer políticas de equidad de género, pero quizás se siente que el tema ya está saturado, que no es necesario seguir hablando. En Chile el movimiento feminista ha sido muy importante para mí, pero yo creo que también ha sido importante para mantener el tema en la palestra pública.P: ¿Por qué su interés en las mujeres y la ciencia? R: Porque las mujeres estadísticamente tienen la mitad de las respuestas, igual que los hombres tienen la otra mitad. No nos sirve una ciencia que sean todas mujeres, no nos sirve una ciencia que sean todos hombres, y por cada gran idea que surgió el siglo pasado probablemente hubo otra gran idea de una mujer que nunca tuvo la oportunidad, nunca tuvo la posibilidad de acceder a esa educación.P: ¿Científica o divulgadora científica?R: Las personas somos multidisciplinarias. (...) Además de las redes, de los libros y de la ciencia, a mí me gustaría mucho poder aportar a políticas públicas. Tengo una visión muy crítica respecto de la necesidad de potenciar la educación científica.ps/pa/vel/dga/dbh",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZXMtdXMudmlkYS1lc3RpbG8ueWFob28uY29tL2JsdWUtYmVldGxlLWFuZ2VsLW1hbnVlbC1zb3RvLTE3MjQwMDM2NC5odG1s0gFYaHR0cHM6Ly9lcy11cy52aWRhLWVzdGlsby55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC9ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1hbmdlbC1tYW51ZWwtc290by0xNzI0MDAzNjQuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-21 06:00:04+02:00,"Ángel Manuel Soto, director de ‘Blue Beetle’: “Vale la pena invertir en contar historias dentro de la identidad latina”","El director puertorriqueño presenta la nueva película del universo DC, que introduce a la pantalla grande a Jaime Reyes, un superhéroe de ascendencia mexicana","¿Quién es tu superhéroe favorito? Fue la primera pregunta que se hicieron Ángel Manuel Soto y Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer. El primero es de San Juan, Puerto Rico, y el segundo de Querétaro, México. Soto recuerda, con risas, que ambos coincidieron en que aún preservan en el pecho el recuerdo de un escudo amarillo en forma de corazón: “Más ágil que una tortuga. Más fuerte que un ratón. Más noble que una lechuga. Su escudo es un corazón. Es el chapulín colorado”. Según el realizador boricua, el personaje creado por el comediante Roberto Gómez Bolaño, Chespirito, como muchos otros, trascendió fronteras y ya no solo es un patrimonio cultural de los mexicanos.
Esos puntos de interseccionalidad presentes en el Chapulín fueron los que les hizo entender cómo contar una historia y cómo esta puede conectar a todos de distintas maneras. El abrazar esta idea fue el puntapié inicial para la concepción de la película Blue Beetle, que introduce al personaje Jaime Reyes, un superhéroe de ascendencia mexicana, en el mismo universo de la pantalla grande en el que otros personajes de la editorial de cómics DC, como Superman, Batman y la Mujer Maravilla, por mencionar algunos, ya han debutado con sendos filmes.
Jaime Reyes (interpretado por Xolo Maridueña), recién licenciado, regresa a casa lleno de aspiraciones para su futuro, pero descubre que su hogar no es exactamente como lo dejó. En su búsqueda por encontrar su propósito en el mundo, el destino interviene cuando se encuentra inesperadamente en posesión de una antigua reliquia de biotecnología alienígena: el escarabajo. Cuando el escarabajo lo elige como huésped simbiótico, éste recibe una increíble armadura con poderes extraordinarios e impredecibles que cambiarán para siempre su destino y le convertirán en el superhéroe Blue Beetle (Escarabajo azul, en español).

Soto se incorporó al proyecto durante la pandemia, cuando tenía por estrenar su película Charm City Kings, pero que debido a la alerta sanitaria mundial no pudo exhibirse en salas. Llegó a la plataforma de streaming en HBO Max y debido a su buena recepción le dijeron que buscaban a un director latino para hacerse cargo. Defender y preservar la identidad del filme fue los más desafiante y difícil, según admite. “Queríamos tener, no solamente nosotros como creadores, pero también los actores la libertad de poder ser libremente latinos, de no tener que dar explicaciones de nuestra latinidad. Lo más complicado fue tener que explicar una y otra vez a algunas personas que simplemente quizás porque no lo entendían, lo veían innecesario”, afirma Soto.
La película, aparte de Maridueña —estadounidense de padre cubano y madre mexicana—, cuenta en su elenco con talento mexicano como Adriana Barraza, Damián Alcázar, Elpidia Carrillo, actores estadounidenses de raíces mexicanas, como George López, Harvey Guillen, y también la brasileña Bruna Marquezine.
Pero las referencias a la cultura latinomericana no solo se quedan en los nombres, sino también en guiños claros, como la similitud del traje de Blue Beetle con el luchador mexicano Blue Demon, recuerdos telenovelescos a través de María la del barrio, protagonizada por Thalía —”una herencia’ de la abuela de Soto, según contó—, y canciones icónicas del continente, como Nada personal, de Soda Stereo; Cumbia Poder, de Celso Piña y hasta Demolición, de la banda de punk rock peruana Los Saicos.

Si bien la historia retrata a una familia mexicana de distintas generaciones, admite el realizador, era “ilógico y absurdo” asumir que dentro de una sola película se puede contar la experiencia colectiva de un millón de personas. Lo que Soto y Dunnet-Alcocer hicieron fue tratar de encontrar un norte, entendiendo la responsabilidad que caía sobre sus hombros y plasmar esos lazos de encuentro en los que se pueda crear la interseccionalidad de las diferentes culturas latinas.
“Queremos que Blue Beetle sea una carta de presentación de las diferentes gamas de colores que existen dentro de la latinidad, pero también que esta experiencia nos sirva de ejemplo de que vale la pena invertir en contar historias de diferentes grupos demográficos dentro de la identidad latina, porque las experiencias latinoamericanas son tan diversas como la cultura que tenemos”, agrega Soto.
El personaje de Blue Beetle fue creado en 1939 y ha tenido tres encarnaciones diferentes, siendo la de Jaime Reyes la más reciente, salido de la mente de Keith Giffen, John Rogers y Cully Hamner en 2006. Desde entonces, el personaje ha aparecido en distintas series de cómics, en programas televisivos y videojuegos. Soto y Dunnet-Alcocer tomaron lo mejor del personaje para plasmarlo en el cine. “Hay un sinnúmero de versiones de Blue Beetle. Desde la Crisis Infinita, hasta New 52. Están las animaciones de The Brave and The bold, Young Justice y el cómic Graduation Day, los movimientos de pelea en el videojuego Injustice 2, por mencionar Algunos. Tenemos un plano con diferentes facetas de Jaime Reyes y Gareth es un geek total del personaje, le dije: ‘divirtámonos y hagamos una versión con sus mejores éxitos”, cuenta Soto.
La película llega en un momento en el cual el género de superhéroes parece pasar por una crisis, debido en parte a una sobreproducción de filmes que, acorde a los fans, no cumplen con los estándares de calidad; y por otra, debido a una saturación del género, que no ha parado de producir desde 2008, año que se estrena Iron Man, de Marvel Studios, la empresa competidora de DC. Otras situaciones que se han puesto por delante de la película de Soto es que su estreno coincide con la huelga de actores y guionistas en Hollywood exigiendo mejores condiciones laborales, lo cual les impide promocionar cualquier película o serie.
A pesar del ambiente incierto alrededor de la cinta, sus mejores aliados han sido los fans, el internet y los memes. Desde hace meses la frase “Blue Beetle 18 de agosto solo en cines” se ha colado en todo tipo de imagen y memes con toques humorísticos. Mientras que en Estados Unidos 27 colectivos han emitido una carta en respaldo a la película expresando que sus “historias son universales y necesitan ser contadas”.
Las próximas semanas serán clave para saber si DC logra remontar el año tras que dos de sus apuestas del año, como Flash y ¡Shazam! La furia de los dioses, no hayan tenido el rendimiento en taquilla esperado. Ante estos altibajos del género, Soto cree que la solución es “apostar al arte”. “Antes que pensar en lo comercial, hay que dar libertad a los autores para que puedan expresar lo que quieran sin que sientan que están regidos por una sombra corporativa. Siento que esa es la manera de refrescar el género cuando sientes un estancamiento. Haciendo las cosas diferentes, los algoritmos no lo saben todo. El arte tiene mucho más poder que cualquier otra cosa”, finaliza.

“¡Eres un superhéroe, cabrón!”.
En los últimos años el tema estrella entre los aficionados vuelve a ser el desapego de los espectadores por las nuevas producciones superheroicas. Los vicios y caminos comunes por los que transita un género a los que una parte del fandom parece ansiosa por ver fracasar en la gran pantalla por no sabemos que extrañas motivaciones. Pero hablamos de un género que ha estado presente en nuestros cines de forma regular desde finales de los años ochenta, a raíz de la batmania desatada por aquella primera película del Batman de Tim Burton. Ya a principios de este siglo el bombardeo de producciones de corte superheroico ha sido constante. Y esto sin contar la influencia que ha tenido el cine de superhéroes en la redefinición del cine de acción de las últimas tres décadas. Es decir, el éxito del género superheroico no está solo en el interés que generan sus propias historias, sino también en haber construido una filosofía que ha calado fuertemente en creadores, estudios y en el imaginario popular definiendo las reglas de la (ciencia) ficción que consumimos hoy en día.
Por otro lado, cuando apuntamos ese pretendido declive actual del género parece que estemos entendiendo a los espectadores como una única masa con unos mismos intereses, gustos e inquietudes. Esto no deja de ser un error de base en el que suelen caer tanto los espectadores como la crítica. Un error que no explicaría éxitos recientes como The Batman, Joker, Doctor Extraño en el Multiverso de la Locura, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Guardianes de la Galaxia Vol. 3 y Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse. Todas ellas producciones estrenadas en los últimos cinco años y que han animado al gran público a pasar por las cada vez más deprimidas salas de cine. Es cierto, en su mayoría estos éxitos tienen que ver con la imagen de marca, pues hablamos de secuelas y/o nuevas interpretaciones de personajes consolidados y conocidos por el gran público desde hace décadas.
Es decir, podemos hablar mucho de fórmulas, estilos y planes maestros, pero como espectadores estamos bastante acomodados a buscar siempre lo mismo. Para que una propuesta que se salga de lo habitual tenga una oportunidad hoy en día tiene que tener ese «algo» indescriptible que atraiga nuestra atención. Esa magia intrínseca al cine que se puede intentar promover, pero que siempre va a responder a muy diversas variables difíciles de definir y cuantificar. Aunque siempre puede hacer mucho una buena campaña de marketing. En ese sentido, no es menor cierto que los estudios están replicando a día de hoy estrategias y maneras que los aficionados a las viñetas hemos padecido durante décadas en los cómics: crossovers, saturación del mercado, repetición de esquemas, reinicios chusqueros, etc.
Esto sin contar que al igual que en las viñetas, en el cine también se ha establecido un cierto monopolio de dos cabezas en torno a este tipo de historias. Después de una primera etapa en la que las licencias de Marvel Comics estaban desperdigadas por distintas productoras y con las producciones puntuales de DC Comics en la gran pantalla incapaces de ir más allá de la enésima película de Batman o Superman, tanto Marvel Studios como DC Entertainment han aprovechado y explotado su imagen de marca -con mejores o peores resultados- para imponerse a cualquier otra alternativa. Las propuestas a nivel independiente brillan a día de hoy por su ausencia y con cada nuevo estreno de las grandes es más difícil que puedan encontrar un hueco en el futuro.
Y con esto llegamos a un presente en el que las dos compañías se han encontrado en un «momento valle» en su trayectoria, una –Marvel Studios– por el cierre de su primera gran etapa y otra –DC Studios– por la factura que le ha pasado el no tener durante años un organigrama claro y cohesionado para su universo superheroico. La solución después de los últimos fracasos de DC Studios ha sido hacer borrón y cuenta nueva. Y el destino ha hecho que James Gunn y Peter Safran -nuevos responsables del futuro de la compañía- tengan un primer reto a superar con el estreno de la primera entrega de las aventuras de un personaje inesperado: Blue Beetle.
Este es un proyecto que ya estaba en marcha en 2018, antes de la reestructuración planeada para el universo cinematográfico de DC Entertainment. Pero debido a su estado embrionario ha sido adoptado para la causa por Gunn y Safran para formar parte de la nueva continuidad de las producciones de la compañía. De hecho, Blue Beetle estaba pensada en origen como una cinta de «presupuesto medio» para su estreno en exclusiva la plataforma de HBO Max. Esa era la intención de Walter Hamada, pero finalmente se ha optado por su estreno en cines. La película es la primera protagonizada por un superhéroe de origen latino en el organigrama de DC Studios, un honor que recae en Xolo Maridueña, un actor estadounidense de raíces cubano-ecuatorianos y mexicanas al que todos conocemos por su participación en Cobra Kai. Maridueña encarna en la ficción a Jaime Reyes, el tercer personaje que en la cronología de las publicaciones de DC Comics asumió el manto de Blue Beetle a principios de este siglo, rompiendo bastante con la imagen establecida por sus antecesores.
En el reparto también tenemos a Bruna Marquezine, una joven actriz brasileña que interpreta Jenny Kord, hija a su vez de Ted Kord que en los cómics fue el segundo y más querido Blue Beetle (sobre todo en sus aventuras junto a Booster Gold). Un papel que ya deja claro la importancia del tema del legado en la presente Blue Beetle. En ese sentido, es clave el papel de Victoria Kord que interpreta una veterana como Susan Sarandon en un rol ciertamente inédito en su carrera como villana de la función en una película de corte superheroico. El resto del reparto lo conforman, por un lado, la familia de Jaime Reyes interpretada por Belissa Escobedo, George Lopez, Adriana Barraza, Damián Alcázar y Elpidia Carrillo, y por otro lado, Raoul Trujillo que interpreta a Ignacio Carapax, la amenaza física con la que deben lidiar Blue Beetle en la película y que funciona como reinvención del concepto de OMAC.
El reparto ya nos deja a las claras el tono familiar de Blue Beetle, uno que contrasta con las producciones previas de DC Studios. Y es que esta vertiente solo la hemos visto realmente en ¡Shazam! y ¡Shazam! La furia de los dioses que podrían ser las producciones más cercanas a la presente Blue Beetle del antiguo universo. Una idea que remarca la dirección del purtorriqueño Ángel Manuel Soto y el guión del mexicano Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer. La familia y la deconstrucción de la misma en base a su modelo tradicional es el elemento vertebrador de Blue Beetle, emparentado así está producción con propuestas de la competencia como Ant-Man y Guardianes de la Galaxia. La diferencia con estas propuestas es que Blue Beetle trata el impacto del elemento superheroico en un núcleo familiar normal y corriente de clase baja, algo que no está presente en las cintas de Marvel Studios en la que tenemos -literalmente- «familias de superhéroes».
Blue Beetle nos trae también de vuelta un prototipo de superhéroe que ya damos por perdido en el género cinematográfico, uno caracterizado por su dualidad y sus problemas reales frente a los de su faceta superheroica. Aunque esta buena intención de partida se va diluyendo en parte a lo largo de la cinta que además redunda en dinámicas familiares que pueden hacer resentir el ritmo del conjunto. Unas dinámicas que por otro lado hacen que las escenas dramáticas tengan un verdadero impacto. Además, la película ahonda en la perspectiva de la población migrante en territorio estadounidense, en las desigualdades de clase y en el intervencionismo de Estados Unidos a nivel internacional, un componente que sorprendentemente ya encontrábamos en producciones del antiguo universo como Escuadrón Suicida y Black Adam. Blue Beetle tiene un mensaje muy sencillo y escasamente revulsivo, pero mantiene la coherencia a lo largo de todo su metraje.
Por otro lado, la adaptación de la historia de Jaime Reyes es bastante fiel a grandes rasgos al origen del personaje que nos narraron Keith Giffen, John Rogers y Cully Hamner en su primera serie y que claramente intentaba captar a un nuevo lector más influenciado por el manga y el anime. No hay sorpresas al respecto: Jaime Reyes un joven normal y corriente que por azares del destino entra en contacto con un extraño artefacto que le otorga increíbles poderes. Esta simple premisa describe la serie original y también su adaptación a la pantalla que funciona como una prototípica -y en parte modélica- historia de orígenes. Los responsables de esta producción se nota que han estudiado a conciencia lo que se ha hecho con el género en nuestros días porque Blue Beetle funciona ante todo como un collage de elementos exportados de aquí y de allá, como intentando sintetizar y destilar lo que a su criterio hace funcionar al género.
Por fortuna, en este proceso Blue Beetle abandona definitivamente el tono más melodramático, impostado y filosóficamente edgy del anterior universo. Estamos ante una película más colorida que a nivel visual sigue apelando a la nostalgia ochentera (su estética nos puede recordar a la mítica Tron de Steven Lisberger), pero que a su vez se distancia lo suficiente de Marvel Studios para ofrecernos algo ligeramente diferente. Lo hace por esas influencias respecto al anime y el manga que comentábamos de la serie original y que aquí ganan importancia, sobre todo se aprecian en su tratamiento de la acción, más rápida y menos acartonada que otras cintas recientes del género. También por una estética visual más orgánica, aunque tenga margen para pulir algunos efectos especiales, sobre todo en el contraste entre la acción y los fondos de la misma. Estamos ante una historia protagonizada por armaduras tecnológicas que se distancia conscientemente de la referencia de Iron Man, para acercarse a la influencia visual del género tokusatsu y las historias de mechas japonesas en la línea de los Power Rangers.
En cualquier caso, si podemos encontrar diversos paralelismos entre la película original de Iron Man dirigida en 2008 por Jon Favreau y la presente Blue Beetle: su ecosistema armamentístico, el componente tecnológico, el concepto de legado familiar, etc. Todo está ahí, pero agitado y removido con la esperanza de que el público entienda a Blue Beetle como un punto y aparte en el género de la misma manera que lo fue en su día la producción protagonizada por Robert Downey Jr. Al fin y al cabo, con Blue Beetle tenemos a un héroe con capacidades similares y aumentadas que además -intencionadamente o no- replica todos los poderes de los Vengadores gracias a su capacidad para generar escudos, martillos, espadas y todo tipo de armas.
En ese sentido, es muy interesante la manera en la que Blue Beetle trata el ya comentado tema del legado. La historia pertenece en todo momento a Jaime Reyes, pero la sombra de Ted Kord está presente en todo el metraje y nos deja algunos easter eggs bastante prometedores para el futuro. La propia película justifica de alguna manera la elección de Reyes al ser un personaje cuyo espíritu puede encajar mejor con las nuevas generaciones, no solo por su historia sino por unos poderes que lo desligan más de la faceta clásica de justiciero herencia directa de Batman al que ya se referenciaba en los tráilers como «un fascista». Esta manera de reintroducir el concepto de legado -similar a lo que hizo Marvel Studios con Hank Pym y Scott Lang en las películas de Ant-Man– se siente natural y mejor planteado que lo que se nos ofreció con anterioridad en el «snyderverso».
Hasta aquí tenemos una cinta de orígenes bien realizada, con un apartado visual -salvo por los detalles comentados- coherente y lejos del estropicio de la anterior The Flash de Andy Muschietti. El reparto resulta complidor, destacando el «peterparkiano» héroe construido por Xolo Maridueña y -pese a lo estereotipado de la misma- la dupla maligna que conforman Susan Sarandon y Raoul Trujillo. El guion no tiene grandes giros, pero sabe equilibrar el drama y el humor con bastante inteligencia emocional. Hay también conceptos interesantes y llamativos, así como espacio suficiente para el misterio y para seguir explorando el universo de Blue Beetle en un futuro. Es un refrito de cosas que ya hemos visto, pero bien disimulado y con un ritmo que hace que sus dos horas de metraje no se nos antojen excesivas.
La banda sonora corre a cargo de Bobby Krlic -o lo que es lo mismo, The Haxan Cloak– que ya ha hecho lo propio con proyectos como Midsommar y Rompenieves. En el caso de Blue Beetle tenemos una banda sonora que cuenta con una fuerte presencia de sintetizadores y bajo la cual se oculta una icónica fanfarria superheroica que por desgracia no acaba de hacer acto de presencia durante el metraje. Esto se combina con una selección musical de influencia principalmente latina y en la que además encontramos versiones de clásicos como Será Que No Me Amas y Be My Baby junto a otras piezas más actuales. En conjunto, la sensación es algo desigual, ya que la selección no parece tener muchas veces un criterio y sentido ligado a la historia, y en algunos casos el volumen entorpece los diálogos, pero al mismo tiempo en muchos casos la banda sonora añade un punto de personalidad y de épica en los momentos oportunos.
En conjunto, caben tres valoraciones distintas para la presente Blue Beetle y ninguna de ellas es excluyente. En primer lugar, la cinta dirigida por Ángel Manuel Soto es una buena película de orígenes, pero con la carga que este esquema -del que la película no hace por escapar- conlleva a estas alturas. Por otro lado, estamos ante una película entretenida, fresca, con humor, drama y épica superheroica bien equilibrada, aunque puede haber algún apartado concreto que dependiendo del espectador resulte más o menos cargante. Finalmente, Blue Beetle es una nueva piedra fundacional de un universo superheroico y como tal intenta ir a la seguro, no plantea mal la batalla, pero tampoco asume grandes riesgos en el proceso y eso sumado a una promoción que ha pasado bastante desapercibida puede jugar en su contra de cara a llegar a su objetivo.
En resumen, el principal problema de Blue Beetle puede ser ganarse a un tipo de espectador a la búsqueda constante de nuevas y originales emociones. Es cierto, Blue Beetle no es una propuesta original en el sentido -como ya hemos mencionado en un par de ocasiones- que no nos ofrece casi nada que no hayamos visto con anterioridad. Pero sobre esto, habría que puntualizar que la originalidad no es un valor añadido en sí mismo y que el mismo no hace mejor o peor una historia. Puede que sea por el componente de ciencia ficción intrínsecamente asociado al género de superhéroes, o por su apelación constante a la épica, pero ni el «más» ni el «mayor» son conceptosq que se relacionan necesariamente con la calidad de una historia. Tampoco habría que olvidar que como aficionados al cómic somos plenamente conscientes que el género de superhéroes si por algo se caracteriza es por la repetición de esquemas y fórmulas, pero que esto no ha impedido que se sigan publicando -de tanto en tanto- buenas historias.

2023-07-25 21:47:54-07:00,'Oppenheimer' Is Christopher Nolan’s Most Incredible And Devastating Film To Date,There are not enough words to describe the quality Nolan has achieved in filmmaking. He is without question one of the best directors working today. This film,"*This review was published during the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.

There are not enough words to describe the quality Nolan has achieved in filmmaking. He is without question one of the best directors working today. This film (his 12th) is a culmination of a legendary run that started in 2005 with Batman Begins. Since then, Nolan has dropped a crowd-pleasing and heart-pumping film every two to three years. What a feat. Over that time, his pen and pacing have become their own. He’s cemented his style by bringing an air of sophistication to blockbuster movie-making. He borrows from his time-bending tricks making this real-world tales feel as science fiction as Interstellar or Inception. With Oppenheimer, Nolan’s sensibilities crescendo to fit perfectly with the talent he’s collected.
Speaking of the cast, Nolan has assembled one of the finest groups of performers in modern movie-making. In every scene, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., and Matt Damon bring the real explosive material. Each of these actors are leads in their own right, but they are the best supporting team Cillian Murphy could want and a director could ever ask for. It would be a shock if this trio didn’t receive an avalanche of nominations later this year.
Damon still has his fastball. He truly shines as a military general bent on helping the mission and sometimes blocking the science. It’s great to see Damon in a fleshed-out supporting role instead of being top-billed. Another high-profile casting showcases Downey Jr. in a ravenous role. It’s so good that I want to say almost nothing about it. Watch him and revel. Downey Jr.’s government official is full of the calm, cool Downey Jr. is known for but also features enough bombastic energy to power an arc reactor. Downey Jr.’s Lewis Strauss is a co-author of this tale. Often shouldering the spotlight in scenes that are not from Oppenheimer’s perspective.
Blunt plays the other most critical role. Her character in another film could have come off as thankless, but Kitty Oppenheimer is never far from our focus. Kitty is the punch that the film needs to keep going, and Blunt has more than one scene-stealing moment. This is an embarrassment of riches, but the performances would fall flat without Nolan’s central star, Murphy.
Cillian, Cillian, Cillian. You are a magical monster in this film. Impeccable, elegant, and essential in every scene. This film never shies away from the complicated man that J. Robert Oppenheimer was. His infidelity and communist ties also paint his egotistic rise to the top. The celebration of science gets time in the sun, but the horror of their creation is painfully apparent throughout. Murphy dances as a magnetic figure over years of education, collecting, and convincing that culminates in the history-altering production of the atomic bomb.

The rest of the cast is a Smash Bros Ultimate-like moment because “Everyone is Here.” Oppenheimer features a who’s who of pop culture and personal favorites, including Alden Ehrenreich (Solo), Scott Grimes (Band of Brothers), Martin Brenner (Stranger Things), James D’Arcy (Agent Carter), Michael Angarano (The Knick), Dane DeHaan (Amazing Spider-Man 2), Jason Clarke (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes), Benny Safdie (Uncut Gems), and Jack Quaid (The Boys) to name a few.
This film also features significant performances from Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Josh Hartnett, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Conti, Casey Affleck, and David Krumholtz. Each person listed does a lot of heavy lifting with their limited lines and less screen time. The emotional highs and lows of the movie lay the most on the shoulders of Pugh, Hartnett, and Conti. With so many award-worthy turns, this cast is as straight-up unfair as the 2017 Warriors. How do you even compete with this?
Oppenheimer is not possible without Ludwig Göransson’s incredible score. Best known for his work on The Mandalorian and the Black Panther films, Göransson’s talents burn brighter than ever in this movie. The first parts are surprisingly melodic in the educational setting, but the score swells in size during the latter acts. He’s almost attacking the ears of the audience in the heavier bits of the story. Silence is used to significant effect at more than one point in the film. As expected, the explosions rock the theatre, but Ludwig’s talent is most on display during the quieter moments. Many things in the film will impress the audience, but that chemical reaction begins and ends with his expansive score.
During the course of the movie, you may find yourself cheering on Oppenheimer and his colleagues as they create the bomb. This subject matter could have been handled offensively, but Nolan’s team must be commended because the film meets the destruction these men and women have wrought realistically, facing that guilt head-on.
Understandably, Oppenheimer is forever haunted by what he’s done. Growing in fame and seizing on their achievement for American scientists while never sidestepping the death they brought to hundreds of thousand. Nolan delivers a terrifying and necessary gut punch here. There are no heroes here; being at war is often the reason for ambitious men to keep going, but as the film progresses, it’s clear that the fruits of their labor are a force that these scientists will never control. That power is for the politicians.

Speaking of power, the marketing machine has been mighty, creating a unique moment in movie history. Yes, Barbenheimer is cool as a joke online, but let it be known that no amount of joy we receive from our Barbie dream world will pull you out of the mess Oppenheimer will leave you in. Go to the movies, indeed, but I plead with you that seeing Oppenheimer and Barbie back to back is a wicked whiplash of a double feature that will bum you out, bub.
Movies are so damn back. Nolan shows his mastery of time, pacing, and camera yet again. His aversion to CGI has always led to clever set pieces, but in Oppenheimer, he shifts gears expertly to make three different films fit into the runtime of one. Astonishingly, Nolan’s skills keep getting better with time. Oppenheimer is the best-case scenario for historic filmmaking, blockbuster movies, and the medium. This is hands down the best picture of 2023.
Rating: 10/10
Oppenheimer is now playing in theatres everywhere.

Crítica: Blue Beetle

Cuando le escribimos para felicitarlo por su éxito ante una película de la magnitud de Blue Beetle respondió con la misma amabilidad y sencillez que hace años cuando buscaba abrirse camino con La granja, esta charla fue un cálido encuentro que tenemos el gusto de compartir con nuestros lectores.

Tú película me conmovió. Creo que cualquier persona con sangre latina corriendo por sus venas va a ver esta película de superhéroes y va a sentir algo muy profundo.

Ángel Manuel Soto: ¡Qué lindo eso! ¡Me alegra escucharlo! ¡Gracias!

Los que amamos la imagen en movimiento y nos entregamos, ya sea viendo o haciendo, hemos sido picados por un bicho: El bicho del cine. ¿Cuándo te picó a ti ese bicho?

(Entre risas) Ese bicho me picó, yo creo que la primera vez que fui al cine. Fui a ver Indiana Jones: La última cruzada. Es la primera memoria que tengo del cine, me daba curiosidad saber cómo se hizo todo. La disfruté como espectador y despertó mi curiosidad, especialmente en una escena donde un muchacho está caminando con un turbante, lo decapitan y sale la cabeza rodando. El público exclamó ¡Ahhh! y lo primero que le pregunté a mi papá fue si era un rollo de papel higiénico lo que usaron para hacer la cabeza. Entonces ahí mi papá dijo: “¿No te asusta?” Ahí fue.

Cuando las nuevas generaciones vean a Blue Beetle en la pantalla, seguramente van a querer saber más sobre tus películas anteriores. Cuéntanos sobre tus primeros proyectos.

Ángel Manuel Soto: Desarrollé esta pasión por el cine en la escuela. Teníamos un grupito y algunos profesores nos dejaban entregar la tesis del final del año como películas. Hicimos varias en la escuela y después, cuando crecí, pues no sé. Se dio la oportunidad, porque no estudié cine, pero empecé a coger cosas por mi propia cuenta, empecé a leer un montón. En esa lectura, en todo ese trabajo de documentación conseguí trabajo en producción de televisión y ahí fue cuando empecé a subir, hasta que me fui por mi cuenta a dirigir un cortometraje y a hacer trabajos comerciales.

Hice un cortometraje que se llama La carta que llamó la atención, me permitió aprender mucho más y viajar por el mundo, asistir a festivales. Después de trabajar en mi escritura, me dan un premio de $250,000 dólares para hacer La granja. Me toma como unos 5 años terminarla porque no tenía suficiente dinero, hasta que llegan de nuevo los festivales. Mientras estoy participando en los festivales estoy experimentando y ahí me cae en 2017 la oportunidad para leer ese guion que escribió Barry Jenkins para Charm City Kings, la cual estrena en 2020 y gana un premio en Sundance. Después de eso, la pandemia apaga al mundo entero.

Exactamente. Ahora quiero hacer la conexión entre Barry Jenkins y Blue Beetle, ¿Cómo llegas a este proyecto?

Ángel Manuel Soto: Estuve varios años buscando una película para dirigir después de La granja, en el 2017 me llamaron para ofrecerme un guion. Cuando lo leí, me di cuenta que era de Barry Jenkins. Aunque era sobre estos motociclistas de Baltimore, hablaba mucho de cómo yo me crie, de mi vida en Puerto Rico, ahí fue cuando empezamos. Le dije que me interesaba, les gustó las ideas que propuse, estuvimos varios años trabajando en esa película hasta que debutó y cuando se estrenó en Sundance, ganó. Al rato después que se cierra el mundo por la pandemia, recibimos la llamada de DC, proponiéndome dirigir una película.

Inicialmente quería hacer el origen de Bane, ya que siempre me ha interesado esa historia, pero ellos tenían otros planes con el personaje. Fue ahí cuando me dijeron “mira, está Blue Beetle”. Pasó un tiempo, al principio yo tenía dudas. No sabía cuáles eran las intenciones del estudio con un personaje latino, no confiaba. Hasta que me dicen que el guionista era mexicano, de Querétaro. Me dijeron “léelo y si no quieres, pues nada, buscamos otra cosa”. Cuando la leí fue que me enamoré, porque las cosas estaban escritas de una manera auténtica y real.

Muy cercanas…

Ajá, ¡exacto! Se notaba que salía de alguien que las había experimentado, no de alguien que se las había imaginado. Ahí fue cuando dije “Esto me gusta y podemos trabajar en algo muy especial”.

Originalmente Blue Beetle ni siquiera pertenecía a DC, sino a Charlton Comics, otra editorial que DC absorbió. Además, Blue Beetle no era latino, eso hace parte de una actualización reciente. Pero hay una conexión con uno de los superhéroes latinos más importantes que hemos tenido y que tiene que ver con bichos. ¿Cómo llegaste a establecer esa conexión?

Yo creo que una de las maneras en la que el escritor y yo nos conectamos – porque yo soy de Puerto Rico y él es de Querétaro – Ambos somos contemporáneos, pero estábamos bien alejados y nos estábamos conociendo, fue por una pregunta: ¿Cuál fue tu primer superhéroe? Nosotros dijimos a la vez ¡El Chapulín Colorado! ¿Sabes? El Chapulín Colorado fue el primer superhéroe que yo recuerdo haber visto en pantalla. En esta película, de hecho, se plantean unos elementos históricos de contexto para Hollywood con respecto a este superhéroe. No solamente el Chapulín es latino, sino que todo el trasfondo de Blue Beetle ahora también es latino. Su familia completa está envuelta en la historia y el reparto principal es completamente latino, a excepción de Susan Sarandon. Nosotros dijimos “hay que rendir homenaje y honor a los que vinieron antes que nosotros” y finalmente, conseguimos la participación del Chapulín en la película.

Lograste la colaboración de las personas detrás de este superhéroe… ¿Cómo pasó eso?

Pues mira, esa búsqueda comenzó desde que estaba en el guion, pero fue hace más de dos años. Todo este tiempo estábamos tratando de “entrarle”. Se llega a un lado, se llega al otro y no fue sino hasta que logramos conocer al hijo de Roberto Gómez Bolaños y le explicamos lo que queríamos hacer, que nuestra intención era rendir homenaje al primer superhéroe latino para nosotros. A él le gustó la idea y accedió. Hasta hizo el “¡No contaban con mi astucia!”. En la película lo hizo el hijo de Bolaños.

Déjame decirte que de todas las escenas postcréditos que he visto, esta ha sido la única que me ha hecho derramar lágrimas

¿De veras?

Sí, sí, sí. Yo no podía creer que estaba viendo lo que estaba viendo en la pantalla.

¿De veras? ¡Ay! ¡Qué bueno! ¿Te puedo preguntar algo? ¿Qué te causó esas emociones?

Mira, es algo que ahora como periodista de ROLLING STONE empecé a sentir. Nosotros en Colombia, en Latinoamérica, sentimos ese universo de los superhéroes y de las películas norteamericanas como algo muy lejano, tremendamente lejano, como un universo de sueños. Pero poder ver al Chapulín, que es tan cercano a nosotros, mucho más “real” entre comillas, fue como vernos a nosotros en la pantalla, por fin perteneciendo a este universo. ¡Dios mío!

¡Wow! ¡Qué buen Breakdown! Nosotros lo hicimos con la intención de hacer un homenaje y quedó tan linda la pieza que dijimos: “¡Vamos a ponerla al final de la película para que se inmortalice!”.

Es como cuando uno es niño. Termina la película y corre a tocar la pantalla para ver si la puede atravesar.

¡Exacto! Saber que algo que hicimos, que queríamos venerar e inmortalizar se traduce en el espectador, como tú lo acabas de interpretar, con esa definición que tú acabas de articular tan bonita, fue exactamente la intención que nos animó a hacer esta película lo más auténtica posible. Con nosotros, los latinos, para que por fin podamos decir: “¡Esta es nuestra!”

Tuve la oportunidad de entrevistar a Xolo Maridueña antes de la huelga de actores. Me parece que es un joven muy sensible, muy inteligente y con los pies sobre la tierra. ¿Cómo llegó a Blue Beetle?

Pues mira, casualmente en Sundance, yo conocí a un muchacho joven que creo que solamente había acabado de terminar la primera temporada de Cobra Kai. Cuando lo conozco, veo a una persona con las mismas descripciones que tú acabas de darme. Muy maduro para su edad también. Esto fue hace algunos años. Xolo tiene su personalidad característica de su edad, pero tiene unas cualidades que son muy avanzadas y muy maduras. Rápidamente entendí que tenía que ver mucho con su mamá y su familia, que siempre están con él.

Pasaron varios años y me presentaron el proyecto de Blue Beetle. Cuando me preguntan quién debe de ser esa persona para interpretarlo, pues yo dije “tiene que ser Xolo Maridueña”, precisamente porque todas las cualidades que tiene como persona, las tiene también el personaje de Jaime Reyes. Era como Xolo afuera y Jaime aquí adentro. Son la misma persona, prácticamente. Adicional a eso, físicamente se parece al Jaime Reyes de los cómics, casi como un copy/paste. La cereza en el pastel está en que el chamaco también tiene experiencia en artes marciales. O sea, yo dije: “¡Este tipo tiene que ser!”

Otra de las fuerzas de Blue Beetle la encontré en la banda sonora. Yo no podía creer que en una película de superhéroes de DC estuviera escuchando a Los Panchos o a Soda Stereo. Me pareció algo estremecedor escuchar a Cypress Hill en la escena de batalla ¿Tú escogiste las canciones?

Sí. Cuando me presentaron el proyecto y antes de sentarme a hacer todo, me propuse hacer un playlist que incluyera todas las canciones que estaban en los diferentes celulares de los familiares. ¿Qué tiene la hermana? ¿Qué tiene Jaime? ¿Qué tiene Alberto? ¿Qué tiene Nana? ¿Qué tiene la mamá? ¿Qué tiene el tío Rudy? hasta ¿Qué tiene Bruna?. Empecé un proceso de cortar, cortar y cortar, hasta que encontramos un número de canciones que para mí representaban todas esas cosas que llevo escuchando desde pequeño y todas las cosas que Gareth, el escritor, había escuchado toda su vida. Y es algo como “¡Ah! Luis Miguel, ¡Ah! los Saicos ¿Los has escuchado? La primera banda de punk latina, qué sé yo. Después siguió la cosa así… Soda Stereo. A mí me recordaba el final de una película de Walter Hill y yo quería darle un “final Walter Hill” a la película, pero con música latina.

Sí, lo lograste.

Ángel Manuel Soto: Entonces es así. Celebrar a los latinos. Vamos a escuchar a Los Panchos, a Vicente Fernández, a Ivy Queen, a Residente, a personas como Mötley Crüe, a Selena. Yo quería recrear todas las cosas que nosotros escuchamos y disfrutamos, porque el latino no es un monolito. El latino tiene tanto cultura popular como cultura nacional.

El metal fue también maravilloso. “Kickstart My Heart”

Ángel Manuel Soto: Sí. Esa es mi canción favorita de metal.

Aquí está la crema y nata de actores mexicanos. George López, Elpidia Carrillo, a quien hace rato no la tenía en mi radar, pero en los ochenta crecimos con ella. Damián Alcázar ¿Cómo fue trabajar con ellos?

Fue un sueño hecho realidad. Una de las cosas que definitivamente quería hacer, era que el casting fuera auténticamente latino, que por primera vez fuera de verdad, no solamente algo actuado, porque hasta cierto punto son vividas experiencias de los mismos personajes que estamos interpretando en la película. Entonces propuse a personas ante las que yo decía “This is no negotiable”. Quería trabajar con Damián Alcázar y con Adriana Barraza. Eso para mí era necesario. Son los primerísimos actores de México, lo que para mí considero lo máximo. Yo decía “quiero tenerlos en la primera película de superhéroes, lo mejor de México”. George López, que fue el primer entertainer latino en romper barreras en los Estados Unidos. Elpidia Carrillo que, como bien dices, en los ochenta era Ripley latina. Quería tenerla y darle pa’ atrás a los que no permitieron tenerla como protagonista en ese momento porque era latina. Yo quería rendir tributo, homenaje, amor y cariño a todas estas personas que en verdad nos han influenciado tanto en el cine y en las artes. Tenerlos a ellos también como héroes, porque han sido héroes para nosotros.

No sé si esto me lo puedas revelar o contar. El universo DC en el cine está en reestructuración y yo quisiera saber sobre el futuro de Blue Beetle ¿Se ha hablado al respecto?

Nosotros tenemos la dicha de tener una película que le habla a un grupo demográfico que ha sido bastante abandonado en Hollywood y que también ha sido bastante estereotipado y al que se le ha hecho mucho daño.

Nosotros quisimos hacer esta película con mucho amor y cariño. Quisimos meterle todas las ganas. Quisimos hacer esta primera película, que representa un cambio a nivel de Hollywood, donde estamos estereotipados como los villanos, o no tenemos suficientes personas que estén liderando papeles principales. Tener esta oportunidad única significó muchísimo y en el momento que empezamos a hacerla, pues, yo creo que se entendió al interior de las personas que estamos dentro de DC y los que trabajamos en el proyecto, sobre la importancia que esto tiene en el contexto cultural.

A la vez, había varios proyectos trabajando, pero no sabíamos que venía un cambio de régimen. Varias películas de DC recibieron el hacha o quedaron en desarrollo. En esa primera transición de liderazgo, logramos sobrevivir a que nos hayan picoteado al principio, y no fue sino hasta después que terminamos de hacer la película que ocurren otras cosas.

Estuvimos contra reloj, contra tres cambios de regímenes, donde personas como tú o personas que han visto la película han podido conectar, se han sentido identificadas. Creo que hemos hecho algo que muchos de los fans consideran que funciona con la lealtad del personaje para poder introducirlo al mundo.

Yo pienso que toda esta odisea, todo este sacrificio, que es tan representativo del latino en su diario vivir, le rinde tributo al legado de nuestros ancestros. Que al final del día, James Gunn pueda decir que Blue Beetle es el primer superhéroe de su nuevo universo… pues una vez eso sale a la luz, todo cambió. Todo se sintió tan orgánico y tan bonito, porque muchas veces ese miedo que tuvimos, que eso pasara ahora y ver que Jaime Reyes y de Xolo como Jaime tenga un futuro largo dentro de DC y que haya salido de la bocadel mismo James Gunn, pues fue algo bien bonito.

Ya que estamos revelando secretos, ¿es verdad que tu próximo proyecto está relacionado con unos robots muy famosos?

Sí, mi hermano. Tenemos el proyecto de hacer una nueva película de los Transformers. El guion ya está listo, solo falta su aprobación.

,"‘Es el primer acto de una saga gigante’, promete Ángel Manuel Soto, director de ‘Blue Beetle’, la película de DC con el primer superhéroe latino",¿Qué hace tan especial al reciente estreno basado en el comic del Escarabajo Azul? Su director tiene más de una respuesta.,"Blue Beetle es la última apuesta de Warner Bros. Discovery para levantar su moral después de que varias de sus películas, basadas en personajes del universo DC Comics, fracasaron este año en la taquilla, mientras el estudio experimenta un importante cambio de régimen creativo.

Se espera que el debut nacional, en Estados Unidos, de la cinta sobre el primer superhéroe latino de DC represente entre $ 22 millones y $ 32 millones de dólares en ingresos.

“Es una película de superhéroes genuinamente refrescante y completamente única que ofrece una experiencia como no hay otra en este género”, aseguró con mucha firmeza Peter Safran, CEO y copresidente de DC Studios, en una conferencia que tuvo lugar en México la semana pasada, antes del estreno del filme. La ubicación de esa rueda de prensa simboliza el corazón de este cómic, pues Blue Beetle es un superhéroe de ascendencia mexicana cuya familia está representada justamente por actores procedentes del país azteca.

Publicidad

Esa fuerza de la “latinidad” y las raíces familiares son los superpoderes de este título, que le han hecho ganarse los dos pulgares arriba del público en su primer fin de semana. Aunque la crítica le confiere, por lo pronto, una calificación de entre 61 y 77 puntos (Metacritic y Rotten Tomatoes, respectivamente) sobre 100, la audiencia la da un valor mayor, de 92.

¿Qué la hace tan especial? Su director, Ángel Manuel Soto, tiene más de una respuesta.

(Reseña) Ya vimos ‘Blue Beetle’, la gran presentación del superhéroe latino llena de amor familiar

El poder latino de Blue Beetle es su principal encanto

Soto, de nacionalidad puertorriqueña, reconoce que la identidad mexicana y lo latino son los grandes sellos de este título de superhéroes. “Yo me crie con TV y cine mexicano, y la música también. Aunque nos separan las millas de distancia, algo que encontramos el escritor (el guionista mexicano Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer) y yo es que ambos nos criamos viendo al Chapulín Colorado (...). Por eso quisimos rendirle un homenaje con un cameo”.

Otra huella de la fuerza latina es la importancia de la familia: “Una de las cosas que más me interesaron de Blue Beetle fue el énfasis a la familia: yo no estaría donde estoy si no fuera por los que estuvieron conmigo y los que estuvieron antes de mí. Ellos son héroes sin superpoderes”.

La banda sonora de Blue Beetle tiene alta conexión con Latinoamérica

“Hice una playlist antes de hacer la película pensando: ‘Si yo cogiera los celulares de toda la familia Reyes, ¿qué estarían escuchando?’. Era imposible no tener esa canción de Alberto Cortez, Gracias a la vida, que me recuerda a mi papá, que no está muerto todavía. Desde más atrás, me quise ir con canciones de boleros, de salsa, de música regional, cumbia... Quería cerrar con ese feeling John Hughes, ochentero, y ahí va Soda Stereo (...). Quería enseñar todo lo que podemos hacer como latino en la música. Quería explorar y presentar artistas nuevos, como Rainao. Presentar todos los colores que tenemos que trascienden el cliché”.

Blue Beetle contiene marcadas referencias del anime japonés

Para los mega- y ultrageeks seguidores del universo de DC Comics no es una novedad que el anime, o la animación japonesa, haya sido una gran influencia para la estética del personaje de Blue Beetle. En la mencionada conferencia de prensa en México, Soto reveló que su mayor inspiración para este título fue la película anime Akira (1988).

“El worldbuilding (construcción de mundos) y la intensidad de Akira (fueron influencia). Siempre ha sido una película, que la vi en high school, que me impactó grandemente. Ese mundo de Neo Tokyo y la relación con Ted Suo (el villano) me pareció muy visceral”, explicó el cineasta. “Cuando empecé Blue Beetle, siempre quise partir de ese mundo, ese neorrealismo que ocurre en las ciudades ficticias de Neo Tokio para aplicarlo a Palmera City (ciudad ficticia en el universo de DC)”.

Como un buen cineasta, Soto investigó todas las creaciones relacionadas con el personaje de Blue Beetle (series de televisión, historieta, videojuegos) para revisar las mejores escenas de cada una y tomar lo que mejor se ajustaba al guion escrito por Dunnet-Alcocer.

“Había tantas cosas particulares que nos parecían superinteresantes de la personalidad de Jaime Reyes (el adolescente detrás del disfraz de Blue Beetle)”. Lo más impactante, o bizarro, que descubrieron fue que “todo lo que hacía a Blue Beetle interesante y relatable (cercano) existía ya en Xolo y que casualmente se parece físicamente al mismo dibujo de Jaime Reyes. Sus características y su personalidad, y su relación con su familia, fue como que lo hubieran escrito con él en mente”.

Blue Beetle nos hace sentir que todos podemos ser superhéroes

Angel Manuel Soto considera seriamente que gran parte del encanto del filme realmente recae en su mensaje: no necesitamos superpoderes para ser héroes.

“Pienso que eso es algo bien bonito. Le puede hablar a diferentes personas de diferentes maneras. No necesito un escarabajo para ser superhéroe y no necesito algo de afuera para que me salve; puedo hacerlo yo. Es un mensaje muy bonito y anticolonialista que es algo que me encanta hacer: personas que nunca se han visto como superhéroes, ni bajo una luz positiva, especialmente en películas de Hollywood, finalmente se han podido ver de esta manera”.

El guion de Blue Beetle destila mucho humor también

“Dentro de la expresión colectiva, no solo en Puerto Rico, sino en Latinoamérica, tenemos esa costumbre de ‘reír para no llorar’. En el personaje de George López, Tío Rudy, es una máscara para un complejo que él tiene, y con ese personaje queremos explorar ese aspecto”, detalle Soto.

Esos momentos que mezclan lo gracioso con lo emotivo son parte de la fortaleza del escritor Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, alaba Soto. También fue posible gracias a la libertad de que los personajes “encontraran comodidad en la comedia”.

Blue Beetle es la primera entrega de una saga prometedora

El mayor reto de la producción de la película, recuerda Soto, fue maximizar el tiempo y el presupuesto para poder contar todo lo que se habían propuesto, a la vez que pudieron mantener otras tramas para poder producir nuevas películas. “Su historia no termina con esta: vienen más. Este es el primer acto de una saga gigante”, prometió el director ante los aplausos de los periodistas que asistieron a la conferencia.

¿Qué se viene para Ángel Manuel Soto, director de Blue Beetle?

Con mucha positividad, Soto asegura que tiene varios proyectos en la mesa, aunque de momento están en pausa por la huelga de actores y guionistas. Pero no es algo que lamenta. “Lo más importante es apoyar a nuestros actores, nuestros escritores. Sin ellos no se pueden hacer películas. Hay que demostrar que tienen nuestro apoyo, que son importantes. Las luchas no son en vano. Espero que se solucione pronto para poder trabajar. Hasta que no haya un trato justo, estaremos con ellos en la lucha”. (E)

,Recensie Blue Beetle,Redt deze nieuwe superheld het DC-universum?,"Aram Isaac



Interesse om recensies over films en series te schrijven? Wij zijn op zoek naar redacteuren

Angel Manuel Soto |Garreth Dunnet-Alcocer |Xolo Maridueña (Jaime Reyes), Bruna Marquezine (Jenny Kord), Susan Sarandon (Victoria Kord), Becky G (Khaji-Da), Raoul Max Trujillo (Carapax), George Lopez (Rudy Reyes), e.a. |127 minuten |2023De term superhelden-moeheid gaat veel rond als het gaat om nieuwe filmreleases binnen dit genre. De successen van Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 en de nieuwe Spider-Verse bewijzen echter het tegendeel. De tegenvallende resultaten lijken vooral gebonden te zijn aan de matige kwaliteit van de films, niet aan het genre.Blue Beetle vertoont helaas precies dezelfde gebreken als alle andere fiasco's deze zomer. Afgezien van de neonkleurige visuele stijl is er weinig interessants aan dit oorsprongsverhaal, dat een uitgekauwde formule gebruikt als compensatie voor een degelijk uitgewerkt verhaal.Jaime is na zijn afstuderen net teruggekeerd in Palmera City, een fictieve stad in Texas. Eenmaal thuis ontdekt hij dat zijn ouders diep in de schulden zitten. Hij en zijn zus nemen een bijbaantje bij een rijke club, waar hij Jenny Kord, de nicht van de wapenmagnaat Victoria Kord, ontmoet. Via haar krijgt hij een buitenaards gadget in de vorm van een scarabee. Die gadget blijkt een soort AI/superpak te zijn, en bindt zich aan Jaime. Daardoor wordt hij de superheld Blue Beetle.Het pak en de krachten van de jonge 'held' doen in deze film sterk denken aan die van Iron Man gecombineerd met Green Lantern. Of dat echt zo is, is lastig te zeggen, omdat nooit aangegeven wordt waar Blue Beetle nou echt toe in staat is. Het pak (Khaji-Da) zegt dat Jaime alle wapens kan 'maken' waar hij aan denkt, maar wat dat precies inhoudt is niet duidelijk.Er zijn te weinig scènes waar Jaime echt experimenteert met zijn nieuw vergaarde superkrachten. Dergelijke scènes waarin de held zijn of haar limieten test zijn essentieel voor een oorsprongsverhaal, omdat ze de kijker informeren waar de sterkte- en zwaktepunten van de held liggen. In plaats daarvan wordt Jaime chaotisch heen en weer gestuurd, tot hij in de climax toevalligerwijs in één klap alles onder controle heeft.Erger nog, in het grootste deel van de film is de slechterik simpelweg afwezig. En als die wel aanwezig is, blijft het bij een eentonige motivatie van geld en macht. De secundaire slechterik, die niet eens als een verrassing in het verhaal wordt gebracht, is ook de standaard tegenpool van de goeierik.De actiescènes zijn ook nog eens buitengewoon ondermaats. Hoewel er pogingen worden gedaan om wat creatiefs te doen met de camera, zien de visuele effecten er zodanig slecht uit dat het onmogelijk is om iets serieus te nemen. De choreografie van de actie is evenmin aantrekkelijk, wat opmerkelijk is aangezien Xolo Maridueña zijn vechttalenten meer dan bewezen heeft in Cobra Kai.Is er dan iets in Blue Beetle wat de film de moeite maakt om te kijken, of ook maar iets van hoop geeft voor het DC-universum? Het enige dat positief opvalt in deze misser is Jaimes familie. Hoewel dergelijke warme dynamieken in talloze andere films en series voorkomen (zoals Ms. Marvel en Encanto), brengt het een klein beetje vermaak in een twee uur durend gedrocht van een superheldenfilm.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbG10b3RhYWwubmwvcmVjZW5zaWUvMTg2ODXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-08-22 12:40:52+00:00,Blue Beetle vs. Iron Man: Who Is More Powerful & Would Win in a Fight?,The battle between Blue Beetle vs. Iron Man would be epic. Here is a comparison of their power level and who would win in a fight.,"Blue Beetle vs. Iron Man is an intriguing superhero matchup fans dream of seeing one day. (As much as it resembles Iron Man, the villain in the Blue Beetle movie isn’t Tony Stark, but Carapax.) If that DC–Marvel heroes clash happened one day, who would win? And who’s more powerful, the live-action version of Blue Beetle or Iron Man? Here’s what we have to say about that.

Is Blue Beetle more powerful than Iron Man?

Blue Beetle looks to have an edge over Iron Man thanks to the powerful alien technology he possesses.

You can make a case for both superheroes being more powerful than the other, and no one could say the contrary. However, Blue Beetle looked slightly above Marvel Cinematic Universe‘s Tony Stark. Khaji-Da scarab grants Jaime Reyes a high-tech suit with energy-based abilities, flight, enhanced strength, durability, and potentially any weapon Jaime can imagine. The scarab can also adapt and evolve on the battlefield, making Blue Beetle a formidable opponent.

In turn, Iron Man relies on his suits equipped with advanced technology, ranging from energy weapons to flight capabilities to an array of sensors and gadgets. The armors are highly customizable and can be tailored to specific situations, giving him versatility in battles.

Would Blue Beetle win against Iron Man in a fight?

Blue Beetle would defeat Iron Man in a fight.

If we were to pit their powers against each other, the battle would likely be intense and potentially close. Iron Man’s vast array of advanced weaponry could give him an advantage in firepower and adaptability. Still, Blue Beetle’s scarab-derived abilities might provide him with unique powers that Iron Man’s technology can’t counter easily, especially not without some time to prepare for the battle.

Tony Stark’s broader experience might be pivotal in the clash, but the odds still slightly favor Jaime Reyes. On paper, there is no doubt that Blue Beetle could win against Iron Man in a fight.

8/15/2023 10:59,Ángel Manuel Soto sobre ‘Blue Beetle’: “Es importante contar nuestras historias sin avergonzarnos de nuestras raíces”,"El nuevo universo de DC tiene a su primer integrante en Jaime Reyes, un héroe no tan popular como otros dentro de su amplia oferta de creaciones pero que, ahora, es el primer guiño a los grandes planes que James Gunn tiene.

Gracias a Blue Beetle, DC aspira finalmente a crear historias que conecten mejor con la audiencia y este filme no será la excepción, especialmente con la comunidad latina. Crónica Escenario estuvo presente en conferencia de prensa con el realizador puertorriqueño de este filme Ángel Manuel Soto, que habló a detalle de lo que podemos esperar de este próximo estreno que promete ser toda una aventura familiar.

La conferencia inició con una breve presentación sorpresa por parte del copresidente y director ejecutivo de DC Studios, Peter Safran. “Gracias a todos por venir. Estoy muy emocionado de estar aquí para introducir al extraordinario director de esta fresca y única cinta de superhéroes. Blue Beetle ofrece una experiencia como pocas en este género a través de una aventura épica con un mundo lleno de mucho humor, corazón y una emotiva historia coming of age que se siente bastante apegada a la vida real”, mencionó.

“La cinta cuenta la historia de un tipo común, Jaime Reyes, interpretado por el increíble Xolo Maridueña, que vive su vida diaria con los sueños, aspiraciones, miedos y dudas que todos nosotros tenemos. Cuando fuerzas extraordinarias convergen en su ciudad ordinaria, Jaime se dará cuenta que alguien tendrá que pelear por ella y qué mejor que él para hacerlo. James Gunn y yo amamos el filme y esperamos compartirlo con toda la audiencia mexicana este 17 de agosto. Mientras, me emociona que conozcan a este entusiasta y talentoso cineasta que le dio vida a este personaje cuadro a cuadro, Ángel Manuel Soto”, complementó Safran.

Ya en el templete, Soto inició hablando del reto que fue encontrar una buena historia para este héroe latino. “Junto a mi guionista traté de encontrar los mejores puntos de la historia de Blue Beetle, al menos del arco de Jaime, desde su primera aparición en el 2006 pasando por los videojuegos de Injustice, los cómics de New 52 y otros. Había muchos que parecían tan particulares en la personalidad de él que tratamos de capturar y lo logramos también gracias a Xolo Maridueña. Nos dimos cuenta que con él podíamos detonar esas cosas que lo hacían tan entrañable y ver que, además, se parece físicamente al dibujo y en su manera de ser en la vida real”.

Construir un universo nuevo no es tan sencillo como aparenta. Por ello, Ángel Manuel explicó las influencias y retos para levantar este proyecto y darle su propia esencia latina. “A nivel creativo, quisimos darle un inicio honesto a esta saga, maximizamos lo que teníamos para crear un producto de calidad, el traje está hecho por Mayes C. Rubeo que además es una mexicana muy talentosa que vino con grandes ideas al proyecto. Además, quise darle a Blue Beetle la construcción del universo e intensidad de Akira, que fue una cinta que, desde que la vi en preparatoria, me impactó mucho. Tomé ese neorrealismo como referencia para crear todo lo relacionado a Palmera City. Todo esto contribuyó bastante para esta entrega”.

“Quisimos aprovechar lo más posible el presupuesto y los tiempos para contar todo lo que queríamos. Además tuvimos que descartar algunas cosas para poder hablar de ellas en las próximas cintas que queremos hacer de este personaje pues su historia no termina aquí. Este es el primer acto de una saga más grande y todo el entusiasmo que está rodeando a la cinta nos motiva a ello ”, adelantó el oriundo de San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Dentro de Blue Beetle hay guiños destacados a la cultura mexicana, un factor con el que Soto creció rodeado. “Me crié con la televisión y la música de este país y si bien nos separan millas, mi guionista y yo encontramos eslabones fuertes con México. Ambos vimos el Chapulín Colorado, que fue nuestro primer superhéroe latino que cruzó fronteras. También están las novelas, de las cuales intenté escapar sin éxito, especialmente María la del Barrio que siempre veía mi abuela. Quisimos rendirle homenaje a toda esa nostalgia de nuestra crianza explotando el amor por la familia. Estos sonidos, colores y sabores de la película tratan de reflejar lo que somos y son muy similares”, apuntó.

Asimismo, Ángel Manuel hizo señaló la importancia de tener un personaje como Jaime Reyes en el panorama de los superhéroes. “ Me parecía importante contar nuestras historias como las queremos contar, sin esconder ni avergonzarnos de nuestras raíces . En mi caso, dar vida a Blue Beetle es una forma de honrar a nuestros ancestros. Sé que la latinidad no es monolito y hay cosas bien diferentes que la componen, pero tener la oportunidad de enseñar aunque sea un poco de lo que somos, lo que nos hace fuertes, para que resuene en otros era importante. No puedo esconder quien soy y no voy a permitir que lo intenten hacer más pues estoy cansado de ello. Suena medio subversiva la cosa pero solamente quise mostrar que así somos y existimos ”.

No cabe duda que uno de los bastiones latinos es justamente la familia. En Blue Beetle, Soto reúne a un cast impresionante con nombres como Damián Alcázar, la nominada al Oscar, Adriana Barraza; el comediante George López o Elpidia Carrillo. “Una de las cosas que más me interesó del relato de Jaime es que le quisimos dar ese justo peso a ellos. Yo no estaría donde estuviera si no fuese por todos los que estuvieron antes andando este camino. El súper poder que ellos aportan es un amor incondicional”, reflexionó.

Conformar este grupo estelar de latinos, fue una labor de ensueño. “Quería trabajar con personas que he admirado toda mi vida. Ese sueño de poder trabajar con actores de calibre que respetaba tanto fue admirable . Siempre estuve peleando por que fueran ellos y que tuvieran raíces mexicanas. No quería a nadie de Los Ángeles o así, si no que fueran de aquí porque existen más talentos fuera de los Estados Unidos. Respetaron mi decisión y aunque Belissa y Xolo son la primera generación nacida fuera del país, se siente mucha autenticidad e identificación en ellos. Crearon una química muy especial entre todos”, afirmó emocionado el puertorriqueño.

Otro punto particular es el soundtrack de la película que tiene todo tipo de ritmos. “Le damos la vuelta a toda Latinoamérica. Hice un playlist antes de filmar pensando en que si tomara los celulares de la familia Reyes, que sería lo que estarían escuchando. Entonces, quedó la idea de mostrar todo lo que podemos hacer como latinos en ese aspecto a través de una gran variedad de canciones y ritmos. Se escucha Gracias a la Vida, que me recuerda mucho a mi papá y es casi un mantra en casa, después pasamos a bolero, mariachi, salsa, regional, cumbia y cerramos con un feeling a lo John Hughes muy ochentoso con Soda Stereo, que es mi tema favorito para karaoke”, declaró Soto.

Algo que ha prevalecido en las cintas de superhéroes es el humor y Blue Beetle no es la excepción. “ La buena comedia solo pasa y dentro de la experiencia colectiva en Latinoamérica tenemos la costumbre de reír para no llorar . A veces puede ser una máscara para ocultar ciertas cosas. Gareth Dunnet Alcocer, el escritor, tiene unas líneas absurdas que encuentran el punch line mezclando lo emotivo con lo gracioso. Si a eso le sumas el darle libertad a tus actores para que encontraran la comodidad en la comedia sin forzarla, aunque se toquen temas serios, profundos o momentos traumáticos, es algo que termina por conectar de buena forma y fluyó con naturaleza”.

“Me parece que el mensaje varía y le habla de diferente manera a cada persona que la ve. En lo personal, me quedo con la idea de que no necesito un escarabajo para ser un héroe, no tengo que buscar al de afuera para que me salve pues puedo hacerlo por mi cuenta . Ése resuena en mí, pues todos podemos ser Blue Beetle. Espero que el mensaje se riegue por todo el mundo, pues todos podemos sentirnos superhéroes cobijados por el amor y la fuerza de la familia. Y si no se tiene, comprender que hay una posibilidad de tener un futuro mejor”, aseveró Ángel Manuel.

Finalmente, Soto no dejó pasar la oportunidad para hablar de la trascendencia de la huelga que se vive actualmente en Hollywood y cómo afecta los planes a futuro de la industria. “ Creo que por el momento, antes de pensar en lo que viene, es apoyar a nuestros escritores y actores en su lucha pues sin ellos no se pueden hacer películas . Hay que demostrar que este tipo de pugnas no son en vano. Esperamos que se solucione todo pronto para que podamos hacer lo que amamos hacer y poder pagar las deudas. Pero hasta no tener un trato justo, estaremos metidos en esta contienda”, concluyó.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyb25pY2EuY29tLm14L2VzY2VuYXJpby9hbmdlbC1tYW51ZWwtc290by1zb2JyZS1ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1pbXBvcnRhbnRlLWNvbnRhci1oaXN0b3JpYXMtYXZlcmdvbnphcm5vcy1yYWljZXMuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jcm9uaWNhLmNvbS5teC9hbXAvZXNjZW5hcmlvL2FuZ2VsLW1hbnVlbC1zb3RvLXNvYnJlLWJsdWUtYmVldGxlLWltcG9ydGFudGUtY29udGFyLWhpc3Rvcmlhcy1hdmVyZ29uemFybm9zLXJhaWNlcy5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

Tandis qu’il cherche sa place dans le monde, le (...)","Résumé : Fraîchement diplômé de l’université, Jaime Reyes rentre chez lui, plein d’ambitions, mais il découvre que la situation a bien changé depuis son départ. Tandis qu’il cherche sa place dans le monde, le destin s’en mêle : Jaime se retrouve par hasard en possession du Scarabée, une ancienne relique d’une biotechnologie extraterrestre. Dès lors que le Scarabée choisit de faire de Jaime son hôte, le jeune homme se voit revêtu d’une armure hors du commun qui lui octroie des pouvoirs extraordinaires – et imprévisibles. Tout bascule alors pour Jaime qui devient le super-héros Blue Beetle …

Critique : Un vieux proverbe berbère dit que, lorsqu’on ne sait pas où on va, il vaut mieux retourner d’où on vient. De fait, après l’indigent Black Adam et le boursouflé The Flash, l’univers ciné DC-Warner – ou ce qu’il en reste – ne pouvait trouver plus belle aubaine que de rebondir avec le sympathique Blue Beetle. Un film qui fait pense aux Marvel du début des années 2000 ; cela ressemble à un reproche, mais c’est pourtant loin d’être le cas. En effet, Sam Raimi (dans sa trilogie Spider-Man) et Bryan Singer (dans les deux premiers X-Men) cherchaient avant tout à ne pas mettre la charrue avant les bœufs : à raconter une histoire simple, aux proportions modestes, à taille humaine, loin de la surenchère pathologique qui touche le genre aujourd’hui.

Sous la capuce de Blue Beetle se cache le post-ado débonnaire Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña, très à l’aise) qui, comme naguère Peter Parker, devra apprendre à vivre avec de bien encombrantes facultés. (Et l’analogie entre super-pouvoirs et changements corporels induits par l’adolescence est désormais bien connue.) La vie n’est pas rose chez les Reyes : le patriarche, victime d’un AVC, a dû hypothéquer son garage auto pour couvrir les frais médicaux ; et la famille devra bientôt décamper, du fait de la gentrification de son quartier, désormais envahi par les Starbucks et le yoga Bikram. On est loin du luxueux manoir de Bruce Wayne. Dans une scène, le gros mot est même lâché par Rudi, l’oncle conspi (le grand George Lopez) : Batman ? « Un fasciste » ! De fait, sous ses airs de ne pas y toucher, Blue Beetle nous rejoue l’air de la lutte des classes : la grande méchante du film, Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon, inspirée) est à la tête d’un conglomérat pseudo-philanthrope qui a du sang sur les mains et ne pense qu’à bétonner des quartiers entiers de Palomar City, doppelgänger fictif de Miami. Ken Loach n’est pas très loin. Angel Manuel Soto, dont c’est le premier blockbuster, semble en tout cas plus intéressé par cet aspect du film que par les inévitables affrontements entre super-types sévèrement burnés et lourdement armés. On a vu pire en la matière (comprendre : on a vu les deux Venom), mais on a vu bien mieux, ça c’est sûr.

Dom Toretto n’est pas bien loin non plus : comme dans Fast & Furious, il n’y en a peu ou prou que pour la « familia », noyau dur inattaquable par et pour qui toute l’action arrive. Il semblerait que l’une des raisons d’existence de ce Blue Beetle soit aussi de « raconter des histoires » plus proches du vécu, de l’expérience bien réelle des Latino-Américains. Même si l’on est, bien sûr, en droit de se demander si de si nobles intentions sont compatibles avec les objectifs mercantiles d’une entreprise comme Warner. Pas vraiment de quoi bouder son plaisir cependant : dans son genre, Blue Beetle est sans doute ce qu’on a vu de plus raisonnable et, osons le dire, de plus sincère depuis un bail.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF2b2lyLWFsaXJlLmNvbS9ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1hbmdlbC1tYW51ZWwtc290by1jcml0aXF1ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

,Por qué aparece Soda Stereo en la película Blue Beetle: el director Ángel Manuel Soto explica la elección,"El filme de superhéroes es un éxito en taquilla y su director habló de la composición latina del personaje. Calle 13, Thalía, Violeta Parra y Cazzu también comforman el soundtrack.","Blue Beetle -la nueva película del universo de DC Comics producida por Warner Bros- acaba de estrenarse en los cines de Argentina y trae una sorpresa para los fanáticos de Soda Stereo.

La película de superhéroes resultó ser un éxito en la taquilla y una de las razones de la buena recepción en Argentina y Sudamérica es el soundtrack incluido. En resumen, el filme trata la vida de Jaime Reyes, un joven con descendencia mejicana que junto a su familia sobrevive en las dificultosas calles de Estados Unidos.

ALERTA DE SPOILER

Más allá del desenlace, en la escena final, se escucha de fondo Nada personal, el hit proveniente del disco homónimo publicado por el trío argentino en 1985.

En una entrevista reciente, el director Ángel Manuel Soto habló de esta elección y explicó que es fan de la canción. Además, confesó que siempre la canta en los karaokes. Al medio Spoiler, Soto declaró: “Cuando estaba leyendo el guion y al final, pues, se besan, me dije: ‘espera, esto es perfecto para aquí’”.

Imágenes de ""Blue Beetle"".

Entrando en detalle, dijo: “Obviamente, no quería incorporar solamente canciones y grupos mexicanos dentro de la música, también quería tener una gama de diferentes tipos de géneros y de diferentes países, desde Calle 13 a Los Saicos de Perú”.

Y continuó: “Tratamos de armar una playlist de la música que escuchan todos los miembros de la familia Reyes”, comentó al justificar la inclusión de otros artistas latinoamericanos como Residente, Thalía, Cazzu y Violeta Parra.

Por otra parte, en otra entrevista para AP, el director reforzó su idea a la hora de llevar a cabo un filme que retrate las raíces latinas. “Ya sabes, las películas que has visto, cada vez que van a un país latino, si van a México, siempre es la misma música. Si van al Caribe, siempre es la misma música”, respondió ante la consulta del periodista.

“Y la verdad es que sí, escuchamos eso, pero también escuchamos otras cosas. No sólo consumimos cosas de Estados Unidos, sino que también tenemos grandes bandas de rock en nuestros países. El hecho de que otras personas no lo hayan escuchado no significa que no sean geniales. Entonces, de la misma manera que me presentaron otra música de Estados Unidos sin ninguna queja, quería presentarle al mundo la música con la que crecí, esperando que tampoco se quejen de eso”, cierra.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYXZvei5jb20uYXIvdm9zL21pcmEvcG9yLXF1ZS1hcGFyZWNlLXNvZGEtc3RlcmVvLWVuLWxhLXBlbGljdWxhLWJsdWUtYmVldGxlLWVsLWRpcmVjdG9yLWFuZ2VsLW1hbnVlbC1zb3RvLWV4cGxpY2EtbGEtZWxlY2Npb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Blue Beetle, intervista al regista Angel Manuel Soto: ""La famiglia è la spina dorsale del film""",Blue Beetle di cosa parla il film con Xolo Mariduena intervista video al regista Angel Manuel Soto trama e trailer di Blue Beetle nuovo film DC Comics,"Interviste Cinema

Uscirà il 17 agosto il nuovo film DC Comics con un supereroe latino. Abbiamo intervista Angel Manuel Soto, regista di Blue Beetle.

Non è il primo personaggio di rilievo di origine latino-americana in un film di supereroi, ma è il primo ad essere protagonista in un ruolo centrale e con superpoteri, tanto per il mondo DC quanto per quello Marvel. E se non avesse una sgangherata ma efficace famiglia alle spalle, non andrebbe da nessuna parte. Blue Beetle segue la storia del neolaureato Jaime Reyes, interpretato dal 21enne attore Xolo Maridueña che conoscono molto bene i fan della serie Cobra Kai.

Il film è diretto dal 40enne regista portoricano Angel Manuel Soto, qui al suo terzo film, e si avvale della anche della presenza di Susan Sarandon nel ruolo della villain Victoria Kord. Completano il cast George Lopez, Adriana Barraza, Elpidia Carrillo, Damián Alcázar, Belissa Escobedo, Roul Max Trujillo, Bruna Marquezine e Harvey Guillén. Abbiamo incontrato virtualmente il regista per parlare di quanto l'elemento della famiglia sia importante nella storia del film.

Blue Bleetle: trama del film sul supereroe latino

Jaime Reyes si laurea e torna a casa pieno di aspirazioni per il suo futuro. Mentre si accontenta di fare lavoretti da inserviente insieme alla sorella, in attesa di capire quale sia il suo posto nel mondo, il destino fa sì che Jaime si ritrovi inaspettatamente in possesso di un’antica reliquia di biotecnologia aliena: lo Scarabeo. Il ragazzo viene improvvisamente scelto dallo Scarabeo come suo ospite simbiotico e dotato di un’incredibile armatura che gli offre poteri straordinari e imprevedibili. Il suo destino cambierà per sempre e Jamie si trasformerà nel supereroe Blue Beetle.

Blue Beetle è un personaggio dei fumetti nato nel lontano 1939, passato tra le mani di diversi editori, fino all'acquisto dei diritti da parte della DC Comics nel 1983. Quella che vedremo nel film è la sua terza incarnazione, in cui lo scarabeo alieno si fonde con il personaggio di Jaime Reyes, un ragazzo ispanico che vive in Texas. Nel film invece, la storia si ambienta nella fittizia cittadina di Palmera City.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbWluZ3Nvb24uaXQvY2luZW1hL2ludGVydmlzdGUvYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtaW50ZXJ2aXN0YS1hbC1yZWdpc3RhLWFuZ2VsLW1hbnVlbC1zb3RvLWxhLWZhbWlnbGlhLWUtbGEtc3BpbmEvbjE2NDE2My_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

Dicho proyecto no es otro que una película en solitario enfocada en Bane, uno de los principales villanos de Batman en los cómics de DC que en la gran pantalla pudimos ver como antagonista en El Caballero Oscuro: La leyenda renace, la última entrega de la trilogía de Christopher Nolan.

Qué actor de Marvel es perfecto para interpretar a Bane en una nueva película, según el director de Blue Beetle

A pesar de estar ahora involucrado con Blue Beetle, su director no ha cerrado las puertas a una película sobre Bane y ya tiene pensado al actor idóneo para el papel.

Durante una entrevista para Hablemos De Cine, se le preguntó a Angel Manuel Soto sobre el proyecto de DC que tenía pensado antes de Blue Beetle en cuanto a qué actor le gustaría tener como Bane si finalmente se le diera luz verde a su película.

Si bien reconoce que al principio no tenía a nadie pensado, eso cambió por completo en cuanto vio que Dave Bautista, actor que ha interpretado a Drax en el Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel, estaba interesado en el papel.

""Pues mira, cuando yo había concebido esa idea no tenía a nadie pensado. Pero de repente salió Dave Bautista a decir que quiere hacerlo y yo dije, 'esto es bien obvio, sí'. Y tuve la oportunidad de conocerlo. Él vio Blue Beetle, le encantó, y entonces yo dije, 'ok, si me dejan hacer Bane, tú eres mi Bane'"", afirma el cineasta.

A la espera de si tendremos o no una película de Bane, Blue Beetle llega a las salas de cine este viernes 18 de agosto de 2023. ¿Crees que funcionaría una película del villano de Batman con Dave Bautista en el papel?",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvYmJ5Y29uc29sYXMuY29tL25vdGljaWFzL2RpcmVjdG9yLWJsdWUtYmVldGxlLXF1aWVyZS1hY3Rvci1tYXJ2ZWwtaW50ZXJwcmV0ZS1iYW5lLTEyOTAxMTjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

,Blue Beetle franchit enfin les 100 M$ au box-office mondial,,"Tout vient à point à qui sait attendre, dit un fameux dicton. Ceci s'applique à toutes sortes de choses, comme par exemple la capacité de Blue Beetle à franchir une petite barre symbolique au box-office. Au terme de son troisième weekend d'exploitation, la dernière production DC Films de Warner Bros. Discovery a en effet réussi à franchir, non sans peine, le cap symbolique des cent millions de dollars.

Petit à petit...

Ainsi, les médias spécialisés dans le suivi du box-office nous rapportent cette mise à jour concernant les chiffres de Blue Beetle au cinéma : le film d'Angel Manuel Soto en est désormais à un score de 56,6 M$ sur le territoire américain, avec un ensemble de sept millions rapportés sur le troisième weekend d'exploitation, ce qui reste honorable toutes proportions gardées, sachant que le film a perdu pas moins de 555 salles d'exploitants aux Etats-Unis pour ce weekend.

La performance est toute aussi faible avec cinq millions rapportés à l'international, pour un total de 45,3M$ engrangés en dehors des Etats-Unis, pour un box-office mondial qui culmine donc à 101,9 M$. Blue Beetle ne risque pas de grimper bien plus haut et c'est peut-être déjà une forme de miracle de le voir franchir cette barre alors que Warner Bros. Discovery compte mettre le film sur les plateformes de vidéo à la demande à compter du 19 septembre prochain - soit à peine un mois après sa sortie au cinéma. A date, le film reste celui avec les recettes les plus faibles après Wonder Woman 1984 (qui était sorti aux Etats-Unis dans un contexte très particulier). De quoi rester plus que circonspect sur le futur potentiel du personnage dans l'univers en construction qu'envisagent James Gunn et Peter Safran.

Blue Beetle est toujours diffusé dans nos cinémas pour le moment.

2023-08-14 13:19:58+02:00,"'Blue Beetle' primeras reacciones: una película sorprendente, con corazón y destacada por su elenco latino",Una película emotiva y en la que se impone el carácter latino. Las primeras reacciones de 'Blue Beetle' sorprenden gratamente a los periodistas.,"No todos los héroes llevan capa y 'Blue Beetle', podría convertirse en la inesperada figura que el dc necesitaba para recobrar parte de la emoción que tanto ha perdido durante estos años. Además de que el superhéroe interpretado por Xolo Maridueña ('Cobra Kai'), literalmente no lleve capa, las primeras reacciones de 'Blue Beetle' están comenzando a aparecer en la red y aunque hay alguna que otra pega, la inmensa mayoría parece estar encantada con la película, definiéndola como ""una gran sorpresa"".

La película dirigida por Ángel Manuel Soto ('Los reyes de Baltimore') supone la representación más notoria de los superhéroes latinos y el elenco del filme, está fuertemente constituido por actores de dicha descendencia tales como Bruna Marquezine ('Breaking Through'), Raoul Trujillo ('22 Chaser') o Adriana Barraza ('Rambo: Last Blood') entre otros.



Uno de los aspectos que más ha destacado la crítica es el cuidado por la cultura latina y su gran representación. Soto ha sido alabado por saber imbuir la película de ese carácter tan distintivo que define a la sociedad hispana y cómo esto, ha hecho destacar altamente el filme. Además, la crítica también se deshace en elogios en cuanto al resto del reparto. Aún así, contiene alguna que otra pega, ya que para algunos de los espectadores la película era algo tonta o infantil.

The #BlueBeetle movie is mostly a blast. Some is too silly or childish for me, a lot had me laughing loud (George Lopez!). Practical suit rocks. The Latino representation is awesome. Enjoyed the family-centric stakes, solid action beats. Overall, it's fun. pic.twitter.com/5qzWIkmDyE

""La película 'Blue Beetle' es en su mayor parte una pasada. Algunas son demasiado tontas o infantiles para mí, pero muchas me hicieron reír a carcajadas (¡George Lopez!). El traje práctico mola. La representación latina es impresionante. Disfruté de las apuestas centradas en la familia y de los sólidos golpes de acción. En general, es divertida.""


""'Blue Beetle' está aquí y los latinos POR FIN tienen un superhéroe propio reflejado en la gran pantalla. La película es increíblemente buena, única y cumple en todos los frentes, ¡dándole al género de superhéroes el sazón que tanto necesita! La banda sonora de la película, inspirada en la synthwave de Tangerine Dream, también es genial"".


""'Blue Beetle' destaca de las anteriores entradas de DC y se debe sobre todo al sabor latino, seamos realistas. Es divertida, emotiva y las escenas de acción con BB son increíbles. El elenco es hermoso, pero Maridueña y López BRILLAN. ¡No puedo esperar a ver más! Felicidades al BORI @angelmanuelsoto ¡¡¡LFG!!!""


""'Blue Beetle' fue una gran sorpresa. Después de un comienzo inestable, la película de superhéroes está llena de risas, acción y mucho corazón. Xolo Maridueña lo mata, Bruna Marquezine también, George Lopez es divertidísimo y Adriana Barraza es genial como ""Nana"". Lleva a toda la familia y trae pañuelos..""

Esta película representa el penúltimo lanzamiento antes de entrar en el nuevo Universo DC, mientras que 'Aquaman y el reino perdido' será el último. La película por el momento, parece ser un éxito, así que tal vez James Gunn y Peter Safran puedan incluir a este superhéroe con tanto sazón a animar su futura saga. 'Blue Beetle' se estrenará en cines el 18 de agosto.

La buena crítica contra los pronósticos

Los pronósticos no auguraban un buen presagio para el futuro de este filme pero ahora, esta gran ola de críticas positivas ha podido cambiar el porvenir comercial de 'Blue Beetle'. Originalmente, esta película está pronosticada para tener el estreno más bajo del DC reciente con una recaudación total de 30 millones de dólares en su primer fin de semana.

Ahora, con las primeras críticas, las cuáles la están poniendo por las nubes y el apoyo total de las asociaciones latinas, las cuales compartieron una carta firmada por 27 colectivos apoyando a la comercialización y publicitación de este filme, 'Blue Beetle' podría mejorar sus pronósticos y abandonar esos números tan bajos en los que está sumido ahora actualmente.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjYXJ0ZWxlcmEuY29tL25vdGljaWFzL2JsdWUtYmVldGxlLXByaW1lcmFzLXJlYWNjaW9uZXMtNzQ0MDIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,Blue Beetle da la sorpresa en taquilla y podría superar a una película reciente del DCEU,"Pese a la mala racha de sus antecesoras en el universo cinematográfico de DC, Blue Beetle sorprende no solo en taquilla, sino también en los comentarios de...","Blue Beetle - 74%, la película de DC dirigida por Angel Manuel Soto y protagonizada por Xolo Maridueña, llegó a las salas de cine el 17 de agosto, luego de que su casa productora, DC Entertainment, atravesara una desafortunada racha en taquilla con los estrenos del último año. Entre los lanzamientos que no tuvieron el éxito esperado se encuentran Black Adam - 52%,¡Shazam! La Furia de los Dioses - 55% y The Flash - 60% . A ello se le suma el reinicio inminente del universo cinematográfico y la competencia con otras casas productoras como Marvel. Lo anterior ha contribuido a la pérdida de una importante base de fans.

Pese a este panorama, Blue Beetle superó las proyecciones de recaudación para su primer fin de semana, pero está a años luz de ser un éxito. Según el portal ComicBook las cifras actuales de la película oscilan entre los US $8.8 millones a nivel mundial. La misma fuente informa que la proyección para este filme es que termine su estancia en los cines con ganancias de entre US $140 y $170 millones, una muy desalentadora expectativa incluso con costos de producción y marketing moderados de US $100 millones, según la revista Forbes.

Dadas esas cifras, incluso si solo consiguiera lo mínimo estimado, sería suficiente para superar a ¡Shazam! La Furia de los Dioses, película que obtuvo un total de US $133. 8 millones. Por otro lado, aun si tuviera un aumento exponencial, los números de Blue Beetle seguirían muy por debajo de The Flash, filme protagonizado por Ezra Miller, cuya recaudación sumó US $268.5 millones en todo el mundo, lo cual fue un rotundo fracaso debido al exorbitante presupuesto de producción, sumado a los costos de marketing.

Sí bien los ingresos han desfavorecido al largometraje, la crítica ha tenido algunos buenos comentarios sobre aspectos que podrían considerarse aciertos dentro de la producción. En su reseña para Collider, Ross Bonaime comentó:

Blue Beetle podría no ser una versión única de la historia de origen del superhéroe, pero Soto y Dunnet-Alcocer demuestran que un enfoque más ligero y de menor escala dentro del Universo DC puede funcionar (...) Aunque a menudo se siente derivada de las piezas de otras películas de superhéroes, su enfoque en la familia hace que se sienta especial e imbuye corazón a esta historia, a pesar de la familiaridad.

Las condiciones para una posible secuela

Antes del estreno en cines, en una entrevista para Yahoo! Reino Unido, el director Ángel Manuel Soto, comentó que una de las condiciones para que Blue Beetle tenga una secuela es que la primera entrega genere el dinero suficiente para reinvertirlo en un segundo e incluso tercer largometraje.

Por la forma en que funciona la máquina, la (primera) película necesita generar dinero para que puedan invertir más dinero, pero para nosotros, siempre se ha visto de esa manera… Nos encanta la historia. Creemos mucho en el producto, creemos mucho en el actor. No pudimos evitar pensar hacia dónde iría su viaje mientras creábamos esta película. ¿Es entonces el cumplimiento de un sueño? ¿Se lo podríamos atribuir al universo? Claro.

Por su parte, un mes antes de su estreno en cines, el director de DC Studios, James Gunn confirmó en Threads que Blue Beetle “y un puñado de otros personajes” continuarán en el universo cinematográfico de DC. Estas Interesantes declaraciones constatan que, desde un inicio, los planes para Blue Beetle han sido convertirlo en una saga. No obstante, hacer realidad una serie de largometrajes depende mucho del éxito financiero de las primeras entregas. Por lo que es difícil que DC se comprometa a continuar la historia del Escarabajo Azul, si este no logra generar ingresos significativos.

In un’intervista con The Digital Fix, Soto svela chi vorrebbe vedere nella parte di Kord. Stiamo parlando della star di Ted Lasso Jason Sudeikis. Ecco cosa dice:

Il mio cast da sogno per Ted Kord è sempre stato Jason Sudeikis. Ma alla fine si tratta di decidere chi è il più adatto per il personaggio, chi ama quello che stiamo provano a fare. E chi desidera vedere la storia di Jaime Reyes continuare.

Dal momento che Ted Lasso si è concluso, chissà che Sudeikis non decida di unirsi all’universo DC…

,Kritika: Kék Bogár (Ángel Manuel Soto: Blue Beetle),"Egy hónap kellett ahhoz, hogy érkezzen egy film, ami letaszítja a Barbie-t az amerikai nézettségi listák éléről, az azonban aligha volt várható, hogy ez Ángel Manuel Soto gyorskajás dobozba csomagolt, cyber-hadsereget táplálni képes bogárról szóló új DC-hőst bevezető filmje lesz.","Egy hónap kellett ahhoz, hogy érkezzen egy film, ami letaszítja a Barbie-t az amerikai nézettségi listák éléről, az azonban aligha volt várható, hogy ez Ángel Manuel Soto gyorskajás dobozba csomagolt, cyber-hadsereget táplálni képes bogárról szóló új DC-hőst bevezető filmje lesz.

Egy földönkívüli szkarabeusz a frissen diplomázott Jaime Reyest (Xolo Maridueña) választja ki gazdatestéül, hogy a tinédzsert olyan cyber-páncéllal ruházza fel, amely rendkívüli és kiszámíthatatlan erőkre képes, örökre megváltoztatva annak és környezetének sorsát. Már ebből az egymondatos összefoglalóból is egyértelművé válik, hogy a Kék Bogár hiány nélkül felhasználja a szuperhősfilmek receptjének hozzávalóit: van egy naiv főhősünk, akire hirtelen és tényleg bármilyen logikus indok nélkül a világ megváltásának felelősége hárul, egy emberfeletti szupererő, ami látványos CGI-effektekre ad lehetőséget és egy összeesküvéselméletnek beillő mitikus eredettörténet, ami idegen erőkkel magyarázza az emberiség történetét, persze az egészet egy főcím alatt letudva, mindenféle részletezést mellőzve.

A Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer által írt történet olyan szempontból azonban mégis hiánypótló, hogy egy latin-amerikai családra fókuszál, főhőse így az első jelentős latin-amerikai szuperhős. Jamie az egyetemről hazaérkezve azzal szemebsül, hogy családi vállalkozásuk csődbe ment, a lakbért pedig tarthatatlanul megemelték, és így elkerülhetetlenné vált a kilakoltatás. Később a szupererőt biztosító ősi bogár harmadik tulajdonosa lesz, akinek az előző birtokosa éppen az milliárdos volt, akinek lánya, Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine) majd segíteni fog a nagynénje által vezetett Kord vállalat ördögi tervének meghiúsításában. Victoria (Susan Sarandon) ugyanis egyszemélyes robothadsereg felépítésére akarja használni a bogár erejét, s így elindul Jaime és a vele szimbiózisba került biotechnikai szkarabeusz nyomára.

A szupererő eredetének megmagyarázása a műfaj egyik legkritikusabb pontja lenne, a DC ebben pedig sosem volt a legügyesebb (az utóbbi időben bevezetett szuperhősei mind megkérdőjelezhetőek – Flash, Shazam, Black Adam), a testbe beszivárogni képes kéken fénylő bogár hatására csápokat és szárnyakat növesztő, spanyolul is beszélni tudó, agyat fertőző entitás ezek között már nem is hat olyan véletlenszerűnek. Az viszont már eléggé meglepő, hogy a gyerekseregek példaképéül eddig bizonyára nem szolgáló Kék Bogár lett a DC sikeres projektje, miután az kudarcot vallott a saját multiverzumának megnyitásában. A Kék Bogár ugyanis pont azért működik, mert nem próbálja görcsösen megújítani a hanyatlásnak indult műfajt, lazán felhasználja annak kliséit, miközben az egésznek sajátos színt is ad.

A Palmera City külvárosában (a képregények helyszínéül szolgáló, El Pasót helyettesítő Miami-szerű nagyvárosban) megélni próbáló család aktuálpolitikai problémákra reflektál, a cselekményt meghatározó szegregáció így a bevándorlók túlélési lehetőségeinek szubtextusaként működik. Ahogy a filmben meg is jegyzik: úgy tartják, hogy a határátkelés nehéz, pedig igazából a következő húsz év az. Így bár a film fiktív poliszának hierarchiájában is jól meghatározott egy latin-amerikai származású helye, Jaime minden vágya az lesz, hogy családját kimozdítsa innen.

A film értékrendszerében tehát az első helyre a család iránti szeretet kerül, ami ugyancsak közhelyesen hangzik, de némiképp változást jelent a szuperhősökre álltalában jellemző, kivégzett családjaik miatt érzett bosszúvágytól. Ebben a történetben az igencsak népes rokonság komoly szerephez is jut: amellett, hogy Jaimével együtt el kell fogadniuk a változást és meg kell tanulniuk használni az új erőket, Jaime segítői is lesznek a Kord vállalat erődjét őrző hadsereggel szembeni küzdelemben. A flúgos és szókimondó Rudy nagybácsiról (George Lopez) kiderül, hogy egy technikai zseni, a végig csendes öreglány, Nana (Adriana Barraza) pedig nem rest elővenni eddig titkolt forradalmi múltját.

A film tehát inkább a karaktereire figyel, az viszont már kérdéses, hogy ezeket mennyire sztereotipikusan építi fel. A latin-amerikai kultúra bemutatása is többször felületes marad: a nagymama spanyol szappanoperát néz, vagy az akciójelenet közben lemaradva az eseményekről spanyol dalokat dudorászik, de az etnikai poénokon kívül nem sokat ismerünk meg erről a világról. Szerencsére ezek a viccek, ha már nem váltanak ki hangos hahotázást a nézőtérről, nincsenek túltolva vagy túlerőltetve sem, a film nem ezekre alapoz.

A DC valószínűleg nem ettől a filmtől várta univerzumának megmentését, és valószínűleg nem is ettől az egyetlen filmtől fogja megkapni. A Kék Bogár minden erényének ellenére nagyon távol marad a műfaj megújításától, így csak késlelteti azt a hanyatlást, ami a szuperhősfilmek esetében egyre tapasztalhatóbban elindult.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vZmlsbXRldHQucm8vY2lray9lanRzZC1oYWptZS1ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1rZWstYm9nYXIta3JpdGlrYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Blue Beetle, un film inutile e che conferma la profonda crisi dei cine-comic","La recensione del nuovo film della DC che, forse, segna l'inizio della fine per il cinema supereroistico.  - Leggi tutto l'articolo  su  Fantascienza.com","Sulle pagine di Delo Science Fiction, Arturo Fabra ha più volte sottolineato una certa stanchezza che ormai attanaglia il cinema supereroistico e prova ne sono anche i risultati magri che, con qualche eccezione, in termini economici stanno ottenendo questo genere di pellicole. Tant’è che sia per qualche film Marvel (Quantumania) sia per qualche film DC (Flash) è più volte stata usata la parola “flop”.

Il genere ha forse tirato un po’ troppo la corda e il fatto è che nei prossimi mesi e anni ci aspetta una nuova abbuffata di supereroi, non è molto incoraggiante. Da un lato abbiamo il Marvel Cinematic Universe, che è attualmente alla Fase 5 ma è già in programma la Fase 6 e dall’altro abbiamo un reebot totale con a capo le menti creative di James Gunn e Peter Safran. Non vi elenchiamo i film dell’uno o dell’altro universo, basta cercarli su qualsiasi motore di ricerca e saltano fuori con le giuste parole chiavi.

Il problema non è solo nei termini di una possibile saturazione presso il pubblico, ma è artistico e produttivo, una crisi più profonda. Proviamo a tracciarne i contorni con un film uscito ad agosto e di cui davvero non si sentiva il bisogno: Blue Beetle, della DC.

Partiamo dalla trama ufficiale: il neolaureato Jaime Reyes torna a casa pieno di aspirazioni per il suo futuro ma scoprirà da subito che non è proprio come l’ha lasciata. Mentre cerca il suo scopo nel mondo, il destino fa sì che Jaime si ritrovi inaspettatamente in possesso di un’antica reliquia di biotecnologia aliena: lo Scarabeo. Jamie viene improvvisamente scelto dallo Scarabeo come suo ospite simbiotico e dotato di un’incredibile armatura capace di poteri straordinari e imprevedibili. Il suo destino cambierà per sempre e Jamie si trasformerà nel Supereroe Blue Beetle.

Da questa breve sintesi è già chiaro che siamo di fronte a vicende viste e riviste. Jaime diventa un supereroe grazie a una tecnologia aliena che entra in simbiosi con lui (Venom), che ha la forma di un insetto e lo stesso Jaime si trasforma in uno scarabeo-umano (Spider-Man), la sua corazza è però molto tecnologica (Iron Man) e, infine, grazie ad essa riesce a immaginare qualsiasi cosa, tipo un’arma, e renderla reale per combattere i cattivi di turno (Lanterna Verde).

Il nostro eroe vive ai margini di una grande metropoli, che sembra essere una futura Miami, e si erge a paladino di tutti i suoi abitanti (Superman-Metropolis, Batman-Gotham). Insomma, la domanda è: c’è qualcosa di originale? Sì, il nostro eroe è messicano e non c’era mai stato un supereroe proveniente da quella parte del mondo.

Jaime Reyes è il terzo individuo a portare il nome Blue Beetle, almeno secondo il fumetto. Prima di lui ci sono stati l’archeologo Dan Garrett, che ha scoperto lo scarabeo tecnologico in un’antica tomba egiziana e, poi, il milionario Ted Kord, che non riuscendo ad entrare in simbiosi con lo scarabeo alieno (pare che ti scelga lui), si propose come Blue Beetle semplicemente come un supereroe che con i soldi poteva creare gadget e una tuta più o meno tecnologica (vi ricorda qualcuno? Tipo Batman, Iron Man). Jaime è il terzo Blue Beelte, ed è un adolescente di El Paso, Texas, che ha stretto un legame con lo Scarabeo di Dan Garrett. Il manufatto gli dona un'incredibile armatura aliena che usa per difendere la sua città natale da ogni sorta di criminali metaumani.

Il personaggio a fumetti è nato nel 1939, sulle pagine di Mystery Men Comics n.1, ma Jaime è entrato nell’universo dei comics della DC nel 2006, apparendo per la prima volta in Crisi infinita n.3.

La cultura messicana, che poteva essere un punto di forza della pellicola, ci viene mostrata per stereotipi. Jaime è un giovane messicano laureato in giurisprudenza e ovviamente trova lavoro solo come cameriere, così come la sorella. La famiglia di Jaime è entrata, all’inizio della loro storia, illegalmente negli Stati Uniti, lo zio Jaime ricorda, ad un certo punto, di come abbia attraversato la frontiera appena bambino insieme al fratello più grande, il padre di Jaime. C’è addirittura una scena in cui la famiglia di Jaime viene arrestata che, se isolata, potrebbe passare tranquillamente per un servizio di un telegiornale in cui avviene in diretta l’arresto di immigrati messicani entrati illegalmente sul territorio americano.

Ancora, la famiglia Jaime è dipinta come povera (non riescono a pagare la rata del mutuo e quindi tra poco perderanno la casa), in contrapposizione con i ricchi americani. Qui, poi, va sottolineata la storia d’amore che nasce tra Jaime e la ricca Jenny Kord, figlia del milionario Ted, che ha come modello la soap opera per eccellenza della cultura messicana, ovvero Anche i ricchi piangono, la cui storia, a parti invertite, è quella di una povera ragazza di cui s’innamora un giovane ricco.

Per la cronaca il film è del regista da Angel Manuel Soto, il protagonista è Xolo Maridueña nel ruolo di Jaime/Blue Beetle. Al fianco di Maridueña ci sono Adriana Barraza nel ruolo della nonna di Jaime, Nana, Damían Alcázar in quello di suo padre, Elpidia Carrillo nel ruolo della madre, Bruna Marquezine in quello di Jenny Kord, Raoul Max Trujillo come Carapax, Susan Sarandon (sì, quella Susan Sarandon) come Victoria Kord e George Lopez nel ruolo di suo zio Rudy.

A parte qualche scena che scade un po’ nel ridicolo, il film è – se non si pretende troppo – piacevole per carità, ma la sensazione di già visto e rivisto è probabile che vi assalirà dal primo all’ultimo frame.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhbnRhc2NpZW56YS5jb20vMjkxODIvYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtdW4tZmlsbS1pbnV0aWxlLWUtY2hlLWNvbmZlcm1hLWxhLXByb2ZvbmRhLWNyaXNpLWRlaS1jaW5lLWNvbWlj0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

8/16/2023 9:08,Review: ‘Blue Beetle’ puts a welcome Latino spin on superhero clichés,"George Lopez plays a wacky uncle and Xolo Maridueña makes a relatable, reluctant hero in DC’s latest family-focused film.","Elpidia Carrillo as Rocio, left, George Lopez as Uncle Rudy, Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes, Belissa Escobedo as Milagro and Damian Alcazar as Alberto in “Blue Beetle.” Photo: Hopper Stone/SMPSP & DC Comics Photo: Hopper Stone/SMPSP & DC Comics
DC has been trying and failing to make its superhero movies about family for some time now. Evidence: the “Shazam!” films; “The Flash”; “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” (“My mom’s named Martha too!”).
Happily, “Blue Beetle” comes closest to cracking the code by grounding its slam-bang sci-fi shenanigans in familia. Based on the third incarnation of a comic book character who’s been in and out of circulation — published by several different companies — since 1939, this movie’s Latin flavor feels fresh, with welcome bits of political bite and funny takes on the genre’s overfamiliar conventions.
Jaime Reyes (“Cobra Kai’s” Xolo Maridueña), the first member of his Mexican American family to graduate from college, returns home to Palmera City, a seaside metropolis done up in “Miami Vice” pastels and hologram-adorned skyscrapers, with a pre-law degree and a lifetime of student loan debt. His demonstrative kin are proud, but facing their own financial setbacks and about to lose their humble home in the low-slung, decidedly not pastel Edge Keys barrio.

Nana (Adriana Barraza), soulful dad Alberto (Damián Alcázar), pragmatic mom Rocio (Elpidia Carrillo) and wacky uncle Rudy (George Lopez) tell Jaime not to worry, they’ll persevere like they always have. Smart-mouthed little sister Milagro (Belissa Escobedo) isn’t so confident. She gets her brother a menial job at the mansion of awful industrialist Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon, relishing every villainous moment). Victoria is the sister of long-missing inventor Ted Kord, and is eager to harness the powers of an outer space scarab he was working with to build a line of paramilitary police.
Comics fans know that Ted was the previous Blue Beetle, a kind of buggy Batman complete with kooky crime-fighting gadgets and an underground lair. After Ted’s well-meaning, aunt-hating daughter Jenny (Bruna Marquezine) slips the symbiotic scarab to Jaime for safekeeping, it’s just a matter of time before the living alien device digs into the lad’s spine and covers him in the black and blue beetle exoskeleton/uniform.

Called Khaji-Da, the sentient advanced technology bestows the usual superpowers and generates amazing weapons. Jaime, though, is a reluctant host. He’s just as mortified as frightened by his first grotesque transformation in front of his vocal, if somewhat, complacent relatives (hey, they’re immigrants; they’ve seen worse).
Unlike the robotically ruthless Khaji-Da, Jaime doesn’t want to hurt anybody. Victoria makes sure he does, though, with the help of her top henchman Carapax (Raoul Max Trujillo). She’s turned that School of the Americas-trained assassin into a cyborg prototype of the robocop that Kord hopes to manufacture.
You know the rest: morphing, flying, fights, near-death experiments, last-minute escapes, climactic showdowns that go on too long.

Except in “Blue Beetle,” the other Reyeses insist on getting in on the action. Nana, the sweet old lady whose worldview seems limited to her beloved telenovelas, turns out to have had quite the past. Rudy is a conspiracy nut who can kick-start anything; he drives Jaime and Jenny to face the bad guys in his souped-up Tacoma, which he calls “the Taco,” complete with a dashboard adorned with vintage Cheech & Chong bobbleheads.
Sporting a cape-like mullet and a goatee down to his pecs, Lopez plays Rudy at maximum comic volume and vulgarity. He somehow also infuses the movie with genuine heart, as do Maridueña and Becky G as the Siri-like voice of Khaji-Da; she lends the killer AI a nice slice of moral intelligence.
“I don’t really like the term alien,” Rudy quips during a discussion of extraterrestrial stuff.

Director Ángel Manuel Soto (“Charm City Kings”) and screenwriter Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer (best known for the U.S. remake of “Miss Bala”) slip in a steady stream of critical jabs at prejudice, income inequality and militarization, as well as a lovely, cosmic moment of magical realism.
The studio is promoting “Blue Beetle” as the first Latino costumed hero feature; Miles Morales and the folks who made the 2018 indie “El Chicano” (which also co-starred Lopez) may like to have a word. But as far as live-action, effects-filled fantasies go, I guess we can cut the DC team some slack. They’ve certainly made one of the more down-to-earth big-screen superhero films this year, and we should all be able to agree that’s a good thing.

8/21/2023 13:02,Did You Find The Sneaky El Paso Easter Eggs in Blue Beetle Movie,There ARE references to El Paso in the new Blue Beetle movie.,"This past weekend DC's Blue Beetle premiered in movie theaters everywhere, much to the delight of anxious fans of DC Comics & the Blue Beetle. We know the Blue Beetle, while the hero was based in El Paso, the movie was set in the fictional city of Palmera City. However...after watching it in theaters, I did spot a few Easter eggs that WERE a clear reference to El Paso Texas.
NOTE: I will make sure to keep this spoiler free.
How many El Paso Easter eggs are in the Blue Beetle?
In the beginning of the movie when our main character Jaime Reyes, played by Xolo Maridueña, comes back to see his family, the first shot of the house we notice a street sign that says very clearly ""El Paso St"". Similar to what you'd see on the ACTUAL El Paso St. This WAS confirmed by Angel Manuel Soto in an interview.
Google Maps Google Maps loading...
And there's another scene where Uncle Rudy, played by George Lopez, is driving his Toyota Tacoma (as he calls it ""Taco""), on the black passenger seat cover, it says ""EL PASO"" in letter writing. And there was even a cameo from Felipe Esparza. I know he's not from El Paso, but he certainly is loved by El Paso.

And I'd be remised if I didn't mention Angel Manuel saying that the Blue Beetle's beer of choice is at the Old Sheepdog Brewery, even showing that Cervza del Pueblo is featured IN the movie.
And don't forget the local artist, elcimi (aka Jesus Cimi),painting a mural in Puerto Rico (where they shot the film) being used in the film.
Aside from that, there weren't too many Easter eggs in the movie; they were all featured in the beginning in the movie. However in the Alamodraft house interview BEFORE the movie, director Angel Manuel Soto did reveal that on their trip to El Paso, they were inspired by the Plaza Theater in Downtown El Paso, as well as the adobe houses found out town. Personally the houses looked similar to those you'd find around Central or around Downtown.
Personally I would've loved to see more references to El Paso in the Blue Beetle movie but I'm happy that we WERE in the movie to begin with! Here's to hoping that more Easter eggs will be in the next Blue Beetle movie.

In a behind-the-scenes clip shared exclusively with PEOPLE, the cast of the new DC Studios film discusses how this superhero origin story separates itself from the pack.
""There's no secrecy"" from the family, star Xolo Maridueña, who plays Jaime Reyes, explains in the clip.
When a powerful, parasitic device latches onto Jaime, claiming him as its human host, he gains superpowers. Then, billionaire businesswoman Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) hunts him down to weaponize the alien tech.

The DC Comics character Blue Beetle first appeared in 1939.
It wasn't until 2006 that the character was reimagined to tell the story of Jaime, described as a ""college graduate with a close-knit Mexican American family living in El Paso, Texas."" (The film is set instead in the fictional Palmera City.)
Director Soto said in a previous statement that he wanted to ""capture the warmth of the family"" in the film.
The filmmakers ""embraced"" the ""very unique journey where the family is part of the adventure, not a group of people or an object of rescue, but on the contrary, an integral part of the construct of this superhero.”

8/26/2023 1:00,‘Blue Beetle’ deserves a better fate than mere DC afterthought,"Imagine if DC and Warner Bros. chose to prioritize “Blue Beetle” this summer instead of “The Flash.” Swap the release dates (early June for late August), ditch the misguided Ezra Miller image reclamation project, and hype the legitimate qualities of “Blue Beetle” rather than brazenly lie about “The Flash.”","Imagine if DC and Warner Bros. chose to prioritize “Blue Beetle” this summer instead of “The Flash.” Swap the release dates (early June for late August), ditch the misguided Ezra Miller image reclamation project, and hype the legitimate qualities of “Blue Beetle” rather than brazenly lie about “The Flash.”
As comic books often ask: What If?
While not the jolt of originality the superhero genre desperately needs right now, “Blue Beetle” easily surpasses most of the output in the 14-film DC Extended Universe, a now failed concept which will officially expire after the release of December’s “Aquaman” sequel. Set in the neon-infused Palmera City, “Blue Beetle” takes a more lighthearted approach more akin to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (and it centers on multiple mech suit battles a la Marvel’s “Iron Man” to boot).
It’s the first superhero film with a strong Latino voice: Puerto Rican director Angel Manuel Soto, Mexican screenwriter Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer and “Cobra Kai” breakout Xolo Maridueña starring as Jaime Reyes, a first-generation college grad who returns home to help his close knit family as they face new financial hardship.
Of course, this being a big budget superhero movie, there’s also an ancient Scarab that “chooses” young Jaime after he helps a protégé at an advanced technology company (Bruna Marquenzine), who becomes the target of her weapons-obsessed aunt (Susan Sarandon). The Scarab fuses onto Jaime’s body, creating a powerful exoskeleton capable of flight, advanced combat, infinite weapons and a voice entity that shares control of the suit alongside a flabbergasted Jamie.
As silly as anything else in the genre, at least “Blue Beetle” surrounds its central character with a supportive family unit, including Belissa Escobedo as Jamie’s younger sister, Damián Alcázar as his father, Elpidia Carrillo as his mother and Adriana Barraza as Jamie’s tougher-than-she-looks grandmother. The surprise MVP of “Blue Beetle” is comedian George Lopez as Jaime’s paranoid Uncle Rudy, providing a mix of levity and heart as an unlikely pseudo-sidekick to the Blue Beetle.
The film delivers whenever it sticks with Jamie’s family, and even with all the CGI mayhem happening in the background, the attention to culture and character here adds fresh perspective to an origin story we’ve otherwise seen too many times before.
The visuals and action function well enough (especially for a movie that was originally developed for HBO Max and carries a fraction of the production budget of the ugly, CGI-heavy “Flash”). However, the various mech battles between Blue Beetle and his primary physical adversary Carapax (Raoul Max Trujillo) crib too much from the busiest of the various “Iron Man” fights over the years. Most oddly, Sarandon is miscast and distracting as Victoria Kord, the corporate baddie pulling all the evil strings.
Some missteps aside, “Blue Beetle” succeeds in many of the ways the MCU charmed audiences during its run from “Iron Man” to “Avengers: Endgame.” Unfortunately, “Beetle” exists in 2023, at a time when there have been far too many of these movies. Its lackluster box office performance is emblematic of the market’s overall superhero fatigue, especially since DC has already announced a major creative shift leaves the Blue Beetle character in limbo. This movie teases a future in its mid-credits scene that might never come to fruition.
Take away all that baggage though and “Blue Beetle” is a good time, and a huge step up from DC’s recent junk (especially “Black Adam” and “The Flash”). Whether anybody cares at this point remains an open question.

,What is 'Blue Beetle'? 5 things to know about DC's first Latino-led superhero movie,"DC Comics' first Latino superhero, Blue Beetle, hits theaters across the country on Aug. 18. But who is the Blue Beetle? And what can he do?","Mark your calendars. On Aug. 18, DC Comics is releasing ""Blue Beetle,"" its latest superhero movie, to theaters across the country.
Xolo Maridueña, of Netflix's ""Cobra Kai,"" stars as Jaime Reyes, the recent college graduate who becomes the titular Blue Beetle, DCs first leading, live-action Latino superhero. Flanked by stars like George Lopez, Susan Sarandon, Becky G and an exciting Puerto Rican director, Ángel Manuel Soto, DC has poised ""Blue Beetle"" to become its next big hit.
But who is this guy? What is Blue Beetle's origin story? What are his superpowers?
This article answers all your ""Blue Beetle"" related questions (and then some). Here's everything you need to know about DC's newest blockbuster superhero, the Blue Beetle.
Who is Blue Beetle? A history
Despite his low profile, Blue Beetle has been around for a long time.
Blue Beetle broke into the comic world in 1939 as archeologist Dan Garret, discoverer of a mysterious Egyptian scarab, which granted him even more mysterious powers. In the 1950s, Blue Beetle was revived in the form of gadget-wielding scientist Ted Kord, who could not use the scarab's powers himself but used the beetle as inspiration for his crime-fighting devices. Think Batman, but less rich, less buff ... and beetle, not bat.
In 1983, DC bought the rights to ""Blue Beetle,"" and in 2006, the character was revamped as Jaime Reyes, a Latino student from El Paso who acts as the host of the blue, alien-artificial-intelligence scarab, and has a deep love of family. Reyes' Blue Beetle became a consequential member of DC's beloved Teen Titans comic series.
It is Jaime Reyes that takes center stage in DC's latest superhero movie, ""Blue Beetle.""
What are the Blue Beetle's powers? And where do they come from?
Jaime Reyes becomes the Blue Beetle when an alien AI beetle chooses him as its human host. The beetle (or scarab, as it is often referred to in the movie) is the agent of an alien force, The Reach, which is trying to take over the galaxy. The particular scarab that chooses Reyes as its host, however, has a slight malfunction, and instead of working for The Reach, chooses to support the goals and preservation of its new host, Reyes. That support comes in the form of superpowers (naturally).
The Blue Beetle's powers include ""alien technology, durability, flight, super strength, instant weaponry and combat skill,"" according to the DC website. In Blue Beetle form, Reyes is protected by an armored exoskeleton that resembles a blue version of Iron Man's suit. The generative powers of the alien-scarab are extensive: ""Whatever you can imagine, I can create,"" the scarab tells Reyes in a similar manner, again, to how Iron Man's AI assistant, Jarvis, communicates with Tony Stark.
Who is Ángel Manuel Soto? The Puerto Rican director behind 'Blue Beetle'
""Blue Beetle"" is director Ángel Manuel Soto's first time working with DC. It is also his first superhero movie and his first big-budget movie. He studied architecture and advertising (he did not go to film school). So who is Soto? And how did he come to direct a future blockbuster DC superhero movie?
Born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in 1983, Soto has always loved movies. His movie-making career, however, did not start until 2009 when Soto created and directed his first short film, ""22 Weeks,"" with money he saved up renting out his own room and sleeping on the floor for two months. ""22 Weeks"" went on to win numerous awards, opening the door for the Puerto Rican director to continue his movie-making dream.
Soto earned the attention of DC's creative directors, James Gunn and Peter Safran, in 2020 with his award-winning coming-of-age movie, ""Charm City Kings."" Gunn and Safran saw in ""Charm City Kings"" much of the same storytelling strengths they were looking for in ""Blue Beetle."" It might have helped that Gunn had recently made a successful switch from directing indie movies to ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" not a decade before. The rest is film history.
Who stars in 'Blue Beetle'?
Xolo Maridueña of Netflix's ""Cobra Kai"" stars as Jaime Reyes and Blue Beetle. Maridueña is supported by a strong Latino cast, as well as evil-villain-playing Susan Sarandon. Here's a look at the actors playing the film's lead roles.

How to watch 'Blue Beetle'
""Blue Beetle"" will be released in theaters across America on Friday, Aug. 18. The $120 million-budget superhero movie is rated PG-13 due to action, violence and suggestive language. Given the recent merger of Warner Bros. and HBO, ""Blue Beetle"" will likely be available for streaming on HBO Max by the end of 2023.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbW92aWVzLzIwMjMvMDgvMTQvd2hvLWlzLWJsdWUtYmVldGxlLWRjLWNvbWljcy1uZXctc3VwZXJoZXJvLW1vdmllLzcwNTUyNzkzMDA3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
,‘Blue Beetle’s’ Latino superpower,"Although it has its share of Hispanic stereotypes, “Blue Beetle” also contains a meaningful layer that will resonate with some Latinos.","Uncle Rudy, a character played by Mexican American stand-up comedian George Lopez, receives a surprise gift: a new Toyota Tacoma . Upon realizing that the truck is blue, he chuckles and says something like, “It’s a little on the nose, no?”
There is a line toward the end of “ Blue Beetle ” — the Latinx superhero live-action movie released in theaters Aug. 18 — that exactly describes one of my first impressions of the film.
As it turns out, “Blue Beetle” is a lot on the nose. From the beginning of the 127-minute movie, there is a barrage of Hispanic references that overwhelm the senses. From the music choices — there was some Calle 13, Los Panchos, Selena, and Ivy Queen, among other Hispanic musical titans — to the iconic images of Our Lady of Guadalupe and a Vicks VapoRub appearance, the movie immediately feels like it wants to unapologetically keep reminding you that, just in case you forgot, this is a Latino film made by Latinos.

The cultural specificity is strong, the Hispanic touchstones nonstop. Most of them are about Mexican identity. The Latinx superhero film centers on Jaime Reyes, portrayed by Xolo Madriueña, who transforms into Blue Beetle and his family, who are of Mexican descent. Hence the specific mentions of Mexican pop culture symbols like the telenovela “Maria la del Barrio” and “El Chapulín Colorado,” a reference to a Mexican TV comedy from the ’70s that will likely come across as obscure even for some Latino viewers.

And yet all the references end up working because it’s as if the movie knows it’s being literal. On some level, one can conclude that “Blue Beetle” is trying too hard. But behind all the Hispanic stereotypes and tropes, and the deeper gentrification and colonialism themes, “Blue Beetle” contains a meaningful layer that resonated with people like me, a Mexican American immigrant.

Directed by Ángel Manuel Soto, a Puerto Rican filmmaker, and written by Mexican American screenwriter Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, “Blue Beetle” opened to underwhelming success at the box office compared to other superhero movies from the DC multiverse. But it did dethrone “Barbie” at the box office during its opening weekend and, to be fair, its release came during the actors and screenwriters strike, which prevented the protagonists from participating in the movie’s promotional plans.

The plot, which is formulaic but also funny, focuses on the gravitational pull of an immigrant family, a Mexican American one in this case. That’s where the heart of the movie is. The real protagonists are the abuelita, or grandma, Nana Reyes; the comedic chops of Lopez’s Uncle Rudy (who uttered the instant classic, “Batman is a fascist!”); and Jaime’s father, Alberto, played by an outstanding Mexican actor, Damián Alcázar, who stole the movie. Then there’s the unapologetic use of Spanish and Spanglish throughout the movie, which gives it an exceptional authenticity, as others have argued. Plus, Ignacio Carapax, the movie’s supervillain, speaks a Guatemalan indigenous language. That has got to be a first.
Sure, it’s going to take more than a fun Latino DC Comics superhero flick — the first one ever — to fix the stubborn lack of Hispanic representation on the big screen. The newest installment of a Hollywood diversity study by the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found that Latinos held roughly 5 percent of speaking roles in films last year, a percentage that has barely budged in recent years. The representation gap is striking: 1 in 5 Americans identify as Hispanic.

That invisibility is what came to mind when Milagro, Jaime’s sister, deadpans to him, “We’re invisible to people like that, Jaime. It’s like our superpower.” Aside from the topic of Hispanic underrepresentation, that sentence contains multitudes. To me, it was a nod to the way many Latinos, and immigrants in general, have learned to turn invisibility into strength and resilience.
Is every Latinx viewer going to love “Blue Beetle”? Of course not, it’s not designed for that. And therein lies its beauty as well. Latinidad means different things to different Latinos, which is of course why the question of identity is so complex. The movie portrays distinct Latino experiences — to name two: Milagro won’t go to college because the family can’t afford it and she doesn’t want to go into debt; and Carapax’s villain origin story in an indigenous village in Guatemala echoes the legacy of American military interventionism in Central America. Many Latinos will relate to those experiences, while some others won’t.
What truly made me love the movie, though, was the song chosen for the closing credits, a selection so singular and epic that I felt like the director was speaking directly to me. It was “Nada Personal,” an upbeat synth-pop hit from the ’80s by the famous Argentinian rock band Soda Stereo. The band’s better-known songs, “De Música Ligera” or “Persiana Americana,” would have been more obvious choices but the fact that they weren’t picked felt original.

It’s been years since I’ve heard “Nada Personal,” but my sister and I immediately started lip syncing it, the only ones in the theater singing along. As corny as this sounds, I felt uniquely seen. And that is “Blue Beetle’s” real superpower.

""I'm ready for it to be like Star Wars — six movies,"" he told SFX in an interview conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike began.
""I'm just kidding. But yes, I am [eager for a trilogy of films].""
He continued: ""Everyone involved, even [producers] Peter Safran and James [Gunn], we see this as a larger story, and I want this to be a trilogy. There's so much more to tell in this story. I'm honoured to have just made this first one.""
Gunn and Safran have introduced widespread creative changes to DC Studios as part of their larger vision, with the former recently stating that Blue Beetle was the ""first character"" in his DC universe.
Maridueña agreed that Gunn's comments on the character were a ""huge honour"", adding: ""People should be excited about this new chapter and the opportunity for unity. Blue Beetle is not going to resemble all the rest of [the DC universe].

2023-07-21 16:12:25+00:00,Early Blue Beetle Box Office Projections Aren’t Promising for DC Movie,Early box office projections for the upcoming DC Universe movie Blue Beetle do not look very promising for the superhero film.,"Early box office projections for Blue Beetle do not look promising.
This upcoming DC superhero movie will introduce a DC Universe (DCU) character as the protagonist. “After Jaime Reyes graduates from college and returns to his hometown Palmera City, he is chosen to become a symbiotic host to the Scarab, an ancient alien biotechnological relic that grants him a powerful exoskeleton armor, turning him into the superhero Blue Beetle,” reads the official synopsis.
Blue Beetle is currently tracking to earn $12-17 million in its domestic opening weekend box office. This would be very low for the superhero movie. As a point of comparison to other DC movies from this year, The Flash earned $55 million in its domestic opening and Shazam: Fury of the Gods earned just over $30 million.
Since both previous DC movies from this year were considered box office bombs, this is not a promising look for the studio, especially as the budget is $120 million.
The movie will release on August 18, 2023, by Warner Bros. Pictures.

2023-08-10 07:00:16+00:00,Latino Hollywood Groups Voice Support for DC’s Blue Beetle,27 Latino Hollywood organizations have signed an open letter in support for Latino-driven entertainment like the upcoming DC film Blue Beetle.,"No fewer than 27 Latino Hollywood organizations have signed an open letter voicing support for Latino-driven entertainment, particularly the fast-approaching DC film Blue Beetle.
Due to the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, writers and actors are unable to promote their upcoming projects. However, the Latino groups — which include the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, LA Collab, the Latino Film Institute, the National Association of Latino Independent Producers, and the National Hispanic Media Coalition — still feel it necessary to “amplify the work that countless Latino artists have worked so hard to create.”
The letter specifically alludes to Blue Beetle, which is directed by Ángel Manuel Soto and stars Xolo Maridueña as DC’s Jaime Reyes. “We were particularly optimistic about this summer,” it reads. “We were approaching a critical turning point for Latino representation as we saw the return of some of our favorite shows and characters, the launch of exciting new series, and prepared for a groundbreaking moment on the big screen — the first superhero movie directed, written, and starring Latinos. We were hopeful that our long overdue cultural moment had finally arrived.”
Read the full letter (via Variety) below:
An open letter from Latino leaders Stories are more than entertainment. They are a powerful tool for social change that fuels our collective movement to build a more equitable, just world for those who have been historically underrepresented and marginalized. Actors, writers, and directors are essential to this work. As we watch them do what they do best, we are reminded that their art influences how people think and feel about our communities – both at home and abroad. While we’re encouraged by some of the changes we have seen in recent years, we continue to deal with the repercussions from years of being actively erased and invisible on screen. For decades, our network of organizations has advocated for more authentic, inclusive representation of the Latino community in film and television, both in front and behind the camera. • We’ve invested in creative talent development and executive pipeline programs to prepare aspiring creators and a new generation of business leaders to succeed across our industry. • We’ve created our own platforms to celebrate Latino excellence in media and honor work that uplifts our communities. We’ve served as cultural experts to studios, networks, and producers to ensure that their projects authentically reflect our complex diversity.
We’ve pushed those in leadership to provide fair, adequate resources to our writers, directors, and talent so they don’t encounter unnecessary barriers in bringing their stories to life. • We’ve insisted on better representation within existing narratives by calling out harmful and dangerous stereotypes, and we’ve held studio leadership accountable when they make irresponsible creative decisions that have serious real-world consequences. It’s clear that we still have a long way to go, but we’re proud of our Latino creatives who are elevating our humanity and moving culture forward through their work. We were particularly optimistic about this summer. We were approaching a critical turning point for Latino representation as we saw the return of some of our favorite shows and characters, the launch of exciting new series, and prepared for a groundbreaking moment on the big screen – the first superhero movie directed, written, and starring Latinos. We were hopeful that our long overdue cultural moment had finally arrived. And now we are confronted with this pivotal moment across the media industry; a double strike that will have a significantly disproportionate impact on artists from underrepresented communities. Actors and writers deserve a deal that protects their work and livelihoods, so we will continue to support them as they fight for better treatment and fair compensation. And since we represent a rapidly growing demographic with tremendous influence over the global cultural landscape, we also remain dedicated to recognizing and celebrating their artistic excellence and its invaluable role in reflecting our community and culture on screen. For the sake of current and future generations of Latinos, we will not delay our progress any longer. We invite you to join us in our effort to amplify the work that countless Latino artists have worked so hard to create. It’s important that we show up for them at a time when they are not able to promote their projects. Our stories are universal and need to be told. Together, we must continue to advocate for a more equitable and inclusive industry, one that respects and honors our storytellers and stories.

,Blue Beetle Concept Artists Talk Ted Kord Casting,"Blue Beetle's post-credit scene teased the return of Ted Kord, but who will play him?","Blue Beetle is now playing in theaters, and while the DC film hasn't had the most successful run at the box office, there is a chance fans will see the character again. In fact, James Gunn has said the character will be a part of his new DCU. Blue Beetle's post-credit scene actually featured a big tease about the franchise's future. Turns out, Ted Kord, who was the second Blue Beetle in the comics, is alive. Now, people are wondering who might play the role in the future. Recently, Screen Rant spoke with 9B Collective co-owners and concept artists Phillip Boutté Jr. and Mike Uwandi about Blue Beetle, and asked about the fan-casting of Jason Sudeikis as Ted Kord.
""Honestly, that's one of my favorites, yeah,"" Boutté Jr. said of the Sudeikis fan cast. ""I was going to say that, to me, was the nail on the head for me. I was like, 'That's perfect,'"" Uwandi added. ""I've seen a few others. It's interesting because he doesn't necessarily have to be the action hero badass guy. He's more quirky. So there's been a few others, but I liked Jason,"" Boutté Jr. continued.
""People tried to cast Nathan [Fillion] as him for the longest time too though,"" Boutté Jr. continued. ""Nathan was another big one. Yeah, I can't think of it. It's an interesting thing because the way that they've set it up in the universe now, it would depend on how that actor plays off of everybody else since the family is super important, because actually one of the things that was a surprise for us was George Lopez. Lopez, they had him in mind, but it wasn't initially him. It was going to be somebody that was skinnier and wiry.""
Of course, it's pretty unlikely that Fillion will play Ted Kord considering Gunn recently cast him in Superman: Legacy as Guy Gardner.
Angel Manuel Soto Breaks Down Blue Beetle's Post-Credit Scene:
Blue Beetle director Angel Manuel Soto recently spoke with ComicBook.com and confirmed that Ted Kord is alive thanks to the hero using a computer to message his family.
""Ted Kord is alive. The whole movie, Ted Kord is in it without being in it. We have Jenny Kord who has this conflict with her sentiment about her father because he disappeared,"" Soto tells us.
Though Blue Beetle has been confirmed to be a part of the new DC Universe, Soto isn't quite sure where the hero could pop up next.
""We wanted to give some closure to her character. Obviously, that closure was a lot of doors to open and that closure comes with the fact that Ted Kord did not die, he disappeared,"" the filmmaker explained. ""While we don't know where he's at or why he sent that message, we know that he's going to be somewhere in the future whether it's by himself or with Booster Gold. Everything is open.""

2023-08-25 01:40:00-05:00,BOX OFFICE: ‘Strays’ stumbles at cinemas without stars’ promotion,"When selling a movie about raunchy talking dogs, it helps to have some star power to get moviegoers into seats.","When selling a movie about raunchy talking dogs, it helps to have some star power to get moviegoers into seats.
And “Strays,” which opened last Friday, has it — at least on the screen. Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Randall Park and Isla Fisher are among those who contribute their comic voice talents. Normally, a cast such as this would translate into countless promotional appearances in settings such as “Saturday Night Live,” late-night talk shows and on social media platforms. Not during the actors strike, when such efforts by the actors are forbidden.
Instead, the most exciting thing to happen during the press tour for the film may have been during a rehearsal for a segment on NBC’s “Today” show when Dylan Dreyer, a meteorologist, took a tumble while practicing a trick with an Australian Shepherd.
“Strays,” which had a budget of $46 million, is one of four movies that opened widely across the country last weekend. It grossed an estimated $8.3 million for a fifth-place showing, a poor opening and not close to the number Universal Pictures was hoping for when it greenlighted the film. (The studio’s previous R-rated comedy that paired raunchy material with family-friendly characters, “Good Boys,” opened in 2019 to $21 million. “Cocaine Bear,” also from Universal, had a far more robust opening, $23 million, in February.) “Take out its wall-to-wall F-bombs, envelope-pushing scatological humor and often gross and, in one key case, deeply disturbing visuals, and you’re pretty much left with an amusing if rote story of well-meaning animals learning lessons on the road,” writes film critic Gary Goldstein for The Los Angeles Times.
“Think ‘Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey’ or the more recent ‘A Dog’s Way Home’ but with the furry main characters having their way with couches and garden art, tripping on magic mushrooms, and spouting poop … jokes.” The winner of the weekend, the Warner Bros. DC film “Blue Beetle,” earned $25.4 million, an average showing for a lesser-known comic book movie. The film, heavy on special effects, cost more than $100 million to make and market.
“I wish ‘Blue Beetle’ would have been higher,” said Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros. president of domestic distribution. “I think that we clearly were disadvantaged by not being able to bring the movie to Comic Con and not being able to bring out our ‘Cobra Kai’ star, Xolo Maridueña, as his fans know him, to the world. So that was tough.” Directed by Angel Manuel Soto, “Blue Beetle” stars Maridueña as a recent college graduate whose life is turned upside down when he suddenly transforms into an alien symbiote. The cast includes Raoul Max Trujillo, Susan Sarandon and George Lopez.
At the Los Angeles premiere of “Blue Beetle,” Soto carried a cardboard cutout of Maridueña’s face and called the cast members heroes for “sacrificing this big opportunity” in solidarity with other striking actors.
“I’ll do anything for them,” Soto said.
Both films are the latest examples of opening weekends hurt because their movie stars are unable to promote their latest work. The early-summer successes of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” can’t hide the larger reality that red carpets are lacking the pop and sizzle of the cameras and box office receipts are depressed.
“So far, ‘Barbie,’ ‘Oppenheimer,’ ‘Talk to Me,’ ‘Ninja Turtles’ and ‘The Meg 2’ got by untouched,” box office analyst David Gross said.
The “Barbie” phenomenon is far from over. Greta Gerwig’s film, which earlier last week became the highest grossing Warner Bros. release ever domestically, nearly managed to stay No. 1 again with $21.5 million in its fifth weekend. It’s up to $567.3 million in North America and an eye-popping $1.28 billion globally.
The other half of “Barbenheimer” also continues to perform remarkably well for a movie so far into its run.
Universal Pictures’ “Oppenheimer” has done even better overseas. Its global gross stands at an estimated $717.8 million through Sunday.
Rounding out the top five last week was Paramount Pictures’ “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” which earned $8.4 million in its third frame for a North American total of $88.1 million.
Opening in wide release this weekend are Columbia Pictures’ “Gran Turismo,” Briarcliff Entertainment’s “The Hill” and Bleecker Street’s “Golda.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvYXVnLzI1L3N0cmF5cy1zdHVtYmxlcy1hdC1jaW5lbWFzLXdpdGhvdXQtc3RhcnMtcHJvbW90aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

Blue Beetle
There’s a potent piece of psychological horror swirling around somewhere in the story concocted by director/co-writer Laura Moss and co-writer Brendan J. O’Brien, but a fundamental chilliness in the filmmaking turns into an obstacle to that potential. In a Bronx hospital, nurse Celie (Judy Reyes) faces the ultimate tragedy when her 6-year-old daughter Lila (A.J. Lister) dies from an acute case of meningitis. But in that same hospital works a pathologist Rose (Marin Ireland), whose clandestine experiments could offer an impossible hope for bringing back the dead. The notion of applying anarrative to parental grief is hardly groundbreaking—Stephen King’sbeing just one devastating example—but Moss and O’Brien do find some interesting territory in the clashing personalities of the clinician Rose and the caregiver Celie, and how their shared circumstance results in a kind of crossover in their behavior. It often feels, though, that the filmmakers aren’t quite sure what to do with the reanimated Lila as a creepy threat, or how to mine their premise for all its body-horror possibilities. Most frustrating, despite the solid performances by the two leads, the emotions behind their behavior don’t end up driving the narrative as much as the idea of a ticking clock for the materials needed to keep Lila alive. The result is slick and occasionally satisfying, but one that misses the mark on finding the real terror in what grief can inspire someone to do.(R)Over the past 15 years, some of the most satisfying filmed narratives involving DC Comics characters have been the early seasons of the “Arrowverse” TV seriesandand this feature follows a similar playbook of earnest emotion and playful storytelling. Xolo Maridueña plays Jaime Reyes, a recent college graduate whose return home to his family gets complicated when he comes into the possession of a scarab housing a sentient, symbiotic alien technology—or, more to the point as Jaime's reluctant superhero-dom is concerned, the scarab comes into possession of him. Along the way, Jaime comes into conflict with a high-tech CEO (Susan Sarandon) who wants to exploit the technology for military purposes, and the resulting dynamics do makefeel a little like an experiment in fusingwith. But the screenplay Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer emphasizes the relationship between Jaime and his family members in a way that feels authentic, rather than someone just mouthing the word “family” every 10 minutes like aentry. And director Angel Manuel Soto has plenty of fun with both the character interactions and this action beats, even as the story starts packing a little welcome attitude about the exploitation of brown people, and a willingness to have Jaime’s Uncle Rudy (George Lopez) assert “Batman is a fascist.” In a way, it feels like a pilot for a DC TV show—and in this case, that’s a compliment.(PG-13)With a title including the phrase “invisible hand” and a main character named Adam (though not Smith), it’s fairly clear that writer/director Cory Finley’s adaptation of M.T. Anderson’s novel is an allegory about economics—but at least in its cinematic form, it bounces to too many different variations on that theme. The story is set in 2036 America, five years after an alien race called the “vuvv” appeared, providing technology that made many jobs obsolete and radically shifted the economic realities for families like that of high-schooler Adam (Asante Blackk), who take in as boarders the family of his classmate/eventual girlfriend Chloe (Kylie Rogers). Finley uses many of the book’s more intriguing concepts, like Adam and Chloe turning their courtship into entertainment for the vuvvs’ anthropological curiosity, a notion that wrestles with the inherent falseness of people who monetize their online personas. But he also shifts several subplots to add more layers to the question of how people are affected by economic inequity, folding gender and race into a story that’s already dealing with matters including an unfair justice system, the stresses on family cohesiveness and the role of artists in pushing for change. The performances always feel subservient to the needs of the plot, and the plot keeps trying out new ideas, as though always trying to stay ahead of every anticipated “but what about …” for any story trying to tackle broken late-stage capitalism.(R)Narrative efficiency is one thing; it’s another when a story barely has enough time to build a viewer’s investment. Co-screenwriters Shea Serrano and Jason Concepcion (creator and staff writer, respectively, for the Freevee series Primo) introduce Miguel Perez (Tyler Dean Flores), a Syracuse, N.Y. high-school senior devoted to action movies and hanging out with his best friends David (Christian Vunipola), Cass (Imani Lewis) and Srini (Suraj Partha). But when he learns that his parents are planning to move, Miguel becomes determined to do one thing he’s never done before: get in an actual fight. Director Oz Rodriguez plays around visually with the genres Miguel fantasizes about for his own theoretical battle—ranging from Bruce Lee kung-fu flicks to anime—and the appealing young cast members give a snap to dialogue that is refreshingly not PG-13’d down. The problem is that the character stuff the writers want to include—like Miguel’s sense that his boxer father (Raúl Castillo) doesn’t respect him, or David’s feelings about his own deceased ex-fighter dad—have to jockey for time with all the goofier stuff in a movie that runs just 71 minutes before the credits start to roll. It’s a pleasant enough diversion at times, but ends up too thin to be more than a low-budget spin on(R)Remember the “DreamWorks face”—that ubiquitous expression of eyebrow-cocked insouciance that once filled posters and other marketing materials for CGI animated features? In adapting an ancient Chinese legend, it feels like the filmmakers behindhad as a primary goal the creation of a walking, trash-talking manifestation of ""DreamWorks face"" energy. It’s the tale of the titular monkey (Jimmy O. Yang), fallen to earth in a rock, whose sense of rejection and isolation leads him to ever-more-extreme actions for proving his worth, including capturing a magical stick from the underwater Dragon King (Bowen Yang). His only potential companion: a young girl named Lin (Jolie Hoang-Rappaport), who offers to become his assistant. Director Anthony Stacchi (The Boxtrolls) oversees an energetic production that almost never stops moving, full of whirling-dervish action, fantastical settings and even the occasional musical production number, and finds some fun in Bowen Yang’s voice performance of purring, preening villainy. But while the narrative tries to wrestle some genuine emotion from the idea of how individuals can behave badly out of a desperate need for acceptance, the relationship between Monkey and Lin just never hits a sweet spot, in part because the writers don’t seem to know how to take Monkey from center of an allegorical myth to full-fledged character. As we await the arrival of a literal deus ex machina, our protagonist remains a mere representation of arrogance in need of humbling—or, in other words, needing to have that DreamWorks wiped off of his face.(PG)See feature review (NC-17)If you’re going to season your raunchy, R-rated comedy liberally with emotional sincerity—as soooo many raunchy, R-rated comedies seem determined to do in the 21st century—it would help if that emotional sincerity didn’t feel cribbed from a much better version of the same idea. Here we find the tale of Reggie (voiced by Will Ferrell), a scroungy mutt who’s abandoned by his horrible owner Doug (Will Forte) miles from home, then teams up with a trio of other dogs—Bug (Jamie Foxx), Maggie (Isla Fisher) and Hunter (Randall Park)—to find his way back to Doug for a little revenge. As a comedy, Dan Perrault’s script too rarely finds actual creative humor beyond references to dogs humping things, pee-pee/poo-poo humor and assuming it’s inherently funny to hear a string of f-bombs digitally mouthed by a dog (which, sue me, it kind of is). It’s actually a bit more successful once it’s clear that this is a story about recognizing when you’re in an abusive relationship, except that it gets sidetracked a bit by Bug’s backstory of heartbreak, which might as well have been scored to’s “When She Loved Me.” It’s a goofy enough time-killer with a handful of guffaws, but this is a high concept convinced it can get you in your feelings, when maybe you’re just there to laugh at a Boston terrier saying “fuck.”(R)",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHl3ZWVrbHkubmV0L0J1enpCbG9nL2FyY2hpdmVzLzIwMjMvMDgvMTcvZmlsbS1yZXZpZXdzLW5ldy1yZWxlYXNlcy1mb3ItYXVnLTE40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

La star de “Blue Beetle”, Xolo Mardiueña, souhaiterait que le film DC soit un succès au box-office mais ne veut pas “être prisonnier des chiffres”.

Xolo Maridueña, le héros de Cobra Kai, est désormais en tête d’affiche de Blue Beetle.

Dans le nouveau film de super-héros, il incarne Jaime Reyes, un jeune homme fraîchement diplômé de l’université qui cherche sa place dans le monde jusqu’au jour où il se retrouve par hasard en possession du Scarabée, une ancienne relique d’une biotechnologie extraterrestre. Lorsque le Scarabée choisit de faire de Jaime son hôte, le jeune homme se voit revêtu d’une armure hors du commun qui lui octroie des pouvoirs extraordinaires et imprévisibles. Tout bascule alors pour Jaime qui devient le super-héros Blue Beetle…

Blue Beetle De Angel Manuel Soto Avec Xolo Maridueña , Bruna Marquezine , Susan Sarandon

Lorsqu’on lui a demandé (via ComingSoon) s’il ressentait une certaine pression quant au succès du film au box-office après les récents échecs commerciaux des longs métrages DC tels que Black Adam, Shazam! La Rage des Dieux et The Flash, Xolo Maridueña a répondu : “Je suis sûr que pour Warner Bros., il y a de la pression… ça sonnait un peu sarcastique.”

Oui, bien sûr, je veux que ce soit le plus grand film de tous les temps. Et j’ai vraiment l’impression que c’est un film mondial. Je pense que ça devrait être un succès au box-office mais en même temps, il y a des succès au box-office qui ne sont pas les meilleurs [films] et vice versa. Je ne veux pas être prisonnier des chiffres.

Sorti vendredi aux États-Unis, Blue Beetle a rapporté 10 millions de dollars lors de son premier jour d’exploitation et devrait rapporter entre 25 et 33 millions de dollars pour son premier week-end, selon les estimations de ComingSoon. Cela le classe à peu près à la même position que Shazam! La Rage des Dieux, sorti en début d’année. En France, le film a fait ses débuts dans les salles mercredi et nous attendons encore de connaître ses résultats.

Réalisé par Angel Manuel Soto, le long métrage met aussi en scène Bruna Marquezine, Susan Sarandon, Damián Alcázar et George Lopez.

Nonostante lo sciopero degli attori in corso a Hollywood, la Warner Bros. sta continuando a portare avanti la campagna promozionale attorno a Blue Beetle, la pellicola diretta da Angel Manuel Soto e interpretata da Xolo Maridueña in uscita a metà agosto negli USA e in Italia, nel tentativo di alzare l’asticella rispetto alle previsioni degli analisti per il box office, non propriamente positive.

Tra le iniziative e le partnership legate al film vi è quella che coinvolge la casa automobilistica Toyota, partner ufficiale della Warner per il lungometraggio DC Studios.

Una Toyota Tacoma appare infatti in tutto il film come l’amato veicolo di famiglia dei Reyes, denominato “Taco”, e descritto come l’orgoglio e la gioia dello zio Rudy (George Lopez). Con la sua robusta capacità,

Non vediamo l’ora che gli spettatori vedano l’inarrestabile Tacoma nei cinema con Blue Beetle – ha dichiarato Lisa Materazzo, di Toyota Motor North America – la Tacoma è il co-protagonista perfetto per l’emozionante avventura ricca di azione che ha segnato la prima volta del supereroe DC Comics sul grande schermo.

Per l’occasione, Toyota ha creato una apposita campagna Tacoma 2024 ispirata a Blue Beetle a sostegno della partnership cinematografica, con la diffusione di un divertente spot con al centro una vivace discussione sulle potenti ed eroiche capacità di Tacoma e di Blue Beetle messe a confronto, fino a quando non viene determinata una soluzione: le due icone dovrebbero semplicemente collaborare.

Siamo rimasti entusiasti quando i realizzatori di Blue Beetle hanno deciso di includere un vero ‘ruolo’ per la Tacoma nel film, uno che consenta al ‘Taco’ di guidare l’azione insieme alle nostre star – ha dichiarato Louise Soper, di Warner Bros. – Toyota è un marchio globale iconico e un partner eccezionale, e insieme siamo ansiosi di offrire l’azione al pubblico di tutto il mondo quando il film debutterà nelle sale.

Il marketing attorno al film DC Studios vede al centro numerose società e brand, che hanno deciso di accompagnare Blue Beetle nella sua prima avventura sul grande schermo.

Il primo lungometraggio di Blue Beetle ha ispirato il nostro team a sviluppare una raccolta variegata e trasversale che porta le immagini vibranti, l’umorismo, l’azione e il cuore del film nelle vite dei fan di tutto il mondo – ha affermato Pam Lifford di Warner Bros Discovery – Questa è un’incredibile opportunità per noi di presentare il supereroe DC a più fan e di estendere la narrazione in modo che possano dare vita a Blue Beetle, alla famiglia e alla storia di Jaime.

Spin Master ha ideato una linea di action figures di Blue Beetle in modalità da eroe e in quella di Carapax, uno dei villain della pellicola. Tra le action figure a primeggiare vi è la Battle-Mode Blue Beetle Figure che attiva luci, suoni di battaglia e frasi iconiche con la semplice pressione di un pulsante.

McFarlane Toys ha creato invece una straordinaria linea di action figure e statue basate sull’eroe DC Comics, tra cui una di 30 centimetri raffigurante Jamie Reyes.

Notevole inoltre la collezione realizzata da Funko, con una linea di Pop! Figure che mostrano Blue Beetle, Jaime Reyes e Carapax, mentre sul fronte dell’abbigliamento, Rubie’s Costume, il più grande designer, produttore e distributore al mondo di merchandising di Halloween, ha creato esclusivi costumi e accessori ispirati al film. I costumi, le maschere e i guanti di Blue Beetle sono disponibili in taglie per bambini e adulti presso i rivenditori statunitensi e su Costumes.com., mentre versioni esclusive del costume da bambino Blue Beetle saranno disponibili anche presso i punti Walmart e Target questo Halloween negli Stati Uniti.

Bioworld ha invece realizzato calze, magliette e uno zaino Blue Beetle con un bagliore riflettente al neon. Trevco e Bentex offriranno una vasta gamma di abbigliamento, tra cui magliette disegnate, felpe e pantaloni per bambini; mentre Komar ha lanciato una linea di pigiami per bambini con il supereroe DC Comics.

La collezione per la casa di Trevco include un’accogliente coperta e bicchieri coordinati decorati con immagini del supereroi mentre i poster e i segnalibri premium di Trends International sono disponibili con una varietà di opzioni.

G FUEL Energy, società che in questi anni ha collaborato alle campagne promozionali di molti film ispirati a fumetti, ha lanciato un gusto di bevanda energetica senza zucchero ispirato a Blue Beetle, che sarà disponibile su GFUEL.com in una confezione di formula energetica in polvere da 40 porzioni, nonché in una scatola da collezione e una tazza shaker in edizione limitata. Per incentivare inoltre la partecipazione dei bambini all’esperienza cinematografica, Snap ha deciso di offrire un peluche Blue Beetle, un contenitore/zaino per popcorn Blue Beetle e un porta-bevande Blue Beetle in tutti i cinema nordamericani.

Per quanto riguarda invece il marketing al di fuori degli Stati Uniti, la filiale brasiliana della Warner Bros. ha, nei giorni scorsi, modificato il poster ufficiale della pellicola per accentuare la presenza di Bruna Marquezine nel ruolo di Jenny. Come già vi abbiamo ricordato nelle precedenti puntate, la Marquezine è personaggio molto noto nel paese essendo stata una attrice di telenovelas e, cosa più importante per i brasiliani, per qualche tempo la fidanzata del calciatore Neymar.

AWA Studios

Dopo l’accordo con Freemantle avvenuto lo scorso anno, la casa editrice fondata nel 2018 da Bill Jemas, Axel Alonso e Jon Miller continua a espandersi e a costruire un futuro cinematografico e televisivo per molti personaggi a fumetti, ma non solo.

Nei giorni scorsi, infatti, è stato sancito un accordo tra AWA e International Literary Properties che vedrà la collaborazione di Fremantle nello sviluppo di una lista di progetti basati su opere del poeta Langston Hughes e dello scrittore Evelyn Waugh, con l’obiettivo di svilupparne alcuni in adattamenti cinematografici e televisivi e altri in rivisitazioni di graphic novel. Il primo progetto dell’accordo è stato definito e sarà svelato a breve.

ILP detiene i diritti di numerose proprietà letterarie tra cui quella di Waugh, Hughes, Ann Rule e James M. Cain, e ha concluso accordi per progetti come l’adattamento dell’ispettore Maigret targato Red Arrow Studios International.

L’accordo con ILP è arrivato subito dopo la rivisitazione in graphic novel di AWA de Il grande Gatsby.

ILP è un importante proprietario di diritti letterari con un incredibile elenco di autori e opere iconiche che abbracciano un’ampia varietà di generi – ha dichiarato il co-presidente e presidente di AWA Matthew Anderson – Abbiamo assistito a un’entusiastica reazione alla nostra ultima rivisitazione di un racconto classico e vediamo una grande opportunità di lavorare con ILP per presentare storie iconiche a un nuovo pubblico con una nuova svolta.

Hilary Strong, CEO di ILP per il Regno Unito e l’Europa, ha aggiunto:",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvc3BhemlvYmlhbmNvLml0L2xhLWNhbXBhZ25hLXByb21vemlvbmFsZS1kaS1ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1sZXNwYW5zaW9uZS1kaS1hd2Etc3R1ZGlvcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

Blue Beetle generó polémica con su primer tráiler, un clip en el que Rudy Reyes (George Lopez) asegura que ""Batman es un fascista"". Ahora que la cinta ha llegado a los cines, Raoul Max Trujillo, quien encarna a Carapax, ha dado su opinión sobre la controvertida broma.

""Vale, bueno, antes que nada, ¿qué crees que quiso decir cuando dijo que Batman es un fascista? Porque esa frase, para mí, tal como la escuché, fue como '¿a qué se refiere exactamente?'. No estaba muy seguro de eso, pero creo que, en todo caso, le estaba haciendo de menos. Creo que fue algo así como, para mí, un mensaje oculto. Básicamente, que le den a Batman, Blue Beetle, porque él viene de la élite. La élite siempre protegerá a la élite. En ese sentido, supongo que podría entenderlo. Pero, de cualquier manera, es solo una frase muy divertida"", explicó Trujillo a Screen Rant.

Anteriormente, el director Ángel Manuel Soto ya se pronunció sobre esta frase. ""Siempre quisimos divertirnos con la forma en que Rudy habla de otros superhéroes. Entonces, para las personas que se enfadaron con eso, dadnos una oportunidad. Solo estamos tratando de divertirnos con los personajes que amamos. Y todos en nuestra película aman a Batman, Superman y Flash. Y por supuesto, tenemos críticas sobre todos ellos, como debe ser. Pero eso no significa que odiemos a Batman. Amamos a Batman"", declaró a MovieMaker.

""Tal vez Jaime y la audiencia no estén de acuerdo con Rudy, pero puedes tener tu opinión. Está bien. Si te hizo sentir algo, ese era el objetivo. Así que creo que si estás de acuerdo o si no estás de acuerdo, se incluyó por una razón. Y ya sabes, todas las personas que tienen sus santuarios de Batman en casa pueden mantenerlos y no tienen que preocuparse"", bromeó Xolo Maridueña, que interpreta a Jaime Reyes.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN1bHR1cmFvY2lvLmNvbS9jaW5lL25vdGljaWEtcG9sZW1pY2EtYnJvbWEtYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtYmF0bWFuLWZhc2Npc21vLTIwMjMwODIwMTYyOTQ3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

De quoi ça parle ? Jaime Reyes est un jeune plein d’ambition. Alors qu’il rentre de l’université, le Scarabée, une ancienne relique d’une biotechnologie extraterrestre choisit de faire de lui son hôte. Ce dernier se voit alors revêtu d’une armure hors du commun qui lui octroie des pouvoirs extraordinaires – et imprévisibles. Tout bascule alors pour Jaime qui devient le super-héros Blue Beetle…

Clins d'œil et différences avec les comics

Les personnages de l’oncle Rudy et Jenny Kord ont été créés spécialement pour ce film puisqu’ils n’existent pas dans les comics.

Victoria Kord est une réinterprétation de Jarvis Kord dans les BD.

La chanson préférée de Rudy est Walk Like an Egyptian des Bangles.

Un panneau de rue d’Edge Keys est un clin d’oeil à El Paso, où est né Jaime Reyes dans la mythologie DC.

On trouve des gants de boxe et des livres dans le Repaire du Scarabée, véritable clin d’oeil à Ted Kord et à son passé de boxeur.

Toute première fois

Blue Beetle est la toute première adaptation pour le grand écran des aventures de ce super-héros issu de l’univers DC. Ce personnage a fait son apparition dans le premier numéro de Mystery Men Comics en 1939, sous les traits de l’archéologue Dan Garrett : celui-ci a découvert un scarabée magique à l’occasion de fouilles en Égypte. Par la suite, Blue Beetle a été réinventé par Steve Ditko sous la forme du brillant inventeur Ted Kord qu’on a vu pour la première fois dans le N°83 de Captain Atom (1966).

Au fil du temps, Blue Beetle a encore évolué pour devenir Jaime Reyes. Faisant son apparition dans le numéro 3 de Infinite Crisis en 2006, Jaime, créé par Keith Giffen, John Rogers et Cully Hamner, était désormais un étudiant entouré d’une famille américano-mexicaine très unie vivant à El Paso, au Texas.

Le film prend la liberté d’imaginer un nouveau port d’attache pour Jaime et sa famille : Palmera City, une agglomération à l’image de Metropolis (ville de Superman) et Central City (ville de Flash). Le scénariste Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer a transposé le récit des origines du héros dans un film américain empreint de culture latino. Quant aux scènes d'action, le réalisateur Ángel Manuel Soto et son équipe se sont inspiré des acrobaties de Blue Beetle dans le jeu vidéo Injustice 2.

La combinaison

La fabrication de la combinaison a soulevé de nombreuses questions au sein de l'équipe car il existe plusieurs versions de ce costume dans les comics. Il était essentiel de concevoir une tenue réaliste et tangible, que Xolo Maridueña allait pouvoir enfiler.

Il a fallu neuf mois de développement et 500 croquis pour la mettre au point avec la collaboration d'Ironhead Studios à Los Angeles. Chaque élément de la combinaison de Blue Beetle a été conçu sur mesure pour correspondre à la perfection au gabarit de Xolo Maridueña. Elle a été fabriquée en latex, y compris les parties peintes à la main et celles en matière imprimée conçue à partir de Spandex extensible dans tous les sens. Ainsi, le costume n’était pas trop lourd et ne freinait pas les mouvements.

Quant au tissu, il a été imaginé pour évoquer un motif inspiré par les extraterrestres et chaque élément a été soigneusement élaboré pour faire écho à la nature hors du commun de la technologie extraterrestre du Scarabée.

L’ánimo

Les auteurs utilisent le terme ""Ánimo"" pour décrire le courage de Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle. Le comédien George Lopez commente : ""Quand on est issu d’une famille qui ne vous encourage pas forcément beaucoup, l’ánimo, c’est ce qui vous permet de mener vos propres combats, de vous lancer dans vos propres projets et, parfois, de s’exprimer haut et fort. On a tellement l’habitude que les autres s’expriment en votre nom. L’ánimo, c’est cette capacité à s’exprimer haut et fort alors que personne n’est là pour vous"".

La voix de Khaji-Da

Le Scarabée, alias Khaji-Da, est une relique d’une ancienne biotechnologie extraterrestre : c’est un Scarabée de la taille d’une main et l’un des objets les plus puissants de l’univers. Le Scarabée, dès lors qu’il a choisi un hôte, lui octroie une combinaison à la fois organique et technologique, et un lien symbiotique transforme celui qui endosse le costume en Blue Beetle. C'est la chanteuse américaine d'origine mexicaine Becky G qui prête sa voix à Khaji-Da en version originale.

,"Blue Beetle, George Lopez come zio Rudy è stata una scelta inaspettata",Blue Beetle George Lopez è stata una scelta inaspettata agli occhi del team tecnico perché com'era inizialmente lo zio Rudy,"News Cinema

Il team che ha lavorato alle bozze del personaggio di zio Rudy è stato sorpreso dalla scelta di George Lopez e il concept artist Phil Boutte ha rivelato il motivo.

Blue Beetle è arrivato non molto tempo fa in sala, inserendo il primo personaggio del nuovo universo DC in costruzione da parte di James Gunn. Ad interpretare il giovane e coraggioso Jaime è Xolo Maridueña ma, stando a quanto dichiarato dal concept artist Phil Boutte, un attore del cast in principio si è rivelato essere una grande sorpresa. Per tutti George Lopez come zio Rudy Reyes è stata una scelta inaspettata. Ma perché?



Blue Beetle: Il Trailer Ufficiale in Italiano del Film - HD

Blue Beetle, George Lopez come zio Rudy è stata una grande sorpresa

Blue Beetle racconta di Jaime, un ragazzo neolaureato che finisce per impossessarsi di uno Scarabeo antico che lo trasforma in un supereroe. Grazie all’artefatto, Jaime entra in possesso di capacità straordinarie ma attira anche attenzioni poco gradite, come quelle di Victoria Kord. La donna ha intenzione di impossessarsi dello Scarabeo ma per motivi diversi e molto più oscuri. Così Jaime è costretto a lottare non solo per difendere la sua famiglia, ma anche il resto del mondo. In una recente intervista con Screen Rant, Phil Boutte ha rivelato che la scelta ricaduta su George Lopez è stata una grande sorpresa per il team tecnico. In principio, infatti, la squadra che aveva lavorato al materiale aveva immaginato un personaggio diverso per Rudy, eppure la scelta ricaduta su George Lopez ha funzionato. Anche il collega di Boutte, Mike Uwandi, ha elogiato il lavoro svolto dall’attore nel corso dell’intervista:

In realtà una delle cose che ci ha sorpreso è stato George Lopez, avevano in mente lui, anche se all’inizio non era così. Doveva essere qualcuno più magro, asciutto. Il suo sguardo e tutto il resto avete presente? Immaginatevi soltanto un vecchio rocker messicano. Poi è arrivato George, Mayes stava facendo delle prove con lui cercando di trovare la sua dimensione con il personaggio. Quegli elementi stranamente funzionavano ancora ed è stato semplicemente esilarante.

Del resto in Blue Beetle la famiglia è la chiave principale. Jaime ha un rapporto stretto con la sua famiglia, che si dimostra pronta ad aiutarlo, una scelta importante se si considera che molti dei supereroi invece cercano di nascondere la propria identità alla famiglia (come Spider-Man).",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbWluZ3Nvb24uaXQvY2luZW1hL25ld3MvYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtZ2VvcmdlLWxvcGV6LWNvbWUtemlvLXJ1ZHktZS1zdGF0YS11bmEtc2NlbHRhLWluYXNwZXR0YXRhL24xNjUzMTIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

“¡Eres un superhéroe, cabrón!”.

En los últimos años el tema estrella entre los aficionados vuelve a ser el desapego de los espectadores por las nuevas producciones superheroicas. Los vicios y caminos comunes por los que transita un género a los que una parte del fandom parece ansiosa por ver fracasar en la gran pantalla por no sabemos que extrañas motivaciones. Pero hablamos de un género que ha estado presente en nuestros cines de forma regular desde finales de los años ochenta, a raíz de la batmania desatada por aquella primera película del Batman de Tim Burton. Ya a principios de este siglo el bombardeo de producciones de corte superheroico ha sido constante. Y esto sin contar la influencia que ha tenido el cine de superhéroes en la redefinición del cine de acción de las últimas tres décadas. Es decir, el éxito del género superheroico no está solo en el interés que generan sus propias historias, sino también en haber construido una filosofía que ha calado fuertemente en creadores, estudios y en el imaginario popular definiendo las reglas de la (ciencia) ficción que consumimos hoy en día.

Por otro lado, cuando apuntamos ese pretendido declive actual del género parece que estemos entendiendo a los espectadores como una única masa con unos mismos intereses, gustos e inquietudes. Esto no deja de ser un error de base en el que suelen caer tanto los espectadores como la crítica. Un error que no explicaría éxitos recientes como The Batman, Joker, Doctor Extraño en el Multiverso de la Locura, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Guardianes de la Galaxia Vol. 3 y Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse. Todas ellas producciones estrenadas en los últimos cinco años y que han animado al gran público a pasar por las cada vez más deprimidas salas de cine. Es cierto, en su mayoría estos éxitos tienen que ver con la imagen de marca, pues hablamos de secuelas y/o nuevas interpretaciones de personajes consolidados y conocidos por el gran público desde hace décadas.

Es decir, podemos hablar mucho de fórmulas, estilos y planes maestros, pero como espectadores estamos bastante acomodados a buscar siempre lo mismo. Para que una propuesta que se salga de lo habitual tenga una oportunidad hoy en día tiene que tener ese «algo» indescriptible que atraiga nuestra atención. Esa magia intrínseca al cine que se puede intentar promover, pero que siempre va a responder a muy diversas variables difíciles de definir y cuantificar. Aunque siempre puede hacer mucho una buena campaña de marketing. En ese sentido, no es menor cierto que los estudios están replicando a día de hoy estrategias y maneras que los aficionados a las viñetas hemos padecido durante décadas en los cómics: crossovers, saturación del mercado, repetición de esquemas, reinicios chusqueros, etc.

Esto sin contar que al igual que en las viñetas, en el cine también se ha establecido un cierto monopolio de dos cabezas en torno a este tipo de historias. Después de una primera etapa en la que las licencias de Marvel Comics estaban desperdigadas por distintas productoras y con las producciones puntuales de DC Comics en la gran pantalla incapaces de ir más allá de la enésima película de Batman o Superman, tanto Marvel Studios como DC Entertainment han aprovechado y explotado su imagen de marca -con mejores o peores resultados- para imponerse a cualquier otra alternativa. Las propuestas a nivel independiente brillan a día de hoy por su ausencia y con cada nuevo estreno de las grandes es más difícil que puedan encontrar un hueco en el futuro.

Y con esto llegamos a un presente en el que las dos compañías se han encontrado en un «momento valle» en su trayectoria, una –Marvel Studios– por el cierre de su primera gran etapa y otra –DC Studios– por la factura que le ha pasado el no tener durante años un organigrama claro y cohesionado para su universo superheroico. La solución después de los últimos fracasos de DC Studios ha sido hacer borrón y cuenta nueva. Y el destino ha hecho que James Gunn y Peter Safran -nuevos responsables del futuro de la compañía- tengan un primer reto a superar con el estreno de la primera entrega de las aventuras de un personaje inesperado: Blue Beetle.

Este es un proyecto que ya estaba en marcha en 2018, antes de la reestructuración planeada para el universo cinematográfico de DC Entertainment. Pero debido a su estado embrionario ha sido adoptado para la causa por Gunn y Safran para formar parte de la nueva continuidad de las producciones de la compañía. De hecho, Blue Beetle estaba pensada en origen como una cinta de «presupuesto medio» para su estreno en exclusiva la plataforma de HBO Max. Esa era la intención de Walter Hamada, pero finalmente se ha optado por su estreno en cines. La película es la primera protagonizada por un superhéroe de origen latino en el organigrama de DC Studios, un honor que recae en Xolo Maridueña, un actor estadounidense de raíces cubano-ecuatorianos y mexicanas al que todos conocemos por su participación en Cobra Kai. Maridueña encarna en la ficción a Jaime Reyes, el tercer personaje que en la cronología de las publicaciones de DC Comics asumió el manto de Blue Beetle a principios de este siglo, rompiendo bastante con la imagen establecida por sus antecesores.

En el reparto también tenemos a Bruna Marquezine, una joven actriz brasileña que interpreta Jenny Kord, hija a su vez de Ted Kord que en los cómics fue el segundo y más querido Blue Beetle (sobre todo en sus aventuras junto a Booster Gold). Un papel que ya deja claro la importancia del tema del legado en la presente Blue Beetle. En ese sentido, es clave el papel de Victoria Kord que interpreta una veterana como Susan Sarandon en un rol ciertamente inédito en su carrera como villana de la función en una película de corte superheroico. El resto del reparto lo conforman, por un lado, la familia de Jaime Reyes interpretada por Belissa Escobedo, George Lopez, Adriana Barraza, Damián Alcázar y Elpidia Carrillo, y por otro lado, Raoul Trujillo que interpreta a Ignacio Carapax, la amenaza física con la que deben lidiar Blue Beetle en la película y que funciona como reinvención del concepto de OMAC.

El reparto ya nos deja a las claras el tono familiar de Blue Beetle, uno que contrasta con las producciones previas de DC Studios. Y es que esta vertiente solo la hemos visto realmente en ¡Shazam! y ¡Shazam! La furia de los dioses que podrían ser las producciones más cercanas a la presente Blue Beetle del antiguo universo. Una idea que remarca la dirección del purtorriqueño Ángel Manuel Soto y el guión del mexicano Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer. La familia y la deconstrucción de la misma en base a su modelo tradicional es el elemento vertebrador de Blue Beetle, emparentado así está producción con propuestas de la competencia como Ant-Man y Guardianes de la Galaxia. La diferencia con estas propuestas es que Blue Beetle trata el impacto del elemento superheroico en un núcleo familiar normal y corriente de clase baja, algo que no está presente en las cintas de Marvel Studios en la que tenemos -literalmente- «familias de superhéroes».

Blue Beetle nos trae también de vuelta un prototipo de superhéroe que ya damos por perdido en el género cinematográfico, uno caracterizado por su dualidad y sus problemas reales frente a los de su faceta superheroica. Aunque esta buena intención de partida se va diluyendo en parte a lo largo de la cinta que además redunda en dinámicas familiares que pueden hacer resentir el ritmo del conjunto. Unas dinámicas que por otro lado hacen que las escenas dramáticas tengan un verdadero impacto. Además, la película ahonda en la perspectiva de la población migrante en territorio estadounidense, en las desigualdades de clase y en el intervencionismo de Estados Unidos a nivel internacional, un componente que sorprendentemente ya encontrábamos en producciones del antiguo universo como Escuadrón Suicida y Black Adam. Blue Beetle tiene un mensaje muy sencillo y escasamente revulsivo, pero mantiene la coherencia a lo largo de todo su metraje.

Por otro lado, la adaptación de la historia de Jaime Reyes es bastante fiel a grandes rasgos al origen del personaje que nos narraron Keith Giffen, John Rogers y Cully Hamner en su primera serie y que claramente intentaba captar a un nuevo lector más influenciado por el manga y el anime. No hay sorpresas al respecto: Jaime Reyes un joven normal y corriente que por azares del destino entra en contacto con un extraño artefacto que le otorga increíbles poderes. Esta simple premisa describe la serie original y también su adaptación a la pantalla que funciona como una prototípica -y en parte modélica- historia de orígenes. Los responsables de esta producción se nota que han estudiado a conciencia lo que se ha hecho con el género en nuestros días porque Blue Beetle funciona ante todo como un collage de elementos exportados de aquí y de allá, como intentando sintetizar y destilar lo que a su criterio hace funcionar al género.

Por fortuna, en este proceso Blue Beetle abandona definitivamente el tono más melodramático, impostado y filosóficamente edgy del anterior universo. Estamos ante una película más colorida que a nivel visual sigue apelando a la nostalgia ochentera (su estética nos puede recordar a la mítica Tron de Steven Lisberger), pero que a su vez se distancia lo suficiente de Marvel Studios para ofrecernos algo ligeramente diferente. Lo hace por esas influencias respecto al anime y el manga que comentábamos de la serie original y que aquí ganan importancia, sobre todo se aprecian en su tratamiento de la acción, más rápida y menos acartonada que otras cintas recientes del género. También por una estética visual más orgánica, aunque tenga margen para pulir algunos efectos especiales, sobre todo en el contraste entre la acción y los fondos de la misma. Estamos ante una historia protagonizada por armaduras tecnológicas que se distancia conscientemente de la referencia de Iron Man, para acercarse a la influencia visual del género tokusatsu y las historias de mechas japonesas en la línea de los Power Rangers.

En cualquier caso, si podemos encontrar diversos paralelismos entre la película original de Iron Man dirigida en 2008 por Jon Favreau y la presente Blue Beetle: su ecosistema armamentístico, el componente tecnológico, el concepto de legado familiar, etc. Todo está ahí, pero agitado y removido con la esperanza de que el público entienda a Blue Beetle como un punto y aparte en el género de la misma manera que lo fue en su día la producción protagonizada por Robert Downey Jr. Al fin y al cabo, con Blue Beetle tenemos a un héroe con capacidades similares y aumentadas que además -intencionadamente o no- replica todos los poderes de los Vengadores gracias a su capacidad para generar escudos, martillos, espadas y todo tipo de armas.

En ese sentido, es muy interesante la manera en la que Blue Beetle trata el ya comentado tema del legado. La historia pertenece en todo momento a Jaime Reyes, pero la sombra de Ted Kord está presente en todo el metraje y nos deja algunos easter eggs bastante prometedores para el futuro. La propia película justifica de alguna manera la elección de Reyes al ser un personaje cuyo espíritu puede encajar mejor con las nuevas generaciones, no solo por su historia sino por unos poderes que lo desligan más de la faceta clásica de justiciero herencia directa de Batman al que ya se referenciaba en los tráilers como «un fascista». Esta manera de reintroducir el concepto de legado -similar a lo que hizo Marvel Studios con Hank Pym y Scott Lang en las películas de Ant-Man– se siente natural y mejor planteado que lo que se nos ofreció con anterioridad en el «snyderverso».

Hasta aquí tenemos una cinta de orígenes bien realizada, con un apartado visual -salvo por los detalles comentados- coherente y lejos del estropicio de la anterior The Flash de Andy Muschietti. El reparto resulta complidor, destacando el «peterparkiano» héroe construido por Xolo Maridueña y -pese a lo estereotipado de la misma- la dupla maligna que conforman Susan Sarandon y Raoul Trujillo. El guion no tiene grandes giros, pero sabe equilibrar el drama y el humor con bastante inteligencia emocional. Hay también conceptos interesantes y llamativos, así como espacio suficiente para el misterio y para seguir explorando el universo de Blue Beetle en un futuro. Es un refrito de cosas que ya hemos visto, pero bien disimulado y con un ritmo que hace que sus dos horas de metraje no se nos antojen excesivas.

La banda sonora corre a cargo de Bobby Krlic -o lo que es lo mismo, The Haxan Cloak– que ya ha hecho lo propio con proyectos como Midsommar y Rompenieves. En el caso de Blue Beetle tenemos una banda sonora que cuenta con una fuerte presencia de sintetizadores y bajo la cual se oculta una icónica fanfarria superheroica que por desgracia no acaba de hacer acto de presencia durante el metraje. Esto se combina con una selección musical de influencia principalmente latina y en la que además encontramos versiones de clásicos como Será Que No Me Amas y Be My Baby junto a otras piezas más actuales. En conjunto, la sensación es algo desigual, ya que la selección no parece tener muchas veces un criterio y sentido ligado a la historia, y en algunos casos el volumen entorpece los diálogos, pero al mismo tiempo en muchos casos la banda sonora añade un punto de personalidad y de épica en los momentos oportunos.

En conjunto, caben tres valoraciones distintas para la presente Blue Beetle y ninguna de ellas es excluyente. En primer lugar, la cinta dirigida por Ángel Manuel Soto es una buena película de orígenes, pero con la carga que este esquema -del que la película no hace por escapar- conlleva a estas alturas. Por otro lado, estamos ante una película entretenida, fresca, con humor, drama y épica superheroica bien equilibrada, aunque puede haber algún apartado concreto que dependiendo del espectador resulte más o menos cargante. Finalmente, Blue Beetle es una nueva piedra fundacional de un universo superheroico y como tal intenta ir a la seguro, no plantea mal la batalla, pero tampoco asume grandes riesgos en el proceso y eso sumado a una promoción que ha pasado bastante desapercibida puede jugar en su contra de cara a llegar a su objetivo.

En resumen, el principal problema de Blue Beetle puede ser ganarse a un tipo de espectador a la búsqueda constante de nuevas y originales emociones. Es cierto, Blue Beetle no es una propuesta original en el sentido -como ya hemos mencionado en un par de ocasiones- que no nos ofrece casi nada que no hayamos visto con anterioridad. Pero sobre esto, habría que puntualizar que la originalidad no es un valor añadido en sí mismo y que el mismo no hace mejor o peor una historia. Puede que sea por el componente de ciencia ficción intrínsecamente asociado al género de superhéroes, o por su apelación constante a la épica, pero ni el «más» ni el «mayor» son conceptosq que se relacionan necesariamente con la calidad de una historia. Tampoco habría que olvidar que como aficionados al cómic somos plenamente conscientes que el género de superhéroes si por algo se caracteriza es por la repetición de esquemas y fórmulas, pero que esto no ha impedido que se sigan publicando -de tanto en tanto- buenas historias.

Secondo quanto rivelato il film sembra essere “stupido” ma “divertente”.

La critica che è stata riportata su Comicbook.com è quella del giornalista Brandon Davis, che ha dato questo giudizio:

Il film Blue Beetle è esplosivo. Alcuni aspetti sono troppo stupidi o infantili per me, ma molti mi hanno fatto ridere forte (George Lopez!). Il costume direi che spacca. La rappresentazione latina del personaggio è fantastica. Mi sono piaciute le scene incentrate sulla famiglia, e i solidi ritmi d’azione. Nel complesso, è divertente.

Blue Beetle è stato descritto come un film che si pone già nel nuovo universo DC che stanno organizzando Peter Safran e James Gunn, anche se in questo lungometraggio non vedremo molto di quelle che sono le idee dei due CEO, considerando che hanno preso il progetto in corsa.

2023-08-04 02:56:25+00:00,Warner Bros. Accidentally Promotes Cancelled Batgirl Movie With New DC Film (Photos),"Holy cardboard standee, Batman! DC may have made a Batgirl-sized marketing slip-up while promoting Blue Beetle.","Despite canceling the film over a year ago, Warner Bros. (WB) accidentally promoted Batgirl with some Blue Beetle promotional materials.

Sadly, after completing filming, the straight-to-streaming Batgirl movie was canceled by WB and written off as a tax exemption, shocking many who were looking forward to the film.

Since then, Warner has remained quite quiet about the project. Scenes from the film have leaked online, but other than that, the movie largely remains a mystery.

Of course, even if the movie had come out, it remains unknown if the character would have remained part of the plans for the newly-instated DC Studios CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran.

WB Accidentally Promotes Batgirl

Eagle-eyed fans have spotted a Batgirl logo on a Blue Beetle cardboard standee, meaning Warner Bros. is inadvertently promoting a film they previously canceled.

Twitter

X (formerly Twitter) user Croc_Block posted images of the standee, amping up hype for the upcoming Blue Beetle film.

Twitter

Looking closely, a series of logos can be seen at the bottom underneath the message ""Check out all of the DC films coming soon!,"" including one for the Batgirl film.

Twitter

The other logos are for Black Adam, The Batman, Aquaman 2, DC League of Superpets, and The Flash, which likely means the standee is older, but it is set up nonetheless.

How Does a Mistake Like This Happen?

After Warner Bros. had just finished wiping the egg from its face from last year's Batgirl cancelation, this feels like it will only get the angry internet machine going once again.

This is an unforced error and feels like another misstep in what has been a series a year of misses from DC Studios.

How this actually happened, remains unclear, but this is very likely an older standee that the store simply put out without any idea Batgirl was even on it.

This may be an indication of a lack of marketing budget that Warner Bros. seems to be putting behind its upcoming teenage superhero.

After breaking the bank on a film like The Flash with an insane promotional spend, the studio seems to not even be handing out new promotional material for Blue Beetle, or at least hasn't in this specific case.

,Blue Beetle,"Sjangeren blir ikke revolusjonert, men Markus mener den ikke trenger å bli det heller.","HQ

HQ

Blue Beetle har vært med i tegneserier siden 1939, og i 1983 kjøpte DC Comics rettighetene til den. Likevel har man ikke sett mye til Blue Beetle bortsett fra noen få opptredener i videospill og animasjonsserier, så filmpublikummet går hovedsakelig til filmen med blanke ark. I det store og hele er Blue Beetle et par timer med vellaget superheltaction uten de store overraskelsene.

Jaime Reyes(Xolo Maridueña) har nettopp sluttet på skolen og vender tilbake til hjemmet sitt i utkanten av Palmera City. Dessverre er familien i ferd med å miste hjemmet sitt på grunn av husleieøkningen. Jaime og søsteren hans ender opp med å jobbe som renholdere for Kord Industries, og Kord-familien eier stort sett hele byen. Gjennom en rekke tilfeldigheter overtar Jaime Jenny Kords(Bruna Marquezine) merkelige, Blue Beetle-lignende gjenstand. Av en eller annen grunn velger denne billen Jaime og smelter sammen med ham som en slags symbiot, som Marvels Venom. Og slik er den nye Blue Beetle født.

I bunn og grunn er historien en veldig tradisjonell superheltfortelling, og den tar også for seg betydningen av familie, kapitalisme, egoisme og så videre. Den enkle kjernen gjør det mulig å fokusere på karakterene og relasjonene mellom dem, og det gjøres på en god måte. En meksikansk familie i sentrum (Reyes), og den påfølgende konfrontasjonen med en helt annen type mektig familie (Kord). Det er overraskelser i vente, og Blue Beetle bestemor Nana Reyes(Adriana Barraza) blir svært viktig mot slutten. Det dårlige er at ikke alle spørsmålene som reises blir besvart. Dette er nok en nødvendig løsning, da filmen kunne blitt for lang, og på den annen side må det være noe å si i eventuelle oppfølgere.

Dette er en annonse:

Kanskje noe overraskende er stemningen, både når det gjelder musikk og fargevalg, svært 1980-tallsaktig med neonfarger. Dette er kanskje en måte å appellere til de eldre seerne på, mens den tradisjonelle superhelt-sjangeren tar seg av den nye generasjonen. En annen overraskende ting er hvor interessante de ulike karakterene blir etter hvert som filmen skrider frem. Tradisjonelt har dette ikke vært tilfelle i superheltfilmer, i hvert fall ikke for meg.

Som man kan forvente, er Blue Beetle teknisk og prestasjonsmessig helt i toppklasse. Det er en fryd for øyet. Allerede i de korte klippene etter rulleteksten er det snakk om en slags oppfølger. Men Blue Beetle oppnår åpenbart ikke den forventede suksessen, så det er ikke sikkert at det blir noen oppfølger. Det er synd, for Blue Beetle, som var helt ukjent for meg, var en hyggelig overraskelse gjennom hele spilletiden.

2023-08-17 12:07:21+01:00,Recenze: Blue Beetle nemá čím překvapit,,"Na úspěch Blue Beetla by si asi ještě před pár dny vsadil málokdo. Do kin vstupuje jen pár týdnů po kasovním průšvihu Flashe a těsně před restartem celého filmového universa DC. V Hollywoodu zuří stávka komplikující jeho propagaci. Únava superhrdinskými filmy a velkými franšízami se skloňuje ve všech filmových médiích a ve všech pádech. O to překvapivější je, jak fajn komiksovou oddychovkou výsledek nakonec je.

Filmové DC je už pár let pěkný bordel a plánovaný restart Jamese Gunna do jeho universa zatím moc řádu nevnáší. V tuhle chvíli kvůli řadě protichůdných oznámení nikdo přesně neví, kde přesně nová série začíná a končí nebo která postava vlastně už je jeho součástí. A do toho dorazil Blue Beetle, hrdina řadovým divákům v podstatě neznámý, nápadně ale připomínající konkurenčního Spider-Mana, Deadpoola a Iron Mana zároveň. Ten měl původně podobně jako Batwoman zamířit na televizní obrazovky; zatímco hotový netopýří spin-off se ale studio rozhodlo vyhodit do koše, puberťák v modrém brnění zamířil na plátna. Nový šéf DC James Gunn ho vzápětí označil jako prvního hrdinu restartovaného universa, navzdory tomu, že to má oficiálně začít až za pár let s rebootovaným Supermanem. Prase aby se v tom vyznalo.

Dobrá zpráva ale je, že tohle všechno vám může být při sledování výsledného filmu a podivování se nad tím, jak dobře vlastně vzhledem k okolnostem dopadl, zcela šumafuk. Blue Beetle totiž příběhově stojí zcela na vlastních nohou a je osvěžující, že k jeho vychutnání nemusíte vidět žádný jiný komiks. Paradoxně vlastně platí, že čím méně jste jich za poslední dvě dekády viděli, tím spíš vás bude bavit.

Jsme ve sluncem zalitém Palmera City, supermoderní neonové metropoli, ve které se ale čím dál víc rozevírají socioekonomické nůžky a kde chudší rodiny živoří na chudinských předměstích, zatímco jim všemocná korporace ztrojnásobuje nájem. To potkalo i rodinu Jaimeho Reyese, mexického přistěhovalce, který navzdory čerstvému titulu z vysoké nemůže zavadit o slušnou práci. Shodou okolností se pak připlete k tajuplnému hmyzímu artefaktu z vesmíru, který mu propůjčí nevídané superschopnosti. Budou se mu hodit, protože než se naděje, místo každodenních problémů a prvních lásek bude muset řešit padoucha, jehož schopnosti se těm jeho nápadně podobají.

Ano, Blue Beetle už při čtení synopse působí jako sbírka žánrových klišé, která spoléhá na funkční, ale tisíckrát viděné prvky. Bez motivačních proslovů mrtvých milovaných či záporáků, kteří jsou v podstatě hrdinovou zlou verzí a vykřikují floskule typu „Nic lepšího neumíš?“ bychom se, pravda, už vážně obešli. Stejně tak se přejedly některé infantilní vtípky, přiblblé gadgety a napůl zničená maska hrdiny ve scénách, kdy přijímá svou hrdinskou identitu.

U sledování Jaimeyho dobrodružství si ale několikrát pomyslíte, že sice sledujete film jak vytržený z roku 2010, překvapivě to ale není vždy na škodu. Blue Beetle připomíná filmy první fáze konkurenčního Marvelu, kdy nebylo potřeba nakoukávat hodiny obsahu, abyste se orientovali. Dostali jste fajn jednohubku se sympatickým hrdinou a příslibem, že se s ním v případě úspěchu potkáte v některém z budoucích projektů, a to vám stačilo. Tady to stačí taky.

Samotná akce vás na zadek neposadí, jde o žánrový standard, kterému pomáhá občasná hravost, s jakou modrý skarab Jaimemu umožňuje vytvořit v podstatě jakoukoli zbraň, co si dovede představit. Jeho představivost bohužel ale není kdovíjaká, většinou tedy zůstane u mečů a různých paprskometů. Stejně tak by stála za prozkoumání schíza z toho, že neoddělitelnou součástí jeho každodennosti navždy bude zvláštní ženský hlas v jeho hlavě, na to ale ve filmu čas nezbyl. Třeba příště, bude-li nějaké příště.

Pochvalu si zaslouží i řízný sound design, syntezátorový soundtrack a překvapivě CGI, už jen za to, že nesklouzává ke gumovým ohavnostem, jejichž synonymem se nedávno stal Flash. Vzhledem k tomu, že Beetle byl původně ve vývoji pro televizi a Flash vznikal násobně déle a dráž, je to s podivem.

Se snahou, aby si diváci hrdiny Blue Beetla zamilovali, tvůrci místy tlačí na pilu pomocí nuceně cool momentů a nuceně vtipných hlášek. Tomu, aby vám skutečně přirostli k srdci, ale brání poněkud toporné herectví a vyloženě nesmyslná rozhodnutí, které postavám scénář místy přisuzuje. Přesto se musí nechat, že právě péče o ně a důraz na jejich rodinnou srdečnost filmu dodává jistou jiskru. Že tady nejde jen o výbušnou superhrdinskou řachandu ostatně ukazuje už fakt, že před nástupem modrého obleku na scénu s Jaimeho blízkými a jejich světskými starostmi strávíme celých čtyřicet minut. Celková stopáž díky tomu sice nabobtnala nad dvě hodiny, ale nevadí to. Blue Beetle je sice předvídatelný, nudit se u něj ale určitě nebudete.

Pictures berjudul Blue Beetle.

Dipendekkan cerita, selepas 127 minit menghabiskan tontonan, bibir ini tersenyum menandakan filem arahan sutradara bernama Angel Manuel Soto tersebut berjaya melepasi jangkaan awal.

Pertama sekali, ingin dinyatakan di sini betapa hebatnya terjemahan karakter utama, Mariduena sebagai Blue Beetle atau Jaime Reyes oleh pelakon Xolo Maridueña.

Pemilihannya sangat bertepatan dengan nuansa dan tema filem yang menjunjung semangat atau budaya orang Latin, kelompok yang sering menjadi mangsa penindasan dan diketepikan di Amerika Syarikat.

Faham tugasan

Pertama kali didokumentasikan dalam bentuk filem atau layar perak, Blue Beetle jauh menjangkaui ekspektasi penonton. Jauh yang membuatkan karya introduksi jenama Blue Beetle ini masuk kategori cemerlang.

Secara peribadi, penulis agak skeptikal terutama pada awal minit penceritaan. Ketika itu, terasa bagaikan pengakhiran hambar, namun graf naratif kemudiannya berkembang dengan baik.

Dari segi plot, terjemahan karakter, representasi budaya, semuanya teradun sempurna.

Mengejutkan, namun berjaya direalisasikan sempurna pasukan produksi.

Syabas buat individu yang duduk di bangku pengarah, Manuel Soto.

Pasukan ‘casting’ filem Blue Beetle melakukan tugas mereka dengan sangat cemerlang.

Hasilnya, bukan sahaja watak utama Jaime Reyes sahaja yang menonjol bahkan karakter-karakter penting lain seperti keseluruhan keluarga Reyes dan Kord, termasuklah Jenny Kord dan antagonis, Victoria Kord.

Watak ahli keluarga Reyes seperti Rudy lakonan George Lopez, Milagro (Belissa Escobedo) dan Nana (Adriana Barraza) dicernakan dengan cukup baik.

Itu bermakna pasukan ‘casting’ faham tugasan dan menjalankan apa sepatutnya dijalankan dengan kemenjadian yang setara.

Budaya Latin, mendarat baik

Dari segi teknik janaan komputer (CGI), Blue Beetle langsung tidak mengecewakan.

Di tangan pengarah keturunan Puerto Rico, karya ditunggu-tunggu ramai itu langsung tidak tersasar daripada ‘DNA’ sebenar adiwira DC.

Keluarga

Satu perkara yang tercetus positif daripada karya adalah betapa pentingnya keluarga, tidak kiralah dalam apa juga situasi.

Dengan kebersatuan antara keluarga dan semangat kejiranan, seseorang itu mampu mengoncang dunia dengan semangat kepahlawanan yang tiada tolok bandingnya.

Blue Beetle, sebuah jenama adiwira yang mendarat dengan baik. Seperti dialog dalam filem, sacrifices have to be made for the greater good, (pengorbanan harus dilakukan untuk kebaikan sejagat), dan semua itu harus bermula dengan tidak ketinggalan menonton Blue Beetle di pawagam.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtvc21vLmNvbS5teS8yMDIzLzA4LzI0L2hlYmF0bnlhLWJsdWUtYmVldGxlLXNpLWFkaXdpcmEtbGF0aW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,

2023-07-19 21:55:56+00:00,Warner Bros. Rejected DC's Request for Reshoots on 1 Upcoming Superhero Movie,Will WB's rejected reshoots hurt DC's next superhero movie?,"This summer's next DC movie had a request for reshoots rejected by Warner Bros.

DC is currently in the midst of releasing four superhero movies throughout 2023 that have now been developed through three studio regimes.

Shazam 2, The Flash, Blue Beetle, and Aquaman 2 have all evolved through the changes, having been worked on across AT&T's WarnerMedia, the succeeding Warner Bros. Discovery, and now James Gunn and Peter Safran's DC Studios.

Warner Bros. Rejected Blue Beetle Reshoot Plans

DC

The Hollywood Reporter recently published an article detailing Aquaman 2's long and troubled development, during which it revealed the team behind this summer's Blue Beetle requested two days of reshoots but was turned down by Warner Bros.

By contrast, the studio recently allowed for five days of reshoots on Aquaman 2 after DC Studios CEO James Gunn gave his input on the most recent troubled cut.

Blue Beetle has seen a number of regime changes on the road to release, having been developed and written prior to the Warner Bros. Discovery merger in April 2022, filmed under the David Zaslav-led regime from May to July 2022, and will now be released under James Gunn and Peter Safran's DC Studios.

The superhero flick may have originally been scripted as an HBO Max original movie in the declining DCEU, but will now seemingly instead fall as the first entry taking place in Gunn and Safran's new DCU.

Update: The Hollywood Reporter updated its article to note that the filmmakers of Blue Beetle were, in fact, actually granted the request for two days of reshoots.

Is Blue Beetle Set To Be Another DC Disaster?

Warner Bros. declining a reshoot request for Blue Beetle may be a sign of its low box office expectations for the movie.

After all, the same studio approved a request for five days of reshoots to improve the reportedly troubled Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, which is the sequel to a billion-dollar-grossing movie (the only one in DC history).

As Shazam 2 and The Flash have already proven to be box office disasters, potentially due to James Gunn's upcoming reboot, many are expecting Blue Beetle and Aquaman 2 to, unfortunately, suffer a very similar fate.

Whether these rejected reshoots would have improved Blue Beetle is something fans will never know, but the fact they were expected to take just two days indicates they were minor and likely had minimal story impact.

Radosław Krajewski 2 0

Miała być porażka, a jest film, który bez trudu przebija poprzednie dwa tegoroczne filmy DC Studios.

Prawdziwa moc bierze się od rodziny Blue Beetle przeszło długą i krętą drogę, zanim trafiło do kin. Film pierwotnie szykowany był jako jedna z pierwszych produkcji rozszerzających uniwersum DC, które miały debiutować na platformie HBO Max. Studio zamierzało skopiować rozwiązanie Marvela i dostarczać produkcje o mniej znanych superbohaterach na streamingu. Ale wraz z objęciem rządów przez Davida Zaslava, któremu można wiele zarzucić w kwestii zarządzania filmą, ale na pewno nie można odmówić mu miłości do kina, zdecydował się przenieść Blue Beetle na duży ekran, a resztą szykowanych tytułów brutalnie pogrzebać. Chociaż pierwszy film z latynoskim superbohaterem w roli głównej nie zapowiadał się ekscytująco, to może właśnie za sprawą niższego budżetu i praktycznie zerowych oczekiwań, ostatecznie Blue Beetle ogląda się naprawdę nieźle. O ile podejdzie się do niego z odpowiednim nastawieniem.

Jaime Reyes (Xolo Mariduena) powraca ze studiów do rodzinnego Palmera City w Teksasie po kilkuletniej rozłące ze swoją rodziną. Chłopak marzy o dobrej posadzie w jednej z korporacji, gdzie mógłby wykorzystać prawniczą wiedzę. Jedyne, na co może jednak liczyć, to kiepsko opłacana praca pracownika porządkowego w jednym z hoteli w centrum miasta. Tam poznaje Victorię Kord (Susan Sarandon), szefową Kord Industries, jednej z największych firm zbrojeniowych, a także Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine), która nie zgadza się z obecną działalności firmy jej ojca. Gdy Jaime próbuje uratować Jenny z opresji, traci pracę w hotelu. W zamian dziewczyna oferuje mu załatwienie nowej fuchy w centrali firmy. Gdy młody Reyes zjawia się na miejscu, Jenny wręcza mu tajemniczy przedmiot, aby ukrył go przed Victorią. Ciekawska rodzina Jaimego namawia go do sprawdzenia artefaktu, którym okazuje się inteligentny skarabeusz. Nieoczekiwanie kosmiczny robak ożywa i wybiera chłopaka na swojego nosiciela, dając mu nadludzkie moce. Victoria jednak nie cofnie się przed niczym, aby odzyskać skradziony przedmiot, dzięki któremu opracuje technologię nowoczesnych nanoszkieletów, dzięki którym każda armia byłaby niezwyciężona.

GramTV przedstawia:

Najnowsza propozycja od DC Studios, najprościej rzecz ujmując, to połączenie Spider-Mana z pierwszym filmem o Ant-Manie. Przynajmniej na pierwszy rzut oka można dojrzeć w Blue Beetle pewne naleciałości znane z obu produkcji. To bardzo lekka, ale przy tym generyczna produkcja, która prawie nie oferuje nic nowego, czego byśmy już wcześniej nie widzieli. Prawie, bo film z uniwersum DC posiada ogromny atut w postaci rodziny Jaimego, którzy stają się równorzędnymi bohaterami do tytułowej postaci. Zazwyczaj superbohaterowie działają w pojedynkę, ewentualnie mogą liczyć na pomoc innych herosów obdarzonych nadnaturalnymi mocami. Ale nie w Blue Beetle, gdzie rodzina Reyesów stanowi o najmocniejszym punkcie historii, w której każdy z członków familii jest ważnym ogniwem. Dzięki czemu Blue Beetle nie jest skazany na samotną walkę ze złem, a widz na totalną powtórkę z rozrywki. Gdyby nie Reyesowie Blue Beetle nie byłby dobrym filmem. Geneza superbohatera jest tak schematyczna i pełna klisz, jak tylko można to sobie wyobrazić. Historia nieszczególnie skupia się na Jaimiem, który dopiero co zyskał supermoce, ale szybko przechodzi do porządku dziennego. Brakuje tu tej samej głębi, która powodowała, że filmy Marvela z wcześniejszych faz tak dobrze się oglądało, śledząc poczynania nowego bohatera, który musi odnaleźć się w nowej rzeczywistości. To spory minus, który nie pozostawia zbyt dobrego wrażenia po samym Blue Beetle, który pozostaje jedynie maskotką, błyskotką całego filmu, a nie prawdziwą postacią z krwi i kości.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyYW0ucGwvYXJ0eWt1bC9yZWNlbnpqYS1maWxtdS1ibHVlLWJlZXRsZS1uYWp3aWVrc3phLXRlZ29yb2N6bmEtbmllc3BvZHppYW5rYS16LXVuaXdlcnN1bS1kY9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en,,,,,,,,,,,
